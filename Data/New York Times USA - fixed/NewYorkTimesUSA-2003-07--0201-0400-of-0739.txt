HEADLINE: American Cars Show Gains In a Survey ofDependability 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 8 

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz has fallen behind its sister brand Chrysler in a closely watched report on vehicle dependability, while General Motors has surged. And Japanese vehicles continue, over all, to hold up the best.
 The report, issued today by J. D. Power & Associates, focuses on problems that arise over three years of ownership. Its rankings are important because most consumers say a vehicle's reputation for long-term durability is their top consideration in buying. 
 Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, had the fewest reported problems in the report, which was based on responses from 55,000 owners of 2000 model vehicles. Owners were asked about 147 potential problems. The most common complaint over all was wind noise, followed by noisy brakes and uneven tire wear.
According to the report, Lexus owners reported 163 problems per 100 vehicles, versus the industry average of 273. Infiniti, Nissan's luxury brand, came in second, with 174 problems. The Buick brand of G.M. was third, with 179 problems. 
The most surprising results involved DaimlerChrysler. Since Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler in 1998, auto experts have often asked whether the manufacturer of the Mercedes could bring respectability to a struggling American icon. 
But in the J. D. Power report, both the Chrysler and Dodge brands outperformed Mercedes-Benz, which in turn only narrowly edged out Chrysler's Jeep brand. Mercedes averaged 318 problems per 100 vehicles, versus 295 for all the Chrysler Group brands. 
While automakers are not far apart in initial quality -- which spans the first three months of a vehicle's life -- the report shows that there are still wide gaps in performance over longer periods. Automakers covet even small gains in the J. D. Power report, knowing that it takes years of sustained results, either good or bad, to change the perceptions of buyers broadly. And customers will pay more for both new and used cars with fewer problems.
"Some vehicles age gracefully," said Joe Ivers, a partner at J. D. Power, "and others get disproportionate problems."
Most of G.M.'s major brands scored better than the industry average, including Cadillac, Chevrolet, Saturn and GMC. Pontiac, with 293 problems per 100 vehicles, was below average. So was Oldsmobile, which is being discontinued. 
"The world turned upside down," said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, describing both Mercedes's decline and G.M.'s rise.
The report was particularly well timed for G.M., which recently began a major advertising campaign -- with the slogan "Road to Redemption" -- that claims its vehicles' quality is improving and asks consumers for a second chance. It was the only one of the Big Three to rank better than the industry average. 
"This is consistent with the message we've had out there," said Pat Morrissey, a spokesman for G.M. "The quality initiatives we have had in place over the last three years are starting to pay off."
Still, Mr. Healy said G.M. had miles to go. "G.M. has the problem of making some of their alienated ex-customers, like me, actually go into a showroom," he said.
Japanese automakers continue to lead in durability, with 228 problems per 100 cars for the average Japanese brand, 282 for the average Big Three brand, 331 for European brands and 406 for Korean brands. 
Not all European automakers fared poorly. Porsche was among the industry's best, and BMW and the Jaguar division of Ford were better than average, as was G.M.'s Saab division. 
But Volkswagen and its Audi division continued to have quality problems: Volkswagen was among the five worst brands in the industry, among 37 ranked. Ford's Volvo and Land Rover divisions also performed below average, with Land Rover ranking behind the beleaguered Daewoo brand and better only than Kia, made by the Korean automaker Hyundai. According to the study, Kia made the two least durable vehicles: the Sportage sport utility and the Sephia sedan, which has been discontinued. 
At Mercedes-Benz, the report said, the most troublesome vehicles were the M-Class sport utility and the E-Class, one of its highest-volume sedans, which starts just under $50,000 and can cost considerably more. 
The E-Class showed the highest rate of deterioration over three years among all vehicles, with 215 percent more problems after three years than owners reported after three months. The most common reported problems were excessive brake dust, which can be a result of worn brake pads; malfunctioning side windows; and uneven tire wear.
Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes, dismissed the comparison to Chrysler's performance. "If we're coming in below industry average, we're troubled," she said. "But this is one measurement, and our feeling is that quality is a more holistic thing that takes into account how owners feel at the end of the ownership experience. Do they stay with the brand or walk away?"
She said that Mercedes had one of the highest customer loyalty rates in the industry and added that many of the problem areas identified by owners had been fixed in later models.
Analysts said it would take a prolonged slide in results to damage Mercedes's sales or image. "I don't see it as a meaningful indicator for projecting sales," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, a New Jersey firm that tracks luxury cars. "The real indicator is what customer care and corrective actions Mercedes has already taken."
"Your brand cachet would begin to suffer if you maintained a position below average over an extended life cycle of products, five to eight years," she added. 
Ronald A. Tadross, auto analyst at Banc of America Securities, said warranty costs were a more pertinent indicator of vehicle dependability than survey data. "I would argue it's hard to derive a conclusion from a survey, because you don't know what the consumer is thinking," he said. "It begs the question: what is vehicle dependability? Is it warranty costs or the nuances of wind noise?"
In the past, J. D. Power surveyed owners after they drove a vehicle for four and five years. The firm switched to examining vehicles after three years so that automakers -- its clients -- could better use the information as they developed future models. The typical car or truck is on the road five years, but plans for a major redesign are typically under way three years into a vehicle's life.

HEADLINE: Tribute to a Room With a View; 
Windows on the World Employees Plan a Restaurant

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Together they represent more than 300 years of experience at New York restaurants, including the doomed Windows on the World on top of the trade center. But theyhad never been forced to confront a problem like this:
 Are spicy French fries upscale enough to include on the menu of a white-tablecloth restaurant? 
 Several of the former Windows workers who had gathered in a noisy downtown conference room shook their heads, as though someone had suggested serving sliced white bread and margarine. Others pursed their lips disapprovingly, but were willing to listen to the consultant who had proposed serving fries at the fancy new co-op restaurant that surviving workers plan to open early next year. 
"Spicy fries," said the consultant, Steven Hill, a chef and cooking instructor, "are not too declasse anymore."
Every Monday afternoon, waiters, cooks, busboys and headwaiters who worked at Windows and a few other restaurants near ground zero wrangle over issues like the character of French fries without always coming to a decision. But there is no disagreement about the group's broader goal: overcoming the tragedy and creating a new future for themselves that will stand as a kind of legacy to the memory of 73 of their colleagues who died on Sept. 11, 2001.
With the help of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a number of former workers at Windows -- a few without legal immigration documents and most without steady jobs -- formed the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York to help themselves rebuild their lives.
This evening, about 40 of those workers will release details of their plans for the restaurant, tentatively titled Windows on TriBeCa, that they hope to open within sight of ground zero.
They already have the support of celebrity New York chefs like Waldy Malouf, of Beacon, and Don Pintabona, founding chef of Robert De Niro's Tribeca Grill, who are helping them organize a cook-off in the fall to raise some of the $3 million they estimate it will cost to get their restaurant going.
They have lined up support from New York bankers, real estate agents and designers. They are negotiating with an Italian restaurant workers' cooperative that has employee-owned restaurants in Europe and Asia and wants to provide the Windows workers with financial and technical help.
They hired a consultant to prepare a $30,000 report sizing up the best location, size and theme of a new restaurant. They have established a catering business that in less than a year brought in enough money to pay for the report.
All profits from the catering business go toward the co-op, and only the director receives a salary. Everyone else works on a voluntary basis and will continue that way until the restaurant opens. Each co-op member will become part owner of the enterprise, but the workers have not yet figured out how they will draw salaries or take profits from it.
Like the ingredients of a complicated recipe, the elements of the venture have been selected. All that's left is the execution.
"I am not nervous about it at all," said Mohammad Quddus, 37, a waiter from Bangladesh who worked at Windows on the World for five years. He has never owned his own business nor run his own restaurant, but he is convinced that among the 40 members of the group, there is experience enough to handle every issue that may arise.
"We are restaurant professionals," said Mr. Quddus, a quiet man who abandons his reserve when he talks about the co-op. "We know how to prepare food and how to serve food. And though we are 40 people, we will all be acting like one owner."
While others share Mr. Quddus's enthusiasm, they are more concerned about how well 40 individuals can work together to make tough decisions. Ataur Rahman, 48, also from Bangladesh, noted the frequent disagreements that have arisen over small decisions, and he worries that they may be a sign of divisions to come.
"But we're going to do it anyway and see," Mr. Rahman said. "At least we'll try."
Working at the top of the world brought the 40 together from the farthest reaches of the globe. Ghana, Morocco, Bangladesh, Mexico, Ivory Coast, Guatemala, Indonesia, Egypt, Nepal and half a dozen other foreign lands are reflected in their faces and in their dreams.
Their diverse backgrounds are considered one of their strengths, and something they hope will be reflected in the menu.
"Everybody will bring his mother here for recipes," said Fekkak Mamdouh, who was a waiter and union shop steward at Windows. The others at the meeting laughed. "No, I'm serious," he said.
If some workers did not quite understand how risky a venture a restaurant can be, the consultant's report done for them by the I.C.A. Group of Brookline, Mass., made it clear.
Given current economic difficulties in New York, the report concluded, an independent restaurant sponsored only by the co-op would be "a difficult and probably unfeasible undertaking."
Saru Jayaraman, the executive director of Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, said that receiving the consultant's report last January was disconcerting. "We were very cautious about moving forward," she said.
The report strongly advised the group to find partners and to seek the counsel of experienced chefs and restaurateurs, and they did.
One of the first people they reached was Mr. Pintabona, who worked at the popular Tribeca Grill until January. "The idea sounded kind of cute, but I was not at all sure if it was going to fly," Mr. Pintabona said. "But when I met with them I was impressed by their spirit."
But not by all their ideas. He was most troubled by the workers' initial intention of making the new restaurant into a memorial to Windows on the World and the people who died there. They intended to bring Windows memorabilia like plates, uniforms and T-shirts to decorate the new venture.
"I told them that people might go there to see what this is all about because it's a unique concept," Mr. Pintabona said, but he doubted it would be enough to bring diners back a second or third time. Reminding diners of the events of Sept. 11 might drive them away, he said.
So Mr. Pintabona and other consultants have suggested that the group focus instead on the cooperative nature of their ownership. "They should connect with co-op farmers and food producers throughout the country, because there's a perceived value there," Mr. Pintabona said.
The consultant's report suggested TriBeCa as the best location for a new restaurant, and the members are negotiating for space in a historic building near ground zero. Despite the ethnic backgrounds of the members, the report recommended that the basic menu fare be traditional American comfort food, like steak and fries.
The report also recommended limiting the co-op restaurant to 100 tables. But when other advisers suggested making the restaurant larger and more luxurious, the workers agreed. Now they are planning a 200-seat full-service restaurant for which they must raise $1 million in cash and arrange financing for an additional $2 million.
The money is far more than any of the members have ever handled. They feel, however, that their greatest strength lies in the stake they all have in a business where they will be both employees and owners.
"Nobody is going to waste food, nobody is going to steal, nobody is going to break glasses," said Utjok A. Zaidan, 54, who was a headwaiter in the Windows banquet room. Mr. Zaidan came to New York from Indonesia in 1974 and, like most of the other people involved in this project, always dreamed of opening his own restaurant.
"This is not just a way to make money," he said. "It could be a model for how to run restaurants in New York."

HEADLINE: Foes of California's Governor Say Recall Vote Is a Certainty 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 8 

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis of California, who was re-elected only eight months ago, appeared likely today to face a recall election as early as this fall after his political opponents declared that they had more than enough signatures to put the question on the ballot. 
 Supporters of the recall movement said they had turned in 1,088,000 petition signatures by Monday and were preparing to submit 300,000 more by the end of the week. Under a state law, 897,158 valid signatures are required this year to place a recall initiative on the statewide ballot. 
 Recall organizers said they now had a sufficient cushion to guarantee an election and had stopped gathering signatures.
"It's a done deal," said Jonathan Wilcox, a spokesman for United States Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from San Diego County who has bankrolled the drive with more than $1 million of his own money and who has announced his intention to run for governor. "The signature collection has stopped."
The California secretary of state, Kevin Shelley, whose office is responsible for conducting statewide elections, said he would not comment on whether recall proponents had gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot until the petitions were submitted to his office later this month.
"As the state's chief election officer, I have to be prepared, whatever happens, to run an election in March, November or October," said Mr. Shelley, a Democrat. "If this actually goes forward, it will be the first time there has ever been a certified election to recall a governor of California. There have been 31 attempts previously, but none has ever made the ballot."
A spokesman for Governor Davis saidhe was prepared to wage a fierce campaign to keep his job.
"His attitude is, bring them on," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary. "He's been elected to statewide office five times and three and a half million people voted for him last fall. They claim to have about a million signatures, so the odds are still stacked in the governor's favor."
The governor, a Democrat, is raising money to fight the recall effort, and he has been helped by a union-backed group, Taxpayers Against the Governor's Recall.
"The reality of California politics is if you have enough money, you can put anything on the ballot," said Carroll Wills, a spokesman for the group.
The recall effort was begun in March by disgruntled conservatives. It has gathered momentum in recent weeks as negotiations to solve the state's financial crisis stalled.
Dave Gilliard, director of Rescue California, one of the main groups promoting the recall, said that his organization had gathered 180,000 signatures over the Fourth of July weekend. The group employed 1,200 professional petition circulators, many from outside California, to stake out shopping malls, baseball games and holiday picnics, Mr. Gilliard said. The circulators were paid roughly $1 per signature.
The number of signatures required is a percentage of the votes cast in the previous election.
An election could be delayed or averted by challenges to the validity of the signatures, which are now in the hands of elections officials in California's 58 counties. It will take at least six weeks to verify the identities of petition-signers and compare them with rolls of registered voters.
If the petitions are validated by Sept. 4, a special election will be held in late October or November. If the validation comes after that date, the lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, could consolidate the recall election with the March 2 primary ballot. Recall organizers are hoping for a fall special election because the March primary will carry the names of the Democratic candidates for president and draw a heavy Democratic turnout.
California Democrats, many of whom have dismissed the recall effort as an empty threat by a small band of anti-Davis conservatives, are now preparing for a fight.
"This is a coup attempt by certain Republican extremists," said Bob Mulholland, political director for the California Democratic Party.
But he said he welcomed the campaign as a forum for Governor Davis to make the case for his continued leadership and present a united Democratic front against a weak and divided state Republican apparatus. He said the state party was prepared to raise whatever money was needed to turn back the recall attempt.
"Darrell Issa has given Democrats an opportunity," Mr. Mulholland said. "The Democrats will have a united team on one side of the field and the Republicans will have half a team with half their leaders in the locker room."
Also today, the five members of the California Legislature's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender caucus announced their opposition to the recall.
"There has never been a governor in this state who has done anything to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights except Gray Davis," said Senator Sheila Kuehl, a Democrat from Santa Monica.
If the election is held, the ballot will have two parts. The first will ask whether the governor should be recalled. The second will list the names of possible successors. If the first question goes against Mr. Davis, then the candidate in the second section with the most votes wins.
The only candidate besides Mr. Issa who has said he will run for governor in a recall election is Peter Camejo, the Green Party candidate for governor last fall. A number of other prominent names have been mentioned as possible candidates, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor; Bill Simon, the Republican candidate for governor last fall; and Richard J. Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles.
State Democratic officials are, for now, united against the recall. Every prominent Democratic officeholder, including the state's most popular politician, United States Senator Dianne Feinstein, has said they will not put their names on a recall ballot. 
To qualify for the ballot, candidates need only to submit 65 valid signatures and pay a $3,500 filing fee, or submit 10,000 valid signatures, so the list of challengers could be long.
Many California Republican officials, including the Republican leaders of the state Senate and Assembly, have kept their distance from the recall effort. The White House and the national Republican Party have declared the question a matter for Californians to decide.
"The general view is that it's a bad thing for Republicans nationally," said a California Republican leader with close ties to the White House who asked not to be identified. "It comes across as a small group of Republicans trying to redo an election." He said that electing a Republican could complicate efforts to ensure President Bush's re-election, because the state would remain in fiscal and political turmoil even if Mr. Davis were removed.

HEADLINE: General Urges Foreigners to Aid Afghans 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: FORT BRAGG, N.C., July 8 

 BODY:
The former top American general in Afghanistan warned today that the nation's recovery was imperiled unless the international community takes bolder steps in the rebuilding efforts there.
 The officer, Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill of the Army, said that security in Afghanistan, while still precarious, was the best it has been in decades and that it would improve if the nation's weak economy gets badly needed foreign assistance for large-scale projects like roads. 
 He acknowledged that he disagreed with civilians, including the United Nations special representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, who insist that security must improve to attract more donors.
"We need to move more quickly and get projects out into the hinterlands," he said in his first lengthy interview since stepping down on May 27 after a year as commander of 11,000 troops in Afghanistan, including 9,000 Americans.
In a wide-ranging conversation here at his XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters, General McNeill said he did not believe the war in Iraq or the rebuilding effort there had unduly drained away resources or political will from tasks in Afghanistan. He also played down concerns that Afghanistan's regional warlords were gaining too much influence.
A series of raids over the last year disrupted the ability of the Taliban or Al Qaeda to regroup, the general said, but the operations snared only lower and middle-level fighters, "low-hanging fruit." The fate of Osama bin Laden is a mystery, General McNeill said, adding that in April the last piece of seemingly hard intelligence about the location of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former Taliban leader, turned out to be bogus.
One problem, he said, has been the inability or unwillingness of tens of thousands of Pakistani forces in the semiautonomous tribal areas along the border to patrol more aggressively or coordinate their missions with the Americans.
As elusive guerrilla fighters continue their attacks against occupation forces, General McNeill said the resistance still posed a serious threat to the fragile government of President Hamid Karzai. 
He expressed amazement at the ingenuity of some Qaeda and Taliban diehards. After one clash in January, he said, American soldiers found a cow, donkeys, food and a kitchen big enough to feed 40 people behind a false wall inside a cave.
Given the security conditions, General McNeill said he anticipated no major changes in the size or shape of the American force in Afghanistan until possibly next summer, when 9,000 members of an Afghan national army, trained by occupation forces, are to be ready to conduct patrols and monitor borders.
The program got off to a rocky start last year when many recruits quit before basic training was finished, complaining of homesickness and the paltry $30 a month the United States was paying them. For their part, the trainers were discouraged that few Pashtuns volunteered. But now, General McNeill said, the program has picked up momentum, and has graduated 4,000 soldiers.
Still, it is unclear when the American forces can hand off more responsibility. Perhaps mindful of Afghans' traditional aversion to foreign troops, General McNeill predicted the Pentagon could begin reducing the number of American troops by next summer. 
He offered few new details about two controversies that happened on his watch. He expressed regret over scores of civilian casualties from an airstrike last July that hit a wedding party. He said today that legitimate military targets inside the compound had fired on American aircraft. He declined to comment on the deaths of two men in American custody in the Bagram detention center last December, saying the inquiry has not been completed.

HEADLINE: What Iraq Needs Now 

BYLINE:  By Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani; Jalal Talabani is secretary general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Massoud Barzani is president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.

DATELINE: ERBIL, Iraq 

 BODY:
Some day, we Iraqis hope to celebrate an Independence Day like the one Americans have just observed. But for the near future we face the challenge of translating liberation into democracy -- a goal we Kurds will push for even more diligently now that we have agreed to join the interim Iraqi administration that will be formed this month. To that end, we will work closely with the United States to establish security, revive the economy and build a democratic culture. 
 Our aims may appear optimistic with American and British forces struggling to establish order and restore public services in some areas of Iraq. Yet the picture is not quite as grim as some claim. The assaults on American soldiers are not "resistance to foreign occupation." Rather, they are acts of terrorism by the Baathist remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime. These remnants are so reviled in Iraq that they have had to resort to foreign volunteers, for few Iraqis will take up arms on their behalf. 
 Since they lack the support of the people, the Baathists will be defeated -- a process that can be accelerated if we establish a national security force. That would be one major step toward making Iraq safer.
But another security problem, widespread looting, requires more than just better policing. The looting has its roots in economic problems. Iraq's economy is largely moribund. The wages paid by the coalition are often not enough to make ends meet. Exporting oil will help, but what Iraq really needs is comprehensive economic reforms to encourage investment. We applaud the moves, announced this week by American officials, to create a new Iraqi currency and restructure the central bank, as a welcome start to such reforms.
One simple way to improve the economy in our part of Iraq, Kurdistan, is to ensure that the Kurds receive the money allocated to them by the United Nations oil-for-food program. It is a scandal that $4 billion destined for the Kurds sits, unused, in a United Nations-controlled French bank account because of past obstruction by Saddam Hussein and the present incompetence of the United Nations bureaucracy. The delays by the United Nations are particularly frustrating because of rules that require the money to go into a general Iraqi development fund if it isn't spent by October. We have repeatedly sought assurances from the coalition that this money will not be lost to Iraqi Kurdistan. So far, the coalition response has been unclear.
Let us be clear, however. We are not seeking lavish handouts from American taxpayers or the international community -- we are asking only for what is rightfully ours. And any perception that the Kurds, the United States' closest ally in Iraq, are being let down will dishearten the many other Iraqis who want to work with the United States.
Not releasing that money also means not addressing a critical issue of justice -- reversing decades of ethnic cleansing that has forced close to one million people in Iraqi Kurdistan from their homes. Just a small fraction of the oil-for-food money would finance the return of many of those who were evicted, and pay for the decent resettlement of the Arabs who took over their land. Thus far we have averted the chaos of a flood of displaced families trying to return home by counseling patience to the Kurds, Turkmens and Assyrian Christians who were forced out. This patience, however, is not infinite. In the coming months we want to work with the coalition to set up a fair, transparent mechanism to allow these people to come home. 
Thus far, the coalition has taken important steps toward promoting democracy. But aspects of the overall strategy remain vague. What Iraqis have learned from their encounters with American soldiers and officials is that they seek to democratize, not to dominate. While we are working with L. Paul Bremer III, the American occupation administrator, to set up constitutional councils to initiate the political process, we need to mark out a clear path toward national elections and representative government, so that Iraqis have some sense of certainty about theirpolitical future. One positive development is that the main Iraqi political groups have been able to reach consensus on the next stage of self-governance in Iraq.
Also crucial to realizing President Bush's vision of a democratic Iraq is his, and our, belief in a federal Iraq. For too long, both Baathist and Arab nationalist regimes held Iraq together by brute force. That is no longer an option. Iraq was a state imposed upon its inhabitants, a country whose preservation has cost too many lives. The new Iraq has to be different, a democratically created state that reflects the will of its peoples and accommodates their diversity. For that reason, and with United States backing, we advocate a federal system of government. Iraqi federalism will of course differ from that of the United States, but the fundamental principle will be the same: a balanced system of government with considerable local autonomy and a sovereign, federal center.
Democracy in Iraq will take time to establish itself. For more than three decades, Iraqis endured a regime that carried out genocide, including the anti-Kurdish Anfal campaign of 1987-88, which littered the country with mass graves and "disappeared" hundreds of thousands. Iraq was a society where the faintest hint of dissent could lead to a death sentence, as the Kurds gassed in Halabja discovered.
The first building blocks of Iraqi federalism and democracy have already been laid in Iraqi Kurdistan. Thanks to protection from American and British air power, facilitated by Turkey, Kurds have had 12 years of a sometimes faltering, but ultimately hopeful, experiment in self-rule, openness and pluralism. With continued help from the United States, and with our work on the interim Iraqi administration, what has become known as the Kurdish experiment in democracy can be a model for all of Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Rich Nation, A Poor Continent 

BYLINE:  By Jeffrey D. Sachs; Jeffrey D. Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

 BODY:
At a time when President Bush has lavished billions of dollars in tax cuts on the richest Americans, his trip to Africa presents him with the perfect opportunity to call on them to take some responsibility for the dire state of the world's poorest citizens. According to a recent report from the Internal Revenue Service, some 400 super-rich Americans had an average income of nearly $174 million each, or a combined income of $69 billion, in 2000. Incredibly, that's more than the combined incomes of the 166 million people living in four of the countries that the president is visiting this week: Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda and Botswana. America's richest individuals could actually change the course of Africa's history, and the president -- who has stressed the importance of personal responsibility -- should urge them to do so. 
 If President Bush gets beyond the typical rhetoric concerning the plight of Africans, he'll discover that poverty throughout the continent is a matter of life and death -- indeed, mainly death. While the average life expectancy in the United States is now 77 years, it is less than 50 years in most of Africa, and less than 40 years in some of the AIDS-ravaged countries. Until the pandemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other killer diseases are brought under control in Africa, economic development and political stability will remain crippled. A breakthrough on disease control, conversely, would help to unleash a virtuous circle of rising productivity, better education, lower fertility rates -- and then lead to further increases in health and prosperity. 
 Yet Africa's poverty makes this an unbeatable problem without more help from the United States and other wealthy countries. In the United States, annual public spending on health care averages about $2,000 per person, according to the World Health Organization. In Africa, public health spending is around $10 per person per year -- not enough to keep the population alive. Countries throughout Africa are desperately trying to do more, but simply can't afford to when their citizens' incomes average less than $1 per day, and when their struggling governments must repay foreign debts to rich nations instead of tending to their sick and dying. 
Two years ago the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I headed, made a stunning finding: If rich countries contributed a total of around $25 billion per year, the increased investments in disease prevention and treatment could prevent around eight million deaths each year in poor countries throughout the world. The United States' share would be around $8 billion, given the size of its economy in relation to other donors. Most of this money is needed in Africa, where the countries are among the poorest and the disease burden is the highest. 
Projected spending by the United States on global health in the fiscal year 2004, even with the president's new AIDS initiative, is roughly $2 billion, or one-fourth of what's needed from us. More money could, among other things, keep AIDS patients alive through antiretroviral therapy, help mothers survive the complications of childbirth and prevent hundreds of thousands of children from dying from malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Here's where America's richest 400 could change history. In 1995, the top 400 income earners paid almost 30 percent of their incomes in taxes. After the Bush tax cuts and other factors, the proportion will be less than 18 percent. Suppose the super-rich applied their tax savings toward Africa's survival. That extra 10 percent of income -- which translates to nearly $7 billion based on the incomes in 2000 -- would provide a huge chunk of the $8 billion that the United States should contribute to the global health care effort. This money could readily and reliably be given to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which could then put it to spectacular use in saving those eight million lives each year. For individuals who already have all the earthly possessions that can possibly be amassed, could there be a better way to give meaning to vast wealth?
The notion that the super-rich might voluntarily rise to the occasion is not preposterous, especially if President Bush encouraged them to do so. Bill Gates has brilliantly blazed the way with a donation of more than $20 billion directed mainly at international public health. And many of the super-rich opposed the recent tax cuts, saying the needs of the poor were too great.
Of course, it's strange to rely on only the goodwill of a few hundred super-rich people to save the lives of millions of the poor. All Americans need to share responsibility for such an effort, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for practical public health reasons. Yet given the huge tax cuts that have gone to the wealthiest Americans, the moral and practical obligations facing them are greater than ever. 
Our world is dangerously out of kilter when a few hundred people in the United States command more income than 166 million people in Africa -- with millions of the poor dying each year as a result of their impoverishment. Perhaps most remarkable of all is that such bald facts are rarely noticed in this country. President Bush's trip to Africa should open our eyes to these realities, as well as to the possibilities they raise to help ease the pain in the world.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Share Prices Advance on News of Several Merger Deals

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A string of merger announcements gave Wall Street another lift yesterday, extending the market's rally to a second day and pushing the Nasdaq composite index to its highest level in nearly 15 months.
 Blue-chip stocks, which struggled for much of the session, overcame their losses during the last hour of trading. Analysts attributed the market's advance to a sudden increase in merger activity. 
 The Yellow Corporation said that it was acquiring a rival trucking company, Roadway, while the data storage maker EMC announced it was purchasing a competitor, Legato. The auto parts maker ArvinMeritor said it would make an unsolicited $2.2 billion bid to take over Dana, a larger rival. 
"What's kind of stirring everyone's interest today are the deals," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
The Dow Jones industrial average recovered from a loss of more than 53 points to close up 6.30 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,223.09.
The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 25.75 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,746.46, its highest level in nearly 15 months, or since April 22, 2002, when it stood at 1,758.68. On Monday, the Nasdaq surged 57.25 points, to its highest close since May 17, 2002.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,007.84, having gained 18.72 points Monday.
Investors were initially inclined to collect profits yesterday. But the day's merger announcements, which followed a spate of other merger news in recent weeks, added to the market's belief that corporate America was feeling more secure about the economy.
"It suggests that there is hope, that business leaders have confidence in this recovery and are willing to do some deals," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Financial Services in Philadelphia.
Roadway surged $16.08, or 53 percent, to $46.10, while Yellow fell $1.24, to $23.25. Yellow is paying $966 million in cash and stock to acquire Roadway, a huge premium over Roadway's recent market valuation.
EMC fell 50 cents, to $11.24, on the news that it will rival Legato in a stock deal valued at $1.3 billion and despite announcing that its second-quarter results will top analysts' forecasts by 3 cents a share. But Legato rose 81 cents, to $9.91.
"The purchase by Yellow of Roadway, the purchase of Legato by EMC suggests that there is a lot of pressure on companies to use their cash to make acquisitions to grow their revenues," Mr. Johnson said. "In other words, companies know that these stocks are cheap and they are doing something about it. They are putting their money out there, even though many believe the stock market is overvalued."
There was also news of a hostile bid by ArvinMeritor for Dana. After failing to get Dana to discuss a possible buyout, ArvinMeritor said it would offer $15 in cash for all outstanding Dana shares, a 25 percent premium over Dana's closing stock price Monday.
Shares of ArvinMeritor fell 71 cents, to $20.29, while Dana climbed $4.18, or 34.8 percent, to $16.20.
In other trading, the Pepsi Bottling Group advanced $1.52, to $22.25, on quarterly earnings that were a penny a share higher than analysts expected.

HEADLINE: Seeking Help With a Crisis, Zimbabweans Go to Pretoria 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 8 

 BODY:
The attention of Zimbabweans is being diverted south this week as President Bush holds talks in Pretoria with the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, that will surely include discussion of the political crisis in Zimbabwe.
 The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, whose leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is on trial for treason in Harare, has sent a delegation to South Africa in the hope of capturing some of the spotlight Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Mbeki will bring. The delegation hopes Mr. Bush will press Mr. Mbeki to condemn President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. 
 "What we have seen is solidarity among African leaders," said Gift Chimanikire, the party's deputy secretary general, in an interview here today. "What we have not seen is solidarity from the leaders with the African people. We hope our presence here can change that."
Mr. Bush, who will hold talks with Mr. Mbeki on Wednesday as part of a five-country tour of Africa, has called for a change of leadership in Zimbabwe. His South African counterpart has been hesitant to push Mr. Mugabe to step down despite the damage the crisis in Zimbabwe could cause to his country's economy and to regional stability.
The Movement for Democratic Change has a carefully crafted message for Mr. Bush: pressure Mr. Mbeki to use his country's standing as a regional superpower to defuse the crisis in Zimbabwe, and promise to do it on a specific timetable.
"We want to lobby for regional support to bring a democratic end to the crisis," Mr. Chimanikire said. 
Last week a judge in Harare gave the Movement for Democratic Change a boost when it ruled that the party's challenge to the 2002 election, which President Mugabe won narrowly amid widespread irregularities and allegations of fraud and violence, must be assigned a court date. The court case had been stalled for 15 months.
Mr. Mugabe, on a tour of Zimbabwe's eight provinces over the weekend, spoke at huge rallies at each stop in which he ridiculed Mr. Bush and called for him and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to stand trial for war crimes for the "genocide which they recently committed in Iraq."
Mr. Mugabe, who is 79 and has been in power for 23 years, told a roaring crowd over the weekend in Chivi, a rural town 140 miles southwest of Harare, the capital, "If Mr. Bush is coming to seek cooperation, then he is welcome, but if he is coming to dictate what we should do, then we will say, 'Go back, Yankee.' "
While people across Africa have turned out to protest Mr. Bush's visit, in Harare, where idle young men with no jobs and no place to go fill the streets, many people wish Mr. Bush would intercede in the Zimbabwe crisis, forcefully, and cite Liberia as a model.
"When Bush arrives he should immediately send a strong statement toward Mugabe, just like what he did with Charles Taylor," said Denis Tsanga, a 19-year-old computer science student in Harare, referring to the president of Liberia. "Because as it is right now, we are suffering."
An intervention like the one under consideration in Liberia is highly unlikely, and opposition leaders have said they hope the United States will apply pressure carefully so as not to seem as though it is bullying a troubled African nation. Indeed, there are no rebel armies threatening Harare, no tide of refugees. But each day Zimbabwe slides deeper into misery. 
With the collapse of Zimbabwe's once robust farming sector, about half of the country will need food to get through to the next harvest without starving. But the United Nations food supplies in the country have dwindled to just a month's worth.

HEADLINE: No. 2 in Trucking, Yellow, Will Buy No.1, Roadway 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Yellow Corporation, the nation's second-largest trucking company, will acquire the industry leader, the Roadway Corporation, the two companies said yesterday. The deal will create the Yellow-Roadway Corporation, a behemoth with more than $6 billion in annual sales.
 Financial analysts hailed the deal as bringing needed consolidation to an industry that has been struggling to stay profitable. The weak economy has reduced the amount of freight carried on trucks even as many shippers have embraced just-in-time inventory practices that let them send smaller loads, often through rail-and-ship combinations and other alternatives. 
 Still, the deal's price and the new company's structure had analysts scratching their heads.
Yellow agreed to pay $966 million, or about $48 a share, for Roadway, whose stock closed on Monday at just $30.02. Moreover, William D. Zollars, the chairman of Yellow who will head the new company, insisted the two would continue to operate separately. Roadway will keep its offices in Akron, Ohio, even though the combined company will be based at Yellow's headquarters in Overland Park, Kan. Each will keep its network of more than 300 terminals where trucks are loaded.
"This industry has too many terminals, too many trucks, too much capacity," said Gregory E. Burns, a transportation analyst at J. P. Morgan. "They have to look at overlapping operations and cut capacity."
Mr. Zollars took a different view. In an interview, he conceded that some operations might eventually have to be consolidated, but for the next year or two, he said, he is happy to avoid the pains of integrating companies.
"This acquisition is not about shrinking," he said. "It is about growing the customer base and services we sell. So why slam these companies together and hope for the best?"
Shareholders did not seem to embrace that idea. Yellow's shares dropped $1.24, to $23.25 yesterday. Shares of Roadway soared by $16.08, to $46.10. The stock is now "in the hands of the arbitragers," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.
It may also be in the Justice Department's hands. Consolidated Freightways, which was the third-largest trucking company, closed 10 months ago. Though there are many regional trucking companies, and trucking divisions of other transportation companies, Consolidated's demise left U.S. Freightways, Yellow and Roadway as the only independent national long-haul trucking companies.
"The companies' lawyers will say the industry must consolidate to survive, but the Justice Department may still believe that the companies will not be aggressively competitive," said John C. Christie Jr., co-chairman of the antitrust practice at Hale & Dorr, a Washington law firm. 
Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said simply, "We are aware of the deal and we will review it."
About 70 percent of Yellow's business is hauling goods for manufacturers, with 30 percent from retailers. Roadway's customers are evenly split between manufacturers and retailers. Edward M. Wolfe, an analyst with Bear, Stearns, estimated that the combined company would have 58 percent of the total market for long-haul shipments of loads that are less than a full truckload.
Mr. Zollars and James D. Staley, Roadway's chief executive, said antitrust concerns were overblown. "Sure, we both carry retailers," said Mr. Staley, who will stay on as Roadway's top executive, "but we're strong with Home Depot, they're strong with Lowe's. They're strong with Wal-Mart, and we're not."
Mr. Zollars said that the combined company would still represent only 1 percent of a $600 billion global freight-transportation market. He noted that truckers, sea-freight companies and airlines all make alliances for long-distance shipping. Moreover, big trucking companies now try to handle international shipments, same-day and overnight deliveries, and even small parcels, to offer customers one-stop shopping. Yellow offers to manage a customer's freight-handling operation through a subsidiary called Meridian IQ. "Customers want us to do many more things, so that old fragmentation of the market has pretty much disappeared," Mr. Zollars said.
The merger will, of course, change the companies. Mr. Zollars estimated that by combining back office operations, the combined company would save as much as $45 million in the first year and as much as $125 million a year after five years. And he said he expected Yellow to be able to sell its Meridian management services to Roadway customers. Roadway had been buying up regional trucking companies, a strategy that Mr. Zollars said Yellow had tried and abandoned and would not resume.
Although Mr. Zollars insisted that, for now, Roadway and Yellow sales forces would continue to bid against each other for customers, he did not insist that practice would continue forever. "Hypothetically, we could focus on different industry groups, or different geographies," he said.
The deal is bittersweet for Mr. Staley, 53, who has been at Roadway's helm less than a year. In June, the company's stock plunged as he warned analysts that despite a one-time increase in business after Consolidated's closing, Roadway's second-quarter earnings would be much lower than predicted.
Yesterday, after the conference call announcing the acquisition, Roadway confirmed the accuracy of that lowered estimate: revenues rose 13 percent from the quarter a year earlier, and income from continuing operations increased 43 percent. Roadway also predicted that revenues and earnings would rise significantly in the third quarter.
It would have been a nice time to be chief executive, but Mr. Zollars, at 56, is unlikely to retire soon. "I'd be remiss if I didn't admit that it will be difficult to not be C.E.O. anymore," Mr. Staley said, "but I will stay on to make sure Roadway employees get what they need."
He will not be the only one watching that. Mr. Zollars and Mr. Staley will meet at noon today with James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters, which represents employees at both companies. The Teamsters just signed a five-year contract with both companies, and Bret Caldwell, a union spokesman, said the members were for the most part pleased with the contracts. But 15,000 of them lost their jobs when Consolidated closed, and the memory is fresh.
"These are two strong companies and we want to see them thrive," he said. "Still, we're always concerned when there's a major transition at a unionized carrier."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Microsoft Will Award Stock, Not Options, to Employees

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF and DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Moving away from a pay system that showered riches on a generation of entrepreneurs and engineers, Microsoft said yesterday that it would no longer grant stock options, relying instead on actual awards of stock to help pay its 50,000 employees.
 The announcement is the clearest sign yet that stock options have lost some of the cachet they held a few years ago. Microsoft's move also comes as some big investors are putting pressure on companies to award fewer options, calling them a prime example of corporate excess in the 1990's. 
 Microsoft, an icon of the technology world, was a leader in creating the stock-option business culture that is still popular among hundreds of companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.
The company, the largest software maker in the world, said it was making the change to calm growing unhappiness among employees about their pay, particularly among newer employees who did not benefit from the huge stock market gains of Microsoft's early years. It said it hoped that the new system would create the next generation of Microsoft millionaires. 
"People have been less happy about the equity-compensation side of the equation than almost anything else in their employment here," said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive.
But with accounting regulators moving to require companies to record stock options as an ordinary business expense, Microsoft may also regard this move as a way to stay a step ahead of outside pressure to alter its compensation methods.
The shift underlines Microsoft's effort to make the transition from a growth-oriented technology company widely considered one of the most attractive places to work, to a more mature company that must fight to keep talented employees who are tempted by the riches they can find at a start-up venture.
Since it was founded in 1975, Microsoft has created more than 1,000 millionaires, according to outside analysts who follow the company. It currently has about 1.5 billion options outstanding, shared unevenly among its employees. Mr. Ballmer and Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman, both own huge numbers of Microsoft shares but they have never received stock options.
The switch to shares, rather than options, will allow employees to make money on their stock-based pay even when Microsoft's shares are not rising. An option gives its holder the right to buy a share of stock at a fixed price in the future, an extremely valuable right during a bull market but one that becomes less attractive when the shares are not rising.
Yesterday, Microsoft shares closed at $27.70, down sharply from a split-adjusted value around $113 five years ago and even further below its peak of about $178 in March 1999.
Microsoft's move puts it at odds with a generally held view in Silicon Valley that stock options are an essential tool for assembling highly motivated teams of technology experts who are willing to work long hours over months or years, gambling that in the end the stock market value of their options will justify their efforts.
Indeed, the culture, economy and mythology of Silicon Valley are largely geared around a system that has permitted companies like Apple Computer, Netscape and Yahoo to mint thousands of overnight multimillionaires.
Silicon Valley executives said yesterday that Microsoft's shift only deepened the rift between start-up and more mature companies. The executives continued to point to difficulties in valuing stock options accurately.
"Microsoft is not the same company it was 10 years ago," said Rick White, chief executive of TechNet, a high-technology lobbying group based in Palo Alto, Calif., which has Microsoft as a member. "Many people in the tech industry think this is about a culture that rewards risk-taking, and that it's no coincidence that Silicon Valley is in the U.S. and not in France."
Executives at Intel, one of the Silicon Valley companies that has adamantly opposed the idea of expensing stock options, said the Microsoft decision did not alter their opposition to the idea.
"We continue to believe that expensing options is bad accounting," an Intel spokesman, Bill Calder, said. 
One of the most vocal advocates of expensing options, the investor Warren E. Buffett, is a longtime friend of Mr. Gates. The company declined to say whether the two men had recently discussed the issue.
After waiting until the stock market closed this afternoon, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said that it would change its compensation policy to favor granting shares of stock both to its highest-ranking executives and its rank-and-file employees. Microsoft will also change its accounting practices to assess more accurately the effect of stock grants and stock options on its financial statements.
In 1999, Microsoft adjusted its salary structure, paying its employees more in an effort to compete against the startling Silicon Valley salary inflation of the dot-com era. In January, Microsoft announced that it would begin paying a small but regular dividend to shareholders.
By making the shift to stock grants, which will gradually become worthwhile over five years, Mr. Ballmer said he hoped that the company would be able to bring its employees' interests more closely in line with those of the shareholders. In the past, employees have generally sold options as soon as possible. Under the new stock ownership plan, Mr. Ballmer said he hoped that more people at Microsoft would continue to own shares of company stock.
"This is about the best way for us to pay our people," Mr. Ballmer said. "For us, this is just a smarter way forward."
The company also said it was developing a plan to help employees who had previously been awarded stock options that are now without value because of the drop in the share price. Under the plan, which is expected to be in place by the end of this year, the employees would be able to sell options that are currently worthless to a separate financial institution, which would expect to make money itself by trading on the value of the options as Microsoft's stock fluctuated in the future.
Microsoft has struggled with an internal class system that has divided employees who were hired before 1997 or so, and enriched from the exponential growth in the value of the stock, from those hired more recently, who have not experienced the vast increase in wealth from stock.
Stock options remain the biggest form of pay for top executives at most large companies, having surged in popularity in the long bull market from the late 80's until spring 2000. Outside the technology industries, though, relatively few rank-and-file workers receive them. 
The most recent Labor Department survey found that 1.7 percent of private-sector workers received options in 1999. Over all, 7 million to 10 million Americans now hold options, according to the National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif.
But now that era may be ending even in much of the high-technology world. "We had lifetime job security in the 60's; we had the corporate car in the 70's; flextime and day care in the 80's; and stock options in the 90's," said Bob Austrian, managing director at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. "Now we're clearly moving on.
Most analysts expect accounting regulators in the next few years to force companies to estimate the cost of the options they award. Regulators have long wanted to take that step, but lacked the support needed to do so until the recent series of corporate scandals caused many investors and politicians to view options with a new skepticism.
"We don't know many companies that aren't looking at their stock-option plans right now," said Peter V. LeBlanc, a senior vice president at Sibson Consulting, which advises companies on pay. "There won't be as many options distributed going forward."
Critics say the popularity of options gave executives an incentive to push up their stock prices by any means at their disposal, including questionable ones. Some investors have also grown unhappy with the portion of company stock that executives have effectively awarded to themselves.
For Microsoft, the shift is expected to have a significant effect on its bottom line. In a report issued in February, Pat McConnell, an accounting analyst at Bear, Stearns, stated that in 2000 Microsoft gave away options worth $1.9 billion, an amount equivalent to 13 percent of the company's reported pretax income that year.
In 2001, the grants were worth $3.3 billion, or 29 percent of pretax income. By 2002, the grants had grown in value to $3.6 billion, or 32 percent of pretax income.
Had Microsoft considered its option grants an employee expense, Ms. McConnell calculated, earnings would have been sharply lower in all three years. In 2000, Microsoft would have had net income of $8.2 billion, nearly 13 percent lower than the $9.4 billion it reported. By last year, net income would have been $5.4 billion, nearly 31 percent lower than the $7.8 billion it recorded.
So even though Microsoft stock is no longer the highflier it was during the technology mania, the cost of its option grants has risen as a percent of earnings.
Microsoft is one of the few big companies not to give options to its highest-ranking executives. Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates have long said that the large stockholdings they acquired starting in Microsoft's early days gave them enough incentive to run the company well.
Under the new compensation plan the top 600 managers, excluding Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer, will receive stock grants based on customer satisfaction and revenue growth.
The very thing that makes restricted stock so attractive to employees can create downsides for investors. In fact, some investor groups were arguing a decade ago that options, which are valuable only when a company's share price rises, should replace stock. 
If, for example, Microsoft's shares were to fall to $20 in future years, employees who held restricted stock could still sell it and make money. But options with an exercise price of $27.70 -- the closing price yesterday -- would have no value until the stock rose above that level.
Restricted stock "is less risky," said Sue Holloway, a project manager at WorldatWork, an association of compensation executives based in Scottsdale, Ariz. "You don't have as much skin in the game."
Robert Willens, the accounting and tax analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, said that from an accounting perspective, Microsoft's move from stock options to restricted shares was not that startling. It will provide certain tax advantages to employees, however.
The bigger significance in the shift, he said, is that this represents the first technology company to break ranks with the staunch opposition in Silicon Valley to treating stock options as an expense. 
"When a bellwether company like Microsoft does it," he said, "that could easily cause a lot of companies to accelerate their movement from options to restricted stock."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the decision by Microsoft to stop giving stock options to employees misstated the date and price of the peak in the company's shares. The stock, which closed on Tuesday at $27.70, peaked in December 1999, not March 1999. The value of the stock at its peak, adjusted to take account of splits, was $59.56, not $178.

HEADLINE: So Long, School Bureaucrats: 110 Livingston Is Being Sold 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Like the Kremlin, to which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg compared it yesterday, 110 Livingston Street was more than a location or a shorthand name for the institution it housed, the city's Board of Education. It symbolized a state of mind, a failed system that was at once imperious and impervious.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani famously called for it to be "blown up." A former president of the Board of Education once suggested pulling a fire alarm there and then locking out all the administrators. One schools chancellor who worked there used to call it "the puzzle palace." Another toyed with changing the address to 112 Livingston Street. 
 Now the days are numbered for the few administrators who remain in the old headquarters building in Downtown Brooklyn. The city announced yesterday that it was selling the building for more than $45 million to a developer for conversion into high-end condominiums, with a theater for arts groups on its main floor.
To dramatize a clear break with the past, Mayor Bloomberg, who won control of the city's school system last year and moved its headquarters next to City Hall, slapped a red "SOLD" sign across the building's front door yesterday. 
"This sale will redefine the address 110 Livingston, which was for too long synonymous with a dysfunctional bureaucracy that served itself instead of our children," he said. "In the future, 110 Livingston will mean quality housing in a lively community."
All of this raises the question: Will the notoriety of 110 Livingston Street be a selling point or a sticking point?
"I don't think anybody cares," said the developer, David C. Walentas, whose company, Two Trees Management, was instrumental in developing the Dumbo section of the Brooklyn waterfront. "People's memories are short."
Faith Hope Consolo, the vice chairman of Garrick-Aug, a retail brokerage firm, said she thought the famous address would add "a very nice cachet."
Others were not so sure. Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian, said he would not be surprised if the building's developers ended up choosing a new address for it, possibly one on Boerum Place, its cross street.
"I would bet you two root beers they're not going to market this as 110 Livingston Street," Mr. Alpern said. "One-ten Livingston Street doesn't represent a building so much as bureaucratic dead weight. If they got a Boerum Place address, then if you said, 'I've moved in to 45 Boerum Place,' people would say, 'Oh, is that somewhere in Brooklyn Heights, or in Boerum Hill?' Then it could be a brownstone, it could be anything."
Mr. Walentas said yesterday that he had no intention of changing the address, which might involve moving the main entrance off Livingston Street.
The change may not be necessary. New Yorkers seem to thrive on unsavory associations, or forget them.
Most chess players in Washington Square Park probably do not know or care that the area was once the site of public hangings. The killing of Paul Castellano, the Gambino family crime boss, outside Sparks Steak House has not kept carnivores from the restaurant. The Triangle Shirtwaist Company building, which caught fire 92 years ago, killing 146, is a landmark housing science laboratories for New York University.
And the Dakota apartment house, on Central Park West, is still one of the city's most elegant addresses, even after it was featured in the horror film "Rosemary's Baby" and after one of its most famous residents, John Lennon, was shot to death outside.
Rob Polner, a co-author of "New York Notorious: A Borough-by-Borough Tour of the City's Most Infamous Crime Scenes" (Crown, 1992), said that in his experience even the city's most notorious addresses got new leases on life.
"Almost all of the places we looked at had new lives, whether they were the scene of a mob hit or a political scandal," Mr. Polner said. "They became Chinese restaurants or luxury apartment buildings. New York continually reinvents itself."
In a sense, the conversion of 110 Livingston Street to high-end housing is more a restoration than a rebirth.
The building was not always known for overflowing "in" and "out" trays. Designed by the firm of McKim, Mead & White, it opened in 1926 as a luxurious headquarters for the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. It had 200 dormitory rooms, a ballroom, bowling alleys, Turkish baths and a swimming pool. The Board of Education did not take over until 1939.
Mr. Walentas, the developer, said he planned to build 245 condominiums in the building, which has 12 stories, not counting a small garret. On the main floor, the old Hall of the Board of Education will become a theater for local arts groups. And the building will get an underground garage with 225 parking spaces.
Mr. Walentas said apartments would sell for around $500,000. The facade, which is not listed as a landmark but is imposing in design and pedigree, will be preserved.
Officials said the city would use 10 percent of its price, or $4.5 million, to build moderately priced housing elsewhere in Brooklyn. The rest will go into the city's general fund.
The deal is not complete. Andrew M. Alper, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that he expected to sign a contract in October and to close the sale in January, and that construction was expected to begin soon afterward. But Mr. Alper, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Walentas all expressed confidence that the sale would be completed.
Condominiums in 110 Livingston Street would help bridge Brooklyn's thriving residential areas on the periphery of its downtown, from Brooklyn Heights, on the opposite side of Court Street, to Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill, across Atlantic Avenue.
Although the city is selling 110 Livingston Street and has moved about 600 education officials to the Department of Education's headquarters in the Tweed Courthouse, behind City Hall, several hundred education administrators will continue to work in Downtown Brooklyn in two other city buildings. But officials of the Bloomberg administration clearly relished the symbolism of the sale.
Few tears were shed yesterday for the end of an era. 
"This will be the least-missed building in the history of New York City government," said John Beckman, a former schools spokesman who worked there. "If there is an opposite of nostalgia, you'd have to apply it to 110 Livingston Street."

HEADLINE: Bush, in Africa, Promises Aid but Offers No Troops for Liberia 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, July 8 

 BODY:
President Bush opened his tour of Africa today with a pledge to work more closely with African nations to help them build a prosperous and peaceful future. But he still would not commit to sending American troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in war-ravaged Liberia.
 "We're in the process of determining what is necessary to maintain the cease-fire and to allow for a peaceful transfer of power," Mr. Bush said after consulting about Liberia with President John Kufuor of Ghana, the leader of the Economic Community of West African States, a regional group. "I assured him we'll participate in the process," Mr. Bush said. "And we're now in the process of determining what that means." 
 Mr. Bush repeated his demand that President Charles Taylor of Liberia step aside to help resolve the conflict and pave the way for new elections. He said the United Nations as well as the West African governments would be involved in the effort to end the long-running conflict, which has killed thousands of people, displaced as many as one million Liberians and threatened to destabilize neighboring nations. 
A senior administration official said later that Mr. Bush would decide whether to send United States forces to Liberia only after he receives a report from a Pentagon team that arrived in Monrovia on Monday to assess the need for assistance. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said it would be "some time" before the president received the Pentagon team's report.
After a meeting with West African leaders and his host for the day, President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal, Mr. Bush rode Mr. Wade's presidential yacht across Dakar harbor to Goree Island, the westernmost point in Africa and the point of departure centuries ago for at least a million slaves sent across the ocean.
"At this place, liberty and life were stolen and sold," the president said, standing against the backdrop of a blue sky and brightly painted buildings that belied the island's dark history. "One of the largest migrations of history was also one of the greatest crimes of history."
Mr. Bush did not apologize for the role of the United States in slavery, but he condemned it in unflinching and strikingly religious terms that seemed to be aimed as much at an audience at home as to the small crowd that listened to him under the blazing sun. "For 250 years the captives endured an assault on their culture and their dignity," Mr. Bush said. "The spirit of Africans in America did not break. Yet the spirit of their captors was corrupted.
"Small men took on the powers and airs of tyrants and masters," Mr. Bush continued. "Years of unpunished brutality and bullying and rape produced a dullness and hardness of conscience. Christian men and women became blind to the clearest commands of their faith and added hypocrisy to injustice. A republic founded on equality for all became a prison for millions."
Mr. Bush's six-hour stay today in Senegal was the first stop on a five-day trip that will also take him to South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria. It is his first trip as president to sub-Saharan Africa, and White House officials said Mr. Bush intended to focus on promoting democracy, fighting AIDS and increasing trade.
Mr. Bush has also injected himself into one of the continent's many conflicts, the long-running civil strife in Liberia, by calling repeatedly for the departure of Mr. Taylor, who has pledged to leave but shown few signs of actually doing so. Mr. Bush has also signaled that he would like to see a change of government in Zimbabwe, which is suffering under the increasingly autocratic rule of its leader, President Robert Mugabe.
As a candidate, Mr. Bush evinced little interest in Africa and suggested that he would be reluctant to commit American troops here. He won less than 10 percent of the black vote, and some of his policies, including his decision to go to war with Iraq, have brought harsh criticism from some African leaders, including Nelson Mandela.
But he has surprised many groups that advocate doing more to help Africa by proposing large spending increases to fight AIDS and promote antipoverty programs. In opening the door to sending peacekeepers into Liberia, he is considering putting American troops directly in harm's way in Africa for the first time since 18 American soldiers died in Somalia in 1993.
To some degree, Mr. Bush's interest in Africa has been driven by national security considerations. Concerned that many African nations could be breeding grounds or safe harbors for Islamic terrorists, Mr. Bush has sought to increase the American military presence in friendly nations and address the poverty that can give rise to anti-American feelings. With the United States accused by some nations of having adopted a unilateral, militaristic approach to foreign policy, Mr. Bush has sought to soften that reputation.
He was accompanied here by two of the highest-ranking African-Americans to serve in the United States government, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. Mr. Powell and Dr. Rice, both of whom have pressed for more engagement with Africa, were with Mr. Bush this morning on Goree Island as he toured the Slave House, which was built by the Dutch in 1776. As many as 200 men, women and children would be crammed into the house's tiny cells at any time, shackled around the arms and neck.
At the end of one corridor is a door that was marked "the point of no return," through which the slaves would be herded as they were loaded onto ships carrying them to the Americas.
In his five days in Africa, Mr. Bush will have few opportunities to see firsthand much of the poverty and despair bred by centuries of oppression, war and disease. The relatively brief duration of his trip and his decision not to meet with more African leaders has also led many advocates of increased help for Africa to question whether Mr. Bush's visit is more than a photo opportunity.
They said Mr. Bush appeared less interested in aggressively addressing Africa's needs than in putting a kinder face on American foreign policy in the aftermath of the Iraq war and in reminding voters at home of his self-description as a "compassionate conservative."
In a letter sent to the White House, a group of advocacy organizations that is often critical of the United States for not doing more to help Africa said Mr. Bush's proposals for increased spending on AIDS and antipoverty programs were a start but not enough.
On Goree Island, Mr. Bush said slavery had helped the United States learn that it had a critical responsibility to Africa and to the world.
"In the struggle of the centuries, America learned that freedom is not the possession of one race," Mr. Bush said. "With the power and the resources given to us, the United States seeks to bring peace where there is conflict, hope where there is suffering, and liberty where there is tyranny."

U.N. Chief Names Envoy to Liberia
 UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (AP) -- Secretary General Kofi Annan today appointed a senior American diplomat, Jacques Paul Klein, as his top envoy to Liberia and dispatched United Nations officials to Monrovia to promote a political transition and a speedy return of evacuated aid workers.
In a letter to the Security Council, Mr. Annan appointed Mr. Klein, who headed the United Nations mission in Bosnia until Dec. 31, as his special representative to lead and coordinate United Nations activities in Liberia.
Mr. Klein has also served as political adviser to the commander in chief of the United States European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, and as a senior adviser to the secretary of the Air Force with the rank of deputy assistant secretary of defense.
Mr. Annan also ordered Abou Moussa, the current United Nations representative for Liberia, and the United Nations resident coordinator, Marc de Bernis, who were recently evacuated, "to return immediately to Monrovia and assist in the preparations for the return to Liberia of United Nations and associated personnel."

HEADLINE: Latest German Fad: Leasing Out the Subway 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 9 

 BODY:
With smooth-running trains, bright, well-kept stations and a blissful lack of crowds, Frankfurt's subway is a pleasant surprise for people from more teeming cities.
 For American visitors who cannot get enough of the U-Bahn subway system, Frankfurt is making a special, once-in-a-lifetime offer: lease the whole system for 99 years with an upfront payment of roughly $100 million. Frankfurt will even throw in its above-ground streetcar network. 
 This arrangement is known as cross-border leasing, and it has become the latest fad for major German cities like Frankfurt, which are in a deep financial hole because of the economic downturn, eroding tax revenues and the high cost of maintaining their plush public facilities. 
Dusseldorf, Dortmund and Essen recently raised $60 million to $80 million each by leasing their subway systems to American investors. About 150 municipalities in Europe -- including some in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and France -- have offered these deals, but Germany has been the largest lessee by far.
Now, Frankfurt is angling to get into the act.
Later this summer, officials from Frankfurt's public transportation authority will embark on a road show to New York, where they will try to entice investors to lease their subway and streetcar network.
The sales pitch is simple: The tax advantages of leasing a huge fixed asset, which depreciates each year, more than offset the upfront fees paid to the city. John Hancock, Bank of America and the Wachovia Bank are among the American investors that have signed such overseas leases.
"We have to look for sources of capital outside the city," said Werner Lutz, the managing director of Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main, a holding company that oversees the city's stakes in its airport, public transit system and utilities. "We need more capital to be ready for competition."
That sounds reasonable. But it does not mollify opponents of the plan, who have papered the city with signs that say, "Cross-border leasing? Nein!" They are trying to gather 41,000 signatures to force Frankfurt to hold a referendum on the matter.
The critics say turning over the subway system, used by 266,000 riders a day, to foreign investors poses too high a risk.
They ask a host of worrisome questions: What if Frankfurt cannot afford to buy back the lease in 30 years, the first buyback option in the contract? What if a natural disaster, such as a flood, were to befall the system? What if the American tax laws that permit these investments are changed?
"We fear future generations will have no control over the city's infrastructure," said Karola Stotzel, a teacher and union official who is helping to organize the campaign.
The protesters, Ms. Stotzel said, are steering clear of appeals to anti-foreign or anti-American sentiment. "We are internationalists," she said. "This kind of tax evasion isn't good for Germans or Americans."
But some believe the recent raw feelings between the United States and Germany are subtly bolstering the campaign. "If we had not had the Iraq conflict, this would have gotten much less attention," said Georg Vietor, a director at Macquarie Corporate Finance, an Australian bank that prepared a feasibility study for Frankfurt. 
Mr. Lutz admits that Frankfurters could be alarmed by the specter of an American investor taking control of the system. "There is always the fear that the foreign investor will take over our U-Bahn and turn it into the New York City subway, which would be terrible," he said. "But of course, that's not the case."
Frankfurt would still operate the subway, repair the tracks, police the stations and collect the fares. The subway trains themselves are excluded from the lease because they become obsolete too quickly.
At heart, cross-border leases are a loophole. Because they extend over 99 years, United States tax law treats them as a sale, which gives the lease holder the benefits of depreciation. As far as German authorities are concerned, however, the ownership does not change.
"German tax authorities take a clever view," said Ulrich Eder, the managing director of Due Finance, a tax advisory firm in Dusseldorf that specializes in cross-border leases. "They say that the city is receivinga cash benefit for enabling the lease holder to gain a tax benefit."
Advocates of cross-border leasing say there is no reason German cities could not lease other pieces of infrastructure, like water systems or gas and electricity networks. For all their financial problems, German cities are still viewed as having rock-solid credit.
If Frankfurt's transportation authority attracts one or more investors, it would give a percentage of the leasing fee to the lawyers and banks that broker the deal. It would then split the net proceeds, which could range from $73 million to $98 million, with the city. It would use its share to fortify the capital structure of the subway, only 8 percent of which is equity.
Finding investors should not be difficult for Frankfurt, given the recent success of Dusseldorf and other cities. The tricky part, according to people here, will be navigating the local political currents. Frankfurt's government is a balky coalition that includes all four major political parties.
And Frankfurt can draw little comfort from the Austrian city of Salzburg, which shelved plans to lease its wastewater system last spring after factions in the government objected to the plan.
Mr. Lutz said he would prefer to finance the subway system directly from municipal coffers. But with its deficit projected to rise to more than $400 million this year, Frankfurt is in no position to do that.
"We can discuss for a long time whether it is the right thing to do," Mr. Lutz said. "But it is totally legal. When I fill out my German taxes, I take whatever deductions I am allowed to take."
As for Ms. Stotzel, she worries only that it will be tough to arouse public passions on an issue as arcane as cross-border leasing. "We're very glad we don't have to campaign to save the sewage system," she said.

HEADLINE: For a Shaper Of Landscapes, A Cliffhanger 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: KENTFIELD, Calif. 

 BODY:
EVERY morning, Lawrence Halprin, the 87-year-old creator of evocative public places, grabs his hiking staff from the kitchen and ambles down a series of wooden steps that wend their way through a gnarled thicket of madrone and redwood trees. 
 He plunges into the swimming pool, hewn from ancient rocks imported from China, then takes a different path back. It might be the one that snakes down the base of Mount Tamalpais to the outdoor dance deck he designed for his wife of 63 years, the choreographer Anna Halprin, or the one through a grove of old-growth redwoods whose mighty wrinkled girths he knows by heart. "I like to wander around in a place like this," he said, wearing the beat-up hiking boots he wore to the White House in March to receive the National Medal of Arts from President Bush. "So, I design for it." 
 The landscape as a stage set for human drama -- the choreography of serendipity -- is at the core of what Mr. Halprin, the tribal elder of American landscape architecture, has been creating for more than 50 years. He is the guiding force behind such places as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington; Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco; Sea Ranch, an ecologically sensitive development on the Sonoma coast; and, most recently, a landscape for the new Lucas Film campus at the Presidio in San Francisco. 
The other morning, he sat with his wife on a red picnic bench in a cloister of trees beside his home, a rustic compound he designed with his close friend, the architect William Wurster, contemplating his life's work and the impending destruction of his landscapes. In Denver, Skyline Park, designed in the 1970's as a quiet urban canyon in abstract concrete, last month became the first major Halprin work to be demolished, and other Halprin landscapes are threatened in San Francisco, Olympia, Wash., and elsewhere. Once optimistic beacons of urban rejuvenation -- "memorable, intense, passionate rather than pretty" as he once put it -- a growing number of the austere, sculptural Halprin landscapes of the 60's and 70's are suffering from neglect and abandonment and are considered by some critics to be dated modernist eyesores out of step with their cities.
"My immediate reaction is anger," he said, his voice slightly wavery. "Then it's 'gee whiz.' We were like scouts in war, working on point to induce people to move back to the city."
The transformative power of landscape is central to both Mr. Halprin's work and the home he and Anna Halprin, an avant-garde choreographer, have created together at the end of a dead-end road. It is deeply personal terrain in which dance occurs daily (he often sketches her rehearsals) and trees literally become a part of her choreography.
They are both survivors: She has had cancer twice. He survived a World War II kamikaze attack in which his ship was split in two, killing 24 and wounding 44. He was sent to San Francisco on survivor's leave.
Their fortuitous arrival in this deeply sensuous place helped foster a naturalistic approach to landscape and dance.
He: "It encouraged my intuition. A waterfall is not intellectual."
She: "The thing that is so nice about a waterfall is it is out of control. It's spontaneous."
In a kaleidoscopic career that has embraced parks, highways, shopping centers, plazas, monuments and national parks, Mr. Halprin infused once-abandoned corners of American cities with nature's joyful spontaneity. Many of his creations were built on the fringy front lines of urban renewal. Among them are Seattle Freeway Park (1970), which reknit a neighborhood divided by an interstate with a park literally built over the freeway, and the Water Garden, soon to be demolished, at the state capitol in Olympia (1972), nestled atop a parking garage that is now in danger of collapsing.
"Larry was working at a time when no one believed in public spaces," noted the landscape architect Laurie Olin, whose firm transformed Bryant Park in Manhattan and who is now in the delicate position of replacing a Halprin sculpture garden at the Virginia Museum of Art. "No one did it with such bravura and a sense of generosity."
Today at the corporate Levi's Plaza in San Francisco (1978), gulls perch on craggy rock formations, and stepping stones invite grown-ups to climb waterfalls. Streams in granite channels meander through shaded rises, creating a gemlike eddy in the urban torrent where people whisper sweet nothings into their cellphones.
The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (1997) in Washington is a sequence of four outdoor rooms and gardens animated by water, stone and sculpture, including bas reliefs by Robert Graham. It is landscape as powerful emotional narrative, in which Roosevelt's story unfolds like a voyage.
In conceiving new places, Mr. Halprin draws upon the essence of the places he loves, especially the High Sierras, where he has long spent summers, sketchbooks in hand. "There is a big difference between talking about nature as a romantic thing and nature as a powerful generative force," he explained, a Yoda in the redwoods with a turquoise turtle bolo. "Up there you can see the process of change, how an avalanche sounds when it's tumbling down and what happens on its way, listening to waterfalls on granite rocks. What I really love up there is how things happen. This is what I try to do when I design."
Mr. Halprin helped take landscape architecture out from behind the polite picket fence of gardening into the broader and more contentious realm of urban planning. His plazas were designed to be free-spirited spaces brimming with young people and activity. The forlorn sunken fountain at United Nations Plaza in San Francisco, for instance, now 27 years old, was conceived as "a place to walk to, sit down, do theater in."
But today, many of these abstract modernist "hardscapes" are unappreciated. Many have suffered from neglect and lack of maintenance. "Open space creates a kind of vacuum for many people," Mr. Halprin observed. "If the pumps go south and aren't repaired, the fountain goes and the place begins to seem lonely and unattractive. So they become vulnerable."
Modernist landscapes also do not fit the stereotype of a park. Charles A. Birnbaum, founder of the nonprofit Cultural Landscape Foundation, notes that Beaux Arts landscapes like Central Park are "places that people have longstanding relationships with, where picnics, weddings and concerts were held." In contrast, he said, "modernist works haven't been around long enough to endear them to people." 
United Nations Plaza recently received a reprieve from demolition by the city's Board of Supervisors, which did not view an alternative scheme as an improvement. Poised between City Hall and the Tenderloin district, it has never been universally admired. Allan Temko, former architecture critic of The San Francisco Chronicle, called it "pretentious schmaltz." Meant to mimic the Bay's tidal rhythms, the fountain is now ringed by yellow chains to prevent homeless people from bathing in it (and worse).
The protracted saga of Skyline Park in Denver pitted downtown business interests against Historic Denver, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and other cultural advocacy groups. The park, surrounded by a five-foot berm and situated below grade, was intended to be a place of downtown quiet, "a canyon-like mountain refuge in the midst of car hell," in the words of Susan Barnes-Gelt, Denver city councilwoman at large. But, as in San Francisco, it eventually drew the kind of users who relished its hidden sightlines.
Eventually the city brought in Thomas Balsley, a New York landscape architect, to reconfigure and largely demolish it.
John Desmond, director of the Downtown Denver Partnership, representing 350 property owners, campaigned for its demolition. He calls the design "dictatorial." 
"Most people didn't read it as a traditional park, and are put off by concrete, especially angular concrete," he said. "It was more sculpture than park."
The park was never loved, Ms. Barnes-Gelt said. "Denverites do not warm up to modernism," she said. "We don't really get the built environment, and we for sure don't get it if it's not red brick and at least 75 years old. Against that, Halprin's esthetic was not respected or frankly, enjoyed."
Preservationists face some tough choices as postwar landscapes age. "Famous people do great work, not-so-great work and terrible work," Mr. Olin said. "Not everything is equal." The options do not necessarily have to be either/or, he said. At Bryant Park, for instance, Mr. Olin rejected a slavish adherence to the historic design in favor of a reinterpretation. Mr. Halprin himself does not view his designs as static; in a number of cases, they could be modified, he said, to increase pedestrian traffic. "We could do lively things," he observed. "In each case there is a different solution."
The threat to Halprin works notwithstanding, there are signs of spirited reappreciation: in Portland, Ore., the Lawrence Halprin Landscapes Conservancy was recently formed to spruce up and protect Lovejoy Plaza, Ira Keller Fountain and Pettygrove Park, an ensemble considered to be one of Mr. Halprin's masterpieces.
"They're enormously powerful places," said John Russell, a developer who has pledged $100,000 to maintain the parks. "They evoke a naturalness, yet are clearly manmade."
The naturalness reflects both Mr. Halprin's connection to northern California, where his own house defers to the trees, and experiential workshops that he and his wife developed to mine group creativity -- and which he still uses to help people articulate the essence of places. They are one couple who did not miss the '60s: for a fleeting moment Dennis Hopper was married to their eldest daughter Daria (now a therapist, she starred in "Zabriskie Point").
It was Anna, whom Mr. Halprin met at the University of Wisconsin in 1939, who encouraged a weekend trip to Taliesin East, a studio of Frank Lloyd Wright's. It changed his life. In Wright's studio he recognized his calling, switching from plant science to "environments human beings occupy."
He received a scholarship to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, newly reconstituted under Walter Gropius, director of the Bauhaus. His classmates included I. M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson.
The Halprins' house is a biography of their passions, filled with antique Judaica, clay figures by Mr. Graham and photos of Anna by Harold Halterstadt, a student of the Bauhaus photographer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. A man of intense, free-wheeling enthusiasms, Mr. Halprin can become as excited about a pair of mechanical singing hamsters -- he conducts them with Maazel-like zeal -- as he can about an ancient pottery shard from the Dead Sea. 
He continues to be a force of nature in blue jeans. Working with the Yosemite Fund, he recently redesigned the approach to Yosemite Falls so that visitors are greeted by trails, not by a restroom and a parking lot. He is restoring the spiritual nature of a place that had become secular. His clients include the director George Lucas, whose new campus at the Presidio will open new vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge. "My own tastes range from Oriental to ornate and overgrown Victorian, which I'm sometimes tempted to combine," Mr. Lucas said in a phone interview. "Larry's tastes aren't quite as wide-ranging."
The other day, Mr. Halprin wandered down to the dance deck, passing an outcropping of azaleas. He looked out over the redwoods to Mount Tamalpais, its silhouette and hue constantly changing with the sky. The deck, he explained, was an improvised shape, because his wife was the kind of dancer who shouldn't be confined by a rectangle. It was design as metaphor for its creator, reaching out in all directions.

HEADLINE: Cruise Control May Be Goal of Honda's Chief 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 9 

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, the Honda Motor Company invited a few professional race-car drivers to its famed three-ringed test track in Motegi, two hours north of Tokyo, to show off its latest creations and get feedback from people who make their living through speed.
 To add to the fun that day, Honda rolled out its Side-by-Side, a Formula-One-style car with a 750-cc motorcycle engine in a slim racing body. The professionals raced the cars around the one-kilometer track in about 31 seconds. 
 Hot on their trail, however, was Takeo Fukui, then the chief of Honda's motor sports division. He circled the loop in 32 seconds. 
Mr. Fukui's competitive streak has not diminished in the years since. In fact, it has propelled Mr. Fukui, a 58-year old engineer, to the posts of president and chief executive of Honda, one of the world's most profitable automakers.
Little known outside the company, Mr. Fukui, who took charge last month, will need to channel his energy into maintaining the successes his predecessor, Hiroyuki Yoshino, achieved during the past half-decade. 
Under Mr. Yoshino's leadership, Honda expanded its factories in the United States, pushed into China and posted record profits in three of the last five years, including 427 billion yen ($3.6 billion) in 2002 alone. Defying the conventional wisdom during his tenure that global consolidation would force Honda to seek a partner, Mr. Yoshino preserved the company's independence.
Mr. Fukui vows to do the same. "I completely agree with Yoshino's strategy," he said in an interview today at Honda's headquarters here. "We might lose 90 percent of our flexibility if we teamed up with a partner."
It is not hard to find arguments for leaving well enough alone at Honda, especially when it comes to the brutally competitive American market, where carmakers fight hard for every 10th of a percentage point in market share. 
Honda has had extraordinary success in the United States in the first half of the year, gaining 1.1 percentage points in share, in large part because of new sport utility models like the relatively sedate Pilot and the quirky Element, which resembles a Brink's truck.
In Japan, Honda still ranks second behind Toyota, though its compact Honda Fit has unseated the Toyota Corolla as Japan's top-selling model. Closing the gap behind Honda has been the revitalized Nissan Motor.
According to some estimates, Honda is also the most profitable car company in China, which is considered the next big battleground for the world's auto companies. The country had been a priority for Mr. Yoshino, who was born there.
But analysts agree that Mr. Fukui's primary focus must be North America, where Honda sells 53 percent of its vehicles and generates 90 percent of its profits. The Accord and Civic sedans are selling well in the United States, with only minimal incentive marketing compared with its Detroit rivals, and the Odyssey minivan remains popular.
"Demand for our cars in the U.S. continues to be stronger than our supply," Mr. Fukui said today. "We have no target for our market share in the U.S., but our sales are on schedule."
He knows the territory. After a series of assignments in Honda's racing and research and development operations, including a job developing the engine for the original Honda CVCC minicar, Mr. Fukui was assigned in the mid-1990's to Honda's manufacturing operations in the United States.
He served as executive vice president, and then president, the job previously held by Mr. Yoshino. 
John Adams, senior vice president and general manager of manufacturing at Honda's factory in Marysville, Ohio, learned that Mr. Fukui's quiet exterior hid a streak of determination. When profits were stretched thin by the rising yen, Mr. Fukui found ways to expand substantially production at Honda's plants in Marysville, where the Accord is built, and in East Liberty, Ohio, where Civics are assembled, without spending heavily.
"It was all done with very little investment," Mr. Adams said. 
To mix better with the unit's 14,000 American employees, he adopted an Anglicized nickname, Take, which was stitched on his white plant uniform. But few Americans dared to call him that, Mr. Adams recalled in an interview. Still, Mr. Adams said, "it's very comforting for us to know someone who worked in the United States is nowpresident of the company."
An important question now being discussed throughout the American operations is whether Mr. Fukui will authorize a full-size pickup truck, the only market segment in which Honda does not compete. Mr. Fukui said Honda had no plans to develop a pickup, a project that would require a large investment, both in money and in engineering resources, and take the company into unfamiliar technical territory.
Joseph Phillippi of Auto Trends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J., said, "They just don't have the engineering history and background to do a full-size pickup truck." He added, "They're so focused on adding lightness and fuel economy."
Mr. Phillippi and other analysts said that Honda would do better to revitalize its Acura luxury division. Although Acura reached the United States in the mid-1980's, ahead of the Lexus from Toyota and the Infiniti from Nissan, Honda has been overshadowed by them in consumers' minds despite occasional hits like the MDX luxury sport utility vehicle.
Acura posted a 3.4 percent sales gain in June, but for the first half of the year as a whole, sales were down 5.2 percent. "Honda doesn't have any good experience nurturing a premium brand," said Kunihiko Shiohara, who follows Honda for Goldman, Sachs in Japan. "Their consumer image is not luxury, but value for money." 
Mr. Fukui acknowledged that the Acura could use some attention. "So far, it has been a successful business, but we need to strengthen our brand by adding new products," he said.
Whichever task he focuses on first, Mr. Fukui is unlikely to try to transform Honda with the ferocity that Carlos Ghosn has applied to Nissan. Mr. Ghosn has become a household name in Japan for the swift financial turnaround he engineered at Nissan and for its phalanx of hot-selling vehicles. 
Mr. Fukui's low-key approach is much in keeping with the general atmosphere at Honda. Unusual for a car company, Honda has its top executives sit in one large room, not separate offices. They can convene meetings simply by swiveling their chairs.
Working in such close contact means that the executive team tends to make decisions jointly, suggesting that whatever changes are made under Mr. Fukui's leadership are likely to be incremental rather than drastic, analysts said. 
Though he may focus on the United States, Mr. Fukui will have to be mindful of Honda's position in Japan, which has been mired in an economic slump for nearly a decade. 
High labor and distribution costs and buyers' preference for smaller cars, prompted by the high price of fuel, have meant that, at best, Honda breaks even on its car sales in Japan, analysts said. But Japan is where the company's all-important research-and-development centers are based.
Efforts to correct this geographic imbalance have met with mixed results. Honda fell short of Mr. Yoshino's goal of selling one million cars a year at home, and its domestic sales fell by 20.3 percent in the first half of the year. 
"Honda is consolidating their position in Japan and using Japan as an R&D base, which is fine, because no one makes money here," said Kurt Sanger, an auto analyst at ING Securities in Tokyo. "In reality, everyone is reliant on overseas sales, because that is where the money is made."
The challenges before him make it unlikely that Mr. Fukui will have much time for his favorite pastime, golf. He lamented today that his handicap had increased 2 strokes, to 10, since he returned to Japan from Ohio.
That is further evidence of his competitive streak, said Koichi Amemiya, a Honda executive vice president who oversees North American operations. "He's quiet on the outside, but there's no doubt that he has a fire on the inside," Mr. Amemiya said.

HEADLINE: ARTS BRIEFING 

BYLINE:  By Lawrence Van Gelder

 HIGHLIGHTS

FRANCE: ARTS DISPUTE UPDATE -- Total collapse threatened the summer arts festival season in France yesterday as performers and technicians intensified walkouts and protests in a dispute over efforts to reduce their unemployment benefits, news agencies reported. The weeklong Francofolies festival of music and song, scheduled to start tomorrow in La Rochelle, an Atlantic port, was called off a day after the cancellation of the opening of the Avignon theater festival in the south. In Paris, some 650 demonstrators stormed a Seine River bridge, shutting down filming of an untitled romantic comedy directed by Nancy Meyers and starring Keanu Reeves, Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. The first week of an outdoor film festival in Paris was also called off, and on Tuesday, performances in the city's two opera houses were canceled. Festivals in the towns of Pau, Rennes, Albi and Montlucon have also been called off as a result of the dispute.

GERMANY: POTTERMANIA -- Although the newly published "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" has become the first English-language book to lead the German best-seller list, readers impatient for the arrival on Nov. 8 of the German-language version are busily translating the 870-page novel on the Web. Contributors are asked to translate a couple of pages into German. In return, they receive access to the work of other translators of the book. So far, 3,000 pages appear on the site, because some have been duplicated. "The translations have been varied," Bernd Koelman, the operator of the site, told Reuters. "Some are great at catching the British irony; others are very strict translations, and some have tried to adapt the English into regional dialects, such as the Berlin dialect." He added: "What this shows is that contrary to expectations, young people like translating, and they can take pride in it. They can't do it at school, but they are doing it here of their own free will." The newspaper Bild said: "Our children are becoming language geniuses of their own free will, thanks to the book. Only magic is faster than this."

ENGLAND: POTTER REAL ESTATE -- Harry Potter's house is up for sale. To fans, the address is No. 4 Privet Drive, where the orphaned Harry was living with those detestable Muggles, the Dursleys, when first encountered in the J. K. Rowling saga about the boy wizard. In reality, the house stands at No. 12 Picket Post Close in Bracknell, in southeast England. It was chosen for the Dursleys' home by Warner Brothers for the 2001 film "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" because it lacked interesting features, according to British newspapers. With an estimated price of $415,000, the house is to be auctioned on July 22 in London, Reuters reported yesterday.

DANCE: TAKING FLIGHT -- Doug Varone choreographed "The Beating of Wings." Dwight Rhoden called his dance "Sky Garden." Bebe Miller choreographed "Aerodigm," and Bill T. Jones, "and before." For Jawole Zollar, it was "Eurydice's Flight." These five works were commissioned by the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first flight by the Wright brothers, natives of Dayton, Ohio. Kevin Ward, the artistic director of the company, says: "What better way to celebrate the triumph and dreams of flight than through the art of dance and with D.C.D.C?" At 8 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday, in two programs at the Victoria Theater in Dayton, the company will present "The Flight Project" before embarking on tours that will take it to 20 places between September and May. From Dec. 9 through 13, "The Flight Project" will be presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next Wave Festival.

MUSIC: BOTSTEIN IN JERUSALEM -- Leon Botstein (below right), the president of Bard College, the music director and principal conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra and the founder and co-artistic director of the Bard Music Festival, has accepted an invitation to become the music director of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Botstein's tenure begins with the 2003-04 season and will include concerts planned and conducted by him, as well as by the ensemble's principal guest conductor, Gabor Hollerung, and its resident conductor, Dan Ettinger. The orchestra has been without a music director since 2000, when David Shalon resigned shortly before his death.

FOOTNOTES

Once upon a time there were 15 men named Frank. Along with a fellow named Pekka, they set out across Helsinki, Finland, in search of the open spaces of Eira, a suburb across the river, dying and disappearing one by one along the way. So goes "Calamari Union." At 4:30 p.m. today, at BAM Rose cinemas, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, this deadpan 1985 comedy opens a 14-day retrospective devoted to the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki (above). "Kaurismaki Goes America" includes many of his features and short works. Included are "Crime and Punishment" (1983), which sets Dostoyevsky's novel in modern Helsinki; the cult favorite "Leningrad Cowboys Go America" (1989), about a touring rock band, and "I Hired a Contract Killer" (1990), starring Truffaut's leading man Jean-Pierre Leaud as a suicidal clerk who hires a hit man to kill him but can't find him after meeting a girl who might make him change his mind. This BAMcinematek presentation continues through July 27.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Drug Costs Are Soaring for Elderly 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
As Congress tries to come up with a bill providing a Medicare drug benefit that it can send to President Bush, a new study says prices for the 50 drugs most prescribed for the elderly rose last year at more than three times the rate of inflation. 
 The study, which was issued yesterday by Families USA, a consumer group, shows "how important it is to offer significant subsidies to the lowest-income seniors," Ron Pollack, the group's executive director, said in a telephone interview. 
 As many as half of the elderly do not have insurance for drugs for some part of the year, he said, because they either lack coverage or have exceeded the limits on their policies, which frequently cap the amount the insurer must pay. 
Prices for the 50 drugs increased an average of 6 percent, compared with a rise of 1.8 percent in the Consumer Price Index, excluding energy prices, the study said. More than half of the drugs increased by three or more times the inflation rate, while a quarter stayed the same. 
Over the years, drug prices have consistently outpaced inflation, said Mr. Pollack, who noted that these increases are particularly hard on the elderly, who are often on fixed incomes. 
An elderly person without coverage buying Lipitor, Vioxx, Synthroid and Fosamax would pay nearly $3,000 a year for all four drugs, Families USA said. 
The study met with sharp criticism from the pharmaceutical industry, which argued that many elderly people were able to buy drugs at discounted prices. "Regrettably, Families USA has decided to continue complaining about prescription medicines, rather than to pitch in and help seniors get the medicines they need," the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association, said in a statement. "Instead of misleading seniors by referencing only undiscounted prices, it should be helping them gain access to the life-saving, cost-effective medicines they need." 
Many drug companies also offer programs that help seniors get free or discounted drugs, the association said. 
Claritin, the popular allergy drug made by Schering-Plough, was among the drugs that have gone up in price the most in the last year, the study said, with its price rising nearly 12 times the rate of inflation. 
The drug, which is now available without a prescription, has since fallen steeply in price and could fall further as more generic manufacturers offer cheaper versions.
While Schering-Plough would not comment on its pricing for individual drugs, a spokesman said the company was committed to offering free or discounted medicine to help people who could not afford its drugs. 
With Congress now trying to reach a compromise between the Senate and House bills, some proponents of the Senate version, which calls for more aid to low-income elderly people, used yesterday's study to bolster their position. Under the Senate bill, a low-income person would pay $74 out-of-pocket for those four drugs, compared with $1,084 under the House bill, according to Families USA.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was among the Senate Democrats who recently sent a letter to President Bush calling for certain provisions in the final legislation, cited the report in a statement yesterday. Medicare beneficiaries "need a bill that provides prescription drug coverage for all seniors, but with extra help for lower income retirees, with low premiums and low co-payments," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Slip on Profit Taking Ahead of Earnings Reports

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street pulled back yesterday as investors cashed in profits from the market's recent rally while they awaited second-quarter earnings reports.
 Fears of a potentially unfavorable legal ruling against the Altria Group also weighed on shares. 
 "It's an earnings game from here on out," said Mike Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital in Charlotte, N.C. "We'll be in for some choppy days until we have a clear direction on what earnings might look like."
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 66.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,156.21, after a two-day gain of 152 points. 
The broader market finished mixed. The Nasdaq composite index inched up 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,747.46, having advanced 84 points so far this week to reach its highest level in nearly 15 months.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.63 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,002.21, after a two-day gain of 22 points.
The Altria Group, a component of the Dow and the parent of Philip Morris, declined $2.77, or 5.9 percent, to $44, on speculation that an Illinois appellate court might overturn a lower court's decision to reduce the bond needed to appeal a $10.1 billion tobacco verdict. 
A government report showing an unexpected drop in wholesale inventories also pressured stocks. The Commerce Department reported that inventories declined 0.3 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted level of $289.34 billion. Economists had predicted a smaller rise.
While stocks have rallied in recent months, investors are now looking to second-quarter earnings for more solid proof that the economy is rebounding.
Analysts said an absence of significant positive news also prompted many investors to sell, unlike Tuesday's string of merger announcements, which helped the Dow to close modestly higher.
"The biggest question is whether technology will continue to lead and earnings will accelerate," Mr. Kayes said. "Investors are holding their breath until that occurs," he said. "Investors are wondering, 'Do we jump into tech stocks now, given the big advance, or sell them if earnings don't go through?' "
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, agreed. "The general feeling is that a lot of things are in place to get the market going -- interest rates are low," for one, and there is also a tax cut package, he said. "The market in general is digesting the big run-up that we've had, looking at second-quarter earnings and waiting for the next big, significant news."
Tenet Healthcare slipped 5 cents, to $12.10, after it said it had received a civil subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating a formal investigation; the S.E.C. had been informally reviewing the company's Medicare charges at its hospitals since November.
Alcoa, another Dow component, fell 34 cents, to $25.47, although it reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share; Morgan Stanley cut the company's stock rating to equal-weight from overweight.
Gainers included Citigroup, which rose 62 cents, to $45.99, after Prudential raised the bank's stock rating to hold from sell.

Treasury Prices Increase
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday on speculation that forecasts for economic growth in the second half of the year may be overstated.
The 10-year Treasury note increased 9/32, to a price of 99 16/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 3.68 percent from 3.72 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 110 14/32. The bond's yield fell to 4.70 percent from 4.72 percent on Tuesday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year inflation notes:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price: 98.881
High Yield: 1.999%

HEADLINE: Canada to Offer Marijuana to Medical Patients 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 9 

 BODY:
The Canadian government announced an interim plan today that will provide marijuana on a regular basis to several hundred people who are authorized to use the drug for medical reasons.
 Coming six weeks after the federal government introduced a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and only days after it approved a trial "safe injection site" in Vancouver for intravenous drug users, the marijuana plan was one more sign that Ottawa is moving in a very different direction on drug policy from the Bush administration. 
 Thousands of Canadians already visit so-called "compassion clubs" in Vancouver and a few other cities, which distribute marijuana to those who come with a note from a doctor saying that the drug can help their condition. The police have occasionally entered some of the clinics and seized marijuana, but for the most part they function in the open. 
The decision to allow the government to provide marijuana to people with illnesses ranging from cancer to arthritis to epilepsy was forced by a ruling in January by the Ontario Superior Court that federal marijuana access regulations were unconstitutional because they did not provide patients with a legal distribution system.
The government is appealing the ruling, meaning that the announcement may not stand.
"It was never our intention to sell the product," said Health Minister Anne McClellan, a skeptic of medical marijuana use.
The cabinet is divided on whether the government should be growing and distributing marijuana, an activity that is otherwise illegal. Ms. McClellan noted today that there is a lack of clinical evidence that marijuana has medicinal benefits. She added that the government will conduct its own clinical trials, scheduled to begin this fall, to gauge possible benefits.
The government says it intends to distribute the marijuana through doctors. Some officials of doctors associations have raised cautions about doing so before there is more study about the impact of marijuana use on people's health.
While the courts decide on the government's appeal, Ottawa will provide as many as 500 people, who have received letters from doctors saying the drug offered them medical benefits, with dried marijuana and marijuana seeds for their own planting. 
The marijuana will cost patients almost $4 a gram, or about half the black market price.
The bags of seeds will cost about $15. The marijuana will come from an underground laboratory situated in an old mine in Flin Flon, Manitoba.
"This is a very small victory but a victory nevertheless," said Alison Myrden, a multiple sclerosis patient who appeared before television cameras today in front of the Parliament building holding a marijuana plant and smoking a marijuana cigarette.

HEADLINE: High Official Quits Treasury And Woman Is Named No. 2 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER with MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
The Bush administration announced changes in its economic team yesterday, including the appointment of the first woman to be deputy Treasury secretary and the resignation of Peter R. Fisher as under secretary for domestic finance.
 The new deputy Treasury secretary, assuming her nomination is confirmed by the Senate, will be Susan C. Schwab, now dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Affairs. She is experienced in international trade and was an assistant secretary of commerce in the first Bush administration and would fill the No. 2 job at Treasury, which has been vacant since the end of February. 
 A senior Bush administration official said Ms. Schwab was the choice of the White House, which had made clear it wanted a woman for the job. 
Traditionally the deputy secretary oversees all operations in the department, freeing the secretary to focus on policy and serving as an economic spokesman for the administration.
Mr. Fisher will be succeeded by Kenneth Leet, an investment banker from Goldman Sachs, adding another Goldman alumnus to the administration. Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman at Goldman, is now chairman of the National Economic Council.
Despite the craving of many traders in the Treasury market, Mr. Fisher's departure may not open the door for the return of the 30-year Treasury bond, some traders and analysts say. In a surprise move in October 2001, Mr. Fisher eliminated the 30-year bond from the regular auction of securities. Ever since then, even as the federal budget swung from surpluses back to near-record deficits, Mr. Fisher has insisted there is no need to resume sales of this bond, once a popular benchmark for the fixed-income market.
It is possible, however, that Mr. Fisher, who worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before moving to the Treasury, could become a candidate again for the job as president of the bank. He withdrew his name as a candidate in May. But since then the search committee has been unable to find a new president, and the bank named Jamie B. Stewart, the first vice president, as interim president. Mr. Fisher was not available for comment on this or other issues, a Treasury spokeswoman said.
During Mr. Fisher's tenure at the Treasury he oversaw the reopening of the bond market after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a surprise sale of 10-year Treasury notes to ease market distortions after the attacks, and broad changes in Treasury operations. These changes included the buyback of existing debt with money from the budget surplus, increased borrowing, and issuing of new securities needed to cover a deficit now projected to exceed $400 billion this fiscal year.
He was at the center of other important policy decisions as a member of both the agency that insures pensions and the Air Transportation Stabilization Board.
In his resignation letter to the president, Mr. Fisher said, "I have come to the conclusion that it will be best for my family to return to New Jersey." To allow for a transition, his resignation is effective Oct. 10.
Mr. Leet, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, runs the industrials group of the investment banking division in Europe and is a partner. He met Treasury Secretary John W. Snow in 1999 when he worked with CSX on the sale of Sealand Services to A. P. Moller-Maersk and has kept up the relationship since then, a Goldman spokesman said. His new job also requires Senate confirmation.
"The Bush administration seems to have learned that the key to good economic policy making is just stockpile as many Goldman partners as you can," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a research firm.
James Capra, president of Capra Asset Management in Rye, N.Y., and a member of the outside committee that consults with the Treasury on its debt policies, said that he did not expect Mr. Fisher's departure to lead to the revival of the 30-year bond soon. He said that the staff that works with Mr. Fisher is also opposed to the bond's revival. In addition, he said, the Treasury is working on a study that argues that the 30-year bond is not an efficient way to raise money for the government because it is more expensive, in terms of interest cost, than shorter-term maturities, like the 10-year note.
Mr. Fisher had substantial influence over pension policy at a time when many of America's pension funds were deteriorating sharply and corporate sponsors were lobbying for relief. The Treasury secretary is an ex-officio director of the agency that insures pensions, and Mr. Snow designated Mr. Fisher to represent him at agency meetings.
As adverse market conditions ate away at the solvency of pension plans, many companies found that they had to make large pension contributions to keep their plans compliant with federal rules. Before long, business groups began to attack the rules, saying they were irrational and needed to be relaxed. 
Some also blamed Mr. Fisher directly for their pension difficulties, because of his decision to suspend issuance of the 30-year bond. Since 1987, companies have been required to use the 30-year Treasury rate as a factor in their pension calculations. Lobbyists for the business community argued that by suspending the bond, Mr. Fisher distorted the values of corporate pension funds, making it harder than ever to keep the plans properly funded.
Mr. Fisher did not just resist the pressure to relax the pension rules, however. He also pushed forcefully for an entirely new way of measuring pension values -- one that would have the effect of tightening the pension rules, particularly for the companies with the sickest plans.
Mr. Fisher was one of three voting members on the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which Congress set up after the Sept. 11 attacks to dole out up to $15 billion in aid and loan guarantees to the troubled airline industry.
In general, Mr. Fisher voted against helping applicants. His reluctance reflected the views of Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary, who had expressed reservations about the mission of the board. For example, while his two peers on the board voted in December 2001 to give America West a $380 million loan guarantee, Mr. Fisher opposed it.
Last December, Mr. Fisher voted against giving United Airlines a $1.8 billion loan guarantee, helping to push the company, the world's second-largest airline, into bankruptcy court. On the afternoon of Dec. 4, after the board announced its decision, Mr. Fisher gave a terse explanation for his vote. "This is not just about costs," he said, "it's about a business plan that is fundamentally flawed."

PERSON: James A. Garner 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
This Black Mayor Is Proud of His Republican Roots

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
"I DON'T get headaches; I give them," James A. Garner says bluntly on a recent afternoon here, cruising his black Crown Victoria through his beloved Long Island village. He is showing it off.
 The comment is matter of fact and funny, a response to a double-barreled query about being a Republican mayor in a Democratic village and how he feels about detractors who view him, an urban black mayor, as a toady to be trotted out by the Republican Party. 
 Mr. Garner, who makes it clear he takes no guff, says "I demand respect and I get it." 
The mayor is a towering presence at 6 foot 5, with a balding crown of white hair. His manner is plain-spoken and confident. And at age 58, he remains one popular guy. This is his fourth term as Republican mayor in a village of 56,000 in which Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one. 
Call it Garnerville. He has held the post since 1989. He was the first black elected mayor on Long Island. 
Mr. Garner's platform rose higher last month when he was elected president of the United States Conference of Mayors, the first black Republican to win the post. He says he will promote sustainable development, and sees mayors as "public C.E.O.'s." 
O.K. Let's get to the nitty-gritty. Mr. Garner says flatly that he intends to milk the new platform. "I want to use my clout to get more federal dollars here," he says. "I'm obviously trying to bring more attention to my town." On this day, Mr. Garner is leaning his big frame over the steering wheel, promising to give a tour that reveals the real village, warts and all. At the moment, he is looking at its rattier fringes. 
"See all this mess in here?," he says, motioning to a stretch of auto repair shops and shabby buildings headed for urban renewal. "I'm going to clean it all up. We're going to get all this mess out of the way." But Mr. Garner really wants to show off the good stuff. He heads toward the two shopping centers. He is explaining how Hempstead is on an upswing after decades of decline. He drives past the new $22 million Long Island Rail Road station, next to the bus terminal. He points to the big retailers: Home Depot, Old Navy and Staples. Over there, he says proudly, is the Chuck E. Cheese. "I mean this is absolutely fabulous!" He notes that Costco and Lowe's are on their way.
"You ask me how I was able to get elected with three-to-one Democrats, and that's the story," he says. "The people who elected me say, 'Mr. Mayor, I don't care who you are. All I know is that Hempstead was going down the tubes and I could care less what you are in terms of party registration. All I know is that you brought home the bacon.' This town is flourishing."
Mr. Garner has gotten elected on the independent Unity Party line, which embraces various political factions in the predominantly black and Latino village. He says his constituents do not see him as a truly hard-line Republican. Even so, he is proud of his Republican roots, and he can go on and on! He says he has visited the White House about 10 times since George W. Bush got elected. "I love him. I really do." Mr. Garner is working to get Tom Ridge, the homeland security chief, to brief a group of mayors when they visit Hempstead later this month. "My fingers are crossed."
Before Mr. Garner became mayor, he was a village board trustee. But he's a businessman at heart. The son of sharecroppers from North Carolina, in 1976 he started an exterminating company out of the basement of his home. The company is now run by his son. His daughter is a health care administrator. In 1990, during his first mayoral term, Mr. Garner earned a bachelor's degree after studying business management and communications at Adelphi University.
He has been divorced for three years, but one senses he does not want to talk about this. He says he and his ex-wife have an amicable relationship. Is he seeing anyone? "Not really," he says, seeming a bit uncomfortable. 
So does he have political aspirations? A village Republican Party leader has said that Mr. Garner has potential in a future Congressional race. 
Asked about this, Mr. Garner is coy. He chuckles. "I'm just trying to build up history now," he says. "Everybody's got political aspirations. The bottom line is lawyers want to become judges. Preachers want to be bishops."
AND? "I'm not ruling it out," he replies. "I got aspirations. Yeah, I do."
But for now, Mr. Garner has aspirations for Hempstead. He wants the village to be legally converted to a city so that it can collect its local share of sales tax. He drives down a street lined with national auto dealerships. "Little Detroit," he calls it. "Look! It's all automobiles and if I could get some sales tax out of this, I could lower people's property tax, possibly. If we can collect some sales tax, oh my God, we'll be on our way." 
Garnerville. It has a ring to it. What does he think? He smiles widely. "You can call it whatever you want, as long as we get some sales tax out of it."

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Fell 0.3% In May, Commerce Dept. Reports 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories fell 0.3 percent in May, to $289.34 billion, according to a government report released yesterday. 
 The decrease matched April's decline and reflected fewer supplies of automobiles, machinery and electrical equipment, the Commerce Department said in Washington. 
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast a 0.2 percent increase in wholesale inventories for May.
May wholesale sales fell 0.5 percent after dropping 2.5 percent. Relative to sales, wholesale inventories remained at 1.24 months' supply and still close to a record-low 1.21 months' worth in March. Companies have been reluctant to fill their warehouses and shelves until demand improves. 
Inventories "are at rock bottom right now," said Astrid Adolfson, a senior economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York. "Until sales are on a firm footing, and there are signs that's going to extend beyond a one-month period, we won't see any significant buildup of inventories." 
Goods on shelves and in warehouses subtracted 0.82 percent from first-quarter growth of 1.4 percent, the latest Commerce Department figures showed. In each quarter last year, stockpiles contributed to economic growth. 
Wholesale inventories account for about a fourth of all business stockpiles. Retail and factory inventories make up the rest. Wholesale inventories are tied to imports because many foreign goods, like oil and cars, are stocked by distributors before being shipped to retailers. 
Inventories of durable goods, which include computers, hardware and lumber, fell 0.3 percent in May after falling 0.2 percent in April. Durable goods sales declined 0.4 percent after falling 0.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Fees and Trustees: Paying the Keepers of the Cash 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation is known for its generosity, giving tens of millions of dollars each year to Jewish organizations like Yeshiva University and the Hebrew Home for the Aged, as well as to places like Lincoln Center.
 The foundation is also generous to its five trustees, paying each of them, including two investment bankers, $175,000 in 2001, the latest year for which data is available. 
 The fees that the Goldsmith Foundation and others like it pay their trustees have moved into the spotlight as part of a vitriolic debate over a provision in a tax bill pending in the House of Representatives that would force the institutions to spend more of their assets each year on charity.
"Why should foundation trustees be paid to do charitable work when, with few exceptions, they are among the wealthiest and most highly paid professionals in America and when millions of Americans of all economic classes are paid nothing to sit on boards of nonprofit organizations?" asks Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for Study of Volunteer Organizations and Service at Georgetown University. 
All of the Goldsmith Foundation's trustees are related to Mr. Goldsmith, who died in 1980 after making a fortune on Wall Street. Two, Robert and Richard Menschel, are senior directors at Goldman, Sachs & Company who received more than $20 million in stock when the investment bank went public in 1999 and made millions in compensation before that.
Richard Menschel said that while he would work as a trustee for nothing, the fees Goldsmith paid were not excessive, given their record for increasing the assets and given that the foundation had no paid staff.
"You have to ask what is the overall cost of any other type of similar organization and what do they accomplish versus what we do, and that, I think, speaks for itself," Mr. Menschel said.
Under current law, foundations must spend at least 5 percent of their assets each year to maintain their tax-exempt status, but they may count some administrative expenses, like legal fees, rent and compensation, including trustee fees.
The pending legislation would require foundations to give the entire 5 percent to charity, forcing them to dip into other assets to pay trustees. That would increase their spending between four-tenths and eight-tenths of one percent, depending on their staffing, according to data from the Council on Foundations.
Foundation executives say the potential switch poses the biggest threat to their long-term existence since 1969, when Congress first made tax exemption contingent on their spending. They contend that raising the required "payout" would exhaust their assets, thereby violating some donors' intentions of establishing a foundation in perpetuity.
To save money, some foundation officials have said they would have to cut back on things like annual reports and other publications and auditing and oversight. 
There has been no mention, however, of cutting compensation for trustees and executives, which accounts for a bigger chunk of expenditures -- almost 16 percent of the average annual expenses foundations counted toward meeting the 5 percent target in the decade ending 1999, according to Internal Revenue Service data compiled by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.
Printing accounted for 2.6 percent of the expenses; accounting and legal expenses for 6.2 percent.
"I think it is a little odd for them to say they will reduce their expenditures on things like auditing and legal matters, which keep them in compliance with the law, given how minimal those expenses are in comparison with other expenses," said Rick Cohen, executive director of the committee, which has long pushed for higher foundation payouts.
Foundations executives defend the salaries they receive, saying they oversee the administration of billions of dollars. Trustees' roles are less clear, and thus the fees they receive have come under greater scrutiny.
"It's a little hard to say that under no circumstances should a foundation pay a trustee," said Peter Frumkin, an associate professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who is affiliated with the university's Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations. "Because in some cases trustees are doing the work of staff, although that's rare." Mr. Frumkin added, "I don't see the issue as black and white, but it's definitely shaded more toward it being better not to pay these fees than to pay them."
Foundations executives and trustees say trustees do not get enough credit for the work they do as stewards of charitable assets. They say foundation trustees seem to be more diligent about attending meetings than their corporate counterparts, and say they can spend hours reading to prepare for meetings and traveling to far-flung places to convene. 
Paul A. Allaire, the former chairman and chief executive of the Xerox Corporation who is chairman of the Ford Foundation, said Ford's trustees are asked to attend three two-day meetings a year and spend one week visiting a site or organization supported by Ford, in addition to whatever time they need to prepare. 
"I would say on average we expect our trustees to spend 15 to 20 days a year, a big portion of their lives, working on foundation activities," Mr. Allaire said in a telephone interview two weeks ago.
He received $26,850 as Ford's chairman in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2001, but said he would sit on the board for nothing. He is not paid as a board member of the New York City Ballet or Outward Bound USA.
Robert E. Campbell, who received $56,000 in 2001 as chairman of the $9 billion Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said foundation trustees had more onerous responsibilities as stewards for charitable assets than directors of nonprofit organizations like the ballet or Outward Bound, whose primary responsibility is fund-raising. "The boards of hospitals, universities and what have you, those are places where you are giving advice and counsel, but since they are generally institutions out there raising money instead of giving out grants, you are doing something completely different," he said.
Mr. Campbell also said he would do foundation work for nothing, but Juanita M. Kreps, an economist who was secretary of commerce in the Carter administration, said she would not serve on the board of the $6 billion Duke Endowment if she were not paid to do so.
"I don't think we're being overpaid," said Ms. Kreps, who along with 14 other trustees was paid $132,799.55 plus expenses in 2001. "We do a lot of work. We meet two full days 10 times a year in Charlotte, which isn't the easiest place to get to, and there's a good bit of correspondence to deal with in between."
Trustees of the Duke Endowment have no choice in whether they are paid. When the tobacco tycoon James B. Duke established the endowment, he stipulated that 3 percent of its investment income be divided evenly among them.
His daughter, Doris Duke, set even more generous terms for trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, although those were reduced as part of a settlement with the New York State attorney general.
So John J. Mack, who receives compensation valued in the tens of millions of dollars as chief executive of Credit Suisse First Boston, received $126,078 in 2001 as a trustee of Ms. Duke's foundation.
Mr. Mack refused to comment, but he is known for working long hours with no pay as a board member at two major hospitals in New York City and at other nonprofits. A spokeswoman for him said he gives the money he receives from the Duke Foundation to charity.
J. Paul Getty, the oil magnate, took a completely opposite approach, explicitly forbidding payments to trustees when he established the J. Paul Getty Trust in 1953. "The trust indenture is a remarkable document in that it has relatively few restrictions in general, but it does have that particular provision," said Peter C. Erichson, the trust's general counsel and secretary.
Toward the opposite end of the spectrum is the Goldsmith Foundation. 
New York law is vague on the issue of trustee fees, allowing "reasonable" compensation of board members, and James Slaughter, a Goldsmith trustee, said the level of compensation paid by the foundation to its trustees was approved by its legal and accounting advisers.
He noted that Mr. Goldsmith left $80 million to the foundation. Since then, it has given away more than $250 million, exceeding the 5 percent spending target every year of its existence.
"We have managed to increase the capital by more than 10 times, whereas today it is more than $800 million, so I would say the record is as good as anybody's and certainly better than most," Mr. Slaughter said.
He added, "That's all due to the trustees, who act as investment, administrative and program officers, which is different from other foundations our size that have paid staff."

HEADLINE: $9.6 Billion Plan Announced for Redesign of Los Angeles Airport to Thwart Terrorists 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 9 

 BODY:
In an effort to thwart terrorists, much of Los Angeles International Airport will be rebuilt at a cost of $9.6 billion under a plan that would ban all cars from the terminal areas.
 In effect, the plan will do away with pick-ups and drop-offs and force airline passengers to check in for their flights and board trains to their planes at a new facility a mile east of the terminals. 
 In that respect, the new plan, announced today by Mayor James K. Hahn, resembles emergency measures undertaken at the airport immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon, when the authorities here prohibited private traffic to the airfield for five weeks and moved passengers onto shuttle buses.
The plan, Mayor Hahn said, would increase the number of passengers passing through the airport each year by more than 20 million and would make the 75-year-old airport, commonly known as LAX, "the safest and most secure airport in America." It represents "new thinking in our post-9/11 environment," he said. 
During a news conference this morning, Mayor Hahn dismissed the conclusion of a RAND Corporation study that concentrating all passengers in the new check-in location, to be called the Ground Transportation Center, would actually increase the number of casualties in a terrorist attack.
One of the mayor's security consultants, John Hensley, said the plan "allows for concentric rings of security," beginning with the off-site structures.
"You have the ability to secure the inner core," Mr. Hensley said, referring to the passenger terminals.
If the Los Angeles City Council approves the plan, workers would begin construction in late 2004 and be finished around 2015. The reconstruction would be one of the largest public works projects in the United States, the mayor said, and would be paid for not by taxpayers' dollars but through a combination of bonds, grants, concession revenues, leases and increased landing fees.
The mayor's planners envisage demolishing three of the airport's nine antiquated terminals as well as all existing parking structures. A vast new passenger terminal would be built, as would a structure where rental car operations would be consolidated. The new buildings would be connected by a "people-mover" train, an amenity already in place at many other large airports.
"Modernization has escaped LAX," said Mr. Hahn, who pointed out that most of the current gates and terminals were designed in the 1960's, when the largest passenger aircraft in use was the Boeing 707. "It wasn't designed for the wingspan of a 747."
Mayor Hahn was careful to call the project a redesign of the airport and not an expansion, despite his proposal to build three large new structures. The Los Angeles airport, which currently serves about 56 million passengers a year, will serve no more than 78 million under the new plan, the mayor said, a concession to neighbors of the airport who were appalled by earlier proposals that called for handling as many as 98 million passengers a year.
Nevertheless, the plan has drawn fire from residents of adjoining communities like Playa del Rey and Westchester, who consider it an unnecessarily intrusive expansion of what is already the nation's fifth-busiest airport.
"Any time you make an improvement to an airport you open it up to expansion," said Roy Hefner, 75, who lives in Westchester one mile north of LAX's northernmost runway. "Mayor Hahn calls it a modernization -- it's a synonym for expansion."
Mr. Hefner, a retired schoolteacher who has served on the LAX Area Advisory Committee since it was founded in 1975, said it was pointless for the mayor to speak of capping the number of passengers at the airport, since only the Federal Aviation Administration has the power to address such matters.
Nevertheless, Mayor Hahn called the proposal "fair to the surrounding communities, who will have to bear with increased traffic."
The mayor acknowledged that the airport's neighbors "won't stand for it" if the growth of LAX is not kept in check. To that end, Mr. Hahn said he foresaw the evolution of the airfield in the context of a regional aviation plan calling for expansion of airports in cities well beyond Los Angeles, like Palmdale and Ontario, and the revival of a plan to turn a former El Toro Marine Corps base in Orange County into a commercial airport. Just last year, Orange County residents rejected such an airport at El Toro.
Here in Los Angeles, some people who were previously opposed to expanding LAX have been won over by Mr. Hahn's plan, which will be the subject of nine public hearings starting on Monday.
Mike Gordon, the mayor of El Segundo, south of the airport, said today that he had been mollified by assurances that his town would not suffer, despite his concern about a facet of the plan that calls for moving the southernmost runway closer to El Segundo to allow room for a new taxiway.

HEADLINE: Litigants in Housing Court Fear What State Fees Will Bring 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Albany did not, by all accounts, accomplish much this spring. But one of the things it did do, legislators now acknowledge, was make a major mistake.
 When legislators passed the state budget in May, they agreed to raise fees, or invent new ones, for cases being filed in State Supreme Court. But the legislation, intended to raise revenue, was written so vaguely -- and, legislators believe, hastily -- that the fees also apply to New York City Housing Court, the often chaotic last refuge of the city's poorest residents and working class. 
 Starting Monday, housing court plaintiffs and defendants alike -- two groups with limited financial resources who fight over life's basics such as adequate heat in winter and timely rent payments -- will be facing hundreds of dollars in additional costs, new hurdles that some fear will effectively bar them from access to the court.
For instance, it will cost a tenant or landlord $45 to file any and every motion in cases, when it used to cost nothing. The legislation, for the first time, also institutes a fee for actually settling a case.
The mix-up has set off a scramble to undo one of the few things Albany actually did. Leaders in both the Assembly and the Senate are pledging to introduce corrective legislation upon their return in September. At least two lawsuits are expected to be filed as soon as today, seeking an injunction against the fees' implementation.
The lawsuits, in a rare moment of agreement, are being supported by both landlord and tenant groups.
Not surprisingly, doubts abound.
"Even if everyone wants it to happen, will it really happen? I never rely on them to do anything," Judith Goldiner, a staff lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, said of state legislators.
Others had an even more sinister view of what happened in Albany.
"Either it was tremendous negligence or stupidity, or it was deliberate," said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a lawyer for many city tenants.
With its boisterous atmosphere of lawyers and tenants negotiating in crowded hallways or barking into cellphones, the housing court can be a desperately bewildering experience. While about 90 percent of the landlords have lawyers, perhaps only 15 percent of the tenants do. And because the hearings before the judges, who are among the most overworked in the system, are typically brief, litigants often have just a few minutes to summarize their predicaments.
Last year, New York had more than 374,000 housing court cases. In recent years, the number of evictions has gradually declined, but the orders to show cause -- legal motions that are typically filed by tenants seeking to buy more time to pay off back rent -- have jumped markedly, increasing by 39 percent between 1998 and 2002.
The introduction of new, and not widely known, fees, veterans of the court say, will add one more layer of confusion and, perhaps, despair.
The city's housing court is part of the civil court system, and is separate from the criminal system. But state law says that any fees imposed on the criminal system apply to civil courts, too.
And that is the law that legislators claim they were unaware of when they agreed, in the final budget deal, to increase the fees for State Supreme Court filings to help generate up to $50 million more for the state's coffers.
Toward the end of the session, both the Assembly and the Senate passed bills that would have exempted civil courts from the new fees. But, as with so many initiatives in Albany, the bills did not match. Now, there is talk in both the Senate and the Assembly of taking up the issue again in September.
"Obviously, there would be dramatic consequences if this takes effect," said Assemblywoman Helene E. Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat who heads the judiciary committee. "But I remain optimistic that there is at least the potential for a nonlegislative temporary solution to prevent this from even going forward."
One such recourse is a lawsuit. And two are expected to be filed before Monday on the grounds that the statute was too ambiguous and that the Legislature never intended it to apply to housing court: one by the firm of Borah, Goldstein, Altschuler, Schwartz & Nahins, on behalf of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents small landlords; and the other by the firm of Sokolski & Zekaria, which is representing landlords and tenants in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
"Housing court is an expensive, unfortunate part of the court system, and anything that adds to that is not beneficial," said Robert D. Goldstein of Borah Goldstein.
On Tuesday, several dozen lawyers representing landlords and tenants met with Fern A. Fisher, the administrative judge of the New York City Civil Court, which oversees the housing court. And there, according to Judge Fisher and several participants, lawyers expressed concerns about how the new legislation could give parties less incentive to negotiate, resulting in more trials and more delays.
And while the city's poorest tenants would likely be exempt from paying the new fees, there are more working-class and even upper-middle-class professionals who are ending up in housing court, largely because of the sour economy.
"There are union members who I represent who will be evicted because they don't have the $45 filing fee," said Bill Whalen, a supervising lawyer with District Council 37 of the Municipal Employees Legal Services.
For her part, Judge Fisher sounded sympathetic to those concerns, and the potential logistical nightmare involving people confused about the new rules. "It's very difficult to implement, and it will have an impact on the public," she said.
Through it all, many lawyers have been critical of what they say has been the noncommittal reaction from the Office of Court Administration, which oversees the entire court system and had strongly pushed for the new fee structure for the State Supreme Court. But David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said that such concerns had not been ignored.
"There is a concerted effort to address this issue, and toexplore various avenues on how to proceed," he said.
Still, some lawyers said they were not optimistic that any substantive changes would be forthcoming. After all, there are rough estimates that the new fees on housing court could net the state $10 million to $30 million a year.
"We don't really trust the people who are telling us this stuff anymore," Mr. Himmelstein, the tenants' lawyer, said, talking about both legislators in Albany and court officials. "Once the money starts flowing, in today's times, who's going to cut it off?"

HEADLINE: Here Comes the Bride. Again, and Again . . . 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
In a era when divorce and remarriage are commonplace, it might not be surprising for a city clerk to see some of the same names pop up on applications for marriage licenses from time to time.
 But it did strike the city clerk's office as highly unusual when it learned this year that one Manhattan woman had applied for 27 marriage licenses from 1984 to 2002 -- and that at least a dozen others had seemingly married in numbers that were highly suspicious. 
 These "career brides," as one city official called them, were not marrying for love, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office, which announced yesterday that four women had been arrested and two more were being sought on felony charges punishable by up to four years in prison. The authorities said they believed that the women had offered to marry illegal immigrants for a fee, usually about $1,000. Officials said the women who had applied for the licenses sometimes actually went through with marriage ceremonies, but sometimes they did not. 
A marriage would entitle the men to green cards and other benefits, including Social Security and unemployment insurance, prosecutors said. The men involved in the scheme came from various countries, including Pakistan, India, Peru, Ecuador, Nigeria and the Dominican Republic, according to court papers.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, began his investigation after the city clerk's office raised suspicions. He said he planned to give the information to the F.B.I.-N.Y.P.D. Joint Terrorist Task Force, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and various United States attorneys.
Officials said the possibilities for abuse are obvious and seemingly endless, given that municipal and county databases on marriage in New York State are not linked, nor are computerized records connected state to state.
"This opens the door to a lot of other fraud and expense for the U.S. taxpayer," Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference.
Victor L. Robles, the city clerk who reported the multiple marriages to Mr. Morgenthau in January, still seemed stunned by his findings. "I wanted to know how that's possible in the city of New York," he said yesterday in a telephone interview.
In order to marry in New York City, prospective brides and grooms must complete an affidavit that requires information about previous marriages. The application is then filed with the city clerk's office. Only once did any of the women arrested yesterday acknowledge a previous marriage on the application.
Mr. Robles, a former city councilman who took over the city clerk's office in 2001, said he was surprised when he heard about a woman who had filed for numerous marriage licenses within a short period of time.
He then learned that his office was doing only one-year computer searches on applicants.
"Somebody who got married this year could go to the Bronx next year and get married again," and not be detected, he said.
Mr. Robles also learned that records were not immediately shared among boroughs or counties.
"I said, 'From now on, every time we catch somebody, we'll forward it to the district attorney's office in the respective counties,' " he said.
Since taking office, Mr. Robles, who has 54 deputies in the five boroughs, has instituted a records search that goes back 10 years, and he is lobbying for all the state's marital records to be connected.
"I hope that this whole scandal will force the city and the state to link systems so that I can punch in a name and know if someone already applied for a license," he said.
This question remains: At what point does one who often says "I do" become suspicious? After three weddings? Five? Ten?
"We have to look very closely," Mr. Robles said, adding that he had hired a lawyer whose role it is to cross-check information on people with multiple marriages. The office also demands to see divorce decrees before issuing new marriage licenses, he said.
The women who were charged yesterday -- Dezerrie Cortes, 40, who had applied for 27 licenses; Maria Davis, 26; Monique Figueroa, 26; and Chera Larkins, 32 -- worked independently of each other, officials said, and had applied for licenses to marry a total of 43 men. The charges included perjury and offering false documents to officials. There was no pattern to the schemes or identifiable ringleader, prosecutors said.
None of the four women could be reached for comment yesterday.
Ms. Cortes is being held at Rikers Island in $25,000 bail. Ms. Davis was released on her own recognizance, and Ms. Figueroa was expected in Manhattan Criminal Court for arraignment last night. Officials said Ms. Larkins had been arrested, but they did not know her whereabouts.
Ms. Davis and Ms. Cortes live in the same Lexington Avenue apartment building, a high-rise near East 121st Street.
"She goes to work and takes her son to school every day -- mother kinds of things," a neighbor, Karen Williams, 29, said of Ms. Cortes.
In explaining how the prospective grooms found their brides, Dan Castleman, the chief of investigations in the Manhattan district attorney's office, said: "Oftentimes it was word of mouth in the neighborhood. Some of the women made it known they were available for a price."
Others used go-betweens to arrange unions, he said, adding that most who actually married after receiving the licenses never bothered to file for divorce before applying for new licenses.
In another case, an employee in the city clerk's office is being sought on accusations that he accepted a bribe to change a bride's name in the computer system. In that case, prosecutors said, the woman scheduled to appear at the clerk's office for a marriage ceremony did not show up, and the would-be groom wanted her name removed from the record so another woman could be substituted and the wedding could go on that day. 
Mr. Morgenthau said an investigation into about a dozen other repeat brides and their grooms was continuing. If the government finds that a green card application is based on a fraudulent marriage, the applicant could be immediately deported.
"We wanted to put a stop to this now," Mr. Morgenthau said. Later, he added, "But the investigation still has a ways to go."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
It's beginning to look as if the politicians in Washington need to take another look at economic policy.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
IT is time for Washington, including Democrats, to start reconsidering economic policy once again. Just when economists began telling us the clouds were lifting, the June unemployment rate jumped to a nine-year high of 6.4 percent. Despite a modestly rising gross domestic product, some 236,000 jobs have been lost in 2003 and 2.6 million since early 2001.
 Furthermore, we too often forget that if jobs are not created and wages do not start rising robustly, what little recovery there has been will peter out. 
 Many people criticized President Bush's "growth" policies -- mostly tax cuts on income and dividends weighted toward the well-off -- for providing too little bang for a buck's worth of stimulus. This seems ever truer.
But Democrats have not done much better. Their rallying cry has generally been to favor tax reduction, just not as much. 
There are better alternatives. One is to concentrate government stimulus in areas that produce a high number of well-paying jobs. These include capital spending and many federal and state programs, from education and health care to transportation infrastructure. 
By contrast, consumer spending in general is less likely to create as many good jobs. Thus, stimulating consumption through individual tax cuts is not the best tonic for these times. 
Before we consider this further, we should clear away some misconceptions. Many argue that times are not bad, or the turn is just around the corner. But the economy has been losing jobs for a longer period than in any other recession since World War II.
And the 6.4 percent rate understates the severity of the problem because many more people have dropped out of the labor force. A historically more accurate estimate is 7 to 7.5 percent. 
Moreover, the average number of weeks the unemployed cannot find a job is higher than at any time since 1983, in the aftermath of the worst postwar recession. And few economists believe that the economy will grow fast enough to add jobs in the next two years.
Finally, the unemployment rate does not merely mean that two or three million more Americans are suffering without jobs. It is an indicator of weakness throughout the labor market. There are fewer promotions or raises, there are fewer benefits, and there is rising insecurity. 
Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute points out that average weekly earnings are growing slowly again, if at all. In the first quarter, they were down after inflation. In the second quarter, they were certainly weak again. 
The president seems determined to stick to his poorly designed programs, but one would think this would be an opportunity for potential Democratic challengers to come up with fresh ideas. So far, there is silence. 
James Medoff, a Harvard University economist, has explored the job-creating benefits of different categories of spending. His main research, sponsored by the Center for National Policy, and based on the Commerce Department's input-output analysis, was done in the early 1990's. But he has completed a partial updating and says the conclusions still apply today. 
Mr. Medoff created a measure that included the number of jobs produced by a dollar of spending and the level of pay and benefits those jobs provided. Combining the two resulted in a labor market "score." He then examined how highly capital investment, consumption and various government spending programs scored -- that is, added good jobs to the economy. 
Private investment in durable goods did especially well, Mr. Medoff found, creating a reasonable number of jobs on average but ones that pay especially well. Thus, more capital investment is an excellent way to create good jobs. 
But the nation's spending on education programs did even better. It created many more jobs per dollar spent, and they paid fairly well, if not as well as jobs derived from capital spending. Government health care spending also produced many well-paying jobs. Other government spending programs conducive to good job growth were for highways, water and air facilities, and police and firefighters. Military spending also added good jobs, but not at an equivalent rate. 
The weakest job-creating spending on average was consumption itself, which is exactly what is driving the economy today. Tax cuts of both Democrats and Republicans are intended to stimulate just that. But such spending may well not create an adequate number of jobs, partly because so much leaks to imports. 
Mr. Medoff updated the study to find out what the quality of jobs has been in the current administration. He finds that the score, combining number of jobs with quality, has declined almost as rapidly in this administration as it did in the first Bush administration. On average, over the course of the Clinton administration, the score rose. 
The lack of job creation for so long has been a mystery. To many, it suggests business is simply more productive. But most models link rising productivity to growing capital investment, and capital investment has been sinking for three years. More likely, business is cutting back on labor aggressively to maintain profit margins. Rising measures of productivity are truly meaningful when both efficiency and the number of jobs are growing simultaneously.
A sensible new economic program, therefore, would reject individual tax cuts and emphasize government spending that creates jobs. This could include adequate transfer of money to the states -- as much as $100 billion. It could also include seriously financing the president's new education bill, which has been neglected; a drug prescription plan for Medicare that is more generous than what Congress is considering; new ideas about providing health insurance to those who have none; and innovative investment in transportation infrastructure. 
Capital spending is usually harder to stimulate directly, although generous new depreciation allowances have already been created.
Given the disturbing state of the economy, a jobs program is what the nation now needs. It might even be just what the electorate wants to hear.

HEADLINE: Democrats Design Agenda in Bid to Hold Hispanic Support 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9 

 BODY:
Moving to protect their political advantage with Hispanic voters against aggressive Republican encroachment, Congressional Democrats are preparing to showcase a policy agenda aimed directly at this increasingly sought-after bloc.
 Developed with Hispanic lawmakers and to be made public on Thursday, the platform promises Democratic backing for a variety of initiatives on civil rights, the economy, education, health care and immigration. Party leaders say they hope it helps solidify support among what is now the nation's largest minority. They plan to contrast the party's stand with what they describe as a failure by the Bush administration to follow through on commitments to Hispanics. 
 "Democrats have a different vision for America's future, one that reflects time-tested American values and the voices of the hard-working majority of Hispanic-Americans, not just the elite few," a draft of the policy agenda stated.
The Democratic push comes as Republicans, led by President Bush, are seeking to cut into Democratic strength among Hispanics. Just today, the White House and top Hispanic groups announced a partnership to improve educational opportunities. Senate Republicans have also sought to use a fight over a Hispanic judicial nominee to undermine Democrats. 
"This is a universe of voters that the Republican Party has long recognized as extremely important," Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said, "and we as a party have been aggressively reaching out to Hispanic voters."
But Democrats said Republicans could be thwarted by high unemployment among Hispanics as well as the disappointment reflected in some polls that the Bush administration had not met Hispanic expectations for better ties with Latin America and eased immigration.
Officials who worked on the Democrats' agenda acknowledged that it did not represent a significant number of new proposals. Its importance lies, they said, in its thematic approach, tying together ideas, for example, on small business aid, work force language training, government-provided health coverage and providing money that has not been forthcoming for promised education programs.
"What is important here is pulling programs together in a comprehensive fashion and showing the Hispanic community we are with them on the issues they care most about," a senior Democratic aide involved in developing the agenda said. A group of Democratic senators were briefed today on recent poll findings that show both opportunities and risks for Democrats when it comes to Hispanic voters.
"Democrats can no longer consider the Hispanic electorate as a base vote," Maria T. Cardona, director of the Hispanic Project at the New Democrat Network, said.
The network helped the party create the agenda, and it financed the poll of 800 Hispanic voters conducted May 27 through June 3, with almost half the interviews conducted in Spanish.
"They are increasingly looking at the Republican Party as an option," Ms. Cardona said.
The survey findings and other data assembled by the New Democrat Network reflect that. In a hypothetical 2002 presidential matchup performed by the group, President Bush -- who won 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2000 -- was at 44 percent among Hispanic voters. The president's brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, whose wife is a Mexican native, won the Hispanic vote outright in the governor's race last year, even among Hispanics outside South Florida's generally conservative Cuban-Americans.
But the recent poll found that the president's support among Hispanics was slipping, with his approval rating declining and his showing in another presidential matchup dropping to 34 percent while support for a Democrat was at 48 percent. Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed said they felt that the president had not kept a vow to make Latin America a foreign policy priority. 
The poll also found that the Senate fight over a judicial nominee, Miguel Estrada, was not resonating with Hispanics although a future fight over a Supreme Court vacancy could be a different story.
"We need to see this as a huge opportunity to really take advantage to start reaching out early and often and not treating Hispanic voters as an afterthought as has happened in the past," Ms. Cardona said of the survey results.
Republican officials said they saw the agenda as politically motivated by anxious Democrats.
"They see eroding support among the Latino community, and this is their wake-up call," Sharon Castillo, who oversees Hispanic outreach at the Republican National Committee, said. "Is it going to help? No. For too long, they have taken the Hispanic community for granted." 
Ms. Castillo attributed her party's gains to the president's personal involvement with Hispanic issues and disputed the notion that he had not followed through on his promises about Latin America. She pointed to a free trade agreement with Chile and continuing talks about immigration changes.
But the agenda, which will be announced by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, along with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, states otherwise.
"Beyond photo ops and political rhetoric," it says, "Republicans have done little or nothing to advance Hispanic priorities."

HEADLINE: Europe Tiff: What's Next? Food Fight? 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 9 

 BODY:
No sooner did Italy and Germany extricate themselves from the diplomatic imbroglio of last week than they got into another one today, with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder reacting to an Italian official's insulting remarks about German tourists by imposing an unusual sanction: he canceled his vacation in Italy.
 Mr. Schroder seemed to be bowing to German public opinion, aroused this time by some inexplicably tactless comments by an Italian under secretary responsible for tourism, Stefano Stefani, who characterized the eight million German tourists who visit each year as beer-swilling, chauvinistic boors who, come summer, "invaded the beaches of Italy." 
 This latest fracas began on Friday when Mr. Stefani, who is a member of the small nationalist Northern League, wrote in a letter to his party's newspaper, La Padania, "We know the Germans well, those stereotyped blonds with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost." 
Apparently angry over the argument last week over comments by Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, that likened a German deputy in the European Parliament to a functionary in a Nazi concentration camp, Mr. Stefani called Germany a "country intoxicated with arrogant certainties." While they like to vacation in Italy, he said, the Germans also like to deal in anti-Italian stereotypes. 
The newspaper Bild, Mr. Stefani continued, referring to Bild Zeitung, Germany's largest mass-circulation tabloid, "doesn't forget to lie about the number of car thefts in Rimini, or even the last statistics from Mafia killings in Sicily." 
In more normal times and between countries like Italy and Germany that generally do not look for trouble, the remarks probably would not have become an urgent matter worthy of the attention of the most senior German officials, but as the new squabble indicates, these are not normal times for Italy and Germany. 
The two nations were on opposite sides in the debates over war against Iraq, with Mr. Schroder a leading European opponent of American policy and Mr. Berlusconi in favor of it. Then came Mr. Berlusconi's remarks last week, which did not go over well in Europe in general but went over extremely badly in Germany.
Today, Mr. Stefani refused to take back anything he had said, and Mr. Berlusconi, who did not follow the advice of at least two German cabinet ministers to fire Mr. Stefani, also showed no particular regret over the latest incident. Asked by Italian reporters for his reaction to Mr. Schroder's cancellation, Mr. Berlusconi replied, "I'm sorry for him."
This latest quarrel seems worse than tactless; the words have become ridiculous. It is the sort of ridiculousness that could now have a serious effect on the ability of the European Union, of which Germany and Italy are both charter members, to move forward with the goal of political integration.
Demonstrating that one insult leads to another, Mr. Stefani attacked Der Spiegel, the newsmagazine, for putting an unflattering portrait of Mr. Berlusconi on its cover last week (before the incident in the European Parliament) with the caption, "The Godfather." 
The message was "self-evident," Mr. Stefani said. It was that "Berlusconi is a mob boss, and thus Mafia Italy is composed of Mafia electors who have accepted living with the Mafia. The Mafia is synonymous with death and suffering." 
Finally, Mr. Stefani had these choice words about Martin Schulz, the German deputy who had criticized Mr. Berlusconi and was then excoriated by him. "This Schulz," Mr. Stefani wrote, "probably grew up taking part in noisy burping contests, after drinking gigantic amounts of beer and gorging himself on fried potatoes." 
The truth is that Mr. Stefani was probably giving voice to some widespread feelings in Italy about Germans and German tourists, especially after the exchange of insults in the European Parliament last week. But even if some Germans do drink a lot of beer and do take up a lot of the space on Italian beaches in the summer, his comments were not of the sort that cabinet-level government ministers in civilized Europe are supposed to make. 
As word of them spread in Germany, resentment mounted. The headline in Bild this morning read, "Stand firm, Chancellor, Nix Bella Italia," and quick polls showed 80 percent of the German public believing that Mr. Schroder, who often vacations in Italy, was right to cancel his vacation there this year.
The German interior minister, Otto Schily, who, like other members of Mr. Schroder's cabinet, often vacations in Italy, said, referring obviously to Mr. Stefani, "If I were the Italian head of government, that man would no longer be in office." 
"Those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country," Mr. Schily said.
Feasting on the incident, Bild today quoted a second senior member of Mr. Schroder's cabinet, Economics Minister Wolfgang Clement, saying of Mr. Stefani, "He should be taken out of circulation."
Mr. Schroder himself, who has spent his summer vacation in Italy twice in the last three years, at first declined, through his spokesman, to say whether he would cancel his vacation plans, though the spokesman, Bela Anda, called Mr. Stefani's comments "a blanket insult to all Germans who like to holiday in Italy." 
In similar fashion last week after the exchange in the European Parliament, Mr. Schroder spoke with Mr. Berlusconi on the phone, saying afterward that Mr. Berlusconi expressed regret for what he had said and that he, Mr. Schroder, considered the matter to be closed.
But at the end of the afternoon today, Mr. Anda said Mr. Schroder would not be vacationing in Italy this year. 
"Further speculation" about his vacation plans, as Mr. Anda delicately put it, would "compromise the necessary relaxation and an undisturbed family time," adding, "Therefore the family will spend their vacation at home in Hanover."
One effect of the commotion today could directly affect the Italian economy. German tourists last year accounted for 40 percent of all visitors to Italy and spent about $10 billion, according to The Financial Times. 
Reflecting the loss of revenue if Germans stopped going to Italy, Palmiro Ucchielli, president of Pesaro Province on the Adriatic, where Mr. Schroder was supposed to take his vacation, demanded financial damages from Mr. Berlusconi because of the chancellor's cancellation.
"The stupidity of the people who are leading the government is so great that they are causing powerful economic damage to our image as a tourist destination," he said.

HEADLINE: A Troubled Occupation in Iraq 

 BODY:
He may be deposed but he remains a haunting presence. From a hiding place, Saddam Hussein has issued defiant words and vowed resistance, saying that "jihad cells and brigades have been formed." Earlier, President Bush, displaying misplaced bravado, issued his own challenge to Mr. Hussein's supporters: "Bring them on." 
 We would have hoped that more than two months after the end of the war in Iraq, the situation would be neither this confrontational nor this dangerous. With almost daily reports of American fatalities in Iraq, the need for turning around a badly deteriorating situation seems urgent. 
 Despite some limited gains under Washington's chief civilian administrator, Paul Bremer III, exasperated Iraqis are increasingly blaming occupation forces for the excruciatingly slow progress in restoring vital services, rebuilding the economy and returning governmental and police power to Iraqi hands. It is not enough for President Bush to claim that America has adequate forces on the ground to repel any Iraqi challenge. What is needed is a realistic and workable recovery plan. The administration also needs to level with the American people, acknowledging that stabilizing and reviving Iraq will take many more months and could cost many more American casualties. 
One badly needed change in Iraq is faster, more visible progress toward self-government. Mr. Bremer should be doing more to extricate Americans from the cross-fire of Iraqi discontent. Beginning serious work on a new national constitution could ease the fears, now common among the majority Shiites as well as the minority Sunnis and Kurds, of being unfairly shut out of power by Iraqi rivals or foreign occupiers. On Monday, after numerous false starts, plans were announced for leading Iraqi politicians to join an interim government later this month. It remains far from clear how this arrangement will function and how much real authority Mr. Bremer will allow these Iraqi figures to exercise.
There also needs to be a more systematic effort to extricate American and British soldiers from the deadly cross-fire of the streets. That will require recruiting and training larger, more capable Iraqi police and security forces. Washington and London have rightly been wary of turning over the streets to unreformed Baathist police officers or sectarian Shiite militias. But American and British combat troops are neither trained nor suited for crowd control and policing duties.
The pressure on American and British troops can also be eased by bringing in significant peacekeeping forces from other countries, including many not involved in the war. That will be accomplished more easily once Washington embraces a more substantial role for the United Nations. With broader U.N. involvement, American and British troops will seem less like foreign conquerors and occupiers.
Finally, Saddam Hussein must be found. Mr. Bremer was right to offer a $25 million reward for his capture. Until Mr. Hussein is in custody, Iraqis will live with the fear of his return to power. 
Having declared that America's security depended on regime change in Iraq, Mr. Bush must now see the job through to a successful conclusion. It can be done, and most Iraqis seem eager for it. The key is not to lose the willingness of the public, either American or Iraqi, to see this through.

HEADLINE: Bush Pushes South African in Fighting AIDS 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, July 9 

 BODY:
President Bush today brought the promise of more money for fighting AIDS to South Africa, which has been slow to attack the disease, and he pressed President Thabo Mbeki to deal with the epidemic more effectively.
 On the second day of his five-day trip to Africa, Mr. Bush urged the South African leader, who has expressed doubt about the link between HIV and AIDS and raised questions about the effectiveness of the drug treatment that has become standard, to come up with a plan that includes both the drug regimen and prevention efforts. 
 AIDS was one of two issues in which the two leaders stepped gingerly around each other during a morning of meetings here. The other was the future of Zimbabwe, which is becoming unstable under President Robert Mugabe. 
South Africa has 4.7 million people with H.I.V., one of the largest infected populations in the world, but Mr. Mbeki's government has not yet made life-prolonging antiretroviral drugs widely available. Advocacy groups have long demanded that Mr. Mbeki drop what they consider to be his incomprehensible reluctance to deal aggressively with the problem.
White House officials played down the differences between Mr. Bush and Mr. Mbeki on AIDS. But they made clear that the United States would use the leverage of its offer to include South Africa in the first round of countries to benefit from the $15 billion AIDS-fighting package Mr. Bush proposed in January to prod Mr. Mbeki to move faster to bring all available weapons to bear.
"We need a common-sense strategy to make sure that the money is well spent," Mr. Bush said at a news conference with Mr. Mbeki. "And the definition of well spent means lives are saved, which means good treatment programs, good prevention programs, good programs to develop health infrastructures in remote parts of different countries so that we can actually get antiretroviral drugs to those who need help."
On Zimbabwe, the Bush administration has called for a change of government, and with Mr. Mugabe turning increasingly autocratic, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell urged South Africa last month to use its influence to bring about a resolution of the issue. But Mr. Mbeki, who has longstanding ties to Mr. Mugabe, and like him fought for years against white rule, has stuck to his position that the best approach is quiet, gradual diplomacy, and has expressed annoyance at Mr. Powell for pressuring him.
At their news conference today, Mr. Bush and Mr. Mbeki said they shared the same aim of restoring stability to Zimbabwe. "President Bush and myself are absolutely of one mind about the urgent need to address the political and economic challenges of Zimbabwe," Mr. Mbeki said. "It's necessary to resolve this matter as quickly as possible."
Mr. Bush said he did not have "any intention of second-guessing" Mr. Mbeki's approach, but he also signaled that the United States would continue to use diplomatic pressure to keep Zimbabwe from an economic collapse or civil war.
"I think it's important for the United States, whether it be me or my secretary of state, to speak out when we see a situation where somebody's freedoms have been taken away from them and they're suffering," Mr. Bush said. "And that's what we're going to continue to do."
A senior administration official later told reporters that "what the presidents talked about is how their two approaches can be complementary."
The official added, "We think everyone needs to do more."
Mr. Bush briefed Mr. Mbeki on his plans for the United States to play a role in efforts to bring peace to Liberia, but again stressed that he had made no decision to commit American troops to any peacekeeping force.
In a signal that he expects West African nations to take the lead in sending peacekeepers to Liberia, and that the United States might prefer to limit its involvement to technical and training support, Mr. Bush said he would "reinvigorate the strategy of helping people help themselves by providing training opportunities."
He said the United States had already trained peacekeeping forces from Nigeria and Senegal. This evening, officials from the Economic Community of West African States, the umbrella group for governments in the region, said they would send 1,000 troops to Liberia.
Mr. Bush also visited a Ford Motor Company factory and had dinner at the residence of the United States Ambassador, Cameron Hume. In both events, he promoted closer economic ties between the United States and Africa, especially through trade.
Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Bush said they welcomed the deepening ties between their countries since the end of apartheid nearly a decade ago, and Mr. Bush stayed at lunch with his host for 50 minutes beyond the scheduled time, a rarity for the ever-punctual president.
But there have been strains between the countries beyond the issues of AIDS and Zimbabwe, most notably over South Africa's opposition to Mr. Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq without the backing of the United Nations. Mr. Mbeki's predecessor, Nelson Mandela, a harsh critic of the war, is out of the country and will not be meeting with Mr. Bush.
Although they were kept far from Mr. Bush, about 1,000 people gathered in a park near the United States embassy here to protest the president's visit, chanting, "Down Bush!" and "Africa is not for sale!"
"We don't want George Bush here," said Liza Xhosa, who is 35 and lives in an informal settlement in Soweto with no electricity or running water. She marched under the banner of the Landless People's Movement, which advocates for the distribution of land to poor people. "Mbeki should not see Bush. Mandela does not like Bush, so why does Mbeki invite him? He should give us land and jobs instead of meeting with imperialists."
Mr. Bush's lone opportunity to meet with South Africans outside of government officials and invited dignitaries was his trip to the Ford plant, where he told workers that he wanted to hear more about how Ford is encouraging efforts to fight AIDS.
He talked about his AIDS proposal, but did not mention that a House subcommittee is likely to cut funds for the first year of the $15 billion, three-year program below the $3 billion sought by legislation Mr. Bush signed this spring. The program would provide help to 14 countries, 12 of them in Africa.
Administration officials said they were optimistic about progress on AIDS in South Africa.
"What we believe is that the South African government, under the leadership of President Mbeki, clearly understands the needs for ARV's," said a senior administration official traveling with Mr. Bush, using an acronym to refer to antiretroviral drugs.
Groups advocating more effort to tackle AIDS said they welcomed Mr. Bush's attempt to engage Mr. Mbeki in the program. But they said Mr. Bush had missed an opportunity by not making a more direct public statement of the need for Mr. Mbeki to change his approach.
"There's no evidence that President Bush's visit advanced the South African government's thinking," said Mark Heywood, national secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign, a group pushing Mr. Mbeki to do more to battle AIDS. "We're still stuck with a government policy that is at odds with medical thinking universally."

Nike to Acquire Converse, Merging 2 Footwear Giants
Nike, known for its shoes and its swoosh, has Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods on its corporate team. Now it is lining up yet another sports star. For $305 million, Nike is buying Converse, a century-old footwear company and maker of the celebrated "Chuck Taylor All-Star" shoe.
 The deal brings together one of the oldest names in athletic footwear with perhaps the world's most famous sports shoe brand. It also opens a chapter for the financially troubled Converse, which dominated the athletic footwear business for decades before stumbling into bankruptcy in the early 1990's. Page C2.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Payton Takes Less To Join The Lakers

BYLINE:  By STEVE POPPER

 BODY:
This is a tale of a player who passes up millions of dollars to pursue a championship. It is the story of an agent who insists that his client's happiness is more important than money. And in a league in which the cash register can spin like a slot machine, those ambitions may just decide the next N.B.A. championship. 
 While headlines on the free-agent market are usually accompanied by big salaries, Gary Payton made headlines this week by stating his intention to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, the date when free agents can sign, for a deal starting at $4.9 million a year. 
 That figure is the midlevel exception, a loophole that allows teams over the salary cap to add a player -- usually a middle-of-the-road player.
 Payton, a seven-time All-Star who won two Olympic gold medals, passed up the chance to go to the highest bidder and instead opted for the lesser pay from the Lakers. Payton, who will turn 35 later this month, will team with Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and either Karl Malone or the next power forward in line to sign on for even less money. 
 "I think it sends a message to the league that players want to play basketball at the end of the day," Payton's agent, Aaron Goodwin, said. "It is a business. You are a small corporation with a window of time you have to go out and get top dollar. But there are times you have to go out and achieve your goals. One of Gary's is to win a championship. If he can do it, this might trigger other players to think this way."
 Payton has spent almost his entire 13-year career in Seattle and made it to the finals once, in 1996, when the SuperSonics lost to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. He was sent to Milwaukee at the trading deadline this season, but Payton was concerned because the Bucks were for sale until recently. 
 Payton then chose the chance to push the Lakers, who won three consecutive titles before being eliminated this year, back to the top.
 Lakers Coach Phil Jackson could have a team that resembles a wing of the Basketball Hall of Fame, but there are egos to stroke and shots to find for those players. Jackson won six titles in Chicago with Jordan, Scottie Pippen and a cast of role players, not this sort of assemblage of star power.
 "If at the end of the day, Gary achieves his goal, I achieve mine," Goodwin said. "That's all I want. I've been with Gary 12 years and made more than my share of money. This is about more than money.
 "I can tell you quite honestly, Shaquille O'Neal contacted me and Gary in the summer -- I've known him a long time -- and told me he'd break my neck if I don't get Gary to the Lakers. I told Gary I need my neck. Really, the entire summer the focus has been on the Lakers. Obviously, he looked at other opportunities, but his heart was set on the Lakers from Day 1."
 Can the players on this sort of roster coexist? "It depends on the character and chemistry of the team involved," said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks' owner, who has a roster filled with starters and stars filling reduced roles. "There is no boilerplate, and no, more stars doesn't necessarily equal more success."
 Cuban said he thought that the league's balance of power was shifting to teams willing to pay the luxury tax for being over the salary cap.
 "I think the Spurs were the last time we will see a non-luxury tax champ for a while," he said in an e-mail message. "In a law of unintended consequences way, the tax is a threshold that proves to players the team is willing to lose money to win. If a team is willing to pay two times to improve, then the player may be willing to lose a little as well since they are on the same side of the profit and loss statement."
 Payton made himself the first believer in this new economy. Now Malone may be next. 
 "Right now, he hasn't decided," said Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, But he added of Payton's decision, "It definitely makes it more interesting than before."
 If Malone does not take the Lakers' remaining $1.5 million exception, Goodwin said, "there are going to be two or three power forwards waiting for that spot."

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
The Changing South Finds Its Way on I-85

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
IT begins quietly enough in the piney woods of southern Virginia. At Petersburg, I-85 diverges from I-95, the main drag of the East Coast, and heads diagonally across Dixie for the next 600 or so miles, passing through North Carolina and Georgia, before petering out in Montgomery, Ala. Many call it the Main Street of the New South, and in its curves are written the broad stories of economic and social change, along with the attendant, if smaller, personal dramas.
 "I-85 is the lifeblood of the economy here," said Ron Patton, director of planning for the South Carolina Department of Transportation. "It's played a tremendous role in the evolution of industry, from textiles 30 years ago to automobiles and high tech today." 
 In North Carolina, I-85 skirts the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill high-tech triangle, with its many universities and labs, before running west toward Greensboro and then rolling past the onetime towel capital, Kannapolis, associated with the Cannon company. In Atlanta, I-85 turns into the teeming Northeast Expressway, and sprouts the perimeter highway I-285. In downtown Montgomery, it crosses Jeff Davis Avenue and Rosa Parks Avenue, before ending in a cloverleaf at I-65. 
In many ways, I-85 offers a textbook study in what J. B. Jackson, founder of Landscape magazine, called odology -- the study of roads and their cultural, economic and spiritual meanings. One of the few established principles of this infant discipline is that roads take their character from a few landmarks or vistas. And what travelers on I-85 probably remember most is not the freeways, traffic tie-ups or glass towers of Charlotte or Atlanta but a strange structure located near the interstate's midpoint: the Peachoid, a 135-foot-tall water tank shaped like a ripe peach and plunked alongside the interstate as it passes through Gaffney, S.C. 
No one is quite sure who came up with the name Peachoid, but it stuck, perhaps because of the tower's vaguely alien personality. Seen above the trees, it can look like a hovering extraterrestrial spaceship. From other angles, at other times, it can look like a sun rising above the mobile-home dealer on the frontage road or a fat, full moon too heavy to make it above the horizon. 
With a seven-ton, 60-foot leaf and a 12-foot stem that also functions as an air vent, the Peachoid was painted by Peter Freudenberg with 50 gallons of paint in 20 colors, all painstakingly applied from the bucket of a cherry-picker. When it was completed in 1981, the Peachoid put Gaffney on the map. 
It is celebrated in the names of local businesses, including the Chevrolet dealer and a lumberyard, and reproduced on postcards, pins, patches and wooden models. It is the symbol for the South Carolina Peach Festival, running this week through July 25, with a demolition derby, a Kenny Rogers concert, a parade and a truck pull. 
Jack Millwood is a former undertaker and insurance agent who was chairman of the public works department, the agency that conceived the giant peach, in the 1970's. Mr. Millwood was born in Gaffney in 1924, and he has seen the changes I-85 has brought to the town. Before the interstate, which was built in many increments during the early 1960's, he said: "We were the poor Old South. There was nothing but textiles, and that was dying." 
Like other interstates in the South, I-85 drew industry from Europe and Japan. The I-85corridor has been one of the nation's leading beneficiaries of direct foreign investment over the last decade and a half, much of it from German companies. In South Carolina, some 200 auto suppliers have invested $11 billion since 1986, a pattern echoed on interstates across the South. (In the Carolinas, the road is known as the Autobahn, thanks to the number of German automobile companies along its edges.) A key moment for South Carolina came in 1992, when BMW began construction of its plant in Greer. Along with its suppliers of seats, tires, metal parts and the like, BMW has pumped about $4 billion into the region. To assure dependable "just in time" production, BMW suppliers are required to locate within three miles of I-85. 
"BMW: Bubba Makes Wheels" reads a popular local T-shirt. Driving past Exit 60, you can see the undulating form of the Zentrum museum -- zentrum means center in German -- filled with vintage and racing BMWs, built to lure travelers from the road.
Though the interstate offered business the way in, the attraction was low wages -- in South Carolina, they are 15 to 20 percent lower than the national average -- and the absence of unions. Later, states eager to lure industry sweetened the pot with tax breaks and training incentives. 
As the carmakers flourished, the local agricultural businesses -- most notably, the peach farmers -- began to wane. 
While South Carolina is second only to California in peach production, the land devoted to peaches in South Carolina has shrunk to about 17,000 acres from about 42,000 over the last 15 years, said Martin Eubanks, who follows the crop as a commodities merchandiser with the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. 
"Most of that is due to urban encroachment and industry," Mr. Eubanks said, the sort of development by I-85. 
Industrial growth has led to the closing of many packing plants, Mr. Eubanks said, and as a result, South Carolina growers cannot assemble the volumes of fruit that groceries demand. The peach crop contributes $50 million to the state's economy, according to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. Many growers near Gaffney have turned almost entirely to roadside sales.
On a June morning at Jolley's Peaches, in a small, temporary building just off Exit 92, Martha Jolley had arranged peaches in bags and baskets, and jars of peach preserves and peach cider in what looked like old-fashioned whiskey bottles. 
"My brother-in-law Donny grows the peaches," Ms. Jolley said. "We opened June 6, but the good ones don't really come in till later in July." 
Down the road, the Sunny Slopes fruit stand at Exit 90 is the flagship store of the largest and best-known peach grower in Cherokee County. It is owned by the Caggiano family, who have been growing peaches here since 1928, but on less and less land. 
"We sold the orchards to the mall," said Mia Caggiano, who was working the register at Sunny Slopes the other day. She was referring to the Prime Outlet Mall, just a few hundred feet away, where discount Mikasa china and Polo shirts vie for the traveler's dollar with the Garnet Beauties and DixiReds in Ms. Caggiano's basket. 
Despite the peach farmer's fading fortunes -- or perhaps because of them -- the Peachoid endures, a folk art symbol of the changing South. Such roadside structures are part of a deep-seated Southern tradition, said William Ferris, a professor of history at the Center for the Study of the American South at the University of North Carolina. "Virtually every fruit and vegetable grown has its own festival here," Dr. Ferris said. "Theyrecall the medicine and minstrel shows of the past."
For all the development, the rural landscape survives. Take Exit 92 and a few feet from the Peachoid the road plunges into a wilderness of kudzu and mimosas where mockingbirds perch. Here I-85 connects with the Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway -- South Carolina Highway 11 -- which unfolds at a more leisurely pace, past mountains and lakes in a great loop, rejoining 85 near the Georgia line. 
A few miles up the road is the Cowpens battlefield historical site, a monument to the independent, ornery spirit of the upcountry people. During the Revolutionary War, this area was known as the Hornet's Nest for its stinging resistance to the British. Now it is a quiet open field, crossed by the old gravel track of the Green River Road. 
William Dunlap is a painter who includes the interstates in his work and regularly drives I-85 for inspiration. "It's all about mood and time of day," he said. "I'll see something in the rearview mirror and stop and take a photo I'll use for a painting." 
As a young man in the 1960's, Mr. Dunlap spent his summers on road crews, building the Southern interstates. "My job was to lay string ahead of the machines, and I was always wading into swamps and ponds," Mr. Dunlap said. "No one then could have begun to imagine there would ever be German and Japanese auto factories on them." 
Today the interstate brings steady commerce: minivans, R.V.'s, a church bus with the word "Heaven" in the destination window. But above all it carries the trucks, like those in the parking lot at Norma's I-85 Cafe, near Blacksburg, S.C. The 18-wheelers sit with their engines running, radiating waves of heat, while inside the drivers indulge in Norma's specialty, the bologna burger. Norma Watterson, who moved here in 1960 from Bessemer City, Ala., when I-85 was not yet finished, tells each customer, "You come back now."
In Atlanta and Charlotte, I-85 has long since turned into an expressway as grim as any in the country. In Charlotte, work is underway to widen the highway -- to eight lanes in places -- and equip it with traffic sensors, video cameras and "smart signs" to update drivers. The project has its own Web site, www.I85widening.com, which contrasts images of the road today with the road to come. Click the mouse and a green median and grove of trees vanish, replaced by three more lanes of concrete. It's a lot of road. 
And yet, it's the Peachoid that still tells the story. A few years ago Mr. Millwood found himself on a British Airways flight to the Middle East. When he happened to tell the flight attendant he was from Gaffney, her face lit up. 
"Oh, of course," she said. "The Big Peach! Interstate 85!"

Rembrandt, Face to Face
 How to spend $11 million before breakfast? Ask Stephen A. Wynn. Mr. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner and collector, set his alarm for 2 a.m. yesterday, sneaked into the bathroom so he wouldn't wake his wife, and bid by telephone on a Rembrandt self-portrait that was being auctioned at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings in London. He ended up buying the portrait for $11.3 million, above its $8 million estimate. 
 Mr. Wynn has been the biggest buyer at auction recently. At the important sales in New York in May, he snapped up Renoir's "In the Roses (Madame Leon Clapisson)" for $23.5 million one night, and a Cezanne self-portrait, circa 1895, for $17.3 million the next. All three works will be on public view at the Wynn Collection, his small museum in Las Vegas.
"I want people to see Rembrandt in relation to the Impressionists, post-Impressionists and early modernists," Mr. Wynn said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Hidden for more than 300 years under layers of paint applied by one of his pupils, Rembrandt's face emerged after years of careful cleaning. It is the first Rembrandt self-portrait to appear at auction in 30 years and only one of three known to be left in private hands.
Dating from 1634, when the artist was 28, the work has gone through many incarnations. Shortly after it was painted, one of the artist's pupils transformed it into a study of a flamboyantly dressed Russian aristocrat with a tall red hat, long hair, earrings and a mustache.
In the mid-20th century, the unidentified collector in France who owned the painting had it cleaned, and off came much of the Russian attire. By the time the present owner's father acquired it in the 1960's, the tall hat, some of the hair and the mustache were gone. By 1980 more hair was gone, as were the earrings.
In 1999, the current owner, the unidentified French collector who was the seller yesterday, approached Sotheby's in London, which had Martin Bijl, the former head of conservation at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, examine the painting with X-rays and infrared reflectography. After slow, careful cleaning, the self-portrait of the 28-year-old artist emerged.
When Mr. Wynn heard about the painting, he had Sotheby's send it to Las Vegas for him to examine. "I have a fascination with self-portraits," he said. "You can stand in the shoes of the painter."
Mr. Wynn said he wanted to reframe the painting with a Dutch frame that would be more appropriate, given the date and style of the art. But as soon as the paperwork (obtaining an export license and making all the shipping arrangements) is completed in London, Mr. Wynn says he plans to hang the work in his gallery.
Seeing a painting like this, he said, is a way of "looking into the eyes of the 28-year-old Rembrandt, and all the magic comes back."
What's more, Mr. Wynn added, "It's a way of standing in the same room as Rembrandt."

Sailing to Museums
In London, the fastest boat on the Thames these days is a $3.2 million, 220-seat catamaran festooned with 2,500 dots in 35 colors. Contemporary-art lovers will recognize the dots as the work of the British artist Damien Hirst, whom the Tate commissioned to decorate the boat.
Tate to Tate, as it is called, travels between the Tate's two museums, Tate Britain in Millbank and Tate Modern on the south side of the Thames in Bankside, making one stop at the London Eye, the ferris wheel. The trip takes about 18 minutes each way and costs $7.35 for adults, half-price for children. (The boat is equipped with a bar.)
"In 1993, when we decided to create the Tate Modern, its location seemed like a distant spot," said Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate.
But before the boat could be launched, the Tate had to build a pier in front of Tate Britain. It was designed by Marks Barfield Architects, who also designed the London Eye, along with Beckett Rankine Partnership, marine engineers. Sir Nicholas said the museum chose Mr. Hirst to decorate the boat because they wanted an artist who was both British and international.
"So far it's doing well," Sir Nicholas added. "Our first Sunday, we had about 1,200 people."
Tate to Tate operates seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 5:18 p.m. Timetable: www.thamesclippers.com; online ticket sales and gallery information: www.tate.org.uk.

Saying Goodbye
While the auction season has wound down for the summer, talk has shifted from art to the future of two high-profile experts.
Laura Paulson, who has run Sotheby's contemporary-art department in New York for four years, will be leaving to spend more time with her daughter.
Beginning in September, Dominique Levy, who headed Christie's private sales since 1999, will become a consultant working for the auction house part time. Meanwhile, she will set up her own business based in New York, where she will buy, sell and advise clients on their collections.

No Fall Art Fair
The proliferation of art and antiques fairs in Manhattan may be getting to be too much, especially in this rocky economy. The year-old New York Fall Fair, which was to take place at the Jacob Javits Center from Oct. 14 to 20, has been canceled because dealers thought it was too risky, not to mention expensive. Lorenzo A. Rudolf, vice president of the International Fine Art Expositions, the organizers who were trying to put together a fair to rival the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, every March, said he hoped that the economy would be looking up and that he could try again in 2004.

Out in the Garden, a Reputation Blooms

BYLINE:  By DAVID COLMAN 

 BODY:
"I KNEW when he cited Dr. Seuss as one of his inspirations that he was the man," Melissa Meyer said. Perhaps not many people planning a glamorous second home on two acres near the ocean in Sagaponack, N.Y. -- smack in the middle of the socially anxious Hamptons -- would be overjoyed to hear the creator of "Green Eggs and Ham" mentioned as a muse by their prospective landscaper. 
 Frederick Law Olmsted, one could see. Gertrude Jekyll, Russell Page -- sure. Isamu Noguchi, maybe. But Ken Smith won Ms. Meyer's heart not just with his affinity for Dr. Seuss but with charisma, vision and a resume of projects that ranged from urban plaza designs to lavish private gardens. 
 "Ken's a character, and I met him with the hopes that he would give me something I had never seen before -- which he did," Ms. Meyer said recently. "He fulfilled my expectations. I could just tell -- he's the creative genius kind of guy." 
You do not often hear words like "genius," "guru"and "artist" mentioned in the same sentence as "landscape architect." As a profession, landscape architects and designers have had to deal with a career profile that casts them as the earthy and earnest kid brother of the mighty architect.
But lately, star landscape architects like Mr. Smith have been scaling the walls of high-end design as stealthily as Boston ivy, as people across the country have become more and more appreciative of the way that gardens add to the pleasure, and perhaps value, of their second homes.
Now, landscape designers -- once the creepers of the design world -- are becoming name-brand entities and are joining the ranks of, and in some cases eclipsing, their bricks-and-mortar peers. As decoritects -- high-end residential architects -- downsize to meet the needs of a less constructive economy, business for landscape architects (whose rule-of-thumb budget is 10 to 15 percent of the house's cost) is thriving. The May issue of Money magazine reported that Americans spent $14.3 billion last year on landscape design, triple the 1998 figure.
The profession's latest cream of the crop -- among them Mr. Smith, Edwina von Gal, Topher Delaney, Pamela Burton, Deborah Nevins, Perry Guillot and Madison Cox -- are newly fashionable characters themselves.
They have clear visions, interesting attitudes, designer wardrobes and that frisson of lifestyle-gurudom from which fashion, interior and industrial designers have already profited -- plus a helping of that spiritual je ne sais quoi you only get from working hand in hand with Mother Nature. 
"They are gaining a certain celebrity," said Dominique Browning, the editor of House & Garden. "I am even noticing it in garden tours, which used to be a retirement-age activity. Now it's a much younger crowd. There's definitely a more name-droppy aspect to it." 
Several factors are lending their profiles a Miracle-Gro boost of chic. Among them: a post-boom penchant for retreat and refuge and a new wealth of information about plants and gardening on the Internet. And now that the McMansion is fast becoming the white stretch limo of the architecture world, some high-end customers don't want houses that practice Manifest Destiny on their lot lines. "Here in our modest vacation home," the new thinking goes, "we're just plain folks." 
But that humility stops at the front door. "The house itself can be humble -- that rustic-hut idea," said Mr. Smith, who prides himself on his dexterity at grafting historical landscape concepts with fanciful, modern (and even artificial) materials. "When people are doing the second home, they're vacating their ordinary lives, and the landscape is part of that escape -- the idea of getting back to nature. So they want a landscape that's not what they ordinarily live with." 
That was certainly the case with the Meyer house. Mr. Smith took the two basic elements of the Hamptons landscape -- open fields and hedges -- and turned them "slightly askew," as Ms. Meyer put it. One of the hedges is a line of hydrangeas, another is holly. A stripe in the lawn is given extra fertilizer, so the grass there is always greener. For a civilized touch of the wilderness, there's a field of wildflowers one could get lost in -- or at least imagine doing so.
MS. MEYER was delighted. "I spend all my time outside," she said. "Sitting by the pool, looking at the perennials. I've surprised myself by how much I get into it. Now I find myself padding around, pulling out weeds, seeing what flowers are coming up." 
But even an un-grand garden can take a truckload of green to get it to look that way. Madison Cox, whose Moroccan garden at the Shore Club in Miami has become one of the hot drinks spots in town and created a ripple effect for his residential business, agreed. "Some of the budgets on these second homes can equal what is spent on a primary residence," he said.
No single look epitomizes the trend. While Mr. Smith is known for sculptural, avant-garde plantings that might, for example, meld hardscape (i.e., stones, gravel and decking) and otherwise humdrum ingredients like grasses. Perry Guillot's style is a sort of 1930's Hollywood meets 1900's Hamptons, an understated yet luxurious sense of high-hedged garden glamour.
Edwina von Gal has carved a high-profile niche as a creator of gardens that match a classic sense of formality with a Zen-like minimalism, set off by offhand, quirky touches, like a swing centered in a "room" made of hedges.
There is moregoing on here than aesthetics, of course. According to the American Society of Landscape Architects, the proper landscaping can add 20 percent or more to a home's resale value.
But even though it's possible for the layman to appreciate how gardening can enhance the look of a house, the technical aspects of working with deciduous decor can be intimidating. "It's much more overwhelming -- a decorator is dealing with set rooms," said Ms. Browning, the House & Garden editor. "It's much harder to look at a field and imagine three rooms."
Barbara Gladstone, the Manhattan art dealer, hired Deborah Nevins to do the small garden at her house in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and did not bother hiring a decorator for the interior. "I'm smart enough to know what I don't know," Ms. Gladstone said. "I always thought if I bought a house, she would be the first call I made." 
Ms. Nevins is a master of historically correct plantings, and the garden she created for Ms. Gladstone's 1860 brick house reflects what, ideally, might have been there originally.
"With interiors, you can more or less impose what you want," Ms. Gladstone said. "Nature is profound -- these people, they have to work hand in hand with what is. It's like the difference between sailing and motoring. In a sailboat you have to respect the wind, whereas with a motorboat, you just go right through." 
Pamela Burton is a Los Angeles landscape architect whose clients range from Hollywood heavyweights like Diane Keaton and Michael Crichton to Southern California institutions. Ms. Burton, who published "Private Landscapes: Modernist Gardens of Southern California" last year, said that the growing respect for landscaping stemmed from people's desire to siphon the utmost pleasure from the outdoor space they have. Ms. Burton's strength is creating lush but not lavish spaces, never too minimal nor too grand, with lots of little gardens or "rooms" with different themes and uses -- a moon-viewing garden, for one. (Talk about inconspicuous consumption.) 
"I think the idea of solace is something missing in our everyday world," she said. "As the planet fills up with more people, having some corner of the world to go to, even a little plot of grass, can be a tremendous relief." 
John Baldessari, the conceptual artist, hired Ms. Burton to redo the garden of a bungalow he had bought in Santa Monica, Calif., and has since been quite pleased with the result. "I sit outside at night and feel totally tranquil," he said. "All my cares of the day just wilt away. I was wondering if the plants actually absorb sounds -- it's so quiet. It's a marvelous experience." 
When Sam Shahid, the creative director and president of Shahid & Company, an advertising and design firm in Manhattan, bought an 1876 farmhouse in Bridgehampton, N.Y., he didn't think his acre of wooded land needed much. Then he met Perry Guillot. After he struggled to articulate what he wanted, Mr. Guillot told him: "I know what you want. You want a London park."
Mr. Shahid hired him on the spot. "I never thought landscaping was important, that it could make you so happy," Mr. Shahid said. "I always thought it was the house, the way it was painted, the way it was decorated. You hear 'landscape,' you think rosebushes, a little garden, you know, like nothing."
But Mr. Guillot transformed the property, cutting down all but a few choice trees, letting the sun flood over the place and planting a large oval hedge in back. In the center he put a simple, elegant rectangle of a pool. Mr. Shahid was overwhelmed. "You don't know why you feel the way you do," he said. "It's a real pleasure thing."
So many people have the same ameliorative reaction to landscaping that scientists are now studying it. John Stilgoe, professor of environmental studies at Harvard, said that the concepts outlined in "The Biophilia Hypothesis," Edward O. Wilson and Stephen R. Kellert's 1993 book, which posits that people are innately drawn to natural surroundings for mental and physical well-being, were driving the landscaping boom and would continue to do so.
"There is emerging medical evidence that the aesthetic end of landscaping turns out to be founded on medical reasons, that you will feel better emotionally in a garden," Professor Stilgoe said.
Mr. Shahid would agree. His admiration for his landscaper seems to know no bounds. "I do have this trust with him that I don't have with architects," he said. "It's almost like a doctor. You sort of fall in love."

HEADLINE: Bank of England Surprises With a Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 10 

 BODY:
At its first meeting under a new governor, the Bank of England surprised investors today by ordering a 0.25 percent cut in interest rates, bringing the benchmark rate to 3.5 percent, a 48-year low, in an attempt to spark economic growth.
 Coming on a day when the European Central Bank in Frankfurt held its rates steady at 2 percent, the move fueled arguments here by some critics of the euro single currency that the British and Continental European economies are not sufficiently in step to justify British membership. 
 British policy makers are desperate to prevent the sputtering out of what appeared to be an incipient economic revival, and want to prevent the British pound from climbing too high -- making exports more expensive and thereby jeopardizing overall economic growth. In the past month, the pound has risen 2 percent against the currencies of Britain's main trading partners. 
Mervyn A. King, who succeeded Sir Edward George as governor of the Bank of England on July 1, hinted last week that he viewed the recent strengthening of the British pound as the most significant development since last month's meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee.
The nine-member committee, led by Mr. King, said today in a statement that "the global economic recovery has remained hesitant." He continued, "although the preconditions for recovery remain in place," prospects for British exports were "weaker than previously expected."
If the aim was to curb the rise of the pound, the rate cut worked: the currency dropped 1 cent against the dollar to around $1.626.
Mr. King, the former deputy governor of the central bank, had previously been associated with those supporting rate increases, and few economists had expected him to come up with a surprise at the first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee under his stewardship.
The rate cut by the Bank of England was the first since a 0.25 percent reduction in February and followed reductions in recent weeks by both the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
Britain has the highest interest rates of the three, reflecting worries that deeper cuts would fuel inflation, particularly in the traditionally boom-and-bust housing market. Mortgage lenders immediately welcomed the cut, which ran counter to expectations. 
A majority of economists polled by Reuters and Bloomberg News before the announcement of the rate cut had forecast that rates would remain unchanged for the time being because of growth in the service industries, which account for the bulk of the British economy.
At the same time, manufacturing is shrinking while trade with the stagnant euro zone economies has fallen to its lowest level in four years, according to official figures.
David Frost, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said Mr. King had "started on the right foot" with today's cuts. "Now is a critical time for businesses," Mr. Frost said, noting that economic growth was sluggish, the boom in consumer spending had ended and overseas demand was weak. "Meanwhile," he added, "inflation is well under control."
Britain's quarterly economic growth rate is the slowest in over 10 years, amid indications that consumer spending may be easing as the number of people claiming unemployment benefits increases.
John Butler, an economist at HSBC Bank, said that consumer spending could no longer be relied on to foster growth.
"The bank requires growth from elsewhere in the economy and needs the economy to rebalance," he said in an interview with the Press Association news agency. "Ultimately, a rebalanced economy needs a lower level of sterling."

HEADLINE: The Next Green Revolution 

BYLINE:  By Norman E. Borlaug; Norman E. Borlaug, professor of international agriculture at Texas A&M University, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.

DATELINE: TEXCOCO, Mexico 

 BODY:
The key to economic development in Africa is agriculture. As President Bush concludes his trip to the continent, and Americans ponder ways to help it emerge from decades of poverty and turmoil, we would do well to remember that crucial point. Fortunately, we have the economic and technological means to bring about an agricultural revolution.
 Using proven agricultural techniques, Africa could easily double or triple the yields of most of its crops. It has the potential not only to feed itself but even to become a dynamic agricultural exporter within a few decades. 
 African farmers face three main problems: depleted soil, a scarcity of water and distorted economics caused in large part by primitive transportation systems. None of these problems is beyond our capacity to solve.
Low soil fertility is one of the greatest biological obstacles to increasing food production and improving land productivity. (Because of overfarming and insufficient crop rotation, Africa's soil is actually less rich than it was 30 years ago.) Yet there is a man-made solution to the sub-Saharan soil's lack of nutrients -- namely, fertilizer, either chemical or organic. Unfortunately, economic forces keep fertilizer out of many African farmers' hands. 
Because of transportation costs, fertilizer costs two to three times more in rural sub-Saharan Africa than it does in rural Asia. As a result, fertilizer consumption in Africa is about 10 percent what it is in Asia. That's a market failure, and it could be remedied by a mix of public and private programs. Aid organizations might buy fertilizer at its point of entry into Africa and distribute it at reduced cost to wholesalers. Alternatively, poor farmers might be given fertilizer vouchers. 
Chronic water shortages are another challenge. Nearly half of Africa's farmland suffers from periodic and often catastrophic drought. But here, too, the problem isn't beyond our control. About 4 percent of farmland south of the Sahara is irrigated, compared with 17 percent of farmland worldwide.
Large-scale irrigation projects are prohibitively expensive and can ruin villages and ecosystems. But clever, small-scale technologies -- including subterranean pools for capturing rainfall, pumps on river banks, and cisterns under drain spouts -- can make parched land bloom.
Because of the dismal state of roads in Africa, farmers there face the highest marketing costs in the world. A study by the World Bank, completed in the late 1990's, found that it cost roughly $50 to ship a metric ton of corn from Iowa to Mombasa, Kenya, more than 8,500 miles away. In contrast, it cost $100 or so to move the same amount of corn from Mombasa inland to Kampala, Uganda -- about 550 miles. And not much has changed in recent years.
The challenge is that African produce is conveyed to buyers via a vast network of footpaths, tracks and dirt roads, where the most common mode of transport is walking. American- and European-financed road projects would connect farmers with consumers while improving life in countless other ways. 
As agriculture takes off, agricultural-improvement and food-aid programs should dovetail. School lunch programs, for example, can provide a significant stimulus to the expansion of commercial food markets if the produce involved is locally grown.
Biotechnology absolutely should be part of African agricultural reform; African leaders will be making a grievous error if they turn their backs on it. (Zambia's president notoriously barred shipments of food aid from America last year that included genetically modified corn.) Genetic technology can help produce plants with greater tolerance of insects and diseases, improve the nutritional quality of food staples and help farmers to expand the areas they cultivate. Rather than looking to European leaders, who have demonized biotechnology, African leaders ought to work to manage and regulate this technology for the benefit of their farmers and citizens.
Africa's warm temperatures, abundant sunlight and wide open spaces and diverse climates make it a place where agriculture can thrive. Countries with tropical climates, like Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, should be exporting, not importing, rice. Drier places -- including Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad -- have the potential to be major producers of sorghum and millet. But you can't eat potential.
Nothing will happen without an infusion of money and technical help from the industrialized world. President Bush is right to emphasize a new emphasis on standards of evaluation. Sub-Saharan countries that make significant progress in producing food and diminishing poverty should be rewarded with additional financial support. 
Lest we forget, helping African agriculture to prosper is not merely a humanitarian issue -- it's a matter of enlightened self-interest. Smallholder African farmers, after all, are stewards of one of the earth's major land masses. And as the Kenyan paleontologist Richard Leakey once said, "You have to have at least one square meal a day to be a conservationist." Aiding African farmers will not only save lives, it will also, in a uniquely literal sense, help to save the earth.

HEADLINE: Your Farm Subsidies Are Strangling Us 

BYLINE:  By Amadou Toumani Toure and Blaise Compaore; Amadou Toumani Toure and Blaise Compaore are the presidents, respectively, of Mali and Burkina Faso.

 BODY:
After too many years of Africa's being pushed to the global background, it's heartening to see the world's attention being focused on our continent. International support -- both financial and otherwise -- is certainly needed to help combat the severe poverty and disease gripping our nations. But first and foremost, Africa needs to be allowed to take its destiny into its own hands. Only self-reliance and economic growth and development will allow Africa to become a full member of the world community.
 With the creation of the New Economic Partnership for African Development in 2001, African leaders have committed themselves to following the principles of good governance and a market economy. Nothing is more central to this goal than participating in world trade. As the presidents of two of Africa's least developed countries -- Burkina Faso and Mali -- we are eager to participate in the multilateral trading system and to take on its rights and obligations. 
 Cotton is our ticket into the world market. Its production is crucial to economic development in West and Central Africa, as well as to the livelihoods of millions of people there. Cotton accounts for up to 40 percent of export revenues and 10 percent of gross domestic product in our two countries, as well as in Benin and Chad. More than that, cotton is of paramount importance to the social infrastructure of Africa, as well as to the maintenance of its rural areas.
This vital economic sector in our countries is seriously threatened by agricultural subsidies granted by rich countries to their cotton producers. According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, cotton subsidies amounted to about $5.8 billion in the production year of 2001 to 2002, nearly equal the amount of cotton trade for this same period. Such subsidies lead to worldwide overproduction and distort cotton prices, depriving poor African countries of their only comparative advantage in international trade.
Not only is cotton crucial to our economies, it is the sole agricultural product for our countries to trade. Although African cotton is of the highest quality, our production costs are about 50 percent lower than in developed countries even though we rely on manual labor. In wealthier countries, by contrast, lower-quality cotton is produced on large mechanized farms, generating little employment and having a questionable impact on the environment. Cotton there could be replaced by other, more valuable crops.
In the period from 2001 to 2002, America's 25,000 cotton farmers received more in subsidies -- some $3 billion -- than the entire economic output of Burkina Faso, where two million people depend on cotton. Further, United States subsidies are concentrated on just 10 percent of its cotton farmers. Thus, the payments to about 2,500 relatively well-off farmers has the unintended but nevertheless real effect of impoverishing some 10 million rural poor people in West and Central Africa.
Something has to be done. Along with the countries of Benin and Chad, we have submitted a proposal to the World Trade Organization -- which is meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in September to discuss agricultural issues -- that calls for an end to unfair subsidies granted by developed countries to their cotton producers. As an interim measure, we have also proposed that least-developed countries be granted financial compensation for lost export revenues that are due to those subsidies. 
Our demand is simple: apply free trade rules not only to those products that are of interest to the rich and powerful, but also to those products where poor countries have a proven comparative advantage. We know that the world will not ignore our plea for a fair playing field. The World Trade Organization has said it is committed to addressing the problems of developing countries. The United States has convinced us that a free market economy provides the best opportunities for all members of the world community. Let us translate these principles into deeds at Cancun.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
A Loft Feeling, but Without the Lofts

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
In real estate parlance, the term "loft" connotes rambling space, while "studio" suggests a compact nest. The Moinian Group, a developer of residential and commercial properties, has worked to blend the two in its new rental building at 90 Washington Street in downtown Manhattan. 
 The 398 units in the building, a former Bank of New York office tower that has been named 90W, are not lofts, "but they have a loft feeling," said Joseph Moinian, chief executive of the firm that bears his family name. The apartments are smaller-scale versions of traditional lofts, with spaces of various shapes flowing into one another without walls or doors. 
 Mr. Moinian designed the sizes of the units -- 420 to 800 square feet -- to limit rents. They will range from $1,466 for single-room studios to $2,600 for spaces designated as living, dining gallery and -- a designation reflecting that it is a room without a window -- home office.
Mr. Moinian is hoping to attract tenants who might otherwise share quarters on the Upper East Side with roommates. "We know our customers well," he said. "They are young, first-time apartment occupants. They have jobs or are getting jobs in Manhattan or the boroughs, and they are very educated." Despite the economic downturn, he said, he believes that there are still enough young people commanding salaries of at least $45,000 a year, which permits them to qualify for the apartments.
Nor is he deterred by the proximity of ground zero, about two blocks to the north. "Negotiations on our deal had started long before 9/11," he said. "It was taking a long time, and that put us back even further. But my commitment is to downtown and we really wanted to continue being here." The Moinian Group owns six residential, commercial and retail buildings in the area, and construction is planned for two more.
Funding for 90W includes Liberty Bonds, which were created to encourage construction downtown after 9/11, and loans from the city's Housing Development Corporation and Key Bank. The total cost is estimated at $82 million. 
In return for Liberty Bond funding, rents will be stabilized, with increases limited for 30 years to those set annually by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. The developer will also receive tax abatements for 14 years under the city's 421-g program, which is meant to stimulate the conversion of commercial buildings south of Murray and Frankfort Streets to residential or mixed use.
Construction on the building, whose facade was preserved but interior gutted, began in January and is due to be completed by Thanksgiving. The first tenants are scheduled to move in by the end of the summer.
Depending on their location, the apartments have sweeping views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park City, the Empire State Building and the canyons of the financial district. "Even a bad view in this building is a good view," said the architect, Avinash Malhotra.
Initially, the configuration of the structure posed a challenge, but Mr. Malhotra said, "Usually I try to take the weakness and make it a strength, and here the weakness was the fact that the apartments were very deep, as much as 200 feet." To keep the units from resembling railroad flats, he designed secondary corridors "sothat you enter in the middle of the apartment," he explained. "It makes the interior space more efficient." 
In some units, he created office space; there is no city requirement that such space have windows. "The way we live has changed over the years," he said, "so the home occupation room has come onto the market. Many people want a separate area where they can work." 
Much attention has been paid to the communal facilities, which were designed by Nancy J. Ruddy, an interior design architect. As Mr. Malhotra put it, "The apartments are not so big, so the amenities act as an extension of your apartment, and the club room becomes your living room."
The 13th floor is used for a 12,500-square-foot recreation center with 18-foot ceilings that includes a gym, a lounge and a roof terrace with putting greens and driving cages.
In addition, upholstery and furniture cleaning, dry cleaning and shoe shining will be offered on the premises. The building's underground garage "will accommodate cars and S.U.V.'s, no matter how big, as well as boats," Mr. Moinian said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims For Benefits Reach a High Set in 1983 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
The number of Americans claiming jobless benefits late last month hit its highest point in more than 20 years, the government said today in a report underscoring the persistent weakness of the nation's labor market. 
 The number of idled workers on the benefit rolls increased by 87,000 in the week ended June 28, to 3.82 million, the highest level since February 1983, the Labor Department said. 
 It also said first-time claims for unemployment insurance rose by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 439,000 last week from 434,000 a week earlier, surprising economists on Wall Street who had expected claims to decline. 
Other reports today offered mixed readings on the manufacturing sector and a rise in import prices, while top retailers reported June sales dampened by wet weather. 
While clear signs have yet to emerge showing the economic pace has picked up after a sluggish start to the year, a closely watched poll of forecasters released today found projections of growth had recently been tweaked higher. 
Economists cautioned about drawing conclusions on the near-term direction of the labor market from the jobless claims numbers, saying the Independence Day holiday and auto plant shutdowns may have skewed the figures. 
The claims figures came on the heels of a report last week that showed the nation's jobless rate surged to a nine-year high of 6.4 percent in June. That report also showed the number of workers experiencing long-term unemployment hit 2.04 million, the highest level since December 1992. 
While auto plant shutdowns for annual retooling might have affected the claims figures last week, a four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, also suggested no improvement. That barometer rose by a slight 1,000, to 426,750, ending a string of three weekly declines.

HEADLINE: Data in Conflict: Why Economists Tend to Weep 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Is the economy pulling itself out of a slump, or is it sinking deeper?
 The answer could be either, based on the data from government agencies these days. Because they measure the same things -- employment, incomes and prices -- in different ways, it can be hard to tell what is really happening. 
 Yet among all the alternative gauges, some of the most widely cited data is collected in a patchwork fashion, or checked against benchmarks only once a decade. What is more, frequent changes in the agencies' methods can make comparisons with earlier trends impossible. And a few economists complain that those revisions may be motivated by politics rather than science. 
"This is not a customer-driven enterprise," said Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It's not always clear to me that we're getting the services that we'd hope for."
Many Americans have been watching data from the job market, but those figures can sometimes be misleading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that payrolls outside farming had dropped by 30,000 in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis. In the same report, it said that the total number of employed people had grown by 251,000.
Was the labor market stagnating, or booming?
Neither number represented an absolute truth. The figure for payrolls comes from reports by businesses and government that are checked once a year against unemployment insurance records, which are fairly comprehensive. But the figure for employed people comes from a sampling of households that is thoroughly benchmarked only once a decade, with the census.
"Particularly if you are interested in employment as a measure of economic trends, you probably want to use the payroll survey more than the household survey," Professor Mitchell said. "Things that are proportions, percentages, ratios -- that's what I would say you want to use the household survey for."
Thomas J. Nardone, who supervises the survey of households as chief of the bureau's division of labor force statistics, said Professor Mitchell's approach was basically correct for short periods. "You have to be careful about interpreting things, especially if you're dealing with just one additional bit of information."
Even a single data point can change, sometimes more than once, over time. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, a Commerce Department agency, releases three figures for economic growth for a quarter: an advance number, a preliminary number and a final number.
For the first quarter of this year, the bureau announced annualized growth rates of 1.6 percent in April, 1.9 percent in May and 1.4 percent in June. Given that the economy averages growth around 3 percent, a swing of half a percentage point is not negligible. Yet it is not uncommon, either.
"That's not an unusual or atypical swing," said Brent R. Moulton, the bureau's associate director for national economic accounts. "When you're working with a small base, it seems more noticeable."
Much of the quarterly data is collected in dribs and drabs, Mr. Moulton said. For service industries, which represent two-thirds of economic activity, comprehensive data is only collected annually. For more frequent figures, some statistical guesswork is involved.
"We have data on volume of stock market activity, which we can use to infer something about the amounts paid in commissions for financial transactions," Mr. Moulton said. "We have data on temperature -- heating and cooling degree-days -- that we can use to infer something about electricity and natural gas consumption."
In some sectors, the economy has grown beyond the scope of statistics, leaving the government scrambling to fill the holes. "We've got an economy that has changed rapidly over the past 15 or 20 years that our statistical infrastructure hasn't really kept up with," said Richard B. Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley and a member of the Bureau of Economic Analysis's advisory committee. Because reporting is often voluntary, he added, it can be hard to persuade new companies to contribute.
They may also drop in and out. The semiconductor industry, for instance, recently agreed to share information on its shipments and inventories for the first time in about a year. But how should officials measure, say, the output of an Internet search engine?
"In a knowledge-based, information-based economy, one could argue that we don't have good metrics for measuring output," Mr. Berner said. 
Measures of income, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases alongside measures of production, can also be incomplete. Mr. Moulton said the agency received fairly reliable data on wages and profit, but "for most of the other pieces of income, we don't have very timely information coming in."
Among the most controversial of government gauges are the indexes of prices. These determine the growth of Social Security checks, the interest paid on inflation-adjusted bonds and the positioning of tax brackets. They also feed into data on worker productivity and real interest rates.
A true change in price, said Neal Soss, chief economist of Credit Suisse First Boston, should not reflect changes in the quality of a product -- essentially, the evolution of a new product. And in the services sector, discerning those distinctions can be difficult.
"I don't know how you'd measure the quality of haircuts, or whether today's rock music is better than the golden oldies of the past," Mr. Soss said. "But in some parts of the service sector, there are objective measures of quality that could be applied, and I don't think that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has applied nearly enough effort to this."
Adjusting prices of services for changes in quality can be especially challenging, said John S. Greenlees, acting associate commissioner for prices and living conditions at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because services are less likely than goods to have observable characteristics. Comparing the features on television sets with different prices is easy, he said, but not so for movie tickets.
"You don't have different movies with different admissions prices based on their acting," he said.
The scope of a statistical agency's work can also be limited by its budget. For instance, the federal government has been gradually replacing its classification of industries in the last few years -- a move that has affected thousands of figures collected by many agencies. Yet while the Federal Reserve painstakingly reconstructed decades of old data to match the new framework, Mr. Berner said, the Census Bureau has been unwilling or unable to follow because of a lack of money.
The experts all said that almost constant revisions in methods and data sources made continuity a recurring problem in government statistics. Drawing comparisons of trends in inflation, employment and growth could be tricky, even, Mr. Berner said, for periods as short as five years.
"The statistical agencies are a little too cavalier about saying, 'Well, we want to have a very accurate snapshot right now, and to hell with continuity,' " Professor Mitchell said. "If they break the series, the users of that information -- the clientele -- don't have any alternative. We're at their mercy."
Putting aside budget shortages, Mr. Berner said that the government's statisticians and economists were able to work in an independent, scientifically minded way. But Professor Mitchell, who has consulted for several federal economic agencies, said they also faced political pressures.
As an example, he said, researchers making revisions to price indexes may have been pushed to understate inflation, as such a change would result in smaller liabilities in the Social Security system when the baby-boom generation retires. "In reality, those kinds of things do play some role."
Mr. Soss agreed. "It's sort of in the air," he said. "For 35 years, countries have wanted their inflation rates to be lower, and I think there's a natural tendency of anyone living in the society to breathe the air. The air surrounding these processes was something that led to looking for ways that inflation might be lower."

HEADLINE: New Orleans Struggles With a Homicide Rate That Belies Its Size 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 10 

 BODY:
Sometimes, a crime is so offensive, it turns a city's stomach and leads to great change.
 So far, the killing of Jasmine Jackson is not one of them. 
 On Sunday night, the 16-year-old Ms. Jackson, a slender, copper-skinned girl called Jazz, was walking home from a block party when she was jumped by two other girls. 
Her cousin said she tried to fight them off but was stabbed in the arm with a steak knife. One of the girls then plunged the knife into Jazz's chest. Ms. Jackson could not run because she had been shot in the leg last year, randomly, and still walked with a limp.
She collapsed on a nearby stoop, holding her hand over her heart.
"I remember saying, 'Stay with me, Jazz, stay with me,' " said Keila Smith, 15, who tried to help. "Then she closed her eyes."
Jazz died barely a week after two teenage girls were sent to prison for fatally stabbing another 16-year-old girl with a steak knife. But besides a few news accounts, there was little outrage beyond Christopher Homes, the broken-dreams public housing neighborhood where Jazz fell.
One reason for the numbness is that New Orleans is in the middle of a major crime wave, with homicides up 30 percent for the year. The city's homicide rate, 54.5 per 100,000, exceeds that of Washington, the most violent large city in the United States. But in a wrinkle of statistics, New Orleans ducks that distinction because its population is 14,000 shy of the 500,000 mark needed to qualify as a big city in federal crime reports.
Some ministers here have been asking for the National Guard to be sent in.
"Certain neighborhoods are under siege," the Rev. Torin Sanders, a Baptist preacher, said. "The last three months I've done at least five funerals, just homicides alone."
No one seems to know exactly why killings in New Orleans are increasing. Nationally, there is no clear trend, with homicides this year down in some places, like Detroit, and up in others, including Philadelphia. Over all, violent crime is much lower than it was during the mid-1990's, when killings hit a peak.
In New Orleans, like many other places, the poor job market is often blamed.
"The economy is not booming right now, and there's definitely a correlation between the economy and crime," Superintendent Eddie Compass of the New Orleans Police Department said.
Other factors include recent turf wars that broke out after two big public housing complexes were shut down and residents were shifted to other projects. Then there are the budget cuts that depleted inner-city services. 
"How many psychologists have they sent to Christopher Homes to find out what kind of trauma exists there?" Malik Rahim, a community activist, said. "Now the next kid is saying, 'I'd better carry me a knife, because I'm not going down like she went down.' "
Keila Smith, the 15-year-old who watched her friend Jazz die, has not talked to any counselors.
"I keep hearing Jazz breathe," she said.
She described a violent teenage world, where girls with pony tails and plastic rings tuck knives in their shorts and carry spray bottles filled with bleach.
Meda Chesney-Lind, a women's studies professor at the University of Hawaii who specializes in female crime, said: "When girls kill, it's almost always other girls or children. Violent boys tend to be violent because they grew up in violent neighborhoods. Girls, it's much more that they've been the victim of violence at home."
Christopher Homes, a tangle of two-story apartments splattered with graffiti, is probably no worse than many other public housing projects. But the neighborhood, in Algiers, 20 minutes from the French Quarter, seems especially bleak in the doldrums of summer, with stagnant water from Tuesday night's rain pooling in the streets and old men pushing rusty bikes through tall, dead grass.
A few boys play basketball. A few girls hang around. But there is no echo of double-dutch jump rope here. No public swimming pool. No job training. Nothing.
"For a girl, all there's to do is chill," Miranda Ingram, 18, said. "And the harder you chill, the more trouble you get into."
Ms. Jackson, who loved crawfish and roller-skating, was the youngest of five children. Her mother is an unemployed cocktail waitress; her father, an unemployed construction worker. She had problems reading, and at age 16 was just about to enter ninth grade. She may not have been the best student. "But she was sweet," her father, Gilbert Burke, said.
Every time they saw each other, she gave him 25 quick little kisses on his cheek.
Last November, she was shot by a stray bullet while standing in a crowd on Canal Street. It was around 10 on Sunday night when she was stabbed. Shortly afterward, the police arrested two 14-year-old girls. On Tuesday, the police charged a 25-year-old woman with handing them the knife.
All the girls involved used to be friends and the only explanation for the attack was petty rivalries.
"They was jealous," Patricia Jackson, the cousin who tried to fend off the girls, said. "Jazz was the cute type. Boys liked her."
On steamy days like today, when other girls are splashing in sprinklers, Jazz Jackson's family sits in a quiet apartment staring at a picture.
It was taken at a school dance a few months ago. Jazz is wearing a gold dress with her manicured toes peeking out from underneath. The photo is labeled "An evening under the stars."
Jazz, her family says, is now among them.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Investors Seek Signs Of Stronger Economy

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An unexpected rise in jobless claims unnerved Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks sharply lower on worries that the market's recent rally might have come too far, too fast.
 Earnings at Yahoo, which met, but did not beat, analysts' estimates also disappointed investors. 
 "Yahoo didn't deliver significant upside and it's a huge momentum name, so you have some momentum taken out of the market," said Keith Keenan, vice president for institutional trading at Wall Street Access, a New York brokerage firm. "The bulls anticipated much higher numbers." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,036.04. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 31.60 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,715.86. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.51 points, or 1.4 percent, to 988.70.
Yahoo slid $2.73, or 7.7 percent, to $32.56, after it reported that quarterly profit had doubled. The result was in line with forecasts, but First Albany lowered the company's stock rating to neutral from buy, citing in part possible overvaluation.
The Labor Department reported that new jobless claims rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 5,000, to 439,000, the highest level since the week ended May 31. Economists had been expecting a decline in claims.
Comments from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that high natural gas prices might not be alleviated anytime soon also appeared to put pressure on shares. Mr. Greenspan said the high prices would probably cause some industries to lose business to foreign competitors, but added that the overall economic effect was still unclear.
Stocks have surged in recent months as investors have grown optimistic about the chance of a solid economic recovery by year's end. But analysts say investors now want more concrete evidence of improvement, particularly in the technology sector, which has had strong gains.
Still, analysts saw yesterday's declines as more of a natural pullback. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq reached its highest in nearly 15 months, while the Dow and S.& P. traded at levels not seen in a year.
"Over all, the market is going to be a lot choppier than we've seen the last few months," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn. "When we punch out to new highs, you become vulnerable to setbacks along the way."
Mr. Keenan of Wall Street Access agreed. He said stocks would probably trade within a narrow range in the coming weeks as companies largely meet, if not slightly beat, estimates during the second-quarter earnings season.
"At this point I don't think you'll see a huge trend reversal," he said.
Abbott Laboratories fell 13 cents, to $43.55, after the company posted operating profits that were in line with previous estimates.
Several retailers also were a bit weaker after reports of tepid June sales. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slipped 13 cents, to $55.63, after posting a small sales gain that fell below estimates, while American Eagle Outfitters dropped 40 cents, to $19.25.
Coinstar tumbled $5.59, or 29.5 percent, to $13.35 after the company, a provider ofself-service coin processing, said it could not reach a new agreement with the Safeway grocery store chain, prompting it to lower its outlook for the year.
Gainers included PepsiCo, which rose $2.40, to $46.95, after the company reported a rise in quarterly profit that met analysts' expectations.

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Bloomberg News
 Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as stocks tumbled and a government report showed initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week. The two developments were taken as further signs that the economy might not accelerate as much as some traders anticipated.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32 , to a price of 99 22/32 . The note's yield, which moves opposite to the price, decreased to 3.66 percent from 3.68 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32 , to 110 13/32 . The bond's yield was unchanged at 4.70 percent.

HEADLINE: Unions Finding That Employers Want More Concessions 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: JEFFERSON, Wis., July 7 

 BODY:
For the 470 workers on strike at the Tyson Foods sausage and pepperoni plant here, the big question is why the company is so eager to cut starting salaries, freeze pensions and adopt a health plan with less coverage when the plant is so profitable.
 In the first strike in the plant's 128-year history, the workers have been picketing since Feb. 28, carrying signs accusing Tyson of greed and hoping to persuade it to withdraw its demands for a string of concessions. 
 "They figure that this is the time to take money out of our pockets and put it back in theirs," said Chuck Moehling, who made $13.10 an hour in the sausage-stuffing operation before the strike. "The fact that they're making record profits doesn't seem to matter."
Healthy profits or not, Tyson has joined hundreds of companies nationwide demanding concessions from organized labor. As corporations grapple with a weak economy, fierce overseas competition and soaring health costs, they have made concessions a focus of labor negotiations, often demanding wage freezes, lower starting pay, stingier pensions and higher health insurance premiums and co-payments. 
This push comes not only from businesses, but also the public sector -- states, cities and school boards that face their biggest budget deficits in decades.
The examples extend far beyond this southern Wisconsin town, where Tyson officials say concessions are needed to keep costs in line with those of its other plants. Verizon, the telephone company, wants concessions from 75,000 employees. New York City has demanded wage freezes from nearly 300,000 municipal workers. In Pennsylvania, 48,000 state employees have had to accept a two-year pay freeze. 
Demanding concessions is common in teetering industries, most notably airlines and steel, but now it has spread to thriving industries as well. Even General Electric, one of the nation's most profitable companies, with more than $45,000 in profits per worker, demanded health-care concessions in recent negotiations. The Big Three automakers also insist that their workers contribute more toward health coverage.
"We're seeing a return to the bargaining climate of the 1980's as a lot of negotiations appear to focus on concessions, givebacks and reductions," said Paul Clark, a labor relations professor at Pennsylvania State University.
With unemployment rising and unions on the defensive, Professor Clark said, "There's no question that employers recognize that they have the upper hand in these relationships, and it's not surprising that they're trying to take advantage."
Manufacturers are making the biggest demands as they feel pressures from low-wage countries like China and from rising health and natural gas costs. Citing the loss of 2.3 million factory jobs in 30 months, many manufacturers warn that jobs might disappear unless workers accept cost-cutting measures.
Such a battle is taking place 30 miles east of Jefferson, where 460 workers have been on strike since May 2 at Waukesha Engine, which makes power-generating equipment. The company seeks a two-tier pay system, far higher health payments from retirees and the right to lay off workers regardless of seniority.
"Now more than ever we compete in a global economy," said Stewart Yee, a spokesman for Dresser, Waukesha's parent company. "When you're talking about competition from low-cost countries, you have to get your work force to help position your company to compete effectively. We tell our workers we have to set ourselves up going forward to keep these jobs in our country."
Patrick Cleary, senior vice president for human resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "It's the worst pricing pressures we've ever experienced. Our guys can't push these costs along. That's why they're seeking to reduce labor costs." 
Most unions try to resist concessions, as is clear in Jefferson, a two-stoplight town of 7,500, surrounded by rolling farmland. Supermarkets, restaurants and bakeries are donating food to sustain the strikers, while scores of homes have signs out front saying "No Greed" and "We Need More Than Chicken Feed."
Some unions have successfully rebuffed concessions -- G.E.'s two main unions beat back the company's demand that they pay 30 percent of health-care costs, up from the current 18 percent. But many other unions have reluctantly accepted them, fearful that a prolonged strike could mean months without paychecks and perhaps the loss of jobs to permanent replacement workers. 
Some labor experts say the current era, like the 1980's, could portend another ratcheting down in labor's strength. The nation's unions have seen their power slip steadily as unionized workers have dropped to 13 percent of the work force, from 35 percent in the 1950's.
"Until unions turn things around, these pressures will continue," said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University.
Labor leaders boast of examples where unions have obtained impressive contracts, notably in cities where unions have organized the vast majority of the workers in a nonmanufacturing industry. In Chicago, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union mobilized 7,300 workers at 27 hotels, threatened a strike and obtained a 54 percent increase in wages and benefits over four years. In recent talks involving janitors in Boston, Denver and Washington, the Service Employees International Union won raises of 25 percent over five years and health insurance for many part-time workers.
"In 1985, we took concessions in 23 out of 25 agreements," said Stephen Lerner, director of the union's Justice for Janitors campaign. "Nowadays we represent 70 to 90 percent of building service workers in these cities. That means a lot in terms of bargaining power."
Even many employers with solid profits are demanding concessions. For example, the Tribune Company demanded substantial concessions from the Newspaper Guild at The Baltimore Sun. In contract talks last month, the company obtained a one-year wage freeze and more flexibility to transfer workers.
"There's an old theory in industrial relations that two main factors determine who has the upper hand," Professor Clark said. "These factors are the economy and the degree to which the government in power supports workers' interests. In the early 1980's, management had the upper hand because the economy was in bad shape, unemployment was rising and the Reagan administration was very unfriendly toward unions. We haven't had the stars aligned that way since the 1980's until now."
Ken Kimbro, Tyson's senior vice president for human resources, said the company, which acquired the Jefferson plant two years ago, merely wanted to get its costs in line with other Tyson plants. 
That, he explained, is why Tyson has demanded a four-year wage freeze in Jefferson and wants to cut starting pay to $9 an hour, from $11.10, and ultimately to cut the maximum base pay to $11 an hour, from $13. For new workers, the company would reduce maximum vacation to four weeks, compared with six weeks for current workers. Tyson also wants workers to contribute more toward their health coverage and accept a less comprehensive plan and to freeze pensions so that workers would not get larger pensions the longer they work. Instead, Tyson wants to institute a 401(k) program, which is less costly to the company.
"Jefferson was in a luxurious position from our perspective," Mr. Kimbro said. "It's just a case of being an outlier."
Mr. Moehling, who has worked at the plant for 22 years, said: "The company asked, 'Why should we be sitting on this pedestal in Wisconsin?' Well, we're just scraping by. We're making $27,000 a year. That's not a lot of money. It's just enough to survive in this state. We have high heating bills and some of the highest tax rates in the nation."
If the union accepted Tyson's demands, he said, the lower pension and higher health premiums would force him to take a second job. "We can't afford to live on the concessions they're demanding," he said.
"If you take a second job, you end up with less time for your family," Mr. Moehling continued. "I have an 11-year-old girl and 9-year-old twin boys, and I do a lot of coaching, but if I have to take a second job, you can forget about the coaching."
Mr. Kimbro said Tyson was mindful of such considerations. "We're not pleading poverty," he said. "We're not saying the Jefferson facility is losing money. We're saying the cost in Jefferson is out of line and we have to make adjustments."

HEADLINE: Next for Civil Rights 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert ("Civil Rights, the Sequel," column, July 7) is right to call for another civil rights movement. 
But the next movement needs to zero in on the root cure: reparations. This would involve a generations-long program of education, employment and economic development to remedy the effects of more than three centuries of slavery and Jim Crow laws.
 Blacks must now move back to the roots of the first civil rights movement, and this time stay with root corrections -- reparations. Blacks must push for reparations, strengthen their self-images to withstand the resulting negative reactions and measure their results in terms of success by degrees, from one generation to the next.

HEADLINE: In Africa, Money Won't Be Enough 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "A Rich Nation, a Poor Continent" (Op-Ed, July 9), Jeffrey D. Sachs proposes that America's 400 wealthiest citizens contribute $7 billion toward health care in Africa, calling this an opportunity to "take some responsibility for the dire state of the world's poorest citizens." 
 But Africa is poor not because Africans suffer severe health problems. Rather, Africans suffer severe health problems because they are poor. And they are poor because they have very little economic freedom. 
In a recent study by the Cato Institute, two economists, James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, found that "economic freedom is highly correlated with per-capita income, economic growth, and life expectancy."
Africans need freedom, not handouts.

HEADLINE: In Africa, Money Won't Be Enough 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A Rich Nation, a Poor Continent," by Jeffrey D. Sachs (Op-Ed, July 9): The Human Development Report just released by the United Nations Development Program shows the bleak prospects for much of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Instead of beating up on rich nations, and now rich individuals, for not contributing enough, Mr. Sachs should grapple with the tough issues. 
 We should be looking at the factors that have eroded Africa's ability to make productive use of financial resources, whatever their provenance. Even the natural wealth of many African countries has not served a poor continent. 
The temptation to find startling solutions to Africa's development crisis should be resisted. Increasing market access, reducing the subsidies rich countries pay their farmers, the full disclosure of the payments by oil companies to African countries and improving governance are some of the initiatives that must accompany enhanced financial flows and debt relief.

HEADLINE: Southwestern Suburbs Top List of Fastest-Growing Cities 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Americans on the move are seeking space and sun, turning once-sleepy suburbs in Arizona, California and Nevada into the fastest-growing cities in the country, Census Bureau estimates released today show.
 The Phoenix suburb of Gilbert has grown by nearly 25 percent in a little more than two years to lead the way, according to the estimates. Cities around Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego also experienced population booms from April 2000 to July 2002. 
 Some of the new residents are people who left larger nearby cities, but much of the growth was attributable to the continued migration of Americans to the South and West.
"Most of the places aren't job centers," said Robert Lang, a demographer with the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. "They are mostly residential, master-planned, large-scale and very homeowners-association heavy." 
Older, industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest like St. Louis, Detroit and Pittsburgh continued losing residents. In addition, some places that grew during the 1990's lost population as the economy cooled and housing prices remained high, said William Frey, demographer with the Brookings Institution, a Washington research organization.
For instance, San Francisco's population dropped nearly 2 percent from 2000 to 2002 after rising 7 percent in the 1990's. Two San Francisco suburbs, Sunnyvale and Daly City, also had declines.
The estimates are the first city population figures released by the federal government since the 2000 census. The Census Bureau used records like birth and death rolls and tax returns to rank the 242 cities with populations of 100,000 or more.
The numbers are used by the federal government in formulas that determine the distribution of more than $185 billion in financing for programs like Medicaid and foster care. States also use the updated estimates for money allocations.
New York remains the country's largest city, with 8.1 million residents, an increase of just less than 1 percent, or about 76,000 people. It was followed by Los Angeles, with 3.8 million; Chicago, with 2.9 million; Houston, with 2 million; and Philadelphia, with 1.5 million.
Chicago lost about 9,800 residents; Philadelphia lost about 25,000.
Gilbert, Ariz., added as many people as Philadelphia lost, to bring its population to 135,000. Though it is still considered a town rather than a city, fewer of the dairy farms and wheat fields that filled the landscape two decades ago remain.
Growth comes with the usual assortment of headaches, most notably crowded schools and roads. Access to water is also an especially acute problem in the Southwest.
"They say there are two kinds of roads here, under construction and not enough lanes," said Rachelle Iadicicco, a mother of four who moved to Gilbert from St. Louis two years ago after her husband, a Lutheran minister, started a church.
The lower taxes and relative tranquillity of the city make up for the traffic tie-ups, Ms. Iadicicco said.
Two Las Vegas suburbs, North Las Vegas and Henderson, followed Gilbert on the list, each surging over 17 percent, while two other Phoenix suburbs, Chandler and Peoria, rounded out the top five.
In fact, Peoria, Ariz., now is larger than Peoria, Ill., with 123,239 residents compared with 112,670.
Three Los Angeles suburbs, Irvine, Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga, were also among the 10 fastest-growing cities, as well as the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista. The availability of more affordable homes and cheaper cost of living led to growth in these areas, said Hans Johnson, a demographer with the Public Policy Institute of California.

HEADLINE: MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK; 
Teaching Game Just One Part of a Manager's Job

BYLINE:  By FRED BIERMAN

 BODY:
The duties of a manager in the lower levels of the minor leagues go far beyond teaching the game.
 "You're like a symphony conductor," said JOE ALMARAZ, manager of the Aberdeen Iron Birds of Maryland in the short-season Class A New York Penn League. "There's a lot of work involved. A lot of these guys are away from home for the first time, and it's your job to acclimate them to the life of professional baseball." 
 Most players are with their first professional team and some are fresh out of high school. In basketball and football, players have months between being drafted and the start of their professional careers; baseball players have only a few weeks.
 IAN STEWART, chosen 10th over all by the Colorado Rockies in the amateur draft, graduated from high school June 17 and two weeks later was in Casper, Wyo., reporting to the Casper Rockies of the rookie-level Pioneer League. To make a player's transition easier, the Rockies and other teams often arrange for a player to live with a local family.
 "In some ways it's been hard," Stewart said. "But the coaches and my host family have made it a lot easier."
 With players like Stewart, it is not only youth and inexperience that their managers have to cope with.
 "It's a very unique experience in professional baseball," said P.J. CAREY, the manager of the Casper Rockies. "It seems that we wind up with players from just about every area of life. We have kids from the Caribbean and Latin America who speak only Spanish right now. We have kids from the Orient, we have kids from mid-America, kids from Southern California and kids from New York. They come from every economic and social background imaginable."
 While young players often display a level of talent beyond their years, managers must keep in mind that a player's skills can outweigh his maturity. 
 "The fact of the matter is that these kids are only 18 and they're only a couple of weeks out of high school," said Carey, who is in his 19th season as a minor league manager. "The game is going to challenge them physically. It's going to challenge them mentally. They're going to miss their families. I mean just about every transition they make going to adulthood they make in the context of professional baseball, and me and the coaching staff have to be there with them through those times."

Fast Start for Ring
 So far so good for ROYCE RING and the Binghamton Mets.
 Ring, who was the centerpiece of the trade that sent second basemen ROBERTO ALOMAR from the Mets to the Chicago White Sox, earned the victory in dramatic fashion in his first appearance with the Mets' Class AA affiliate on Saturday.
 Ring entered the game against the Norwich Navigators in the eighth inning with the score tied and runners on first and third. In addition, his new team was trying to snap a 10-game losing streak. Ring induced a ground-ball double play to end the inning. 
 After Binghamton scored in the top of the ninth, Ring retired the side in order for the victory. 
 On Wednesday night, he earned his first save, striking out five in one and two-thirds innings. 

Success for Seguignol
 In what has been a somewhat disappointing season for the Columbus Clippers, FERNANDO SEGUIGNOL has been a bright spot.
 After hitting 23 home runs last season for the Orix Blue Wave in the Japanese League, Seguignol was signed to a Class AAA contract by the Yankees. 
 Last week Seguignol, a 28-year-old switch-hitter, went 12 for 48 with 14 runs batted in and hit 6 home runs over a five-game stretch from Monday to Friday.
 Seguignol is tied for the International League lead with 14 home runs.

Ankiel Out for Season
 RICK ANKIEL, whose control problems forced the St. Louis Cardinals to send him to the minor leagues in 2001, is out for the season with a torn ligament in his left elbow. 
 Ankiel, who won 11 games and struck out 194 batters for the Cardinals in 2000, had just completed two of his best outings for the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern League.
 In the two starts, Ankiel allowed only 4 hits in 14 innings with 18 strikeouts and 5 walks. For the season he was 2-6 with a 6.29 earned run average and 64 strikeouts in 54 1/3 innings. He also threw 10 wild pitches. FRED BIERMAN

HEADLINE: Sowing Seeds of Destruction 

BYLINE:  By Charles M. Benbrook; Charles Benbrook, an agricultural consultant, runs Ag BioTech InfoNet, a Web site.

DATELINE: SAND POINT, Idaho 

 BODY:
Though President Bush deserves praise for going to Africa and talking about hunger, his proposals for addressing the problem are likely to make it worse. American farm and trade policies -- particularly the promotion of American-style agricultural biotechnology -- will do little to alleviate hunger.
 In the weeks before the president's trip, the administration stepped up its efforts to promote biotechnology and genetically modified food. In May, the United States filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the European Union for its moratorium against the approval of genetically modified crops. The administration claimed that European policies have turned some African nations against biotechnology, thereby undermining American efforts to help Africa. In a speech last month to biotech leaders, the president said, "We must help troubled nations to avert famine by sharing with them the most advanced methods of crop production." 
 The president is right that African farmers will benefit from new knowledge and technology. But he's wrong about which technologies we should be offering. African farmers neither need nor want to produce American-style genetically modified crops. 
It is easy to understand Africa's lack of enthusiasm. The first generation of genetically modified food crops -- corn and soybean seeds -- were created to make pest management simpler on America's large, mechanized farms. The technologies would be far less effective on African farms, which are small and diversified and rely largely on human labor.
These technologies don't make economic sense. In the United States, most farmers planting genetically modified seeds break even -- the increase in seed costs, approximately 35 percent, is covered by reductions in pesticide expenses or marginally higher yields. In stable, well-irrigated environments, these crops enable individual farmers to cultivate more land.
In Africa, however, these benefits can be burdens. For cash-poor farmers, the cost of genetically modified seed would be prohibitive. Moreover, genetically modified crops need near-perfect growing conditions. In dry areas, they require irrigation systems and the water to run them. They also need to be managed with special care. For example, crops are engineered to work with specific herbicides; the wrong herbicide can ruin an entire crop. In Africa, where pesticides are often misbranded, sold in unmarked containers or handled by people who cannot read, this can be a problem. 
Governments will also bear increased responsibilities and costs in carrying out and assessing health and environmental safety testing for these crops, a task few African nations are able to take on.
Africans recognize these drawbacks and that's why American efforts to promote genetically modified crops have backfired. The initiative to introduce genetically modified corn to Zambia through American food aid donations in 2002 clearly did not work out the way the administration had hoped. The Zambians were vocal in their refusal. And the move brought simmering global tensions over biotechnology to a boil at last summer's global environmental summit meeting in Johannesburg and raised questions about American motives, priorities and understanding of the roots of hunger. Despite a full-court press by the Bush administration and some members of Congress, the Zambians have stood by their decision to reject such food aid.
African farmers face a multitude of challenges. Drought is a recurrent problem. Soils are often worn out. Depressed commodity prices undercut human enterprise. Land tenure systems and reluctance to direct financial and technical assistance to the women who do the majority of the work on many farms are social issues that undermine farm productivity, as are civil strife and AIDS. For these problems, biotechnology has little to offer.
The only way Africans can afford today's genetically modified seeds is for us to give the seeds or technology to them no strings attached, a highly unlikely scenario. Before contemplating this approach, though, Americans should know that their money and expertise might be better directed doing the things that Africans themselves might actually find useful.

HEADLINE: Showdown Looms in Europe Over Proposals on Accounting 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A BATTLE ROYAL over accounting is breaking out in Europe. The leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board, which is trying to impose new rules on financial institutions, have been denounced by one of France's most prominent business leaders as "ayatollah accountants" who refuse to be reasonable.
 The battle is over accounting rules for financial institutions. Even some of the harshest critics of the international board concede that rules in some European countries have been weak and subject to abuse, but they are furious about proposed rules that would require many derivative securities to be shown at market value on financial statements, something that often does not happen now and that some suspect could be allowing companies to hide losses. Many other assets and liabilities would also have to be shown at market value, leading to what opponents call unnecessary volatility in profits and perhaps causing some insurers to avoid volatility by shunning stocks and corporate bonds. 
 If the accounting board does not back down, the battle is likely to lead to a political showdown that could severely damage the board and stop Europe from getting unified accounting standards in 2005, as it intends to do. But if the board is seen as caving in to political pressure, that could destroy its reputation outside of Europe.
"Banks are not a normal business," said Gerard Gil, group chief accountant for BNP Paribas. "They have a special role in the economy. It is necessary that financial stability be preserved." 
Such arguments make little headway with accounting rule makers. "I've never understood how reporting what was going on creates economic instability," said Wayne Upton, an American who is research director for the international board. "It seems to me that ignoring what is going on, as we learned with the savings and loans, is what creates problems." 
The details are arcane, and in fact some compromises have been reached, with more likely. But with the board close to issuing its final decisions, some Europeans have concluded the time for negotiating is past. They are painting disputes over accounting policies as cultural issues pitting Europe against the United States.
It was Claude Bebear, the chairman of AXA, the French insurer, who compared accounting rule makers to Iranian religious leaders. Most of them are from the United States, he said, but "there is a super-super-ayatollah who is not even American but is from Scotland" and "has a fascination with market value." Sir David Tweedie, the Scottish chairman of the international board, was traveling and unavailable for comment.
In an interview, Henri de Castries, Mr. Bebear's successor as AXA's chief executive, was no less angry. The international board members were "extremely dogmatic," he said. "Immediate fair market value, in my mind, doesn't mean anything." What is important is long-term values, and investors could be misled if companies like his were forced to reduce the value of their assets just because a volatile market marked them down.
While the European Union has agreed that rules of the international accounting standards board be binding on all European companies starting in 2005, its executive arm, the European Commission, will retain the power to overturn an international standard.
And that, Mr. de Castries said, is what it should do. "Because, at the end of the day, this is a political decision," he said. "What sort of system and economic goals do you want?" 
Would such a rejection destroy the international board. "I don't know," Mr. de Castries said. "It is not my problem."

HEADLINE: Bush Promotes His Plans to Help Africa 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: GABORONE, Botswana, July 10 

 BODY:
President Bush visited Botswana today to promote his proposals to help Africa fight AIDS and overcome poverty, saying he wants the world to know "that we're not only a powerful nation, we're also a compassionate nation."
 But his visit coincided with action by Congress to trim the budgets for the two main proposals he highlighted here, a plan to increase aid to countries that make demonstrable progress toward democracy and free markets and a program to send $15 billion to some of the world's poorest nations over the next five years to combat AIDS. 
 In choosing to come to Botswana on the third day of his swing through Africa, Mr. Bush put a spotlight on a nation that embodies much of the promise of Africa, having posted a solid record of economic growth that has enabled it to build a middle class and considerable political stability. 
But Botswana also suffers from one of the world's highest rates of H.I.V., with 39 percent of adults infected, making it not only home to an enormous human tragedy but also a laboratory for initiatives to bring the pandemic under control.
Mr. Bush spent his day meeting with Botswana's leaders, stopping by a trade fair that exhibited handmade goods for export and touring a game park, where the animals he encountered included, to his obvious amusement, a pair of mating elephants.
Like many of the other African nations that have succeeded in moving toward economic and political stability, Botswana and its president, Festus G. Mogae, have increasingly emphasized fighting poverty by developing industries that can export products to the rest of the world. Much of Mr. Mogae's discussion today with Mr. Bush involved pressing the United States to open its market more fully to African goods and working to end other trade practices, including heavy subsidies to American and European farmers, that make it hard for Africa to compete in world markets.
Mr. Bush said that he had heard the same message from President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa on Wednesday and that he expected to hear similar messages for the rest of his trip through Africa.
"It will come up in every country we come to, because African leaders are worried that subsidies, agricultural subsidies, are undermining their capacity to become self-sufficient in food," Mr. Bush said.
He said the United States wanted to resolve the issue through talks on a new global trade accord that would also require Europe and Japan to cut their agricultural subsidies. He repeated his message that Europe had a special responsibility to drop its ban on imports of genetically modified crops from Africa, saying that it discourages African farmers from investing in techniques that could help end hunger on the continent.
Africa's halting economic progress and the attempts by countries like Botswana to become part of the global economy have coincided with a sharp decline in trade between Africa and the rest of the world.
The World Bank has calculated that Africa's share of world exports has dropped by nearly 60 percent to 1.5 percent at end of 1990's from 3.5 percent in 1970. The bank said the drop represented a loss equivalent to 21 percent of the region's total economic output and more than five times the $13 billion in annual aid flows to Africa.
As the Bush administration was confronting pressure from Africans to do more on trade, it was faced with pressure from many Democrats in Congress to make good on its promises to help the poorest nations.
A House appropriations subcommittee took up a measure that would finance Mr. Bush's AIDS proposal at $2 billion next year, $1 billion less than called for in legislation Mr. Bush signed this spring but about the same as the administration called for at the beginning of this year. The subcommittee also moved to reduce first-year financing for Mr. Bush's economic development plan, the Millennium Challenge Account, to $800 million from the $1.3 billion the administration had requested.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is traveling with the president, said he "would have preferred to see full funding" of the AIDS program.
Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, said the administration had not pushed hard enough for the money.
Mr. Bush's "public remarks would have you believe that his H.I.V./AIDS and Millennium Challenge Account initiatives will offer significant additional resources and solve the crisis," she said. "These contentions are largely a fraud."
But Representative Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who heads the subcommittee, said the panel was constrained by a $17.1 billion spending cap that required reductions in other programs. He said the bill allocated 40 percent more to global AIDS programs than Congress appropriated last year, and he contended that the money was sufficient to get both the AIDS program and the Millennium Challenge Account started.
"A plane doesn't take off at 500 miles, and it doesn't take off at 30,000 feet," Mr. Kolbe said. 'It takes off slower, and it climbs. And we do the same thing with programs, which is how you ramp them up."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Remains High As Oil ImportsSet a Record 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit remained near record levels in May at $41.84 billion, as exports struggled to show growth and record demand for foreign oil helped push imports slightly higher, the Commerce Department said today. 
 The trade gap was the third highest on record and was slightly wider than the revised estimate of $41.65 billion for April. The May tally was in line with an average estimate of $41.50 billion made by analysts before the report. 
 Crude oil imports increased to a record 320.5 million barrels, while average prices fell for the third consecutive month, to $24.11 a barrel. They were also the lowest since July 2002. 
The drop in oil prices trimmed $800 million from the value of imports, despite the record volume. Overall imports rose slightly to $123.89 billion, led by increased demand for foreign cars, auto parts and capital goods. 
Exports rose slightly to $82.05 billion, led by capital goods, cars, auto parts and industrial supplies. Despite the dollar's drop, which should make goods made in the United States more attractive on the world market, exports have been stuck in a range of $82 billion to $83 billion over the last year -- a reflection of continuing weak demand overseas. 
On balance, the trade gap "was pretty much as expected," said Patrick Fearon, an economist with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "However, you have to keep in mind that these are pretty big trade deficits. And it reflects the fact that the global economy is weak, especially global capital spending."
Trans-Atlantic trade declined slightly in May, a possible result of tensions caused by the Iraq war. Exports from the United States to Western Europe dropped about 1.3 percent, to $13.82 billion, while United States imports from the region fell about 1.6 percent, to $22.08 billion.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Formally Designates U.S. Steel Tariffs as Illegal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 11 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization issued its formal finding today that steel tariffs imposed by the United States last year were illegal. The ruling could lead the European Union and other nations to retaliate later this year with sanctions on American exports. 
 The United States will appeal the decision, said Richard Mills, a spokesman for the office of the United States trade representative. "In the meantime, the steel safeguard measures will remain in place," he said in a statement. 
 Today's ruling came after an interim ruling in March also went against the United States. The ruling now goes to an appellate body of seven judges within the W.T.O. that is expected to give its final word in late November or early December.
If Washington's appeal fails, the European Union will impose sanctions on American imports worth as much as $2.2 billion almost immediately, said Arancha Gonzalez, the European Commission spokeswoman on trade issues.
Although the United States granted many European steel makers exemptions from the import tariffs, Europe will still push for the maximum sanctions allowed by the World Trade Organization, she said.
"The exemptions were granted to help U.S. steel users, not to give European steel makers a present," she said, adding "there is no reason to modify the $2.2 billion sanctions list."
Trade lawyers, however, said they expected that the Europeans would ultimately have to pare their list. "The W.T.O. would call for a reduction in the amount of U.S. products to be targeted," said Richard Weiner, a trade specialist in the Brussels office of the law firm of Hogan & Hartson.
In March 2002, the Bush administration imposed tariffs of nearly 30 percent on most types of steel imported from Europe, Asia and South America, in an effort to protect the troubled American industry. The administration subsequently scaled back the tariffs, exempting a further 178 steel products and largely defusing the dispute with Europe. 
The W.T.O. panel, which was set up to consider complaints by the European Union, Japan, South Korea, China, Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand and Brazil, concluded that the United States did not have grounds to impose the tariffs as a way of safeguarding the American steel industry from a flood of imports.
The United States was wrong to assert that imports were rising in many steel categories, the panel said today in a 1,000-page report.
It also failed to prove a link between an increase in imports in some sectors and any serious injury suffered by American steel makers as a result of those increases.
The United States trade representive's office argued today that the tariffs had ignited an "unprecedented level of consolidation and restructuring" within the American steel industry. It defended its right to use measures like tariffs to safeguard domestic industry.
"The administration has demonstrated its willingness to both defend and use these laws, and other trade remedy laws," the office said in its statement.

HEADLINE: Liberian Faction Says It May Fight Peacekeepers 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, July 11 

 BODY:
In an effort to increase the pressure on President Charles Taylor to step aside, the rebel group that calls itself Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy threatened today to fight West African peacekeepers if they arrived before Mr. Taylor's departure. 
 "Any troops deployed before the departure of Taylor must be prepared for a firefight," the statement read. 
 The announcement comes as the Bush administration considers whether to send American soldiers to stabilize Liberia, or to restrict its efforts to financial and logistical support for the West African contingent. The Pentagon has dispatched a team of experts to assess how it can help. 
The Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas, has said it is prepared to send 1,000 soldiers here in two weeks. 
Mr. Taylor, who remains under indictment by a war crimes tribunal in neighboring Sierra Leone, has insisted that he will not step down until after the arrival of peacekeepers, warning that otherwise the result would be chaos.

HEADLINE: Prices Rose At Wholesale Last Month 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices moved up in June, reflecting a surge in energy costs, after two months of decline. The combination of higher fuel bills and weak prices for many other products gave profit-squeezed businesses little to cheer about. 
 The Producer Price Index, which measures prices before they reach consumers, rose 0.5 percent in June from May, the Labor Department reported today. The increase came after wholesale costs plunged a record 1.9 percent in April and dipped 0.3 percent in May. 
 Excluding energy and food prices, core wholesale prices -- those of all other products -- edged down 0.1 percent in June, after inching up by that amount in May. That suggests that many other product prices remain soft, economists said.
"Businesses are finding it difficult to raise prices but at the same time they are affected by increases in the costs of energy, health care and insurance and that means ongoing pressure on profit margins," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management. 
Economists believed that the report would not eliminate the Federal Reserve's fears about deflation, an economically dangerous long-term slide in prices. 
"If you don't like inflation, then the producer price report was good news," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers. "If you don't like deflation the report was not as great. Negative signs far outnumbered positive signs, and that indicates the downward pressure on prices continues." 
To help the economy, the Federal Reserve reduced a major interest rate on June 25 by one-quarter point, to 1 percent, a 45-year low. The rate cut was aimed at bolstering economic growth, to help prevent an outbreak of deflation. 
Although Fed policy makers still say the chance of deflation is remote, the central bank must remain alert because of deflation's potential to wreck the economy, economists said. 
The nation's last serious deflation occurred during the Great Depression. A bad case of deflation can lead not only to widespread price declines -- from goods and services to real estate and stocks -- but also to job losses and pay cuts. 
The decline in core prices last month reflected falling prices for a range of products. The prices of cars and communications equipment fell 0.7 percent each. Light truck prices went down 1.5 percent. Prices for household appliances dipped 0.4 percent and prices of sporting goods fell 0.2 percent. Computer prices declined 1.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Solutions for the Salton Sea 

 BODY:
Southern California's Salton Sea has lost much of the appeal it once enjoyed with tourists. A lot of the fish died off, and people began worrying about pollution. To the fish that still call it home, however, as well the millions of birds that use it as a migratory stopover, the Salton Sea is still crucial. At the moment it is caught in the middle of an interstate dispute that threatens to reduce, if not entirely cut off, its chief source of water: irrigation runoff from Imperial Valley farms. 
 The sea has no natural system of water flowing in and out. It was created roughly 100 years ago in a desert basin by flooding from the Colorado River. Water moves out of the sea mostly by evaporation, leaving behind salt and increasing the sea's salinity. The sea is now 25 percent saltier than the Pacific Ocean. Without water from irrigation runoff, it could completely evaporate in as little as 15 years, by some estimates. 
 Hence the relevance of the current dispute. For years, the Western states that depend on the Colorado River for their water have been allotted quotas. California regularly exceeded its quota by as much as 20 percent until Gale Norton, the interior secretary, reduced the state's ration at the beginning of this year because it had failed to agree on plausible ways to decrease consumption.
Ms. Norton's department has suggested various strategies. One is get Imperial Valley farmers to reduce the water they use for irrigation, mainly by using more modern methods. Such improvements would free up water for city dwellers in San Diego. Unfortunately, it could also kill the Salton Sea because less irrigation water means less runoff.
So the question is whether California can live within its limits, providing enough water for the cities and saving the sea. One plan is to build a desalinization plant, while shrinking the size of the sea. The plant would desalinate runoff as it entered the sea so it could be sold to the cities, leaving behind water for the sea.
This would be expensive, costing maybe $2 billion. Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis of California has proposed a two-year, $20 million inquiry into different restoration strategies.
This is a complex issue, environmentally and economically. One hopeful sign is that many state authorities seem determined to save the sea. That is important. At issue here is not just a reservoir for runoff, but an important ecosystem.

HEADLINE: Builder Rules Out Syracuse for Mega-Mall, Official Says 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 11 

 BODY:
An official at an upstate development company said today that the company had decided not to build the nation's largest mall and tourist center in Syracuse.
 But the official with company, Pyramid Management Group, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said the plan for the mega-mall would not be abandoned altogether. The mall, known as DestiNY USA, a $2.2 billion behemoth of a shopping, tourism and entertainment complex, will be erected somewhere else within New York State or in the Northeast United States, he said. 
 "The decision has been made not to build this project in the city of Syracuse," the Pyramid company official said. "This is something that could easily be built outside of the city, in Onondaga County, or any place else in the state or any other state." 
The official said a public announcement had been planned for Monday or Tuesday to outline the official reasons for the decision, which he said was the result of a series of "difficulties with the city's administration."
Specifically, company executives have grown mistrustful of the city over a series of recent issues regarding the zoning of land to be developed, as well as agreements that govern how the project will go forward, company officials said today.
Questions were swirling today after officials of the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce told The Post-Standard, a Syracuse newspaper, that the developer had told them in a meeting last week that the project was dead.
But Matthew J. Driscoll, the mayor of Syracuse, said today that he had not heard from the developer, Robert J. Congel, one of the founders of the Pyramid mall empire, about whether the project would go forward in the city.
"He has not communicated to me that DestiNY is done," said Mr. Driscoll, who said he was perplexed about why the company had not communicated its concerns earlier. "I stand ready, willing and able to help them move this vision forward."
In the past year, promoters of the mall have touted its square footage (more than twice that of the Empire State Building); its amenities (400 stores, 30 cafes and a 20-screen movie complex); and its promise to enrich the region (a company consultant estimated that it would create as many as 122,000 jobs and $12.5 billion in economic activity). The company says it has invested more than $100 million to date on legal, architectural and other costs.
But with the likelihood of finding private investors to underwrite the entire project in question, company executives lobbied extensively this spring in Albany. They tried to persuade lawmakers to guarantee that the company would continue to receive tax benefits of up to $600 million over 14 years that it is entitled to under the state's Empire Zone program, even if that program is later disbanded.
Though no formal bill on the matter surfaced this session, company executives, Gov. George E. Pataki and the state's two top legislative leaders remained hopeful that a deal could be worked out, perhaps when the Legislature reconvenes in a special session this fall.
"Both houses were working together to try to resolve this," Charles R. Carrier, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said today, adding that Mr. Silver had not been told that the deal was dead.
"The Speaker was always favorably impressed with the concept and what it might mean to the central New York region," he said. "But, on the other hand, there were a lot of difficulties in answering questions and putting together the details, and that's still where things stood when the session ended."
Pyramid officials said they were encouraged by their experience in Albany, though disappointed with the outcome. What raised their ire, company officials said today, were a series of developments in Syracuse.
They said that an effort to rezone a section at the southern end of Onondaga Lake as residential directly conflicted with the DestiNY USA project and with plans to build a 43-story hotel on the site. Also, they said, an agreement that would dictate the relationship between the city and the company was approved by the Syracuse Industrial Development Agency before negotiations were finalized.
Mayor Driscoll rejected as false claims that any zoning changes would conflict with the project. He said he had requested that a zoning vote be delayed until fall. He said changes in the industrial development agency agreement had been sent to the company three days before the agreement was approved.
David Cordeau, the president of the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce, said he had met with Mr. Congel this month.
"He said it's not going to happen here," Mr. Cordeau said.
Still, Mr. Cordeau said he spent much of today meeting with supporters of the project, trying to organize them to persuade the developers to stay in the area. "There's an army of people behind this project," he said. "None of us would be able to sleep if we didn't make one more run at this."
When asked if the decision to abandon the city of Syracuse could change during the weekend, the Pyramid official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no.
"This is an absolute, cut-in-granite decision," he said. "One thousand percent." He added: "It will not be built within the city limits. It will be built somewhere else."
Several nearby states have been courting Mr. Congel, the company official said. If DestiNY USA is not built in the Syracuse area, Mr. Cordeau said, "We will have missed the biggest opportunity we ever will have."

HEADLINE: Blacks Lose Better Jobs Faster As Middle-Class Work Drops 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Unemployment among blacks is rising at a faster pace than in any similar period since the mid-1970's, and the jobs lost have been mostly in manufacturing, where the pay for blacks has historically been higher than in many other fields.
 Nearly 2.6 million jobs have disappeared over all during the last 28 months, which began with a brief recession that has faded into a weak recovery. Nearly 90 percent of those lost jobs were in manufacturing, according to government data, with blacks hit disproportionately harder than whites. 
 At the same time, jobless black Americans have been unusually persistent about staying in the labor force. Having landed millions of jobs in the booming 1990's, they have continued to look for new ones in the soft economy, and so are counted now as unemployed; if they gave up trying to find work, they would not be counted. 
These two phenomena help to explain why the black unemployment rate, though still not high by historic standards, is rising twice as fast as that of whites, and faster than in any downturn since the mid-1970's recession. Low-wage workers and women who went from welfare to work in the 1990's have largely kept their jobs; factory breadwinners have borne the pain, men and women alike.
"The number of jobs and the types of jobs that have been lost have severely diminished the standing of many blacks in the middle class," said William Lucy, president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists.
In Indianapolis, for example, Autoliv, a Swedish manufacturer of seat belts, is closing a plant and laying off 350 workers, more than 75 percent of them black. Many are young adults who were hired in the late 1990's when the unemployment rate in Indianapolis was only 2 percent and Autoliv, to recruit enough workers to expand production, hired young men without high school diplomas. 
"They were taken from the street into decent-paying jobs; they were making $12 to $13 an hour," said Michael Barnes, director of an A.F.L.-C.I.O. training program that helps laid-off workers in Indiana search for new jobs. "These young men started families, dug in, took apartments, purchased vehicles. It was an up-from-the-street experience for them, and now they are being returned to their old environment."
It is not only the recently hired who are losing jobs. So are tens of thousands of textile workers in the South, many with long tenure, as production in the industry shifts to China and India. Bruce Raynor, president of Unite, the union that represents textile workers, ticked off a few of the more recent losses: 1,000 jobs lost in the last two years as mills closed in Roanoke Rapids, N.C.; another 1,000 in mill closings in Columbus, Ga.; 1,500 lost in the closing of a sweatshirt factory in Martinsville, Va.
These workers are mostly black men and women who were earning $11 an hour plus benefits in small towns where other jobs, if there are any, do not pay as well.
"This is not like the cyclical downturns in the old days, when you got furloughed for a few weeks and then recalled," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "These jobs are gone, and that represents a potentially significant slide in living standards."
Black employment in manufacturing, once concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast, is now spread across every state as companies have migrated to lower-wage towns and cities. With an increasing number of these companies migrating again, this time overseas in search of yet lower labor costs, the job loss in manufacturing has intensified. Every state has lost manufacturing jobs over the last three years, according to a study by the National Association of Manufacturers. 
In 2000, there were 2 million black Americans working in factory jobs, or 10.1 percent of the nation's total of 20 million manufacturing workers. Blacks were represented in the overall work force in roughly the same proportion. Then came the recession that began in March 2001; since then, 300,000 factory jobs held by blacks, or 15 percent, have disappeared. White workers lost many factory jobs, too -- 1.7 million in all. But because they were much more numerous to begin with, proportionally the damage was less, just 10 percent. 
These job losses figure significantly in the rise in the unemployment rate among blacks 20 years of age or older. It has gone up 3.5 percentage points since the onset of the recession, while the rate among whites has risen less than half as much, 1.7 percentage points.
Most damaging, blacks' share of the remaining manufacturing jobs has slipped to 9.6 percent. "Half a percentage point may not sound like much," Mr. Bernstein said, "but to lose that much in such an important sector over a relatively short period, that is going to be hard to recover." 
Hispanic workers, in contrast, have fared better over the last 28 months, even expanding their share of manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Their overall unemployment rate rose 2.2 percentage points, in line with the increase for the nation as a whole. The national unemployment rate now stands at 6.4 percent.
While blacks have been big losers in the 28 months of recession and weak recovery, they made big gains in the tight labor markets of the late 1990's. Their unemployment rate, which had soared as high as 18 percent in the aftermath of the severe 1981-82 recession and was nearly 13 percent in the early 1990's, fell to less than 7 percent, on average, in 1999 and 2000 -- close to the overall rate of less than 5 percent. Never since the Labor Department began to track unemployment by race in 1972 had black unemployment been so low for a sustained period. Now it is 10.5 percent for blacks 20 years of age or older.
The shift in fortunes is evident in a poll that David Bositis, a political scientist at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, conducts periodically among blacks, asking 850 people representing a cross section of the black population whether they consider themselves financially better off than a year before, worse off, or the same. In October 2000, the responses were quite positive: 45 percent better off, 10 percent worse off, 44 percent the same. But by October 2002, only 18.9 percent said they were better off than a year earlier, while 36.7 percent considered themselves worse off and 42.6 percent said their circumstances had not changed. "That is an enormous shift," Mr. Bositis said.
For all the setbacks, black Americans have not diminished their presence in the labor force. During the late 1990's, the percentage of black Americans who were in the labor force -- that is, either held jobs or were actively looking for them and therefore counted as unemployed -- rose by two percentage points to more than 68 percent, the highest level on record. Significantly, in the subsequent downturn that high participation rate has held.
That means that the number of black people looking for jobs is higher now than in previous eras -- a statistic that some analyst see as a reason for optimism. "People are coming out of a favorable labor market," said William Spriggs, executive director of the National League for Opportunity and Equality. "They are still optimistic, and they are more skilled, which means they are more willing to continue to look for work."
Others see suffering in the same data. Not since the Depression has the nation's work force contracted for so many months after a recession began. "Reluctance may be part of the reason blacks are not leaving the labor force," Mr. Bernstein said, acknowledging Mr. Spriggs's point. "But you leave a lousy labor market because you can afford to do so, and in a jobless recovery that has persisted for so long, many blacks don't have the savings to make a go of it without a paycheck."

HEADLINE: Verizon Is Told It Must Reinstate 2,300Workers Let Go Last Year 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
An arbitrator has ruled that Verizon Communications improperly laid off 2,300 workers in December and must reinstate them, a decision that union officials hailed but that company executives said underlined Verizon's need to gain more flexibility in contract talks to cut costs.
 In a 59-page ruling that the parties received yesterday, the arbitrator, Shyam Das, concluded that Verizon violated a job-security provision that said the company could not lay off union workers unless an external event directly reduced the need for employees. 
 Verizon had argued that the recession, fierce competition, the telecommunications slump and the substitution of wireless service for land-line service constituted such an external event. 
Mr. Das, who also serves as an arbitrator for baseball players and owners, wrote that "this ongoing evolution in the industry" did not "have the characteristics of a discrete 'external event' " that would allow for layoffs.
As a result, he said, the 2,300 workers, almost all of them field technicians and operators in New York State, must be reinstated with full back pay, minus severance payments or other income they had received since December. Verizon's main union, the Communications Workers of America, said it would meet with the company on Tuesday to discuss a schedule for reinstatement.
"It's a tremendous victory for the union and all the employees and families," said Pamela Galpern, an installation and repair worker in Manhattan who was laid off in December after three years on the job. "These are workers who want to work. Verizon needs them to provide good service."
In a statement, Verizon said it was disappointed with the arbitrator's decision and believed that it had followed the contract. Employees in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have filed similar complaints with other arbitrators. 
Because of the ruling, Verizon said it was imperative that it gain increased flexibility to lay off and transfer workers in current contract talks. The contract for 75,000 workers from two unions expires on Aug. 2.
"The decision does not change the need for the company to address the challenges facing the business," Verizon said. "The difficult business conditions facing the company -- the same conditions that caused the layoffs -- all remain. The company and unions will have to address job security issues in the current bargaining to match them to the changing telecommunications industry."
Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, estimated that the company owed $25 million in back pay. But Larry Mancino, the communications workers' top official in the Northeast, said the figure would top $100 million.
Saying the arbitrator's decision surprised him, Mr. Mancino said, "It takes a real gutsy arbitrator to rule the way this arbitrator ruled."
The union said, "This decision is also very good news for consumers who deserve high-quality telecom services and for shareholders who want their investment to grow through growing the business and generating revenues -- not just slashing costs at the expense of service quality."
The contract bars Verizon from carrying out layoffs "as a result of any company-initiated 'process change,' " like hiring outside contractors or closing offices.
The contract does allow layoffs in response to outside events that significantly and directly reduce the need for a large number of employees. These include the loss of a big contract or a regulatory change that causes the company to abandon a line of business.
Mr. Das wrote that "any belt-tightening in response to the reduction in revenue was company-initiated process change."

HEADLINE: Man Continues Hostage Standoff in Queens, Police Say 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
A 48-year-old man who the police said had been holding his estranged wife hostage at gunpoint for more than 24 hours remained shut inside a Queens apartment last night. The man had held the same woman hostage twice before, threatening her with a machete, a box cutter and a live electrical cord, a state parole official said. 
 By late evening, the police said, the gunman, identified as Karan Persaud, was still inside the woman's first-floor apartment at 105-02 Van Wyck Expressway in Richmond Hill as hostage negotiators continued marathon phone conversations with him. Mr. Persaud, who had demanded nothing, made moves throughout the day to leave, but always backed down, the police said. 
 The standoff began about 12:30 a.m. yesterday, the police said, when Mr. Persaud ambushed his estranged wife, Indrani Jawana Persaud, outside her apartment as she returned home from work and pushed his way in at gunpoint. 
The couple's 13- and 25-year-old daughters, who were home, ran to the bathroom when they heard the commotion, said Capt. James Klein, a police spokesman. The elder daughter called her boyfriend, and when he arrived, a shot was fired, the police said, but no one was injured.
At that point, the daughters fled the home, but Mr. Persaud would not let Ms. Persaud go, the police said. 
State officials said Mr. Persaud had a history of violence. In June 1999, he pleaded guilty to charges of assault and intimidation of a witness after holding Ms. Persaud hostage for 12 hours, threatening her with a machete and a live electrical cord, in November 1998, according to the Division of Parole. In that case, after his initial arraignment, he returned to Ms. Persaud's home and held her at knifepoint for seven hours until she escaped, parole officials said. 
Mr. Persaud was sentenced to five years in state prison. Two months after he was rejected for parole, he was released by the State Department of Correctional Services in March, before his term was up, because he had earned time off for good behavior, said Tom Grant, a spokesman for the Parole Division. 
"If it was up to the Parole Board, he would still be incarcerated," he said.
The police said Mr. Persaud was unemployed and was living with his parents in Ozone Park, Queens.
In the Richmond Hill neighborhood, streets were barricaded and traffic was snarled. As the standoff continued into the evening, neighbors complained about the disruption. Some had been shut out of their homes, and others had to detour around the barricaded streets to run errands. 
Six television trucks and 10 camera tripods crowded the streets as neighbors gathered outside to observe the spectacle. Young women parked their baby carriages behind police lines, old men stood around smoking cigars, and at one point, a man strummed a song on his guitar to persuade the gunman to release his hostage.
The Red Cross provided food and water for residents who had been shut out of their homes. 
"You don't know how long these jokers are going to hold us up," said Charles Jolicoeur, who lives next door to the barricaded home. Mr. Jolicoeur said the police woke him at 2 a.m. yesterday and told him to leave his house. 
The Van Wyck Expressway service road was closed between Liberty and Atlantic Avenues, as were some residential streets. 
"Traffic is already bad here," said Michael Duvalle, 38. "Now it's even worse. The light changes 10 times before you move a foot."
The road closings and swarms of police officers hurt business at neighborhood grocery stores, real estate offices and office supply stores, employees said. Although the Richmond Hill Grocery and Deli lost its regular customers, the manager, Rida Kadim, said the influx of reporters, police officers and emergency workers had provided a cushion.
Gillie Belk, 35, who lives behind the home where the hostage was being held, stood on the street smoking yesterday morning, eager to be allowed back into her house. Ms. Belk had just finished working the midnight shift at Kennedy Airport and said she needed to sleep.
Ms. Belk said that she wanted Ms. Persaud to get out safely but that if the standoff and lockout lasted much longer, she would have to call in sick to work the next day.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Canada Presses to Reopen Markets for Its Beef Exports

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 11 

 BODY:
Nearly two months after the carcass of a single cow tested positive for mad cow disease, Canada has begun a desperate diplomatic campaign to reopen international markets to its beef exports. But no relief for the country's stricken cattle industry seems near.
 After the slaughter of more than 2,000 head in three provinces, animal health experts studying the situation said they had found no evidence that the disease had ever entered the food supply or exports. 
 But more than 30 countries still ban Canadian beef, in part because Canadian officials have not been able to pinpoint conclusively how that lone cow on a remote ranch in northern Alberta contracted the disease, formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E. 
Canada is losing more than $8 million a day because of the bans, creating particular hardship in the prairie provinces. The losses are the latest in a series of setbacks for the Canadian economy, including the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which scared away tourists and business travelers, and the rising value of the Canadian dollar, which hurts exporters.
Only Mexico, Canada's second-largest beef market, appears close to readmitting Canadian beef.
In recent days Prime Minister Jean Chretien has telephoned President Bush and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to argue that extensive scientific testing has shown that Canadian beef is safe.
President Bush told Mr. Chretien that he wanted to reopen the American market, which ordinarily accounts for nearly 80 percent of Canada's beef exports, as soon as possible. The American secretary of agriculture, Ann Veneman, said this week that she thought Canada had dealt effectively with the outbreak. 
But she could give Canadians no assurances that their beef would be welcome again anytime soon. "I'm not in a position to give you any time frame," Ms. Veneman told reporters this week. "There are a lot of complicating factors."
Those factors can be summed up in one word: Japan. The Koizumi government has said that if the United States starts admitting Canadian beef again, Japan may stop accepting America's beef exports unless they are certified and labeled as free of meat or byproducts originating in Canada. 
But the Canadian and American cattle industries are so closely integrated, with cattle and feed ordinarily moving freely across the border every day, that American officials say it would be too costly and time-consuming to do what Japan wants.
Since Japan is the biggest customer for American beef exports -- it took $842 million worth last year -- Washington is caught awkwardly between two important allies and trading partners. Complicating the picture, South Korea, another major beef importer, has made requests similar to Japan's. 
After suffering its own mad cow outbreak two years ago, Japan seems unwilling to take any chances with Canadian beef. In the last few days, the government has ordered that all imported Canadian beef products stockpiled since late May be incinerated. 
In his conversation with Mr. Chretien, Mr. Koizumi agreed to send his agriculture minister, Yoshiyuki Kamei, to Ottawa on Saturday for consultations with Canadian officials. Japan, which had been Canada's No. 3 export market after the United States and Mexico, also wants Canada to improve its inspection system to protect against future outbreaks.
Canadian officials are growing frustrated. "We have to stress that there is no need for the ban to continue, nor a reason for the United States to segregate its product," said Vern Greenshields, spokesman for the agriculture minister, Lyle Vanclief. "The science is in, and there was one cow found that did not enter the food chain."
Global fears of mad cow disease stem from outbreaks in Europe in the 1980's and 1990's that led to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. About 130 people, most of them in Britain, died from a human form of the illness.

HEADLINE: G.E. Says Yearly Profit Rise To Be Smallest in a Decade 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that its annual profit would show its smallest increase in a decade because of slow economic growth and SARS. 
 Profit will rise from $1.55 to $1.61 a share, General Electric said. The chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, previously said profit might be as high as $1.70 a share. He gave the new range after reporting that second-quarter earnings declined 14 percent. 
 "The environment has been similar to what we've seen, positive economic growth but slow," Mr. Immelt said on a conference call. SARS "had some impact particularly in April and May in businesses like engines, medical and plastics, but that impact is now diminishing." 
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., has been hurt by a drop in orders from manufacturers, a weak airline industry and fewer gas-turbine deliveries. High raw-materials costs have cut profit from plastics used in mobile phones and compact discs. The new range means Mr. Immelt will not meet his goal of 10 percent profit growth this year, excluding some charges and gains. 
"I'm a little concerned about 2004 given how many times they mentioned slow economic growth," said Marcy Yeamans, an analyst at Banc One Investment Advisers, which owned 33.3 million General Electric shares as of March. "The big issue here is how much do you want to pay for single-digit growth." 
Second-quarter net income fell to $3.79 billion, or 38 cents a share, from $4.43 billion, or 44 cents, a year earlier, General Electric said. Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $33.37 billion. 
Shares of General Electric fell 7 cents, to $28.12.
Analysts had expected the lower range of 2003 earnings. Of 16 securities firms surveyed by Thomson First Call, 12 had estimated 2003 profit of $1.61 a share or less. At least seven analysts had narrowed their estimates in the last 30 days after the company said May orders of plastics and appliances missed expectations. 
Net income last year was cut by $1.4 billion because General Electric underestimated the cost of reinsurance reserves. Excluding that charge, profit was $1.51 a share. The new range would put growth on that basis at 2.6 percent to 6.6 percent, the smallest increase since 1993.
 Third-quarter profit will be 39 cents to 42 cents a share before a charge of about 4 cents for an accounting change, General Electric said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson had estimated 42 cents. G.E. earned 41 cents in the third quarter of 2002.

HEADLINE: Poor in Money, but Even Poorer in Democracy 

BYLINE:  By Charles Onyango-Obbo; Charles Onyango-Obbo is a columnist for The Nation newspapers in Kenya and The Monitor in Uganda.

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda 

 BODY:
African chiefs, whether the old variety in feathered hats or the modern kind in military fatigues with Kalashnikovs, always travel with gifts and rewards. President Bush has followed that time-honored tradition in his trip to Africa this week by showcasing his $15 billion pledge to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean and his $100 million fund to help combat terrorism and promote development.
 But in promising to throw money at Africa, Mr. Bush ignored the real problem. Misery has become Africa's fastest growing industry not because rich nations didn't give the continent any development assistance, and health levels are primitive not because of a lack of hospitals. 
 In the 1960's, many African economies were more advanced than South Korea's. The continent stagnated largely because corrupt dictatorships took over, and the areas that slid back to the medieval age did so mainly because of the ravages of war. To really change Africa, Mr. Bush needs to offer long-term leadership in two areas: ending the wars, and helping pro-democracy forces bring honest andeffective government to African countries burdened by oppressive regimes, even if that means accepting antiterrorism laws that aren't as strict as he would like.
Yet President Bush's itinerary allowed him to avoid looking directly at Africa's real problems. Three of the five countries on the trip -- South Africa, Senegal and Botswana -- are safe, relatively happy and well governed.
More typical for Africa is Congo, where a five-year conflict has resulted in the deaths of more than three million people. The Bush administration has not helped American credibility by its reluctance to support an expanded United Nations peacekeeping force or by its refusal to contribute troops -- a stand that changed only this week. Similarly, as violence has engulfed Liberia, a country set up as a home for freed slaves from America, Mr. Bush has dithered about sending American troops, the one action that would strongly signal that his administration is serious about helping to end the conflict there.
To his credit, Mr. Bush also visited two troubled countries: Uganda and Nigeria, the final stops on this trip. Indeed, the Uganda leg of Mr. Bush's trip best demonstrates the challenge facing any American president visiting Africa today.
Uganda under President Yoweri Museveni has demonstrated what a poor country can achieve by being smart about AIDS. The AIDS prevalence rate in Uganda today is below 6 percent, sharply down from over 18 percent 10 years ago.
Still, Uganda has serious problems, including a rebellion in the north that has endured since 1988. It is also a de facto one-party state. The Museveni government, though it says it now backs a return to multiparty politics, is pressing to have presidential term limits removed from the Constitution. This would open the way for Mr. Museveni to run in 2006, although by then he would have been in power for 20 years.
The last time an American president visited Uganda -- Bill Clinton in 1998 -- opposition politicians sought an audience. Mr. Clinton dispatched the Rev. Jesse Jackson to buy them lunch, and none of their concerns about democratization were taken up publicly. Five years later, the rebellion in the north has spread, and the economy is worsening. Because of the conflict, the impressive gains against AIDS are being lost, thousands of children cannot go to school, corruption is spreading, and the government's ability to be a stabilizing force in the region has been greatly eroded. But Mr. Bush, like Mr. Clinton, said nothing about this.
The Bush administration's wrongheadedness on Africa is also evident in its stand on terrorism. The United States is pushing tough antiterrorism legislation, even though some African governments have used the threat of terrorism as a cover to pass laws to suppress their political opponents.
A country like Kenya, which has a large pro-Western elite, demonstrates what has gone wrong. Kenya has paid dearly for playing host to Western interests. Al Qaeda bombed the American Embassy there in 1998. Another attack, on an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa last year, all but killed Kenyan tourism.
Today, while revulsion against terrorism in Kenya is high, there is also resistance to a proposed stringent antiterrorism law that is supported by the United States because of the fear it could be misused. 
The Bush administration doesn't realize that the rule of law does not have as long a history in Africa as it does in the West. In the United States, antiterrorism laws that strip away some civil rights in the name of national security will not roll back human rights significantly -- but in Africa they will. Only in the last 10 years have pro-democracy campaigns resulted in constitutions and laws that allow press freedom, fair trials, honest elections and other basic rights.
The roots of these laws are so shallow that a single antiterrorism law simply wipes them out. This all but destroys political groups that are seeking to create open and prosperous societies, and thus take away the poverty and alienation that terrorist groups feed on.
Still, Mr. Bush's trip to Africa might have been worthwhile if he had used one of his photo ops to ally himself some powerful symbol of Africa's struggling democracy. He didn't. Given the rarity of American presidential visits to Africa, it's doubtful that he will return to try and do it right.

HEADLINE: Bush Has Praise for Uganda In Its Fight Against AIDS 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: ENTEBBE, Uganda, July 11 

 BODY:
President Bush praised Uganda today as a model for how African nations can succeed in combating AIDS and pledged that the United States would help underwrite efforts to fight an epidemic that has cost millions of lives and disrupted efforts by many countries to lift themselves from poverty.
 Speaking to an AIDS support group here on the fourth day of his Africa trip, Mr. Bush praised Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, for working to remove the stigma of AIDS and aggressively pursuing a program that includes drug treatments, as well as promoting abstinence, condom use and education about the disease. 
 Uganda is among the few developing nations to have reduced its AIDS infection rate. Mr. Bush put the rate at 5 percent, down from 30 percent a decade ago. Although there is some debate among experts about whether the decline has been that sharp, there is general agreement that it has been impressive. One of the main reasons, they say, is that Mr. Museveni, far more than other African leaders, has cast aside cultural taboos and political worries to tackle the problem head on. 
"You have worldwide influence here because you've provided a model of care for Uganda," Mr. Bush told volunteers and H.I.V.-positive people he met here. "Life by life, village by village, Uganda is showing that AIDS can be defeated across Africa."
Having developed the will to combat the pandemic, Mr. Bush said, Africa now needs more money to do so. Referring to his proposal to spend $15 billion over five years to help some of the world's poorest nations to step up their efforts against the disease, Mr. Bush said the United States would help provide it.
"And this is my country's pledge to the people of Africa and the people of Uganda: You are not alone in this fight," the president said, with Mr. Museveni looking on. "America has decided to act."
In coming to Uganda, Mr. Bush was not only sending a message to other poor countries that it was both possible and necessary to strike a more aggressive stance in dealing with the disease. He was also trying to demonstrate to Congress that increased assistance from the United States would be money well spent, despite his own insistence that Congress hold spending down on most programs outside of the military.
Mr. Bush did not mention that the House took action on Thursday to finance his AIDS initiative next year at $2 billion, about what the administration had originally requested but $1 billion less than allowed under legislation Mr. Bush signed enthusiastically this spring.
Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, told reporters today on Air Force One that Mr. Bush "believes very strongly in full funding of this." She left unclear whether the White House considered its target for full financing next year to be $2 billion or $3 billion.
Mr. Bush's high-profile call to action on AIDS in Africa, an issue about which he had shown little interest before this year, stems from a number of factors. Eager to repair the image of the United States around the world after the deep diplomatic rifts over the war in Iraq, he has stressed on this trip that he wants the United States to be known around the world not just for its military might but also for its compassion.
But his stance also reflects a growing feeling in one of his core constituencies, religious conservatives, that dealing with the suffering caused by AIDS in Africa is a moral imperative. In doing so, religious groups have forged an alliance with liberal activist groups that have long called on rich nations to do more to help.
"I believe God has called us into action," Mr. Bush said today. "We are a great nation; we're a wealthy nation. We have a responsibility to help a neighbor in need, a brother and sister in crisis."
In Mr. Museveni, Mr. Bush is dealing with a leader who has helped Uganda make tremendous economic progress after the ravages of Idi Amin's brutal dictatorship of the 1970's. Mr. Museveni is a favorite of the White House because he has been among the most helpful of East African leaders in pursuing terrorists on the continent and because he is a free-market conservative who says that trade rather than handouts is the key to his country's future.
A high standing with Washington has helped Mr. Museveni at home, where he is under increasing pressure to allow more political opposition and to give up what some of his critics said was an effort to remain in office after the end of his second five-year term in 2006. Under the country's Constitution, he is limited to two terms.
It was not clear whether Mr. Bush, in a half-hour private meeting with the Ugandan leader, pressed Mr. Museveni not to remain in office indefinitely or discussed with him plans for an increased American military presence here.
Mr. Bush's arrival in Uganda brought out the biggest crowds of his trip so far, with hundreds and perhaps thousands of people lining the road from the airport to the hotel where the leaders met. After meeting with AIDS patients, Mr. Bush heard a moving rendition of "America the Beautiful" by a choir of children who had lost one or both parents to AIDS or to war. They finished the song with broad smiles on their faces and their arms stretched toward heaven.

HEADLINE: Diana Charity Halts Grants, Citing Lawsuit 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, July 11 

 BODY:
The charity set up in honor of Diana, the Princess of Wales, said today that it was cutting off all grants because of a financial crisis brought on by a lawsuit filed by the Franklin Mint, the company that specializes in commemorative dolls, dishes and baubles featuring celebrities, living and dead.
 The suit will not affect the availability of porcelain "Diana, Princess of Culture" dolls at $195, or heart-shaped diamond "Diana, England's Rose" pendants at $135. Both items, and 35 others carrying the likeness of Diana, are still available from the Franklin Mint, payable in five monthly installments. 
 The Franklin Mint won the right to produce and sell those in a legal battle in 1998 with the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which was established by the family of the princess after her death.
Comparing the company's business practices to "vultures preying on the dead," the charity had filed suit to stop it from making items bearing her likeness.
Tiger Woods had won a similar suit the year before, after the Franklin Mint manufactured a Masters Cup Commemorativemedal with his likeness. The company was banned from making products with his likeness, and Mr. Woods was awarded undisclosed damages.
In California, where the 1998 case was tried, a suit to preserve the "right of publicity" may be filed on behalf of a dead person, but only if that person is a Californian. So the charity lost the case and was required to pay the Franklin Mint about $2 million in lawyer's fees.
In November the Franklin Mint filed a suit of its own, contending it was the victim of a malicious legal campaign by the charity to force it to stop making Princess Diana plates and dolls. The Mint is seeking $25 million and an unspecified amount in punitive damages.
Dr. Andrew Purkis, the chief executive of the charity said it was legally obligated to stop new or existing grants until the situation was resolved. The charity has pledged $82 million to more than 120 different organizations in the last five years, including the Council for Disabled Children and the Children of the Andes, an organization that aids street children and other children at risk in Colombia. The group has a project in the works to teach Colombian children how to avoid land mines.
"This is devastating for us," said Christine Oran, fund-raising manager for Children of the Andes. The group, she said, was relying on a $114,000 grant from the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to get the project started. 
The Franklin Mint did not return several calls for comment.

 MERCHANTS OF IMMORTALITY
Chasing the Dream of
Human Life Extension.
By Stephen S. Hall.
439 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $25.
 MIDWAY through "Merchants of Immortality," Stephen S. Hall takes us inside a laboratory in central Massachusetts. Like the rest of the book, the fascinating episode is intensely researched, and it's the simple, mundane details that make it work. We're given the tiny cow eggs harvested in Iowa from the ovaries of slaughtered cattle, the small white plastic tubes the hundreds of eggs were plopped into, the thermoslike container that kept the tubes warm in the overnight mail to Worcester. The container arrived at a drab brick laboratory building, where a technician drew out the eggs, put them under a high-powered microscope and, using an extremely fine needle, sucked the cow DNA out of them. Taking one of these emptied eggs, another technician stuck it with a needle loaded with a human's cells. And then, "with a barely perceptible squeeze of one hand, she deposited a single adult skin cell, with its unique payload of human DNA, into the egg of a creature that moos." 
With this, we become witnesses to one of history's earliest human cloning experiments. The hybrid eggs were given a 15-microsecond, 120-volt electric zap, effectively fusing the two cells into one. The cells were made to begin replicating in an incubator. And with enough replications, some of these fused cells went on to form what seemed to be a very human embryo.
Making an embryo was as much as the scientists believed they could achieve and as far as they wanted to go, Hall tells us. With such an embryo in hand, their real aim was to harvest stem cells from it. As a surprising number of people seem to know nowadays, embryonic stem cells are capable of forming almost any tissue in the human body from scratch -- muscle, bone, blood vessels, even brain. Just the knowledge that such cells exist poses the heady possibility of rejuvenation, of using them to grow an endless supply of spare parts -- cardiac tissue for heart attack patients, brain cells for victims of strokes or Parkinson's disease, pancreatic tissue for diabetics. 
This ultimate scientific quest -- this attack on the ravages of aging, potentially on mortality itself, and the lengths to which we are now taking it -- is what brings Hall here. The full tale spills out in a daunting number of directions. There is the biology of "longevity genes," telomeres, stem cells and even African clawed toads to explain. There are battles between laboratories, questions of the morality of the work and collisions with national politics. There is history and economics. And there are the individual people involved to tell about, too. 
It is a measure of Hall's skill as a science writer -- this is his fourth book and he has often written for The NewYork Times -- that he manages to navigate through all this as lucidly as he does. The book is not successful in everything it tries to do. Hall can be almost too evenhanded. He has a reporter's instinctive reticence about giving us his own thinking, and the book works best when he's not pulling punches. But he makes the biology clear without stooping to condescension. He is admirably thorough. And he does not sacrifice vividness, understanding or the voices of the many key players. 
Its title notwithstanding, this book is not really about anyone chasing the elixir of immortality. Hall himself shies away from the word inside the first 50 pages. And that's as it should be -- even the most fanatic researchers claim nothing like the possibility of finding such a potion. The scientists Hall follows are after what he prefers to call "life-extension technology." Even that is an inapt term: most medicine is a form of life-extension technology. And the threads connecting cloning, stem cells and longevity are pretty slender. But these are the revolutionary fields in medical research. They all have genuine, radical promise -- like vaccines and transplants and open-heart surgery not so long ago. One can see why Hall is interested in them.
So then, how are these new sciences unfolding? Hall's answer is: messily. In part, that's how all science tales go -- they are full of failure, weird findings, unexpected success and egos. (The opening chapter is a small gem of an example, trailing the mercurial Leonard Hayflick, who discovered 40 years ago that human cells do not replicate indefinitely but instead simply stop after a while and die.) In part, however, the messiness is due to something that makes Hall's book a lot darker and less heroic than the usual science story -- the new and now constant awareness in the field of money to be made. (Hence the "merchants" of the title.) 
Just the fact that the cow-human experiment did not take place in a publicly funded laboratory but instead at a private company -- in this case one called Advanced Cell Technology and led by Michael West, a maverick entrepreneur and notorious provocateur -- has fundamental implications. Divorced from the traditions of academic basic research, where the emphasis is on open information and profit is not the priority, standards begin to slip. As Hall notes, "ACT's scientists have not published a single word about the cow-human experiments in the scientific literature," where they could be independently reviewed, "although they have spoken exhaustively about them in the popular press." In several instances, he found more information on research work from patent filings than from scientific publications. He saw ethics controls weaken and companies dominating the public debate.
This increasingly is the norm. Nearly all basic research in these important fields has moved out into the private sector, largely, Hall shows, because of politics. He devotes a significant part of the book to peeling back the messy, contradictory, often incoherent debates and policies. The Clinton administration proved simply unable to design a viable policy on stem cell or cloning research in the aftermath of the Lewinsky scandal. The Bush administration comes off even worse. 
Hall takes us through President Bush's months of indecision about what position to take on stem cell research and then their strange culmination: on Aug. 9, 2001, in a televised speech "which may have come as close as any presidential address to a national lesson in sex education," Bush announced that federal funding for human embryo stem cell research would be banned except for work on "existing cell lines." There were, he said, "more than 60" of them. But within days it became apparent that this was not the case. In the next year, researchers found at most four usable cell lines. And what embryonic stem cells exist turn out to be mostly commercially owned. Academic research ground to a halt, and overnight a handful of companies struggling to stay afloat in today's uncertain economy were given nearly complete control over future research and the new generation of treatments that could result. 
Hall tells the entire story in very close. You end up hungry for regular intervals with the camera pulled back far enough to see where the tale is heading. In the end, though, the book is about our arrival in a place of tremendous medical opportunity and also baffling political idiocy. "The long-term promise of stem cell therapy is everything it has been cracked up to be: the potential clinical impact is staggering, on a par with the therapeutic importance of antibiotics," Hall writes. "But solving all the biological problems is a staggering task, too, and it is a task that has been largely assigned, by politics and happenstance, to a handful of underfinanced, understaffed and scientifically overwhelmed boutique biotech companies." 
There are serious consequences to contemplate in the prospect that science could significantly lengthen the human life span. Children born today can be expected to live to 90, and major breakthroughs could make that 100 (or more?). Hall considers the strain on social and environmental resources of an older population, the endless arguments over whether a 30-cell embryo is life, the effects of aging societies on family life, traditions and the location of political power. But he finds many reasons to believe that the enterprise must continue. And the deepest is moral duty. Faced with a doctor's waiting room full of patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease or one of a dozen other dehumanizing illnesses, can we morally say we will not pursue our era's most promising chance to relieve their misery? Hall shows that we may already have done so.

 BODY:
 EDISON'S EVE: A Magical History of the Quest for Mechanical Life, by Gaby Wood. (Anchor, $14.) Tracing the human fascination with robotics to the sophisticated mechanical toys of the Enlightenment, the author conjures a menagerie of bizarre and quixotic automatons, including chess-playing machines, artificial defecating ducks and Thomas Edison's doomed venture to mass-produce talking dolls. Last year our reviewer, Miranda Seymour, called this "a lively, elegant and surprising book, packed with curious details and enticing anecdotes."

HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $12.) No one expects an easy life in this first collection of short fiction, mostly set in the author's native Montana. The tales evoke a West of horse tracks, cowboy brawls, failed oil wells and brides who choose their wedding dress to hide branding-iron scars, a world where even young people feel their choices limited by economics and losing habits. "At its best, 'Half in Love' offers up both plain speaking and mystery, subtlety and shock," Jean Thompson wrote here in 2002.

THE GATEKEEPER: A Memoir, by Terry Eagleton. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) An acclaimed literary theorist, prolific writer and Marxist scholar tells of his coming-of-age as a member of the Irish Catholic working class in England's industrial northwest and his education at Cambridge and beyond. His "hilarious, devastating little book" is "an apologia pro vita sua from one of Britain's most unapologetic old New Left thinkers" as well as "a hymn to the enduring power and pleasure of intellectual thought," Jenny Turner said in the Book Review last year.

YOU SHALL KNOW OUR VELOCITY! by Dave Eggers. (Vintage, $14.) Eggers's first novel is a perpetual motion machine, setting its heroes, a pair of semi-slacker buddies named Will and Hand, on the run in such locales as Chicago, Dakar, Marrakesh and Riga, in a frantic effort to suck up life following the violent death of their best friend. Last year our reviewer, John Leonard, found this a "lesser effort" than the author's first book, "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius," but one that is nonetheless "entirely honorable and ultimately persuasive" and whose "Frisbee sentences . . . sail, spin, hover, circle and come back to the reader like gifts of gravity and grace."

THE LOBSTER Chronicles: Life on a Very Small Island, by Linda Greenlaw. (Hyperion, $13.95.) Greenlaw, familiar to readers as a swordfish boat captain in Sebastian Junger's best seller "The Perfect Storm," describes her efforts to make a home off the coast of Maine, where she reconnects with her family and looks to find a mate. "It's a lot of fun to read," Erica Sanders said here last year, and it also "relates the lobster's rise from its beginnings as grub fit only for servants, orphans and prisoners; the creature's mating rituals; and her mother's recipe for lobster casserole."

CENTURY'S SON, by Robert Boswell. (Picador, $14.) At the center of this novel of four generations are a Midwestern couple lost in a fog of recrimination and mourning following the suicide of their 12-year-old son. Rounding out the mix are their daughter, who becomes pregnant at 14 and raises her son in her parents' home even as she refuses to divulge the identity of the father, and her grandfather, a renowned Russian dissident who shows up one day. "Boswell sets his vision of one family's painful, incomplete, unorthodox but still stirring return to life as an irremediably private matter," Jonathan Dee wrote here in 2002.

KING OF THE JEWS, by Leslie Epstein. (Handsel, $15.) This 1979 Holocaust novel focuses on the morally ambiguous politics of survival of a Judenrat, or council of Jewish officials, forced to collaborate with the Nazis in a Polish ghetto. The council's elder is a complex figure who is part charlatan, part mad dictator and part cunning politician. The result is a "quietly controlled, eerily lucid" tale and a "lesson in what artistic restraint can do to help us imagine the dark places of our history," Robert Alter said here.

BETRAYAL: The Crisis in the Catholic Church, by the Investigative Staff of The Boston Globe. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.) This book incorporates a decade's worth of reporting by The Globe on the abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Boston and the church's efforts to contain the scandal. The result is "the fullest account to date of the egregious priestly and episcopal mistakes, sins and crimes that occurred at the epicenter of what almost immediately became a national crisis," R. Scott Appleby said here last year. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
The Whole World Is Watching

BYLINE:  By GARY SHTEYNGART; Gary Shteyngart is the author of the novel "The Russian Debutante's Handbook."

 BODY:
HATRED and fascination are the two disparate strains that run through "The American Effect: Global Perspectives on the United States, 1990-2003," a witty survey of art about the United States at the Whitney Museum of American Art. America is rendered in the eyes of its beholders as both the last utopia and the root cause of the world's economic, social and military disasters. Both , but what is surprising about this carefully chosen and thematically ambitious survey is the eloquence and subtlety of so much of the art. Because of our global reach, these artists already live in a kind of ersatz America, consuming our disposable products, debating our government's policies while their homelands are often host to our hyperactive military.
 In contrast, the majority of our populace has little interest in the world beyond our borders. As the curator, Lawrence Rinder, writes in the show's catalog, only 14 percent of Americans hold passports. An ad hoc show of American perceptions of, say, Italy would probably yield a selection of pasta-and-wine narratives, while Russia would merit a roomful of snow, and Afghanistan, a burka. 
 As a Soviet-born immigrant, I found myself caught in a happy dichotomy throughout the exhibition. I was prancing around a museum on Madison Avenue, the Holy See of the advertising industry, surrounded by work explicitly critical of America's consumerism and the power that accrues to its unmatched economy. As a child I had worshiped American technology, practically making love to my father's Chevrolet Malibu Classic, and finding myself upon entering an American kitchen oddly turned on by the mysterious word Osterizer. Now, in the belly of the beast, I was equally delighted to stare at incontrovertible proof that the stuff of my childhood dreams has earned worldwide resentment. 
"The American Effect" presents a wide range of media, with the most promising works in video. The Norwegian artist Jannicke Laker's "No. 17" is a heady mix of revenge and exploitation. In this dramatization, Ms. Laker invites a dorky-looking young American tourist to her apartment, and in the course of 11 minutes strips this shy specimen of his shirt, entices him into a fit of pathetic dancing and in a clever and unexpected turnaround, finally throws him out of her apartment. 
The young man, in his blue blazer and round glasses, is the perfect embodiment of American naivete, and as the video painfully unfolds one almost starts rooting for our national nebbish as he submits to the European's carefully planned humiliations. 
"Tell me about yourself," the Norwegian woman says at the beginning of the seduction. 
"There's not much to tell," the American replies, which begs the question: how can an answer that honest and self-deprecating also serve as the indictment of an entire nation? Somehow, in this victim's case, it does. 
After the young man takes off his shirt and starts dancing, the Norwegian woman urges him on: "Yeah, that's nice," she says. "That's really nice. You have this African thing in you." 
What had taken place on the screen was an act of violence that the director Neil LaBute ("In the Company of Men") would have been proud to call his own. The work can sustain many interpretations -- revenge at America's hegemony being at the top of the list.
Ms. Laker, armed only with a hand-held camera, gets to reverse the flow of power, if only briefly. And yet we cringe: the American on the screen is both innocent and complicit, but, most important, he's recognizably and undisputedly one of our own, the kind of mild-mannered, perfectly agreeable young man produced by our best colleges who wields ignorance as deftly as a Visigoth once handled a spear. 
Bjorn Melhus's equally disturbing video, "America Sells," presents American free enterprise as a quasi-messianic affair that comes as second nature to the country's young people. Mr. Melhus was wandering through East Berlin on the day of the unification of the German monetary system when he stumbled upon a troupe of teenage, corn-fed, mostly female Americans performing an innocent-seeming tribute to their vast homeland titled "America Sings." Against a background of bleak socialist housing complexes, the sort that peaceably crumbled down the road from where I lived as a child in Leningrad, the teens dance and holler their anthem: "America sings from the mighty Mississippi/ America hears the children rock." 
What starts out as kitsch soon ends as commerce. After their performance, the group's leader, a well-groomed young man, delivers the hard sell: "Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that in order to pay for our trip to Germany, we sell wonderful T-shirts and sweat shirts! Very cheap! Very cheap! You understand cheap? You understand cheap? Good!" 
The video ends with poorly dressed East Germans exchanging precious new Deutschemarks for ugly American T-shirts, reminding me of the first gift I received from an American who had pitied my post-Soviet sartorial predicament: a Batman T-shirt five years out of fashion. Likewise these East Germans are being inducted into a lifestyle from which there is no escape, and they're paying hard currency for the ride. 
Throughout the work Mr. Melhus focuses his attention on one particularly overweight and overenthused young performer. Both he and Ms. Laker seem to exult in unattractive American physiques, as if to posit a rebuttal to the perfect-body images American commercials disseminate around the world. American gigantism, including unembarrassed obesity, may strike many foreign-born people as a kind of personal homage to expansion, an Imperialism of the Belly, if you will.
The show's most moving, elegiac video, the Yugoslav Zoran Naskovski's installation "Death in Dallas," tempers the irony of the preceding work. Mr. Naskovski combines film of John F. Kennedy's assassination (intercut with footage of the Kennedy family in happier times) with a mournful decasyllabic Herzegovian ballad accompanied by the sounds of an ancient Balkan stringed instrument known as a gusle.
The pairing of the familiar footage and the Balkan homage to the slain president produces an immemorial effect, as if the assassination took place before images could be recorded. Throughout the video, imperfect translations of the Serbo-Croatian ballad appear on the screen ("The President Kennedy recently was shot/ By this news the hospital staff was frozen a lot"), the awkward phrasing somehow deepening our grief, reacquainting us with Kennedy's death through foreign eyes and vernacular. 
The nonvideo portions of the exhibition are relatively less spectacular: we are presented with a strong array of journeyman work interrupted by bursts of giddy inspiration. Saira Wasim's "Friendship After 11 September 2" offers convincing craftsmanship -- the artist reinterprets Raphael's "School of Athens" as a Mughalesque miniature -- but she is hampered by a lack of thematic subtlety. A drawing of George W. Bush in the guise of a victorious Roman emperor, flanked by Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf (with Napoleon and sundry imperialists nearby), leaves nothing to the imagination. The complicity of our government in the tragedies of developing nations, including Ms. Wasim's native Pakistan, demands an accounting, but her work is as relentlessly "on-message" as a Pentagon news briefing, if more compelling and tongue in cheek. 
Across the room, an assortment of aging superheroes while away their last years in the French artist Gilles Barbier's life-size tableau "Nursing Home." Superman, Catwoman, the Incredible Hulk and others are presented as if they had aged naturally from their first comic-book appearance. Given the reverence many Americans feel for their superheroes, and the fact that most young male immigrants, myself included, were once invited to fall in love with this country through their examples of brawn and sacrifice and spontaneous weight-gain, "Nursing Home" is an oddly tender conceit. It can also be seen as a prophecy (or perhaps an eager anticipation) of the natural decline of American power in the world. 
In a different take on the retirement theme, the Japanese artist Miwa Yanagi asked young Japanese women to picture their ideal old age for a photographic series titled "My Grandmothers." Her touching and playful "Yuka" shows an ecstatic older Japanese woman in a low-cut dress, her dyed-red hair streaming behind her and a gold tooth gleaming, hurtling down the Golden Gate bridge in a motorcycle sidecar piloted by a grinning young Japanese man in sunglasses. "Yuka" is a lyrical paean to America's promise of the open road, cultural mobility and freedom from the constraints of upbringing. This is how we want to see ourselves, these are the quintessential traits that celebrate our spirit and geography and tap into the most favorable impressions of America abroad (while inspiring the wrath of fundamentalists from Karachi to Houston).
"The American Effect" deserves more than one viewing, but each visit should end lying atop the "Dream Machine" of the Russian artist Sergei Bugaev, who goes by the name Afrika. Visitors are invited to spread themselves out on a titanium sheet covered with American political memorabilia, including carpets woven with images of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Folkloric Russian items are thrown into the mix -- wooden sleds that keep the titanium platforms aloft and keepsake chests stuffed incongruously with American flags (imagine for a minute the exact opposite: Soviet flags poking out of handsome Samsonite cases). In keeping with the mix-and-match motif, the bed pillow is emblazoned with a hammer and sickle and the words "Proletariat of all countries unite." Mr. Bugaev, who trained as a psychotherapist, has invited his friends to sleep on these "beds," after which he has taken notes documenting the peculiar intersections of American and Russian psychic space. 
Since I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Mr. Bugaev is now based, I was happy to take the bait. I couldn't spend an entire night in the Whitney, but I did allow myself 10 minutes on "Dream Machine." I found my Russian identity subsumed by that of my adopted country. I dreamed of chasing my first American squirrel at 9, my first corn-chip-flavored American kiss as a teenager, the Long Island funeral of my Russian grandmother, my terror upon entering the second grade and, finally, my first encounter with the Pacific Ocean in Los Angeles only two months ago (I ran up to an incoming wave and, with a drunken sense of endless New World possibility, slapped its foamy crest). 
Yes, I thought a lot about my trip to L.A., the fascination of seeing a beat-up Ethiopian restaurant shoe-horned into a grimy strip mall, a gaggle of Iranian Jewish men in traditional garb negotiating a 10-lane throughway after Sabbath services. Don't get me wrong: I despised Los Angeles. And yet I wanted to move there immediately, because that Californian megalopolis is the future, frightening and sublime. And that, perhaps, is the real American Effect.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Tourists Are Once Again Heading for Nepal

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

 BODY:
Katmandu, NepalWENDING her way through the Hindu temples and Internet cafes of downtown Katmandu, an American rara avis was spotted during Everest anniversary celebrations in late May: an elegant woman wearing a T-shirt that read, Hilton Head Polo Team.
 In Nepal, where affluent American tourists are few, this confirmed sighting could signify a rebirth of American tourism and trekking in a nation more associated in recent years with Maoists than with mountaineers. 
 Over four years of guerrilla rebellion, the number of international arrivals dropped 57 percent, down to 215,900 last year. 
 But in January, a cease-fire was signed between the Maoist guerrillas and the government. In the four months since then 18 people in this nation of 24 million have been killed in political violence, down from about 1,800 in the same period last year. 
 The first to notice the decline were Nepal's neighbors, China and India. During the first four months of this year, Chinese tourist arrivals jumped by 25 percent and Indian arrivals by 31 percent.
 Now, with all the favorable publicity emanating from celebrations surrounding the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Mount Everest, Nepal tourism promoters are convinced that Americans, Europeans and Japanese will return for the trekking season, which starts in mid-August.
 "It's upbeat," said Deepak Upraity, general manager of the Shangri-La Katmandu hotel. Referring to a tourism fair in Tokyo, he said: "We have people who were recently in Japan. They were saying it is going to be an excellent season."
 Even before the Everest anniversary on May 29, there were indications that tourism might be turning a corner. In April, arrivals reached 20,799, up 15 percent over April of last year. At Namche, the traditional gateway for treks in the Sagarmatha National Park, which includes Mount Everest, there were 3,000 trekkers, almost double the 1,700 registered in April 2001.
 In recent years, the tourism fall was as fast and as traumatic as a slip on a Himalayan ice field. "The last five years were the worst in our 25 years," said Shyam Bahadur Panday, owner of the Nepalese Shangri-La hotel group and a member of the Nepal Tourism Board.
 The guerrillas are not known to have killed any Western tourists. In interviews, their leaders repeatedly stress that they favor international tourism here. Krishna Bahadur Mahara, third ranking in the Maoist hierarchy, said in an interview in Katmandu in May: "As far as the tourism industry is concerned, we very much encourage it. This country needs tourism."
 In a country where high unemployment forces many to emigrate, the tourism industry employs 250,000 people.
 "Not a single tourist has been killed by the guerrillas in Nepal in the last seven years," Narayan Singh Pun, the government's negotiator in peace talks with the Maoists, said in an interview."
 But in two separate attacks last fall, the Maoists killed two Nepalese guards at the American Embassy. The current United States Government consular information sheet on Nepal warns that the unpredictable nature of Maoist attacks "increases the likelihood that Americans in Nepal could be caught in the wrong place at the wrong time." It warns against traveling at night, on public buses and during general strikes. It also warns that guerrillas often demand "donations" from tourists passing through their rural areas.
 Trekking to the base of Manaslu peak in May, five months after the information sheet was written, Scott Darsney said he saw a different side to the guerrillas.
 "The Maoists gave us a letter to give to the porters at the next village," said Mr. Darsney, an Alaska-based photographer who has made at least a dozen visits here in recent years. Addressing porters who charge the equivalent of $19 to carry a 100-pound load for six hours, he said: "They wrote: 'You are charging the foreigners too much."'
 "You see a lot of them wandering around with the camouflage, with their red flags and slogans," Mr. Darsney said of guerrillas in an area in central Nepal, far from Everest, where he hiked and climbed in mid-May. Last fall the government issued permits to 55 climbing groups, largely Americans and Europeans, a 29 percent jump over the same period in 2001, according to figures compiled Lisa Choegyal, an American who promotes adventure tourism in Nepal.
 But for many Americans who have never visited, last year's toll of violence, 4,655 dead, has made them think twice about coming this year.
 "I would have had 12 people here; I had six," Chuck Demarest, a Boulder, Colo., businessman, said minutes before receiving a Nepalese government climbing medal in a 50th anniversary celebration. 
 Mr. Demarest, who reached the summit of Everest in 1998, said that some friends and family declined his invitation to come to Katmandu. "People were scared about the Maoists, that the cease-fire would break down," he said.
 But after widespread American and European coverage of the anniversary events, including interviews with Sir Edmund Hillary, hoteliers now are betting on the Everest effect. Navnet Nagpal, manager of the Yak and Yenti Hotel, said of flights that link this Himalayan capital with India's three largest cities: "The flights are coming in chockablock."

HEADLINE: AMERICAN ORCHESTRAS; 
A Growth Curve

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 At a time when America's orchestras are struggling to serve their communities across the country, Bernard Holland's front-page commentary "How to Kill Orchestras," June 29 does a great disservice. Mr. 
Holland's opinion that orchestras are less relevant in today's society could not be further from the truth. As a matter of fact, the article by James R. Oestreich buried inside the same section "Orchestral Survival: It's Not Simply the Economy, Stupid" gives a much more accurate accounting. 
 Today, America's 1,200 professional and volunteer orchestras are annually serving a larger audience than ever before: more than 30 million, up 10 percent from a decade ago. Today's American orchestra is reaching far deeper into our society than ever before. The Pew Charitable Trusts recently conducted random household surveys in five communities and found that a significant percentage of the respondents attended a live professional orchestra concert in the last 12 months (Cincinnati, Denver and Seattle, 19 percent; Pittsburgh, 16 percent; three cities in Alaska, 20 percent).
Orchestra audiences are growing. Rather than perpetuate the myth of dying orchestras, The New York Times might better rail against the lack of exposure of America's youth to the arts and the new wave of cuts in arts education in the public schools.

WHEN he was a boy visiting his grandmother's house in Helmetta, Andrew Tancredi recalls, the snuff mill across the street made the whole town smell sweet. "The flavor going into the tobacco," he said, "was always in the air."
 But then, those were generally sweeter times for Helmetta, noted Mr. Tancredi, who now lives in his late grandmother's home; in those days, the mill was thriving -- and so was the town built around it. Now, as president of the Helmetta Borough Council, Mr. Tancredi is one of those presiding over an effort to make the mill site into something vital again. 
 Helmetta, off Route 18 in Middlesex County, had its beginnings in 1880 when George W. Helme, a New Orleans lawyer and Confederate major general, bought the land between Spotswood and Jamesburg for a snuff processing mill and 105 homes for mill workers. He named the land after his daughter, Olivia Antoinette Helme, who was known as Etta. In 1888, Mr. Helme led a secession from East Brunswick, and the borough of Helmetta was officially established. 
By 1925, the Helme Snuff Mill in Helmetta claimed to be the world's largest producer of snuff -- powdered tobacco that was snorted or applied to the gums -- and snuff-related products, like chewing tobacco. By 1934, the mill employed 400 people, most of them residents of Helmetta.
Swisher International, a large tobacco company based in West Virginia, later took over the plant and ran it successfully until 1993. Then Swisher moved all its operations south and shut down the old factory in Helmetta, vacating 16 brick and frame buildings on 31 acres -- smack at the middle of Main Street. Left behind, too, were 1,200 residents, virtually all of whom had had connections with the mill.
"The mill has been a blight on the center of town ever since," said Frank Hague, the mayor of Helmetta, who moved to the tiny town, 20 miles from Trenton and bordering on Spotswood, the year the factory closed. "The loss of property taxes and jobs was devastating." 
Helmetta has managed to get by, and even to grow, without the business that was its namesake and primary taxpayer, the town officials said. The addition of 400 condominiums and town houses several years ago helped swell the population to about 1,825, Mayor Hague said.
"But we spent a decade waiting and hoping that Swisher would find someone to purchase the mill and redevelop it," he said. "Nothing happened."
The vacant buildings were not vandalized and did not become a home for derelicts. "This is like Mayberry," the mayor said, "even though it's in the busiest part of the state. It's a nice, small, quiet town, with crab apple trees lining the streets. Our borough hall is the old schoolhouse. We have a small-town police force, and the people are respectful. It is just a waste to have the mill buildings sitting there empty." 
Finally, he said, Helmetta moved to put its own plan in the works -- a master plan for redevelopment that would turn the site into a residential and commercial center, or, maybe, a conference center.
Last year, the town began refurbishing its downtown park, situated near the mill and adjacent to Helmetta Pond, which is known to botanists for its unusual plant life. A fishing pier, walking trails and a gazebo are being installed in the park, using state and county grant money.
Meanwhile, the town declared the Helme site "an area in need of redevelopment," the first step in setting up a redevelopment area over which it will have control. It also hired Remington, Vernick & Vena Engineers and Planners, based in Toms River, to come up with a blueprint for transforming the mill property -- as long as two main mill buildings on Main Street were preserved. Last month, the firm produced its first draft, which awaits review by the town Planning Board and, if approved, by the council. The mayor and the council president say they have already looked at the plan, though, and they are thrilled.
"This redevelopment plan is exactly what we were looking for," Mr. Hague said. "It outlines our goals, and it leaves things flexible as to exactly which way we go."
Mr. Hague said about 10 developers had already contacted him about the project, for which the town may not officially solicit proposals until after the redevelopment plan is in place. The developers have floated different sorts of ideas for reviving the site, he said.
Stuart Wiser of Remington & Vernick, who is in charge of producing the redevelopment plan, said, "Its overriding philosophy is flexibility."
He added, "While we are confident that Helmetta's ideal character, its Middlesex County location, and its proximity to the economic and population centers of central and northern New Jersey will create a tremendous demand for residential and commercial space, we did not want to lock ourselves into a single project type."
The proposed plan suggests two possibilities, one residential-based and the other more commercially oriented. The first envisions a mixed-use residential complex with "appropriate commercial amenities," like a supermarket, drugstore and shopping, while the second envisions a conference center and hotel with amenities appropriate to that use.
Mr. Tancredi said he was an early supporter of the conference center concept, which he thinks takes advantage of the borough's countrified setting and central New Jersey location.
"We are within 5 or 10 minutes of every major highway in this part of the state," he said, "and 5 or 10 minutes from Exit 8A off the Turnpike. There is a huge number of warehouses doing business in the area around us -- and aside from the Marriott Inn in Cranbury, there is no specialty place like a conference center in the area. It could be a place to be rented out for weddings, too. There's always a call for that."
IN Mr. Tancredi's view, if housing is put on the mill site, it should be restricted to older adults. Helmetta now pays the town of Spotswood to educate its 240 schoolchildren, but Spotswood schools are close to capacity, Mr. Tancredi said. "The question has to be asked, Would it be irresponsible to send more kids there than is already necessary?"
While remaining flexible on the use of the site, town officials do appear to be firm about saving the larger mill buildings, especially the two seven-story main structures that are closest to Main Street. The redevelopment plan calls for, and "strongly encourages," the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of some of the existing structures, while permitting alteration or demolition of others deemed not reusable.
"Several of the two- and three-story buildings that were used to hang and dry the tobacco still have that tobacco smell worked into the wood," Mr. Hague said. "Some are old and shabby, although the two main buildings don't have a brick out of place." 
The proposed redevelopment plan specifies that any new construction is to reflect the mill's historic architecture. Helmetta has its own Historical Society, whose members collect memorabilia from the mill and its products, and who feel they have a stake in keeping its history alive, the mayor said.
"The mill is the reason we're here," he said, "and that won't be forgotten."

A Sports Guy's Credo

BYLINE:  By EWALD KIST; Written with Joseph B. Treaster.

 BODY:
TOWARD the end of World War II, life in my country, the Netherlands, was very difficult. The last winter was what they called the hungry winter. It was so bad that people ate tulip bulbs. The Germans had kicked my parents out of their house, and they were living with three other families. I was 1 year old.
 Once a month, you could get an egg. If you had a baby, you got an extra egg. Everyone living in the house would share the extra egg they'd gotten because of me. They would split it into 14 pieces. 
 After the war, the Americans helped us with aid through the Marshall Plan. It got the machinery going again. I think that's why the Dutch are always friendly and thankful toward the American people.
As an adult, I've come to believe in a work-life balance. There's more on earth than just money. I am 59 years old and the father of five children. My wife, like me, is a lawyer. And I am a sports lover, a sports guy. I played on the national field hockey team; we went to the Olympics in Mexico in 1968. I've run in six marathons.
I met my wife at a teammate's wedding. I ran my first marathon in Washington, when I was in charge of ING's North American operations. In the United States, field hockey was not considered a man's sport. So at the age of 45, I switched sports. I've run in three New York City marathons, the latest with three of my sons. And since we now are the title sponsor of the ING New York marathon, I plan to participate next year with all four of my sons.
Through sports I learned to be a team player and to go for the gold. I keep my body healthy with sports. And I set an example for my employees by engaging in activities outside the office. I'm not impressed by workaholics.
I've learned to be very efficient. In my early years, I took speed-reading courses. I can boil down my whole job to four categories: important things and unimportant things, urgent things and not-urgent things. The slow, unimportant things I leave to one side; many solve themselves.
My father was a Supreme Court judge in the Netherlands. It was an important job, but the pay was poor. We were five children; there was no money for travel, but field hockey opened the world for me. I traveled to India, Pakistan and Mexico. 
When I graduated from Leiden University, I was drafted into the Dutch Army as a lieutenant. It was my first management job. Our job was to keep the Russians out, and they never came. I had to find ways to motivate my people. For training, we had a small, unmanned plane that towed a big white blanket as a target. We tried to shoot at the target. The troops loved it. The lesson is that to get people to do things, you need to make things useful and fun.
After the army, I entered a training program at National Nederlanden, a predecessor of ING. I've worked at the company for 34 years.
Skating is another sport of mine. You may have heard about the 11-Cities Tour in Holland. I participated twice. This is a 200-kilometer skating tour over lakes and canals with some 25.000 participants. It is like a New York City marathon, but on ice. Extremely cold. Terrible winds.
A marathon is only four hours, but this lasts all day and late into the night. The hardship is extreme. You are exhausted, as in a marathon. Three-quarters of the way through a marathon you ask yourself, "What am I doing here?" People are falling down from exhaustion. But you have to have the guts to go farther and to spread your energy over the whole trip. That's the art.

HEADLINE: Behind the Region's Run-Up in Prices 

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE value of homes in the New York metropolitan area has risen faster than homes in almost all other areas in the country for more than five years, providing a bounteous reward to anyone with the foresight or luck to already own a home, but raising questions about the impact of the high prices on home seekers and housing policies. 
 Across the region, the median sale price of a single-family home has risen by 75 percent since 1998, an increase of more than $140,000, according to data collected by the National Association of Realtors. Across the country, prices have risen 26 percent in that time. 
 Of 139 separate geographic areas tracked in the price survey, the entire New York region ranked fifth in percentage gain. But Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island ranked first in the country during this period, with home prices nearly doubling; the median price of all homes sold in the two counties increased by $162,000, to $338,000. Long Island was followed by the Sacramento and San Diego areas, and then Monmouth and Ocean Counties along the Jersey shore. Bergen and Passaic Counties in northern New Jersey ranked ninth. 
At times in recent years, there have been frenzied bidding wars, with houses selling within days if not hours after being placed on the market. But more recently, brokers say, price increases are moderating; supplies of homes for sale -- especially more expensive homes -- are increasing; and the market is becoming what brokers say is "more balanced," albeit at the highest median prices ever.
"The worst you can say about housing prices is that the rate of price increases is slowing," said Rae Rosen, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "To me the continued price appreciation reflects the underlying strength of the economy in the metropolitan area. People are voting with their feet. They are saying we are staying here and paying premium prices to do so."
The surge in prices here during a period of economic weakness is the product of many factors, both national -- notably, extraordinarily low interest rates -- and local, such as a slowing in the construction of new homes, especially moderately priced ones, and a critical lack of land for new home construction.
Together, these trends raise concerns for some homeowners and home seekers. Will prices stagnate, and in some cases fall, as they did in much of the region in the early 1990's after a huge run-up in pricesduring the previous decade? Will young families today with average middle class incomes be able to afford homes in the region? What will happen if interest rates rise as high as they were a few years ago?
For Patricia Green, a senior assistant dean in the Frank G. Zarb School of Business at Hofstra, the rising housing market worked out just right. After completing her doctorate in educational administration, she was recently hired as an associate dean at Ithaca College in upstate New York and it was time to sell the house she shared with her mother and two dogs.
Her father had purchased a Cape Cod home in the original Long Island Levittown in 1952 for $6,700; it was modestly expanded some time later, but the kitchen had never been updated. 
It was put on the market for $299,990, a price her broker, Michael Litzner of Century 21 American Homes, thought would appeal to an entry-level home buyer with income of $80,000 to $100,000. The property attracted immediate interest, since more extensively remodeled Levittown homes cost upward of $100,000 more.
The potential buyers "were every age, every type of person," Dr. Green said. "There were some single women, some couples with children, some without children, older people, a racial and ethnic mix. Some were moving from condos, some moving to be closer where they worked. I had five buyers on the weekend after Memorial Day, preapproved."
By the end of Sunday, the house was sold for $300,000, $10 more than the asking price, enough to pay for a much larger house along Cayuga Lake in Ithaca with a mortgage with 5.2 percent interest.
Brokers in many parts of the region say $300,000 homes have gone the way of the 10-cent telephone call. And where homes in this price range are available, they sell quickly and are in short supply, while inventories of much higher-priced homes are rising.
For first-time buyers, the situation can be bleak. "They call you and you feel bad for them," said Sharon Tucker of Tucker Associates GMAC Real Estate in West Nyack in Rockland County. "They just got married, they are in the city and they have been renting. These homes are tough to find. You might be able to show them three or four homes, and their apartments are bigger."
A "decent little house" in Nanuet is $375,000 to $380,000, she said. Instead, she suggests a condominium in Valley Cottage for $219,000 plus $350 in monthly maintenance and $4,500 in property taxes a year.
A few years back in Clifton, N.J., Diana Bustamante of Keller Williams Team Realty sold a very nice, but small, Cape Cod house on Surrey Lane for $204,000 and, she recalled, "people thought I was a miracle maker."
Now, she said, a similar two-bedroom Cape on Lyall Road, a few blocks away, is on the market for $289,000 in a neighborhood that attracts many first-time home buyers, frequently immigrants who had been living in New York City and Hudson County. To find a larger house with a driveway and a garage in a "nice neighborhood" is nearly impossible for less than $300,000, she said.
"There are not enough properties on the market for the number of buyers out there," Ms. Bustamante said. "Where were these buyers 10 years ago? We had too many houses and not enough buyers."
In Mercer County, John Burke, manager of the Gloria Nilson GMAC Real Estate office in Hamilton, said that though the number of multiple offers on properties had declined, they were still common. "There are times that we scratch our heads trying to justify the prices," he said.

Source of the Surge
Dramatic Impact Of Falling Rates
The driving force behind the surge in prices here and across the country has been sharply falling mortgage interest rates, as the Federal Reserve Bank responded to the weakness in the economy by driving rates to their lowest levels in more than 30 years.
It is hard to overestimate the impact of these falling interest rates on the housing market. It was as if the Federal Reserve Bank had put tens of thousands of dollars in the pocket of nearly every home buyer in the country: every qualified buyer could get a larger loan, based on his or her income, at no extra cost.
Mortgage interest rates began rising in the late 1990's as the stock market took off and peaked in May 2000, at a monthly average of 8.52 percent for a 30-year mortgage, before falling to 5.23 percent last month, according to Freddie Mac.
A buyer who put down 20 percent in cash and who was willing to pay $2,000 a month in mortgage payments would have been able to afford a $325,000 house in the year 2000, but today would be able to afford a $454,000 house, a extra $129,000 or 40 percent, in purchasing power over a short period. Of course, the down payment would be almost $26,000 larger.
The lower interest rates enabled many homeowners to refinance their mortgages and either reduce payments or borrow more cash without increasing their monthly payments, or both. And even homeowners who did nothing saw their homes rise in value.
This extra purchasing power brought many thousands of new buyers into the home market. Others rushed to trade up. People who had never been able to qualify for mortgages suddenly were in the market. Prices rose, and across the country many more new homes were constructed. 
Economists say the tremendous wealth effect for those who owned homes provided some comfort in the face of stock market losses, including those in 401(k) retirement plans of people who did not otherwise dabble in the stock market, and protected the economy from a deeper recession.
The effect of this can be seen in statistics that track the mortgage payments needed to support the median priced home in the metropolitan area. Despite sharp increases in these prices, the mortgage needed to support the typical home has risen far less, and after controlling for the cost of living has actually declined from the late 1980's. 
Since the year 2000, median prices in the New York area have increased 43 percent, but the monthly mortgage payment needed to carry that home increased only 14 percent, to $1,552, and only 7 percent after accounting for inflation.
By June, when mortgage rates fell further, the mortgage on that same median house would have declined by $100 a month. Even more striking, since 1990 prices have increased by nearly 90 percent but mortgage payments have actually declined by 11 percent after accounting for inflation.

New York Region
Where Supply Is Lagging
The interest rate bounty does little to explain why housing prices are rising faster in the New York metropolitan area than elsewhere in the country. To economists, the answer can be summarized by a simple economic proposition: supply and demand.
In much of the country, the supply of housing is expanding to meet the demand. In the New York region and in a few densely populated areas on both coasts that is not happening.
David A. Lereah, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said that the run-up in prices is not evidence of a "bubble" similar to the Internet stock market frenzy, but the functioning of a rational marketplace.
"The supply of homes is very, very lean in New York," he said. "That is why you have such huge price appreciation. That is a healthy thing."
He said that around New York construction of new homes has not kept pace with job creation over the last decade. "Something has to give," he said, "so prices go up."
He said that over 10 years, one home has been created for every 1.6 jobs created nationally, but in the New York metropolitan area one home has been created for about every 16 new jobs. He estimated it would take an additional 269,007 homes in the New York area to meet the needs created by a decade of economic growth.
The comparison between the New York region and the Atlanta metropolitan area, which leads the country in new home construction, is stark. In Atlanta, one single-family home building permit was issued for every 81 residents last year, compared with one for every 735 residents in the New York area, including suburban counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to the Census Bureau. When multifamily dwellings are included, the ratio shifts to one unit for every 61 residents of Atlanta, compared with one unit for every 378 in the New York region.
The New York area, analysts say, is running out of land for large housing developments. The new homes that are being built -- not infrequently by knocking down older homes -- are marketed to more affluent buyers of large homes.
When a new home is built, it typically frees up an older, lower-priced home that is also put on the market. When fewer homes are built, this trickle-down effect is weaker. At the price range that many first-time homeowners can afford, there are few homes to be had.
Michael H. Schill, a law professor and director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, worries that the "smart growth" movement in some New York suburbs, which seeks to protect open spaces and limit sprawl in outlying areas through restrictive zoning, is cutting into the supply of land for housing. In theory, high-density developments are supposed to compensate for land left undeveloped, but proposals for such developments are often fiercely resisted.
"If you limit the amount of land that can be used for housing, there is no surer way of getting higher home prices," he said. "It is transferring wealth from renters and people getting into the market to upper income people."
The demand for lower priced homes may be so extreme and the supply so limited that it is distorting statistics in the New York area and perhaps exaggerating the median price increase, according to some housing analysts and appraisers.
The median price data compiled by the National Association of Realtors is based mainly on prices at closings reported by local multiple listing services used by brokers across the country. It is the most current national housing price survey, although it excludes sales by owners and exclusive sales not reported to the listing services. 
Jeffrey G. Otteau, the president of the Otteau Appraisal Group, which publishes market reports for much of New Jersey, said the housing picture "is not quite as optimistic" as the closely followed median price figures suggest.
When the New Jersey Board of Realtors recently published figures showing continuing double-digit increases in median prices in Ocean and Monmouth Counties, he concluded that most of the houses sold were new homes in "luxury price ranges," while more down-to-earth homes were hard to find. Thus, the median-price home, with half of all sales higher and half lower, moved upward.
"Most builders wish they could find land for lower priced homes, but municipalities don'twant it," he said. "The trend is that most are increasing their minimum lot size requirements."
He estimated, based on recent transactions, that the true price increases in New Jersey this year will be far lower than in recent years, closer to 5 percent. 
The same pattern may hold in Westchester County, where 2,200 building permits were reported last year, including 1,049 for single-family homes. The new construction is barely enough to replace homes lost through fires and demolition, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. 
In Westchester, he said, inventory was up and sales were down, but, contrary to the usual functioning of supply and demand, median prices remain higher than ever. 
Mary Ellen Tolan, a broker in the Scarsdale office of Houlihan/Lawrence, said that inventory is rising for the most expensive properties, while there was little available at the lower end of the market, which in Scarsdale is $500,000 to $600,000. "There is softness at anything over $2 million," she said. "Sellers have been holding the line, but we are starting to see some compromise."
A similar pattern is evident in the Manhattan condominium and co-op market. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal company, said that prices currently seem to be rising over levels of a year ago but that there was a quarter-to-quarter price decline in the first quarter of this year. In that period, prices of the properties in the highest 10 percent of the market fell more, by 11.5 percent, than the overall median, which declined by 1.9 percent.

Looking Ahead
Weighing the Effects Of Increases in Rates
But what happens when mortgage interest rates stop falling and start to rise? Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, remembers the local real estate boom in the early 1980's, followed by years of static and even declining prices in the recession in the early 1990's, and says the current market is risky for anyone who buys now and needs to sell within a year or two. 
Although many economists forecast a modest rise in interest rates during the second half of this year, they say that it will probably have little effect on the housing market. If rates rise as part of a broad economic recovery, incomes will rise too, limiting the impact on home prices and values.
Under this theory, buyers will then have to pay more each month to cover the cost of a new home purchase, but will have more income available. Unless the local economy hits some unexpected bumps, they say, the demand for homes by aging baby boomers and immigrant families will probably continue as well.
The lack of inventory of moderately priced homes is having a ripple effect across the region. 
In the Bronx, demand is keen but inventory low, according to Joseph F. Limongelli, a broker at Better Homes Realty and president of the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors. 
He said that homeowners in the East Bronx, Throgs Necks and surrounding areas are finding housing in the suburbs more expensive to buy and to own, because of higher taxes, and are staying in the Bronx. In Throgs Neck, a one-family row house is selling for about $310,000, and larger three-bedroom houses for $350,000. "People are staying put rather than moving to the suburbs," he said. "A lot of them are improving what they have and staying."

New Kind of Snooping Arrives at the Office

BYLINE:  By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM

 BODY:
CORPORATE executives are becoming increasingly aggressive about spying on their employees, and with good reason: now, in addition to job shirkers and office-supply thieves, they have to worry about being held accountable for the misconduct of their subordinates.
 Even one offensive e-mail message circulated around the office by a single employee can pose a liability risk for a company. Not only that, but a wave of laws -- including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the anticorruption and corporate-governance Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 -- have imposed new record-keeping and investigative burdens on companies. Not complying with some laws can result in the personal liability of officers and directors. 
 As a result, employers have stepped up their surveillance of employees, often using stealth techniques to peer deep into their computer use. As of 2001, more than a third of all American workers with access to computers, or 14 million in all, were being monitored in one way or another, according to the Privacy Foundation, a Denver research group; with added pressure on executives to oversee their employees' electronic activities, experts predict that those numbers will grow.
Indeed, while companies still use cameras and phone taps to track down the bad eggs and sometimes even send detectives into the office to poke around for evidence after hours, most scrutiny focuses on computers, the weapon of choice for corporate wrongdoers.
A growing band of specialists in a field called human-resource forensics are using the latest technology to record everything from the Web sites employees visit to the files they delete to the data they download, even as workplace and legal experts are raising red flags about some of those efforts.
Though some forms of surveillance are perfectly proper, they say, using technology to spy on employees can damage workplace morale and, if taken to extremes, test the boundaries of what is ethical or legal. At the very least, these experts urge companies to think hard before turning their workplaces into areas where no one feels trusted.
The key, says Arthur G. Tisi, chief executive of atthought.com, a technology-services company in Tarrytown, N.Y., is being consistent and "maintaining a moral compass."
The most important decision for companies to make, Mr. Tisi says, is whether extensive surveillance will violate the corporate culture or otherwise be counterproductive. "For example, if your institution is all about freedom of information and you're monitoring your employees, there is an obvious conflict," he said.
If a company monitors employees' activities, Mr. Tisi says, it should identify the reason why: whether it is to gauge employee productivity, contain costs, fight corporate espionage or comply with legal requirements. He also suggests formulating a policy and creating a committee of people from all parts of the organization to implement it.
Margaret Blair Soyster, an employment lawyer in New York with the law firm Clifford Chance, says that employers should have a written policy advising employees that their e-mail messages are not private but can be read by their supervisors, that the technology they use at work belongs to the company and that the company reserves the right to monitor the computer activities of employees.
"It should also make it explicit that technology shouldn't be used in any way that could contribute to a hostile work environment," she said, adding that even circulating off-color jokes through e-mail could fall into this category. "And employees should sign off on the policy."
SUCH precautions probably make it easier for companies to deal with troublemakers without becoming embroiled in legal disputes, experts say. Ms. Soyster recalled the case of a company that tracked employees' movements within the building electronically and discovered that an especially unproductive employee spent excessive hours at work. It then examined his computer use and concluded he was visiting Internet pornography sites for six or seven hours a day.
Confronted, the employee tried a novel defense. "His response was that he had a sexual compulsion that was a disability that the company needed to accommodate," Ms. Soyster said.
Ultimately, he left the company without pursuing his claim, but Ms. Soyster said she believed that the ability to monitor his activities had helped the client get rid of an unproductive employee and contain a potential liability -- the risk that another employee would complain that the man's activities had created a hostile work environment.
Even the decision to monitor the e-mail system, something that most employees have come to expect, is not without risks.
"Companies have to be careful about what they are watching for," said Clifford R. Atlas, an employment lawyer in New York with the law firm Jackson Lewis. "If there's union organizing going on, then acts of surveillance can lead to an unfair-labor-practices charge."
Some companies are engaged in what might be called surveillance light, hiring third parties to question employees about their concerns and seek out information from them. One such service provider is eePulse of Ann Arbor, Mich.
Some queries are open-ended, like, "What issues are you having at work?" Others seek particular information, like whether employees have witnessed improper behavior in their departments. Employees respond directly to eePulse, which compiles the data and returns information to the company without revealing the identity of individual respondents.
Theresa M. Welbourne, eePulse's chief executive, said the employees her company contacted via its Measurecom software were often wary at first, but warmed up to the task once they realized that their participation was voluntary and that the confidentiality of their responses was guaranteed.
"We perform a different kind of audit," Dr. Welbourne said. "If you look at some of the big scandals lately, if they had our kind of data, we could have known about it a long time ago."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; 
Sarah Massey, William Leggett

 BODY:
Sarah Elizabeth Massey, a daughter of Dr. Marilyn Chapin Massey and James A. Massey of Paris, was married last evening to William Hinch Leggett, the son of Jane Hinch Leggett of Flushing, Queens, and the late William W. Leggett. The Rev. Susan Marlan, an interfaith minister, officiated at the New York Aquarium in Brooklyn. 
 Ms. Massey, 29, is keeping her name. She is the communications director of the National Employment Law Project in Manhattan, an advocacy organization for the unemployed and working poor. She graduated from the State University College at Cortland, N.Y., and received a master's degree in urban planning from Hunter. Her father retired as an actor in Los Angeles. Her mother, also retired, was the president of Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif. 
 Mr. Leggett, 32, teaches English at Forest Hills High School in Queens. He also graduated from Cortland and received a master's degree in English literature at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University. His mother retired from the Department of Corrections as a chaplain at the Rose M. Singer Correctional Facility for Women on Riker's Island. His father covered horse racing for Sports Illustrated.
Ms. Massey and Mr. Leggett met in 1994 at Cortland, when they were dialogue partners in a Spanish class, which led to studying together.
One day, he stuck a note in a fortune cookie. As Ms. Massey recalled, "It said, 'You will go out with a handsome young man and make him very happy,' and I thought, of course."
But it did not last. Ms. Massey said, "We were young -- I was 21, Bill was 24 -- and I don't think I was ready for a major commitment."
In 1999, a college friend asked if she knew what had become of Mr. Leggett. "We hadn't spoken for four years," Ms. Massey remembered. "I wrote him a letter that night, and basically in the letter I said, I'm well, I hope you're well. Basically, I apologized." 
She mailed the letter on a Monday, and by that Friday she received two single-spaced typed pages, with his telephone number. She called that night, and they talked for hours, ending with a plan to go to the Bronx Zoo the next Monday.
On opening the door and seeing him, Ms. Massey realized she wanted to pick up where she had left off. "I remember the moment. I almost fell over. He was dressed real nice, and he didn't look like a kid anymore -- he looked like a man. And he was wearing the cologne I had given him, four years later."

A Soft Landing for the Boomers?

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS baby boomers face retirement, they have a problem of their own making. This often-pampered and self-indulgent generation is unprepared financially. Instead of saving, too many of them have mortgaged their futures for a BMW lifestyle.
 The latest figures from the Federal Reserve show that the median net worth -- or difference between assets and liabilities -- is $123,684 for families whose household heads are 45 to 54 years old. That means that half the families have more than this amount and half have less. The average net worth for the group is $419,073, but the median is probably more representative because income distribution in the United States is heavily skewed toward the top, a trend that has been accelerating in recent years. 
 These assets, especially the median figure, do not point to lavish retirements, and the clock is ticking. Boomers are turning 50 at the rate of seven every minute and will continue to do so until 2014, according to American Demographics magazine.
Of course, it's wrong to generalize excessively about this generation of70 million or so people. Dr. Robert N. Butler, the president of the International Longevity Center-USA, a research organization in Manhattan, has observed that the quintessential upscale baby-boomer lifestyle often depicted in the media tends to be a coastal phenomenon; in the center of the country, boomers are almost indistinguishable from the rest of the population.
No one should generalize, either, about how much money people need to retire comfortably, despite the mutual fund industry's self-serving estimate that it will take at least 70 percent of your annual preretirement income.
Deena Katz, 53, an independent financial adviser and the president of Evensky, Brown & Katz, a financial planning firm in Coral Gables, Fla., has some definite opinions about her generation. She says the fundamental difference between baby boomers and their parents is in the philosophy of and approach to "things."
"The big issue for baby boomers is that they live in the immediate now," she said. "They have always given themselves everything they thought they were entitled to. When my folks needed a refrigerator, they saved money and bought it. Notice I said 'needed,' not 'wanted.' Now, when boomers want a refrigerator, they buy it and pay it off over time.
"So the boomers are absolutely going to have a hard time making an adjustment to a downsized lifestyle, because they haven't saved enough to continue as they have been living."
But many will have to make that adjustment, and she expects the boomers to solve the problem in a way typical of their generation: they will change the rules.
"I don't think the boomers will be a generation of traditional retirees," Ms. Katz said. "We will be a generation of repositioning."
"Repositioning" is another way of saying that the boomers will continue to work in some fashion and will stay very active in their version of "retirement" -- as has been indicated in most surveys.
BUT what about the generation's resistance to giving up "things" and living a less expensive life?
"They are going to have to make some sacrifices and changes," Ms. Katz said. "And that will work for them if they are convinced these changes are positive rather than negative."
She also says that many baby boomers and others who maintain that they don't want to move to a less expensive part of the country when they retire will actually do so when the time comes. A recent survey by Harris Interactive for Del Webb, the big builder of retirement communities, may support that notion. In the April survey, 59 percent of baby boomers aged 44 to 56 said they would relocate in retirement; in a similar survey in 1999, only 31 percent of those from 48 to 52 said they would do so.
"We'll see a great exodus from the cities into a simpler, less complicated lifestyle," she said. "But it will be a positive thing for the boomers -- not, 'You're going to have to sacrifice and downsize!' but, 'I want to make my life simpler and the plus in that is that it's going to cost me less.' This will be their salvation from the problem of not having saved enough. When the mutual fund industry says you can't retire on less than 70 percent of your preretirement income, the boomers will say, 'Not me, baby; I'm going to figure it out.' "
The differences in housing prices around the country show why boomers might be willing to move.
Whenever I check home prices on the Internet, in newspapers or in real estate booklets, I am astounded by the low prices outside major metropolitan areas, particularly when I look away from the East or West Coasts. That $300,000 you might pay for a small house in the New York or San Francisco areas will buy much more in Arkansas or New Mexico.
Last winter, I took a car trip through the eastern part of West Virginia, then south through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. I picked up several real estate booklets along the way. While plenty of homes were listed in the $200,000-to-$300,000 range, there were also these:
* A new home on a one-acre wooded lot. It had three bedrooms, two baths, vaulted ceilings, a fully equipped kitchen, a fireplace, a basement and a deck with a hot tub. The asking price was $149,900.
* A two-story log home on five acres. Three bedrooms and two baths. $95,000.
* A ranch house on 1.77 acres. Three bedrooms, two baths, a fireplace, deck and a double garage. $119,000. 
Of course, these houses have probably been sold by now, and comparable houses may have risen a bit in price. They may not match your personal tastes or be in areas where you want to live, but you get the idea.
A good Web site for home prices nationwide is www.realtor.com. To compare costs of living, including home prices, among most cities and towns, try www.BestPlaces.net. It's an eye-opener for coastal boomers.

Economic Slump Hits Men the Hardest

BYLINE:  By Steven Greenhouse

 BODY:
EVEN though the pay wasn't great, Michael Deloach, 41, was happy with his $7-an-hour job as a messenger for a Wall Street firm. It was steady, full-time work; he felt needed, and he was not expecting anything better because he was a high-school dropout.
 Then came the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and his firm laid him off, after four years on the job. Since then, Mr. Deloach has tried other messenger jobs but the work there was so unsteady and the pay so meager that he left them. Now he is looking for jobs as a security guard, janitor or messenger. "It's real hard out there because I have no computer skills and I don't have a G.E.D., and even if I did, it would still be hard," he said. 
 Mr. Deloach is the victim of a surprising twist in New York's economic slump -- it has hit men much harder then women. The industries in the city hit hardest by the downturn -- finance, software, airline and construction -- employ men disproportionately, and as a result the jobless rate for men has risen much faster than for women. 
The male jobless rate soared by 3.3 percentage points from 2000 to 2002, reaching an average of 8.8 percent in 2002, according to an analysis by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group that serves the poor. Women fared considerably better, with their jobless rate rising by 1.5 percentage points to 7.6 percent in 2002.
"The rate for men tends to be more volatile because they're concentrated in blue-collar industries like manufacturing and construction, which go up and down with the job cycle," said James Brown, an economist with the New York State Department of Labor.
The job picture for women was brighter, largely because there was little job shrinkage in three major fields where women are employed disproportionately -- health services, education and social services. In those three areas, women represent more than 70 percent of the work force in the city, including 82 percent in social services, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"It isn't so much which industries have been losing employment so much as which industries have managed to gain employment throughout the recession, and those have been education, health and social services, which have been the mainstays of women's employment, particularly for less well-educated women," said Mark Levitan, senior policy analyst at the Community Service Society. 
A stark way of seeing how hard men in New York have been hit is to examine the employment-population ratio -- the percentage of men, aged 16 to 64, who are holding jobs. On average in 2002, the percentage of men with jobs dropped to 67.8 percent from 72.9 percent in 2000, a sharp 5.1 percentage points. In contrast, the ratio of women working fell by just 1.6 percentage points over those two years, to 56.8 percent.
The drop in the employment-population ratio for young men, age 16 through 24, was especially steep, falling by 9.7 percentage points, to just 36.4 percent. In contrast, the ratio for women age 16 to 24 fell just 1.2 percentage points, to 40.4 percent.
There was also a sharp decline for black and Hispanic men. Among working-age Hispanic men, the percentage with jobs fell by 7 percentage points to 65.5 percent, while for black men, the drop was 6.1 percentage points, to 58.1 percent. For black women, the employment rate fell just 1.1 percentage points, while for Hispanic women, the drop was 2.9 percentage points. 
Many labor force experts say young men with limited education are usually the last to be hired, and when the economy boomed in the 1990's, many found jobs. But when the economy weakened, they were often the first to be laid off. For men without a high school diploma, the percentage holding jobs fell 6.2 percentage points from 2000 to 2002.
"All this provides a clue to one mystery -- why the welfare rolls haven't been growing during this slump," said Mr. Levitan. "I don't want to say this is the answer, but it's part of the answer. The industries that have provided a lot of employment to less well-educated single mothers continued to grow through the recession -- health, education and social services."
But Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist with The New York STAT, an economic newsletter, said the good news for women may not last because fields like health and social services may soon make large-scale layoffs as the city and state grapple with their budget deficits. 
"The ability of women as a group to sidestep the worst of the recession may not last much longer," she said.

Detecting Signs of Life In Japan's Economy

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
AFTER more than a decade of watching the Japanese economy flounder and the stock market lose three-quarters of its value, many investors might not be willing to believe that a turn could be at hand.
 Still, the broadest stock market index, the Tokyo Price Index, has risen by more than 16 percent so far this year in dollar terms. Virtually all of that gain has come the last couple months. 
 Stephen Mitchell, who heads a team of Japanese equity specialists in London that manages about $5 billion at J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, took some time last week to assess whether what is going on is real or another bear trap. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. Why do you think the Japanese stock market has turned?

A. Over the past two years, companies have been working at restructuring and improving their cash flow. That has gradually been coming through. Also, the Big Three Japanese auto companies are winning market share in the United States, Europe and are growing share in China.
Also, the government is extremely worried about a possible debt crisis. With little economic growth, there is not enough tax revenue to service the debt, which is more than 100 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. So they have to reflate the economy and keep the currency relatively weak. That reflation has started to come at the same time that balance sheets are improving.

Q. Have these efforts to stimulate the economy changed your economic forecast?

A. Currently, we are forecasting the economy will grow at a 1.2 percent rate, but we are in the process of revising our growth numbers higher.
We are looking for consumption, which is about half of gross domestic product in Japan, to start picking up. We have gotten the first glimmering of that in the last couple of months. But you can feel the energy beginning to pick up.

Q. Which sectors have been most successful in restructuring?

A. The number of sectors that have sorted themselves out is remarkable. Everything from shipbuilding to steel to rolling stock makers and plant engineers. Not only are the new industries doing well, but some of the old industries are coming back very strongly. In steel, for example, there are now only two big companies, which is a major change from a decade ago, when there were about 20.

Q. Have the problems in Japan's banking sector been resolved?

A. The banking situation is not resolved. They still have nonperforming loans to write down, and they are still undercapitalized. But big companies don't need to borrow from the banks. And small and medium-sized companies that need to borrow can go to a quasi-governmental lending organization to get access to capital. There is not a shortage of capital to grow.
In terms of their importance to the Japanese stock market, the banks, which used to represent about 24 percent of the market's capitalization, now make up about 7 percent. The five major city banks are now only about 3 percent of the market.

Q. How important is China in a Japanese recovery?

A. China is very important for Japan. It is a huge opportunity, and looks like a profitable one. The Japanese were relatively late coming to China, but they are moving in strongly now. The Chinese need machinery and capital equipment to bring their factories up to world standard, and Japanese manufacturers like Fanuc are providing that.
The other thing China needs is infrastructure, which means a boom for companies like Komatsu. China is their most profitable market. And the growth of the Chinese market is a real spur for Japanese shipping companies.

Q. Are Japanese stocks correctly valued?

A. We are about 75 percent below the 1989 peak. But valuations in Japan are in line with the global norm. Small-cap Japanese stocks are a bit cheap.
But at the moment, the market's capitalization is less than 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. That is about where it was in 1986. If you can snap the economy out of this deflationary spiral, you are going to have a market that is seriously cheap.

Q. Where are you putting your money?

A. Our focus in Japan is on manufacturing, which is where you are getting the profit recovery, and in the service sector, because it is underdeveloped compared to the United States and Europe.
In the service sector we like some of the labor outsourcing companies like Goodwill and Fullcast. 
In addition to Fanuc and Komatsu, other manufacturing companies we like are blue chips like Canon and Bridgestone. And we like a company like Nitto Denko, which is a supplier to the liquid-crystal display manufacturers.

In the Urban 7-Eleven, the Slurpee Looks Sleeker

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
THIS is not the 7-Eleven you grew up with.
 Gone are the garish red, orange and green stripes wrapping the top of the store. Gone, too, is the parking lot. Instead of anchoring a strip mall, this store is in a new, 48-story condominium building in the fashionable River North district of downtown Chicago, with a small 7-Eleven logo hanging from the sandstone facade. 
 Inside, a huge coffee bar, flanked by cases of deli sandwiches and pastries, fills the front of the store; the rack with a dozen kinds of beef jerky has been relegated to the back. The wall is painted in "grasslands," not off-white. Pendant lamps hang from faux tin ceilings, and the porcelain-tile floors are meant to look like wood. 
The store opened on Wednesday and, ceremonially at least, is the chain's 25,000th outlet worldwide. At the opening, waiters in tuxedos served doughnut centers and taquitos while a high school choir belted "Oh Thank Heaven," the paean to hot dogs, chips and Slurpees that was written last year for the company's 75th anniversary. The opening was not just a milestone for 7-Eleven Inc., whose stores had $33 billion in sales and a daily average of six million customers last year. It also was a chance to meditate on the chain-ification of cities -- and the evolution of the concept of convenience.
To Murray Forseter, editor and publisher of Chain Store Age, a trade publication, "it's a symbol of the nation of convenience we have become and actually the world has become; it's a symbol of the longevity of a concept."
To Jane Jacobs, the Toronto-based author of several books on cities and economics, "it's a symbol of stagnation; we don't want the same things on every corner, especially when it seems to be at the expense of having some really new ideas."
To Christina Callender, 20, a culinary school student who lives upstairs, it was a chance to get a free cherry-Coke Slurpee. "I grew up with a 7-Eleven down the street," she said between slurps.
"Who didn't?" asked her boyfriend, Jacob Rolfes.
The chain actually has 25,076 outlets worldwide -- its fast growth in Asia outpaced the grand-opening hoopla here -- compared with a total of 30,081 for McDonald's. In the United States, 7-Eleven has 5,775 stores, versus 15,646 for Subway, 13,531 for McDonald's and 5,609 for Blockbuster.
Such huge numbers are hardly surprising in a nation where chains account for 60 to 70 percent of all retail sales -- including restaurants but not cars. Chains have even made inroads in Manhattan, though 7-Eleven's plans for a Times Square store fell through last year.
"When we're used to one of these places, we don't want to go out of our way to find it," Wendy Liebman, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm based in New York, said of the ubiquity of chains of all kinds. "We've come to know that we can guarantee that those companies in particular will provide a consistent product and offering. It short-circuits the discussion and the decision making."
Or, it short-circuits American culture, because the cookie-cutter interiors of many stores can make customers wonder whether they are in Chicago or Charlottesville.
"I don't want to sound too much like a crybaby or a whiner, but 7-Elevens are boring," said Eric Brown of the Center for a New American Dream, a nonprofit group that aims to counter the commercialism of culture. He added that he did not see the benefit of "counting on the sameness of McDonald's french fries or a Slurpee."
The chain began in Dallas in 1927 as the Southland Corporation, an ice company whose Tote'm stores offered eggs, milk and bread on the side. The stores' name changed in 1946, to pitch the novel notion of staying open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Slurpee, the company's icy carbonated signature, was introduced in 1966, and the Double Big Gulp, its 64-ounce cup for soft drinks, in 1988. Since 1991, when Southland emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, two Japanese companies -- Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan -- have owned a majority interest in the company; its name was changed to 7-Eleven Inc. in 1999.
Today, nearly all 7-Elevens are open 24 hours a day. The chain says that it sells more cold bottled water, grilled hot dogs and money orders than any other American retailer, and that its customers visit an average of 17 times over four weeks, buying a total of a million cups of coffee a day and 11.6 million Slurpees a month.
MUCH of the chain's growth has been in Japan, which has 9,757 stores -- 77 per million people, far more than the 20 per million in the United States, but less than the 148 per million in Taiwan.
The frenetic growth in Asia, where convenience stores are more like pantries for city dwellers who are short on space, spurred the American strategy reflected in the River North store, one of 84 urban walk-up stores to open since 2000. The idea is to emphasize fresh food -- like a pair of hard-boiled eggs for 89 cents -- over packaged staples. "It's dashboard dining for the pedestrian, quite honestly," said Steve Hall, vice president for real estate and development. "In the urban environment we could probably have a store, literally, on every block."
The urban 7-Elevens are proliferating as the retail industry in general is focusing more on convenience. But while stores like Wal-Mart and Walgreens define convenience as ever-bigger stores with ever-expanding selection, 7-Eleven and other convenience-store chains are building smaller outlets with fewer products. These c-stores -- defined as places that are open at least 13 hours a day and sell, among other things, diapers, canned tuna, pet food, ketchup and toothpaste -- want people in and out, fast.
"We sell time, literally," said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. "Whether you walk into a store or drive into a store, from the time you go in to the time you go out, is usually three to four minutes. Some of these other places offering one-stop shopping, you're probably looking at three to four minutes circling the parking lot."
At the new 7-Eleven in River North, Colin McQueen, a Londoner spending six weeks in Chicago, picked up The Financial Times on his way to work. Megan Ennessy, 24, marveled at the flavor shots -- cherry, lemon and vanilla -- at the new Slurpee machine.
"This amazes me: the Slurpees have come a long way," said Ms. Ennessy, who recalled biking to her suburban neighborhood 7-Eleven as a child but had not seen one since she moved downtown. "For me, Starbucks can be more of a treat. 7-Eleven can be an every-morning, every day kind of thing. Or night, really."

Tax Policy That Uses Economies Of Scales

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
AS most full-time residents of foreign vacation spots will tell you, Americans are fat. And, as statistics will tell you, we're getting fatter. Doctors and nutritionists have been encouraging us to slim down for years. But to solve a big part of this big problem of big people, we need economics.
 Wait a second, this sounds like economists' getting too big for their breeches again. Next they'll be telling us how to appreciate art or find a soul mate, right? Not quite. In many cases, the problem of obesity fits well into an economic model. 
 First of all, obesity often persists as a result of individual choice. It may result from a disease or an inherited condition. But most individuals have the power to affect their own weight through diet, exercise and other habits.
Second, obesity is easily observable. A few measurements are all it takes to place a person somewhere along the continuum from dangerously skinny to Brobdingnagian.
Third, an individual's obesity can affect many people. As a result, it becomes a societal issue as well as a medical problem.
Precisely identifying these effects can be difficult. At least one seems much more important than squeezed seats on airplanes, however. Obesity increases the risk of many medical problems. When someone has a heart attack, chances are either taxpayers or members of a private insurance plan will foot most of the bill. And, thanks to modern medicine, the obese elderly survive almost as long as their thinner counterparts.
Last month, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn suggested a tax on fatty foods to discourage their consumption. An economist might take exception to this plan, because the tax would punish even people who ate such foods in moderation. Of course, that has not stopped similar justifications for taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Even if you have just one drink or cigarette a year, you still pay heavy "sin" taxes.
Two weeks ago, Kraft Foods decided to lower the fat content of some recipes and reduce the sizes of single-serving snacks. Again, this approach is slightly clumsy. Even if you're eating rice cakes, you'll gain weight if you eat enough of them. And though some Americans may be happy with a smaller packet of cookies, others may just buy two and finish them both. (Kraft said nothing about cutting the snacks' prices in line with the portions.)
Another kind of remedy might have more success. The problem is obesity, not fatty food or anything else that contributes to being overweight. So why not take aim at obesity directly?
Basic economics recommends taxing individual behaviors that hurt society. But taxing overweight people, perhaps by identifying them and then assessing them some social cost of obesity every year, sounds draconian and impractical.
A more palatable solution might be to collect a lump-sum tax from every American and put the proceeds into a reward pool. Each year, anyone who wanted to could go to an existing government office for a simple series of measurements. People who registered normal weights throughout the year would receive cash rewards from the pool -- much like a tax refund.
This system would still tax obesity, though it would not tax the heaviest people more than the merely rotund. Nor would it tax the middle-aged and disease-prone more than the roly-poly young. Nevertheless, the incentive to lose a few pounds might be quite powerful.
TO see why, consider just one cost of the overweight and obese population: the extra burden it imposes on the Medicare and Medicaid programs paid for by taxpayers. A study published in May by Eric Finkelstein and Ian Fiebelkorn of RTI International, a research group in North Carolina, and Guijing Wang of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put that figure at $40 billion to $50 billion a year. The average cost to society is about $250 a year for each of about 180 million heavy Americans.
There are about 300 million Americans in total, so setting the lump-sum tax at $100 a year would yield $30 billion for the reward pool -- enough to reward about 120 million Americans of normal weight with checks for $250.
Most likely, not everyone of normal weight would collect the reward. High-income thin people, for example, might be too busy for the weigh-in. These no-shows would allay the regressive nature of the lump-sum tax, as well as leave plenty of money to cover administrative costs.
Those who are not obese would be $150 richer on balance, while obese Americans would be out $100 -- a total difference of $250. And $250, though perhaps not foie gras, is not exactly chicken feed.

HEADLINE: Grand Theft Auto 

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
CARS have all sorts of devices to protect them from being stolen. Car designs are just there for the taking.
 No shrill alarms warn passers-by to step away from a distinctive body shape. No global-positioning satellites track the perpetrators of roofline larceny and automatically alert the patent police. No late-night advertorials sell locking clubs to prevent wheel patterns from being purloined. 
 But on the road, drivers are more and more likely to do double takes on automotive double shapes. Doesn't that new Nissan Maxima look like a larger-scale Saturn Ion? Could the Kia Sorento be a Lexus RX 300 in disguise? Doesn't the face of the Nissan Z look like that of the Toyota Celica (and its taillamps like those of the Lexus SC 430)? Is that the new Bentley -- or the new Hyundai?
A few years ago, people complained that cars in general were beginning to look alike. But now cars in specific are looking more and more like other cars. Aerodynamics were once blamed for the melding of shapes into a common silhouette. Today, all designers confront the same detailed safety and economy standards, and they all work with the same "space packages" of dominant vehicle types, from minivans to S.U.V.'s to the blended vehicles known as crossovers.
But today's designers also communicate more with one another and move more often among companies and across continents. Many attended the same schools, notably the Art Center College in Pasadena, Calif.
In January, at the designers' party during the Detroit auto show, a Woodward Avenue club was packed with an all-star cast of designers from companies including Mitsubishi, Porsche, General Motors, Ford, BMW and Rolls-Royce. A bad seafood salad would have crippled the global auto industry.
Imitation pays the compliment not only of flattery, but of admiration. Jaguar's chief designer, Ian Callum, says certain seminal models have had such profound impact that they influence all the cars that come later. "The Porsche 911 was one, of course," he said. "The Audi TT was a watershed."
Today, admiration for the designs of Audis and Volkswagens has infected the looks of Nissans, Mitsubishis and even Fiats. Several leading designers now suggest that Nissan is setting the design standard, which would be a first for a Japanese company.
Success naturally breeds imitation. "Good artists copy; great artists steal," Picasso supposedly said, though the quotation itself has been swiped by others.
"Hommage" is Hollywood's polite word for this process. When Brian De Palma tumbled a baby carriage down a staircase in "The Untouchables," he paid homage to a similar scene in a 1925 Sergei Eisenstein film, "The Battleship Potemkin." But one man's hommage is another's petty theft. The Chrysler Crossfire's side vents pay homage to the car's corporate cousin, the Mercedes SL 500, but putting a Bentley rump on a Hyundai is something else.
Sometimes it is easy to see which of two similar cars came first. The Infiniti FX45 was already in production when its lines were shadowed by the Lexus HPX, a design study for a similar sport wagon. Since Lexus has not announced plans to build the HPX, it cannot be charged with theft, only intent. But in other cases, given the long progress of designs from sketch to metal, precedence is less clear. Did the Ion or the Maxima come first? (Another sedan with the counterfeit Ion roofline, the 2004 Mitsubishi Galant, isn't on sale yet.)
Some manufacturers use styling to suggest visually that their cars are the equal of more expensive models. Korean automakers seem especially unabashed in borrowing styling from more exclusive models, recalling the cloners of sunglasses who display dozens of styles with a sign that says, "Compare in price with Oakley." Or with Ray-Ban or Armani or Versace.
"Compare in price with Jaguar" may be the message of the Hyundai XG350's prominent grille, which also resembles those of Infinitis. The same car's rear suggests, "Compare with Bentley Arnage." The Hyundai Sonata's amoebic headlamps say, "Compare with Mercedes"; they look much like those of the C-Class.
Some styling features are borrowed because they send a more specific message. The signature of Jaguar's sporty R series cars is a black mesh grille that resembles medieval chain mail. When Cadillac wanted to signal that its new CTS-V was also a high-performance model, it added a mesh grille, too.
The Five-Hundred sedan in Ford's future looks like an Audi. No surprise, perhaps, since Ford's design chief, J Mays, was once in charge of Audi design. And the look is appropriate for the Five-Hundred's mission: to offer European luxury at an American price.
Many auto designs are ostensibly protected by design patents, which are far harder to enforce than technical ones. Mr. Mays's name is attached to several design patents, including one for the Concept One, precursor of the New Beetle.
"We get design patents on our work," said Joe Dehner, a Chrysler designer. "But that is more to protect against after-market manufacturers of replacement parts."
Last year, for the first time in memory , a company went to court to protect a design. DaimlerChrysler sued G.M. over similarities between grilles of Hummers and Jeeps, but failed to win in court. Chrysler also sent warning letters suggesting that grilles of the Lexus RX 300 and Kia Sportage were too close to Jeep's.
And G.M. sued a tiny Florida company, Avanti, over its design for a hulking S.U.V. that would revive the Studebaker nameplate. G.M. contends that the Studebaker looks too much like its Hummer H2. A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 18.
In his 1973 book "The Anxiety of Influence," Professor Harold Bloom of Yale suggests that poets start out trying to imitate older poets they admire. Those who have real talent fail at the effort, of course, and produce original works despite themselves. The idea may apply to car designers as well: sometimes, poetic license includes a license to steal.

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Automobiles section last Sunday about the copying of car designs misidentified the home state of the Avanti Motor Corporation, which was sued by General Motors over the look of its Studebaker sport utility. It is Georgia, not Florida.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Earnings Are Worse Without The Icing

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
CORPORATE earnings season got off to its official start last week, and the second-quarter results had better be good. If they are not, the big move in stocks of the last few months will have less footing than rational investors require. 
 But even if many companies report decent numbers, investors should not break out the Dom Perignon. Because the quality of earnings has declined so significantly among the nation's largest companies -- those in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- it is not hyperbolic to advise investors to view every profit report with suspicion. 
 David Bianco, accounting analyst at UBS in New York, said: "The quality of earnings for the S.& P. 500, from an accounting standpoint, is the worst it has been in more than a decade." And he has done the work to prove it.
The slide is largely the result of aggressive accounting practices in three areas, he said. First are so-called special charges, which companies say are one-time events from re-structurings or asset impairments, but which may actually include recurring operational costs that should be deducted from revenue. Second is the choice many companies have made not to subtract the costs of stock options from their results, and finally, there are those rosy pension assumptions -- inflating pension earnings or masking pension costs -- that improve corporate earnings.
Taken together, earnings at many companies are not what many investors think they are, Mr. Bianco said. As a result, these company shares sport a higher cost, in the form of a price-earnings ratio, than investors believe.
He analyzed results at each of the S.& P. 500 companies over the last 11 years, viewing earnings and accounting practices over an entire economic cycle. Then, he adjusted the companies' reported earnings for special charges, stock-option grants and overly rosy pension assumptions. What he found was that in 1991, the adjusted earnings were roughly 18 percent less than those the companies reported to shareholders: $15.91 a share versus $19.50 a share. 
Shifting to 2002, the difference grows vast: earnings adjusted for the funny stuff were 41 percent less than the profits reported to investors. 
So while investors may have thought that they were paying roughly 19 times the earnings of S.& P. companies to own the index last year, they were really paying almost 25 times profits after adjustments for the three items. 
At individual companies the numbers become even more troubling. Texas Instruments, which analysts expect to earn roughly 35 cents a share this year, would earn 10 cents a share if Mr. Bianco's adjustments were made. That increases its price-earnings ratio from 54 to 188, based on Friday's close. And at eBay, Mr. Bianco figures that while analysts forecast its profit at $1.46 a share, the figure would drop to 57 cents this year if adjusted by his method. That ramps up eBay's price-earnings ratio from 77 to 198.
ALTHOUGH Mr. Bianco can only estimate what the companies will report in special charges and the like, he has based his assumptions on historical norms.
"We've all been waiting for the day when people will be forced to acknowledge quality-of-earnings problems," Mr. Bianco said. "Some of it seems to be occurring." More companies are expensing the costs of stock options, and regulators are pushing companies to justify special charges. "If earnings are overstated because of these things," he said, and new rules force changes, "it's going to be more difficult for earnings to grow from these levels."
In other words, the great stock market bubble lives on.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 20, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Market Watch column last Sunday, about the inflation of corporate profits through accounting practices related to pensions, stock options and one-time charges, misstated what the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have been last year if the effects of such practices had been excluded. It was 31.4, not 25.

HEADLINE: What's Left After Everest? A Higher Target 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
FRESH from writing one of the most popular books ever published about mountain climbing, Jon Krakauer circulated a proposal for his next project. An account of the 1984 killings of a Utah woman and her infant daughter, the new book promised outlaw sex, bizarre rituals, unknown history, an examination of the tragic consequences of faith -- all built around murder in the service of a home-grown religion.
 Editors were perplexed. 
 " 'Where are the mountains?' " asked one editor, Mr. Krakauer recalled. "People think of me as this outdoor writer. But I'm really a seeker, a doubter. I'm interested in those people who take things too far, because I see something of myself in them." 
There is a moment in all his books when Mr. Krakauer turns the story on himself and presents an imperfect human -- an author as guilty of the hubris, doubt and foolishness that push his nonfiction characters to extremes. So it is in his latest book, "Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith," which Doubleday is bringing out this week, complete with a publicity agent's dream controversy -- loud condemnation of the book by his primary target, the Mormon Church.
"I don't know if God even exists, although I confess I find myself praying in times of great fear, or despair, or astonishment at a display of unexpected beauty," he writes. "In the absence of conviction, I've come to terms with the fact that uncertainty is an inescapable corollary of life."
Until six years ago, when Mr. Krakauer wrote "Into Thin Air," an account of a deadly season on Mount Everest, books about mountain climbing were to the literary world what sensible shoes are to fashion -- serviceable and plodding. But the book he produced, dashing it off in a three-month sprint of writing and emotional purging, was not the usual how-I-conquered-the-top-of-the-world tome.
In a story of arrogance and missteps at the highest altitude, Mr. Krakauer and his party reached the summit of the world's highest mountain in the spring of 1996. On the descent, four of his teammates died, and Mr. Krakauer blamed himself, in part.
The book was a sensation, riding best-seller lists for two years, translated into 24 languages, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle award. There are now more than 3.6 million copies in print. It made Mr. Krakauer, a former carpenter and fisherman who scrapped for a living as a freelance writer, a rich man. He was free to pursue his passions and settle down along the Front Range here in well-manicured Boulder. The book followed "Into the Wild," Mr. Krakauer's story about a lost American soul, Chris McCandless, who died looking for inner meaning without sufficient outer protection in the Alaskan bush. It also became a best seller.
Now, with "Under the Banner of Heaven," Mr. Krakauer has begun his own culture war. If he thought the mini-industry spawned by his Everest book -- competing books, death threats and continuing Web battles -- was a nuisance, he may one day look back on that experience as a minor dust-up compared with what could follow his book questioning religion.
Already, the Mormon Church has questioned his motives and veracity, while pointing to some secular publications -- like the Economist magazine -- that have criticized him for failing to explain why people are drawn to the church.
The gist of the complaints is that, having climbed to the top of the world and written well about it, does an admitted agnostic really think he can take on a popular religion? Or even get it?
Mr. Krakauer, whose friends both praise and fault him for his laserlike intensity, certainly takes his swings. 
A year ago, the nation was appalled at the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, the sunny-faced Utah girl of 14 whose abductor says he was following early Mormon scripture in taking her as one of his brides. But as Mr. Krakauer writes, Joseph Smith, the Mormon Church's founder, also took a 14-year-old girl as one of an estimated 40 wives, explaining to her that God had commanded her to become part of his harem.
"My friends in Utah say Elizabeth Smart was more vulnerable to this kind of thing because the culture puts so much emphasis on obeying the word of God," Mr. Krakauer said.
In the book, Mr. Krakauer examines Mormon fundamentalists, the tens of thousands of true believers living mostly in Utah who broke away from the original Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The splinter groups are the American Taliban, Mr. Krakauer says, living in desert theocracies where pubescent girls are forced into marriages with old graybeards who rule with an iron fist. These polygamous communities are against the law, but usually tolerated by officials who see a little bit of great-grandpa's pioneering ways in the modern sects.
The biggest of these communities, Hildale/Colorado City, on the Utah-Arizona border, is full of houses the size of a Days Inn motel, stuffed with dozens of wives married to self-styled Mormon fundamentalist patriarchs. The community is in open violation of the law, Mr. Krakauer and others have noted, but faces little legal sanction and also manages to have one of the highest ratios of welfare recipients in the country.
His main focus is on Dan and Ron Lafferty, a pair of Utah brothers who believed they were ordered by God to kill their sister-in-law and her 15-month-old daughter. Brenda Lafferty had her throat slit with a 10-inch boning knife, and her daughter, Erica, was also stabbed. Dan Lafferty is serving a life sentence and his older brother, Ron, is on death row. The brothers said they did it because Brenda opposed their plan to take multiple wives.
Mr. Krakauer draws a connection between the revelations the Lafferty brothers claimed guided them and early Mormon acts of "blood atonement," in which followers targeted victims because of purported divine inspiration. Ron Lafferty, Mr. Krakauer notes, was a Republican city councilman and devout Mormon, who came to believe that his religion had lost touch with its roots, which allowed men to practice polygamy and to receive divine revelation.
Mr. Krakauer faults the modern Mormon Church, perhaps the fastest growing religion in America, with worldwide membership approaching 12 million, for failing to honestly address a past where taking young wives, killing on behalf of God and open disdain for the Constitution are papered over in place of a more Osmond-friendly image. Often overlooked by mainstream historians, the story of how a church founded by radicals who practiced an early form of communism and sanctioned sexual promiscuity through multiple wives has come to be known for white-bread conservatism is a compelling American tale. 
The church officially renounced polygamy in 1890, and excommunicates members who openly practice it. But officials in Utah say up to 60,000 people continue to live in polygamous families there.
The church issued a five-page, single-spaced rebuttal of the book two weeks before publication. They found some relatively minor factual errors in the book, which Mr. Krakauer has promised to correct, and they took issue with one of his central points.
The book "is a full frontal assault on the veracity of the modern church," Mike Otterson, a church spokesman in Salt Lake City, said in a statement. "His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things."
In tying the crimes of the Lafferty brothers to the roots of the church, Mr. Krakauer has smeared an entire religion, Mr. Otterson said in the statement. "Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist."
Doubleday, which is bringing out a 350,000-copy first printing of the book, seems delighted with the controversy. Its publicists promptly faxed the Mormon Church rebuttal to reviewers, and passed on phone numbers of church spokesmen.
Church officials say they agonized over responding in such a splashy way to the book, but decided that they had to make their stand, even at the risk of running the book up the best-seller charts.
Mr. Krakauer, a wiry, bearded, 49-year-old man with a sense of humor that is rarely evident on the pages of his books, admires the Mormons for their faith, he said during an afternoon in Boulder.
"I grew up with Mormons," said Mr. Krakauer, who was raised in Corvallis, Ore. "I like this culture. What I'm less comfortable with is the mind-boggling certainty of this or any religion."
He seems unfazed by fame; he has been married to the same woman, Linda Moore, for 23 years, and moves around Boulder with minimal interruptions from strangers. He can seem tightly wound, but the guilt and soul-searching that followed Everest are genuine, say friends.
"The controversy over Everest changed him," said John Rasmus, the editor of National Geographic Adventure Magazine, who has worked with Mr. Krakauer for 20 years at other publications. "Jon felt the Everest book was somewhat the result of being in the right place at the right time and that he had profited from what turned out to be a tragedy."
In a postscript in a later edition of the book, Mr. Krakauer called himself "stubborn and proud and loathe to back down from a fight," and wished that he had been "a little less strident" in his post-Everest debate with a climbing guide, Anatoli Bourkreev, who died shortly after his own book on the deadly season came out. Mr. Krakauer had faulted the guide for leaving the summit before all of his clients were down the mountain, and for not using supplemental oxygen.
With the new book, Mr. Krakauer has fresh demons on his flanks. In their rebuttal of Mr. Krakauer, Mormon officials describe him as "agnostic," a label Mr. Krakauer does not dispute.
"I'm trying to figure out religion," he said. "I'm not a social reformer, but I am troubled by this sheeplike acceptance that faith is always good."
Mr. Krakauer's father was a Jew from Brooklyn, an agnostic and a medical doctor, who moved to Oregon and became friends with another famous outsider, the writer Bernard Malamud. In "Into the Wild," Mr. Krakauer wrote some less-than-flattering things about his father, now dead. They reconciled before his death, he said.
The latest book started as an inquiry into the nature of faith. He chose the Mormons because he has always been fascinated by them, he said, and because they have long tried to convert him, with missionaries showing up on his doorstep.
His research led him to Dan Lafferty, who cooperated with Mr. Krakauer from his cell in Utah, and still shows no remorse for his crimes. The church says Mr. Lafferty is simply a murderer who used his own cryptic religious revelations as an excuse to go after his sister-in-law because she opposed his views on polygamy.
"I don't believe Dan Lafferty is crazy or a psychopath," Mr. Krakauer said. "He is an example of an inevitable outcome of strong belief. The modern church's refusal to acknowledge its history has spawned people like Dan Lafferty."
This kind of deduction is far too simple, say Mr. Krakauer's critics. If in fact the early church history is so toxic that it continues to inspire people to murder, why are there not more people like the Lafferty brothers? The murders, the church says, are anomalies -- not evidence of cause and effect.
MR. KRAKAUER still climbs, often twice a week with a friend, scaling the rock walls in Boulder's backyard. He does not consider reaching the summit of Everest a major mountaineering achievement.
"I'm kind of freaked out by it all now," he said. "If I had to write a climbing resume now, I wouldn't even put Everest on it."
Mountaineering is like a religious faith in one way, he said, because it defies reason. And climbing Everest is the ultimate irrational act.
"The plain truth is that I knew better but went to Everest anyway," Mr. Krakauer wrote at the start of "Into Thin Air" in 1996. "And in doing so I was party to the death of good people, which is something that is apt to remain on my conscience for a very long time."
He wrote the Everest book as a cautionary tale, blaming commercial guides for rushing overeager clients up a mountain that requires expertise and patience -- and can't always be bought. It has had the opposite effect, of drawing more people to the mountain, Mr. Krakauer said, and now he is disgusted with the climbing world's continued focus on Everest. "The owner of an Everest guiding service recently thanked me for bringing him more clients," Mr. Krakauer said, shaking his head.
If the new book has the same effect on the Mormon Church, they may be thanking him in Temple Square, the church headquarters, as well.

HEADLINE: Fighting for the Right to Communicate 

BYLINE:  By JILL ANDRESKY FRASER

 BODY:
IN its simplest terms, this is all about one man, one company and six e-mail messages. Oh yes, and one lawsuit, which took nearly five years to wind its way through the California court system.
 Yet the Intel Corporation v. Hamidi never has been all that simple. 
 It originated in a battle against Intel, the giant semiconductor manufacturer, by Kourosh Kenneth Hamidi, known as Ken, who has spent eight years trying to rally employees at Intel, his former employer, to resist what he considers abusive workplace practices. Mr. Hamidi, who was fired by Intel in 1995 for what it terms cause, sent six e-mail messages after his departure to thousands of company employees, prompting Intel to sue him for trespassing. 
Over the last few years, the case has assumed importance far beyond one man and one company. A range of public interest activists, cyberlaw experts and labor organizers believed that the suit's decision, if it favored Intel, would restrict free speech and other activities that people now take for granted on the Internet. Business leaders like the National Association of Manufacturers sided with Intel, arguing that the company had the right to block the electronic transmissions since they passed through Intel's private property.
Two weeks ago, the California Supreme Court overturned two lower court decisions and sided with Mr. Hamidi rather than Intel, arguing that Intel could not properly use state trespass laws to block Mr. Hamidi's e-mail messages since its property had not been damaged by them. 
Already, the ruling has come to be viewed as a landmark decision affecting the future of the Internet. Other states are likely to follow California's legal precedent, according to lawyers, legal scholars and cyberspace rights advocates. The decision is not expected to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, since "trespass" is a state issue.
The consequences of this victory, meanwhile, are equally great for Mr. Hamidi, who has struggled against enormous odds, in the face of public ridicule, financial ruin and a number of stinging legal defeats. With the California Supreme Court's decision, he has quickly become a symbol of initiatives for cyberspace rights and fair working conditions.
If life were a 1940's movie, the hero of this man-against-the-system drama might be played by Gregory Peck. But at the center of this legal maelstrom is a deceptively ordinary looking 56-year-old man, who lives in Citrus Heights, Calif., a suburb of Sacramento, and now works as a compliance officer for the state's Franchise Tax Board. 
His background was scarcely ordinary, however. Born in Tehran, Mr. Hamidi spent 11 years during the 1960's and 70's as an officer and instructor in Iran's air force, struggling to be released from military service and to win permission to emigrate to the United States.
"Living under the shah's dictatorship, I used to watch John Wayne movies and dream about freedom," he recently recalled. "I remember being on the plane, finally flying to the U.S. with my wife and our 3 1/2-year-old daughter and telling them, 'I will work. I'll be able to vote. I'll be free. Our children will be free.' "
That was 1978. The Hamidis settled in Los Angeles, where their struggle became a financial one. "In the beginning, I worked three jobs," Mr. Hamidi said. "I'd wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning, because I had a newspaper delivery route. I was 31 years old and I was delivering newspapers. Then I'd rush home, shower and get dressed in a suit and tie, and go to my next job, which was managing a small, bilingual travel agency." After that job, he would head home for dinner and a change of clothes, and then on to the evening shift at a liquor store. 
Along the way, Mr. Hamidi put himself through college, majoring in engineering; eventually he earned an M.B.A. He remembers 1986 as a glorious year. "I became a citizen," he said. "I received my engineering degree. And I got hired by Intel."
But in September 1990, the glorious days ended when the car that he was driving home from a work-related conference was hit from behind. Mr. Hamidi was left in chronic pain with shoulder and neck injuries. Although the injuries resisted treatment, he continued to work for more than a year, often putting in what he said were 16-hour workdays. "I was sleep-deprived because I was working so hard to keep up with my workload and I was in so much pain," he said. "I was fainting at the office. I became clinically depressed." In February 1992, he took a prolonged medical leave.
Mr. Hamidi filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits, contending that he had work-related physical and mental injuries. His claim was initially granted, but it was overturned upon appeal from Intel. Mr. Hamidi said he had unsuccessfully tried to return to his job. Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, would not comment on specifics, noting only that the company dismissed the engineer for cause in 1995. 
Living with chronic pain and constant financial anxieties, Mr. Hamidi said he was hospitalized twice, under a suicide watch. "I was losing everything I had," he said. Unable to find another job, with little income except state disability payments, Mr. Hamidi declared personal bankruptcy in 1997.
Despite the magnitude of his personal problems, Mr. Hamidi found his calling in a growing determination to publicize his accusations about excessive job demands and unfair employment practices at Intel. 
In 1995, he started an organization that soon came to be known as FACE Intel, for former and current employees of Intel, and the next year he developed a Web site, www.faceintel.com, to disseminate information, including accounts that contended there was a connection between job stress at Intel and employee suicides and heart attacks. Mr. Mulloy at Intel said such statements "are examples of the absurdity and the falsehoods that Mr. Hamidi continues to perpetuate." Mr. Hamidi also filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Intel, but later dropped it for lack of resources.
TO some people Mr. Hamidi was considered crazy or vengeful. But his movement attracted attention. He conducted numerous interviews with reporters. He handed out leaflets to students at universities where Intel was recruiting. And at some point, he obtained two diskettes containing an electronic file of Intel's employee telephone book. (According to Mr. Hamidi, this came to him through the mail in an unmarked envelope.) 
The rest, as they say, is history. 
As the California Supreme Court noted in its 4-to-3 decision on June 30, the facts of Intel v. Hamidi are "simple and undisputed." 
On six occasions, over a period totaling 21 months, Mr. Hamidi sent "a single e-mail message to between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees, highlighting what Mr. Hamidi considered to be Intel's abusive and discriminatory practices," the decision of the majority of the court said. He suggested that employees seek jobs elsewhere, and he solicited participation in FACE Intel. During this time, according Mr. Mulloy, the Intel spokesman, the company employed 65,000 to 70,000 people.
To put it mildly, the e-mail campaign attracted Intel's attention. "From Intel's perspective, Mr. Hamidi intended to disrupt employees by making inflammatory statements concerning Intel as an employer," Mr. Mulloy said. 
"In March of 1998, after a few of these e-mails had come, we received a number of complaints from employees. The kind of comments we would hear were, 'Why are we getting these at work?' 'Can't you stop him?' We sent Mr. Hamidi a letter demanding that he refrain from sending them. He replied to us and refused to do so. He then sent more."
Intel tried to block Mr. Hamidi's messages but was only partially successful. By switching computers, Mr. Hamidi managed to evade the company's roadblocks. There is no evidence, however, that he sent additional e-mail messages to any recipient who asked him to desist.
Intel sued on two counts in 1998. One, later dropped, contended that the messages were a nuisance to Intel and its employees. The second was a "trespass to chattel" claim against Mr. Hamidi, that accused him, among other things, of disrupting Intel through unauthorized use of its computer system. "We disagree with everything he says about Intel," Mr. Mulloy said. "We think he's wrong. But we never did anything to try to prevent him from setting up his Web site or leafleting at universities.
"When someone is using our e-mail system, though, our thinking was that we had certain rights."
It was now autumn 1998. Mr. Hamidi was unemployed, had been through bankruptcy and was struggling to support a family of four on occasional odd jobs and his disability payments. It wasn't until late 2001 that he found his state job. 
Soon after he was sued by Intel in 1998, however, Mr. Hamidi attracted a crucial supporter, William M. McSwain, a former Marine then in his second year at Harvard Law School and an editor of The Harvard Law Review. Listening to National Public Radio one day, he heard a mention of the Intel case that caught his attention.
"This was an unusual use of the trespass-to-chattel tort," he said. "I thought the case might have broad implications."
He decided to look into the case, thinking it might produce an article for the law review. "The more I found out, the more I wanted to help this guy. He was broke, fighting his own battle, getting beaten up and nobody was helping him."
MR. McSWAIN researched the issues and concluded that Intel had not demonstrated damage to the chattel, which in this case would be the computer system. "Intel was just claiming a more general kind of damage, through the loss of employees' productivity." 
He said that he eventually came to believe that Mr. Hamidi's case was the most important Internet dispute ever litigated. "If Intel could use trespass laws, without demonstrating any damage to its equipment," he said, "then this would have huge implications for all kinds of communications taking place on the Internet."
The article that Mr. McSwain published in the May 1999 issue of The Harvard Law Review validated Mr. Hamidi's case. "It is ironic," he wrote, "that a technological giant such as Intel, which has helped to usher in and has greatly benefited from the cyberspace age, now expects the state to protect it from a creature of its making." The article attracted attention. 
But by the time it appeared, Mr. Hamidi had lost the first round. California's Superior Court granted Intel's request on the trespass to chattel claim and issued a permanent injunction against Mr. Hamidi.
Mr. Hamidi appealed. "They thought I was this bozo, coming here from some weird country. 'He is helpless,' 'He will come to his knees.' " Instead, he went out of his way to attract public attention for his cause. That included a horseback ride to deliver a floppy disk to Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and a ride there in a horse-drawn carriage to deliver 40,000 printed copies of an e-mail message to company employees to publicize the fact that the court had barred him from communicating to Intel workers on the Internet.
It helped that he knew he was no longer alone. Through what seemed to him the hand of God, he had Mr. McSwain, who during his final year of law school was on an internship with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit public-interest and civil-liberties group. There, Mr. McSwain wrote the substance of a brief filed by the foundation on the behalf of Mr. Hamidi. 
"To us, it seemed very clear that if Intel won this case we'd all be at risk of losing the fundamental value of the Internet, which is its openness," said Lee Tien, a senior lawyer for the foundation. "Imagine what could happen if at any time any site could say, 'We don't want you to visit, we don't want you to search, we don't want your e-mail.' The Internet would fragment."
Nevertheless, the California Court of Appeal in Sacramento in December 2001 upheld the lower court and supported Intel. 
"That was the proper decision," argued Richard A. Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and the author of a brief, filed on behalf of a number of business groups, in Intel's support in Mr. Hamidi's appeal to the California Supreme Court. "This wasn't comparable to Mr. Hamidi standing outside Intel's property and shouting at employees using a bullhorn. It was as though he took Intel's bullhorn to do it."
But the appeals court was split on its decision, 2 to 1, with a dissent coming from one of the state's most influential judges, Justice Daniel M. Kolkey.
By now, Mr. McSwain was a lawyer, working at the Dechert firm in Philadelphia. With 700 lawyers and a large corporate law practice, Dechert might have seemed an unlikely firm to support Mr. Hamidi's case. But the young lawyer convinced his colleagues that this was a case "about the soul of the Internet," as he put it. He said he believed that if the decision in favor of Intel were allowed to stand, it would ultimately hurt business by lowering productivity and impeding commerce.
His colleagues at Dechert agreed. With a strong First Amendment practice, the firm also supported the freedom of speech aspects of Mr. Hamidi's case. They agreed to allow Mr. McSwain and another junior lawyer, F. Gregory Lastowka, to work on the case pro bono.
THE pairing proved to be a strong one. Mr. McSwain handled the legal theories, relations with the media, and of course, dealings with Mr. Hamidi, whom he calls an ideal client, rational and calm. Mr. Lastowka, a cyberlaw expert, coordinated briefs filed on Mr. Hamidi's behalf and wrote the response to Intel's arguments. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a separate brief, as did more than three dozen professors of intellectual property and computer law. Support also came from the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and from the Service Employees International Union.
"There was a lot of concern among union organizers about the lower court decisions," said Stacey M. Leyton, a lawyer with Altshuler, Berzon, Nussbaum, Rubin & Demain in San Francisco, which worked with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the service employees union. "Our concern was that, if the lower court decisions were left standing, this could become an important tool for employers to use against union activities."
The decision on June 30 came at the very end of the 90-day period to issue a ruling after oral arguments. Mr. McSwain knew that the decision was likely to be posted at 10 a.m. Pacific time, so back in Philadelphia, he grabbed a sandwich at Dechert's cafeteria and sat in front of his computer screen, staring at the Court's Web site and waiting for the notice. Mr. Hamidi was in his office at the Franchise Board, training two employees, but keeping an eye out for an e-mail message from his lawyer or the court. 
When the notice came, "judgment reversed," Mr. McSwain sent out atwo-word e-mail message to his client and colleagues, "We Won." Mr. Hamidi saw his computer's message light blinking and asked his co-workers for five minutes to himself. He called Mary, his wife of 32 years, could not reach her and left a message on the answering machine. 
"I don't know how being electrocuted feels," he said, "but there were shocks going all through my body." His phone started ringing with calls from reporters. He received a voice-mail message from his wife, telling him that she had been unable to call back at first because she had been crying so hard she could not speak. Eventually, he asked his supervisor for permission to some time off.
Despite broad support for the decision, there are those who believe this is a dangerous legal decision, one that will open the floodgates to spam, erode employers' powers and give unions free rein to woo members by e-mail. As part of a longstanding policy, Intel would not allow the law firm that handled the case, Morrison & Foerster, to comment on the decision. But in one of its briefs for Intel, the firm wrote that the basic issue was property rights. "Ownership of private property carries with it the right to prevent others from using this private property to harm the owner," it said. 
The day-to-day consequences are not yet clear. "I don't know if the downside from this decision is small or large, but I do know this: There's no upside," said Professor Epstein of the University of Chicago, who worked closely with the firm while writing a brief for Semiconductor Industry Association and other business groups. 
As for Mr. Hamidi and his relationship with Intel, "The ball is in his court," said Mr. Malloy, Intel's spokesman. "If he decides to continue spamming us, we will have to evaluate our options." 
Mr. McSwain said, "I don't want to speculate about what Ken will do." He said the original injunction will remain in place until 30 days after the Supreme Court's ruling "and the one thing I'm certain is, Ken won't do anything during that period." If, later, he does send more e-mails, his lawyer said, " Intel may go after him as hard or harder than ever."
The California Supreme Court said in its majority opinion that depending on what happens next, Intel might have the option of suing for interference with its business prospects, defamation or infliction of emotional distress. 
For now, Mr. Hamidi will not disclose his plans. But he does give some hints. 
"I have done my part for the American people," he said. "Now I am back to the fight for Intel's employees and other working men and women."

HEADLINE: A Tax Shelter, Deconstructed 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
TAX sheltering is one of those activities that people normally carry on behind closed doors. But in a federal courthouse in New Haven, the doors have been thrown wide open and bright lights have been trained on one room in the house of Mammon that is tax avoidance in America today.
 Being revealed is a plan arranged by a great economic mind, Myron S. Scholes, winner of a Nobel in economics, while a partner in the giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. The partners hoped to recycle a tax shelter that had already enabled Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Electronic Data Systems and a half-dozen other major corporations escape taxes on a total of $375 million in earnings. Dr. Scholes sought to duplicate the maneuver for his investment group, on profits that also totaled $375 million. 
 Long-Term Capital, of course, would collapse in 1998 -- a fall so spectacular that the Federal Reserve established a bailout to avert what it feared would become a worldwide financial panic. (The short, expensive life of Long-Term Capital and the story of its famous founders were captured in the title of a best-selling book by Roger Lowenstein, "When Genius Failed.") 
For Dr. Scholes, Long-Term Capital Holdings v. United States is a test of whether his mastery of economics and tax law led him along a slippery slope toward an embarrassing and costly confrontation with the government. The trial will determine whether he and his partners must pay $40 million in taxes and $16 million in penalties and interest. 
For ordinary Americans, the case may be a lesson in how the rich and well-connected can mine the tax code in ways that are unavailable to others.
And for the government, the trial is a challenge with huge consequences for federal budgets: Can it encourage all taxpayers to obey the law by pursuing a few prominent cases, making examples of those it judges to be violators, mostly through civil actions like the Long-Term Capital case and a very few criminal prosecutions?
AS a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital, which was officially organized in the Cayman Islands, was an unregulated investment pool that by law was open only to the very wealthy. John W. Meriwether, the Wall Street bond trader, created it in 1993 with a few of his investment friends, including Dr. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, the Harvard economist with whom Dr. Scholes shared the Nobel in 1997.
Dr. Scholes, whom colleagues have described as the consummate analyst, brought much intellectual firepower to Long-Term Capital.
"This is a guy who will look at a problem and tries to devise some sort of intellectual structure that explains it," said Burton G. Malkiel, a Princeton economist who worked closely with him in the late 1980's to analyze the financial markets' crash of 1987. "If you talk to him about a problem, he immediately says, 'How can we model this?' "
Dr. Scholes traces his fascination with market dynamics to his childhood in the gold-mining territory of northern Canada. What was it, he says he wondered back then, that makes prices fluctuate? "From an early age, I was very, very fascinated by uncertainty," he once said on the public television program "Nova."
The big idea that he had to offer to Long-Term Capital was to make money in the securities markets by applying a technique for valuing stock market options that he had helped invent.
Known as the Black-Scholes method, it was described in a paper that he and Dr. Merton wrote in 1973 with Fischer Black of the University of Chicago. The method would become the standard for options traders; it is now widely used to value executive stock options, as well. The paper ultimately won the Nobel for Dr. Scholes and Dr. Merton.
Long-Term Capital was an instant success. With Mr. Meriwether and the two famous economists heading the investment team, it quickly raised $5 billion of equity, which they used as leverage to raise $95 billion in loans.
The founding partners put in $300 million of their own money but closed the fund to outsiders, with two exceptions, both of whom are now at the core of the tax case.
Despite its name, Long-Term Capital engaged mostly in rapid-fire trading in and out of stocks, bonds and synthetic forms of ownership like futures contracts and sometimes-exotic derivatives. The firm's traders, in Greenwich, Conn., produced phenomenal returns -- 28.1 percent in 1994, 58.8 percent in 1995 and 57.5 percent in 1996.
But that very success also created what Dr. Scholes saw as a problem: a huge income tax bill. Short-term trading profits were taxed at the time at 39.6 percent, the highest income tax rate. The prospect of losing such a big part of their windfall did not please Long-Term Capital investors.
One day in March 1996, a possible solution came into view. From the moment that Dr. Scholes learned of it, he understood its potential to defer, even eliminate, taxes on more than one-third of a billion dollars of profits.
The tax shelter did not come to his firm by way of strangers, but from Babcock & Brown, an investment bank in San Francisco whose general counsel, Jan Blaustein, had been the girlfriend of Dr. Scholes for more than two years. They would marry in 1998.
The shelter was in the form of stock, in companies like Electronic Data Systems, Rhone Poulenc and Qwest, that had a combined market value of about $4 million but that also had a potential worth of more than 90 times that to Long-Term Capital's partners. 
The stock had been assigned by Babcock & Brown to three London investors, who did not have to pay American taxes, through a series of multilayered leasing arrangements that gave them tax deductions worth $375 million. The Londoners could not use the deductions themselves, but they could sell the stock, and the deductions that went with them, to American investors.
The Londoners would make money on the transaction, the American investors would eliminate their tax liability on up to $371 million in stock-trading profit. And Babcock & Brown and its network of lawyers, banks and other associates would earn big fees. Everybody would be happy -- everybody, that is, except the federal government.
And so it was that in auditing Long-Term Capital's tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the use of $106 million of deductions to reduce the taxes owed by partners of the firm. Long-Term Capital then paid part of the $40 million in taxes that it owed, but sued for a refund in Federal District Court in New Haven, where the trial has been under way for three weeks and appears to be about halfway over.
BOTH sides knew that the outcome would depend on whether Long-Term Capital could convince Judge Janet Bond Arterton that it had not simply bought the shares in question for use as a tax dodge, but had done so for a legitimate economic purpose.
Under a doctrine known as economic substance, courts have long held that if a business transaction has no value except to create tax losses, then it can be disallowed by the I.R.S. Otherwise, tax lawyers could just move symbols around on pieces of paper, and their clients would never pay taxes.
In testimony last week, Dr. Scholes tried to show that the acquisition had a economic rationale beyond just acquiring tax losses. He viewed the transaction, he said, as a way to establish and a strong business relationship with Babcock & Brown. It was a relationship that he hoped to develop, he said, though he acknowledged that his partners did not share his passion. Indeed, once the tax shelter deal was finished, so was Long-Term Capital's relationship with Babcock & Brown.
On cross-examination by the government, Dr. Scholes, who was the principal author of a $130 textbook, "Taxes and Business Strategy," that he used to teach graduate business students at Stanford, tried to minimize his knowledge of taxes. He conceded, however, that he knew that basic tax rules required wringing a profit from a tax shelter without regard to its tax benefits if the shelter was to stand.
His testimony also showed that he worked hard to imbue the tax-favored stock with value, ordering analyses, soliciting legal opinions and even flying to London to meet with one of the three owners to make sure, he said, that they were not people who would bring disrepute on Long-Term Capital.
His way to show a profit from the tax shelter was to make both the three Londoners and Babcock & Brown investors in Long-Term Capital, even though the firm, in theory, had been closed to outside investors. 
That presented another problem. Neither the Londoners nor Babcock & Brown wanted to put up any money, and neither was willing to assume any risk of losing money should the fund go broke, as it would do in 1998.
So Dr. Scholes arranged to lend them millions of dollars at an interest rate of 7 percent, which, contrary to usual banking practice, was lower that the rate he could have gotten from most clients.
Then he used his expertise as one of the creators of the Black-Scholes method to write several options guaranteeing that the investors could not lose money, he told Charles P. Hurley, the lead Justice Department lawyer in the case.
In one of the deals, the three Londoners put tax-favored stock with a market value of $2.5 million into Long-Term Capital and, at the low interest rates, borrowed $5 million, more than half of which went to pay off an existing loan they had on their stock. To make sure that they could not lose the value of their stock or the amount they borrowed, they paid $61,000 for a put option designed and priced by Dr. Scholes. 
AFTER 14 months, the Londoners cashed out and walked away with a 22 percent profit, by Dr. Scholes's calculations. They also paid the partnership fees of about $900,000, he estimated in testimony. Those fees, plus the value of the new relationship with Babcock & Brown, were the profits that Dr. Scholes said made the tax shelter valuable in its own right.
Against that, Long-Term Capital paid more than $500,000 to the Shearman & Sterling law firm in New York for an opinion letter. The letter said that one part of the tax shelter deal should survive an I.R.S. audit. Long-Term Capital paid $400,000 to King & Spalding in Washington for a similar opinion letter on another part of the deal.
Larry Noe, the tax director of Long-Term Capital, received a bonus of between $50,000 and $100,000 for his work in bringing in the tax shelter, though Dr. Scholes made it clear that the firm had resisted paying anything extra to Mr. Noe for his successful efforts on the partnership's behalf.
Taken together, those costs equaled or exceeded the $900,000 in fees that Dr. Scholes was able to wring from the tax shelter apart from the tax benefits. In other words, unless the $900,000 was all profit, the shelter could not make a profit apart from the tax savings.
Then came the coup de grace. Mr. Hurley slipped in a question about whether Dr. Scholes had sought, and received, a bonus for himself of several million dollars for his role in strengthening the tax shelter. Dr. Scholes confirmed that he had, but that it had been paid in extra partnership shares, not cash.
Counting his bonus, the tax shelter cost far more than its economic value of $900,000 in fees, making it hard to prove it met the economic-substance requirement.
On the witness stand, Dr. Scholes appeared to realize how Mr. Hurley's questioning had shown that apart from the tax benefits, the deal could not have come to close to turning a profit, in large part because he took that bonus.
"I'm being trapped here," he blurted out.
Dr. Scholes has told friends that most of his wealth has been wiped out in the collapse of Long-Term Capital. If the court rules in the government's favor, he stands to owe millions of dollars to the I.R.S.
For the brilliant boy who grew up in hard-scrabble gold-mining country and went on to win the world's greatest intellectual honor, the dissection of his work by a government lawyer seemed to come as a shock.
When he stepped down, he walked over to his wife, Jan, who had begun to fidget in her seat as Mr. Hurley's carefully planned cross-examination set the snare that the great economist stepped into.
Dr. Scholes was visibly shaken, his head cast down so that no one could see directly into his eyes as he and his wife slipped into an anteroom and shut the door.

HEADLINE: Scientific Solution to Save Your Skin 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FOR decades, Estee Lauder's Prescriptives was content to help women find exactly the right colors to put on their faces. Then, two years ago, Pamela K. Baxter took over the brand, and she wasn't content at all. Millions of women, the statistics told her, were letting doctors inject Botox into their frown lines and abrade their faces with tiny crystals, all in hopes of repairing the skin to which those color cosmetics are applied. Yet, Prescriptives didn't even offer a garden-variety anti-aging cream.
 "My reaction was: if microdermabrasion is doing so well in dermatologists' offices, why don't we have a product to do it at home?" Ms. Baxter recalled. In April, Prescriptives introduced Dermapolish, a home care product that uses tiny abrasive crystals similar to those used by dermatologists. And next spring, it will roll out a line of products, developed with a dermatologist, to combat cosmetic problems like adult acne, red skin and dark spots caused either by sun damage or hormonal imbalances. 
 The days of hope in a jar, different merely in package and price, are long gone. Today's skin-care companies are marrying science to mass customization. The sales representatives behind the counters, many newly trained, are asking their customers to fill out questionnaires that are as detailed as patient charts. Do they smoke? Are they often stressed? What's their diet like? 
In other words, they are telling customers, "Let us help you classify your skin type and beauty regimen and we will sell you just the right product to solve your skin problems."
"It used to be so simple. Am I dry or not? Do I need moisturizer or not?" said Beth DiNardo, senior vice president for global marketing at Clinique, another Estee Lauder brand. "Now, picking the right cream has become a full-time job."
It sure has. Want to halt aging? Try the penta-peptides in Procter & Gamble's Olay Regenerist, the copper peptide's in the Neutrogena Corporation's Visibly Firm With Active Copper, or the "insulin-like growth factor" in Re Vive. Need moisture? Try Dove's Essential Nutrients, derived from research done by its parent company, Unilever, on the natural moisturizing mechanisms in skin. Want to try even more esoteric science? Let Lab21, a tiny New York company, analyze your DNA from a cheek swab and use the results to customize your eye creams and face scrubs. Or, see if your dermatologist stocks one of the new products that include human growth hormone, an extract derived from a baby's foreskin.
The personal and scientific approach comes at a price. Mass-market brands like Olay or Neutrogena that rarely topped $10 now command upward of $20 for products with scientific-sounding ingredients. A two-ounce jar of Re Vive carries a $375 price tag. Dermapolish is going for $125 for an eight-week supply.
Critics of the new scientifically based products are easy to find, of course. "If the things you see on the labels of cosmetics had the effects they claimed, they would have to go through the F.D.A.," said Dr. Irwin Freedberg, chairman of the dermatology department at the New York University School of Medicine, referring to the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Leslie Baumann, chief of cosmetic dermatology at the University of Miami School of Medicine, is equally scornful. "The old cosmetic ads used to just say: 'Our product will make you more beautiful and keep your husband from cheating.' Now they talk about some high-tech sounding protein that slows the aging process," she said. "But, very few ingredients do the things they say they do, and I'm not sure all of them are safe."
In fact, the companies have carefully steered clear of ingredients, dosages or claims that could raise a red flag to regulators. They note, with some justification, that many of their ingredients had their debuts in medical journals, and that they have published their own results in cosmetics journals. Numerous studies show that penta-peptides and copper peptides heal wounds, they note, so, of course, they can "heal" aging skin. Genomic research can spot all kinds of predispositions -- so why not a predisposition to react to a skin cream or pollutant? If microcrystals work when dermatologists use them to abrade skin, why shouldn't they work in Dermapolish? If Retin-A, a powerful vitamin A derivative, is prescribed for combating wrinkles, then products replete with retinols and retinoids that were derived from vitamin A or from RetinA itself, should work as well.
Indeed, a growing number of "pure" scientists are embracing the convergence of aesthetic illusion and medical science. Drug companies, most of which long ago divested their cosmetics arms, are again pumping research dollars into aesthetic dermatology. For example, last year Pfizer formed Anaderm (Greek for new skin) to develop prescription creams that could fight aging or oily skin, and abnormal hair loss or growth. Dr. Arthur P. Bertolino, Anaderm's clinical exploratory head, predicts the products will be blockbusters. "We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe over a billion, for each," he said. "This is science finally meeting the unmet needs."
The lines between doctor's offices and cosmetics counters are blurring as more dermatologists offer their own emollients and creams. Neutrogena licensed its copper peptide technology from the ProCyte Corporation; ProCyte also sells higher-potency Neova copper peptide creams exclusively through doctor's offices. The Neutrogena product sells for about $20; the Neova products sell for $60 and more.
"We spent more than $100 million on research over the last 15 years, and now we can concentrate on sales and marketing," said John F. Clifford, ProCyte's president.
The plethora of molecules du jour was probably inevitable. More than a decade ago, companies began putting alpha hydroxy acids, retinols and retinoids, vitamins C and E, and all kinds of other scientific ingredients into what used to be mundane creams. Their sales shot up. In late 1993, for example, Unilver's Ponds brand offered its first alpha hydroxy product, and its face cream sales doubled in a year. Avon Products, which had introduced alpha hydroxy products even earlier, also had a huge increase in sales.
"Since then everyone has been looking for the next magic bullet," said Alex Znaiden, senior vice president for research and development at Unilever North America. "And when they can't find it, they combine retinols and hydroxies, or otherwise mix and match."
Numbers for the total skin care market are impossible to come by. No one seems to be tracking sales through doctor's offices, and big stores like Wal-Mart rarely divulge their numbers. But companies that gather data from drugstores and department stores say that skin care products are flying off shelves.
The question is, why?
One reason is obvious: The first wave of baby boomers have hit their 50's, and they are not content to age with grace. 
Numerous other trends are converging to push skin care front and center. Among them:
* Doctors seeking to rebuild incomes decimated by managed care are offering Botox, chemical peels, laser resurfacing and other procedures to help patients look younger. Not all patients get the treatments, but they do read about them and see them demonstrated on TV. "Every beauty editor wants to be the first to write about the next best thing in skin care," said Dr. Tabasum Mir, a New York dermatologist who sells her own creams.
* These educated customers are less likely to buy on the basis of prestige or glitz and are more likely to chase exotic ingredients at a decent price. "You'll see women in Manolo Blahnik shoes buying drugstore cosmetics because there's just less of a class system now," said Ms. DiNardo, of Clinique. Companies are even toning down packaging, once tantamount to heresy in the cosmetics world. Avon's Anew line has always come in signature blue and silver jars and bottles with gold caps; its latest anti-wrinkle products, Anew Clinical, are in simple white glass jars. "We wanted the package to look a little more scientific," said Janice J. Teal, chief scientific officer.
* Companies have dropped the not-invented-here syndrome. Many have full-time people whose job is to surf the Web, attend conventions and otherwise comb the world for promising technologies. "There are so many more scientific journals these days, and it's helping all the companies find and share data," said Gerald N. McEwen Jr., vice president for science at the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association.
* Even within companies, researchers are collaborating more. Procter's skin-care people went to the paper technology group, which is usually more concerned with paper towels and disposable diapers, to learn how to make Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths, which leave conditioners on the skin after the soap has washed away. E. Michael McNamara, global president of the Neutrogena Corporation, readily acknowledges that Neutrogena would not have developed its lucrative line of retinol-based anti-aging products without access to the portfolio of research on Retin-A at the parent company, Johnson & Johnson.
* Companies have more research tools at their disposal. "We have computer models that let us test ingredients and synthesize molecules, and we have labs where we can actually test what skin cream ingredients can activate the gene that makes collagen and elastin," said Ms. Teal of Avon. "It lets us test products the same way a drug company tests drugs."
Genomic research makes it possible, at least theoretically, to identify the factors that control how skin reacts to the environment and to certain ingredients. 
Lab21, which was founded by former Estee Lauder executives in 2001, may have taken that approach to the ultimate extreme: It maintains a lab at the State University of New York at Stony Brook where computers analyze the DNA taken from from a swab of a customer's cheek, factor in data the customer provided about skin type and lifestyle, and then mix and match ingredients from myriad jars standing nearby. The result is a skin cream that can cost $250 but that Nathaniel L. Benson, Lab21's president, says is unique to each individual.
"The 5 percent lactic acid that one person's skin needs could cause an allergic reaction on another person's skin," Mr. Benson said. "Big companies that mass produce millions of units can't take that chance, so they have to dumb the formulas down." Lab21 sells its products at stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue in the United States, and through dermatologists in Brazil.
There are less esoteric routes, too, to customization. Clinique has begun giving customers a "dear doctor" card that describes the ingredients in its products and suggests that the doctor choose the right ones. Prescriptives is training its consultants to analyze which skin treatments their customers need. "The customers for skin care are loyal, while the customers for color cosmetics are not," noted Ms. Baxter of Prescriptives, who also oversees three other specialty brands for Estee Lauder.
The mass-market brands cannot go quite that far. But they, too, are offering an explosion of ingredients and formulations. Under the Healthy Skin umbrella, Neutrogena is offering creams that fight wrinkles, others that fight blemishes and some that fight both. Some have alpha hydroxy acids, others have retinol. Some firm areas under the eyes, others bleach them. Ponds, too, now has products replete with alpha hydroxy acids, retinol, vitamins C and E and others.
The companies seem remarkably unconcerned that they might be cannibalizing their own product lines. Olay Regenerist seems to be aiming at the same market as Olay Total Effects, a niacinamide-based anti-aging product that is one of Procter's stars -- sales of Total Effects increased 29 percent last year despite the soft economy. Michael D. Kuremsky, Procter's general manager for North America skin care, insists that Total Effects is an all-in-one product aimed at women who would be unwilling to follow the three-product skin care regimen that Regenerist entails.
If the proliferation of products continues, however, consumers may wind up with less choice, not more. Shelf space is a precious commodity, and stores are loath to carry products with too narrow an appeal.
That's one reason Procter has stopped short of offering too many iterations of Regenerist or Total Effects. As Mr. Kuremsky put it: "We want to be sure all our products have enough scale to hold onto their shelf space."

HEADLINE: There's Hope in Liberia's History 

BYLINE:  By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, is chairman of the Carter Center and winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Liberia is ready to be rescued from disaster, and the time is ripe for persistent but modest American involvement in this process. I have full confidence that a joint effort with West African nations will be successful.
 I made my first visit to Liberia as president in 1978, when the nation was a symbol of stability and economic progress in West Africa. The visit represented a continuation of the strong ties between our countries that had been maintained for more than 150 years, since freed American slaves established a government there in 1822. President William Tolbert enjoyed worldwide acceptance as an enlightened Christian layman, having been the elected leader of the Baptist World Alliance, representing almost all organizations of this major Protestant faith. 
 My wife, Rosalynn, and I noticed the minimal level of security, both for Liberian public officials and for visiting dignitaries, quite different from what we had experienced on other foreign visits. When questioned, American Embassy personnel explained to the Secret Service that Liberians were a peaceful people and violence was unlikely.
Two years later, a sergeant named Samuel Doe was assigned to a beach patrol near the president's home and he and his platoon decided to present some of their grievances to the highest authority. Within a few hours, the president and his 13 cabinet members were executed, and Sergeant Doe and his youthful followers became the governing authority.
A struggle among warlords continued, and President Doe was captured in Monrovia, tortured and dismembered in September 1990. By that time, Charles Taylor gained control of 95 percent of the country, excluding only the small area surrounding the capital. The 13-member Economic Community of West African States sent troops into Monrovia to protect what was left of the government, and chose a distinguished professor as acting president.
The Carter Center adopted Liberia as one of its peace efforts in Africa, and I began visiting the country in 1990, working closely with the Economic Community of West African States and its military arm. By traveling throughout the country, we also became well acquainted with civilian leaders and the different warlords, and encouraged other nations in the region (primarily Nigeria) to attempt to stabilize the country so that a democratic government might be established. As time for elections approached, there were two principal demands for any warlord wishing to be president: disbanding his army and turning in all weapons.
This effort by West African leaders, strongly supported by the Liberian people, was successful. All the major armies disbanded, and coalition troops confiscated almost 40,000 weapons, ranging from pistols to artillery pieces. A blanket amnesty was declared, and a flood of refugees and displaced persons returned to their local villages to vote. As the prime monitors, we encouraged a liberal interpretation of voter registration, and there were no disputes among the candidates about this procedure.
Carter Center monitors visited polling sites throughout Liberia on Election Day in July 1997, and were impressed with the overwhelming commitment to peace and democracy. Rosalynn and I began our day at a large open-sided shed near the capital, and we had tears in our eyes when we saw people, overwhelming numbers of registered voters, lined up in the dark, in a steady rain, long before the polls opened. At the end of the day, Charles Taylor received about 75 percent of the total vote -- because of strong support of people whom he had dominated in the rural areas and because others in Monrovia felt that he might resort to violence if he lost.
Unfortunately, the United States government played a minimal role in Liberia after the election. There were high hopes, but it became increasingly obvious that Charles Taylor was determined to maintain dictatorial powers and had little commitment to an honest government or to the well-being of the people. It was also clear that he was involved in inciting dissension in neighboring Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone. Because of these disappointments and concern about the safety of our staff, we decided to close our office and have restricted our subsequent involvement to staying in touch with regional and Liberian leaders.
Now that President Taylor has said he will resign, the coalition of West African nations should reassume their former role, with Nigeria, Ghana and other countries providing troops. A relatively small but significant American military presence of perhaps 2,000 troops should join the coalition. In addition, the world community should provide necessary economic assistance to revive Liberia's economy. Drawing on our experience, the Carter Center and other international monitors can help to ensure a proper electoral process.
Liberia has significant agriculture, forestry and mining resources, and with Mr. Taylor's departure the Liberian people will be eager to participate peacefully as we join them in restoring stability and democracy.

The New Europe Sounds Just Like the Old

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
IT seems like an eternity ago, but it was only mid-June when pundits around these parts trumpeted the shared values and common goals of countries in the European Union, which was pressing the accelerator on its first constitution. The hills were alive with a Continental Kumbaya.
 No more. In short order, that suspiciously sweet music has been replaced by a din of name-calling, backbiting, wounded national vanities and rekindled national grudges. Historians can now breathe a sigh of relief, and everyone can rest assured: Europe is back to normal. 
 Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, helped nudge it there, telling a German representative to the European Parliament that he resembled a concentration camp guard. A lower-level Italian government official did his part last week, saying he was fed up with overfed Germans who hogged all the best beaches on the Mediterranean.
Understandably chagrined, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, canceled a planned summer vacation in Italy, while his countrymen chattered acidly about those ruffians on the southern side of the Alps.
It was a torrid tit-for-tat. It was also a fresh, revivifying glimpse into the ugly emotions and messy truths obscured by all the environmental regulations, farm subsidies, stylish logos and snazzy Internet sites that glue the European Union together.
"There are old wars, battles lost, battles won, eclipsed glory," said Keith Spicer, the director of the Institute for Media, Peace and Security in Paris. "It's just endless."
Mr. Spicer was referring to the last six centuries, during which the forebears of Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany and England vied for global domination. Military invasion easily bested soccer as Europe's preferred sport, creating the kind of hurt feelings that die awfully hard.
Those resentments are infinitely larger and more varied than the latest spat between Italians and Germans, who actually like one another a whole lot more than the English and the French -- or, for that matter, the English and the Germans -- do.
Even before the tornado-sized dust-up in Europe over who was and was not supporting the United States in Iraq, relatively respectable British publications ran articles that dismissed the French as "frogs" and the Germans as "krauts," presumably on the principle that you are what you stereotypically eat.
That derogatory, decades-old tick may explain a comment in the 1990's by Edith Cresson, then the prime minister of France. In a not-so-atypical example of intra-continental insult, she asserted that fully 25 percent of British men were gay, and she did not mean happy.
Methods of lovemaking, styles of cuisine, even manners of speech: these are grist for the mill of European jealousies and jibes, neither harmless nor pretty but persistent nonetheless.
As a general and admittedly broad principle, the British find the French condescending, as do the Italians, the Germans, the Spaniards, the Dutch and maybe even the French themselves.
The French think that the British have no taste in food and no restraint around alcohol. The French think that about the Germans, too.
The Germans and the Italians think that the British, or at least those British who consider themselves upper crust, are supercilious and punctilious -- and use too many fancy words.
"They have a superiority complex when it comes to public life, but an inferiority complex when it comes to private life," said Beppe Severgnini, the former Italy correspondent for The Economist, a British publication, and the author of a book about Britain through an Italian's eyes.
For example, he said, the British fret some about sex.
Nigel Farage, a British representative to the European Parliament, said Italians don't fret much at all about a few other, arguably important matters.
"It's rather like if we talk about fraud in the European Union budget," Mr. Farage said. "There are missing billions every year. The British care about it passionately. The Italians couldn't care less."
In fact, Europeans' impressions of Italians as lusty but lawless, charismatic but corrupt, were fuel for the recent fire. Even before Mr. Berlusconi lost his temper at the European Parliament and said arrivederci to etiquette, other countries' newscasts and publications were treating his assumption of the union's rotating presidency as an apocalyptic event.
Some of those appraisals carried clear traces of bigotry and ethnic suspicion, the kind of ill wind that could blow stronger as the union expands and clumps more onetime adversaries closer together. It is set to grow to 25 nations next year from 15 now.
The eastern and central European newcomers have seldom engendered much admiration from their western counterparts, who believe that real civilization clusters much closer to the Atlantic.
There was a pungent whiff of that prejudice when Jacques Chirac, the French president, famously (and frostily) told some of those countries that they should have shut up rather than express support for the American-led military campaign against Iraq. It was a poignant preview of the love-fest to come.
Sections of Europe that look, from the outside, like homogenous recipes for unfettered harmony turn out to be something else entirely. "Even Scandinavians have very specific feelings about each other," Mr. Spicer said. "The Danes will say the Swedes are boring. The Swedes tell you that if you think they're boring, you should look at the Norwegians. The Norwegians will tell you to look at the Finns."
The Norwegians do not actually belong to the European Union, having taken a pass on the project. Mr. Farage understands that. He is against extensive European political integration, and was elected to the European Parliament on a platform of not letting it go too far. "I'm the enemy within," he explained.
"The rivalries here are very deep, and I don't think that anybody pretending they're not is helpful," he said, referring to Europe's future, present and past.
From his pessimistic perspective, Mr. Berlusconi's outburst at the European Parliament was a moment of bracing and necessary truth.
"They were the best theater tickets I ever bought," Mr. Farage said. "I was there, roaring with laughter and shouting out, 'Ah! The happy family of Europe!' "

Showing Real Estate Brokers the Door

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
Real estate brokers looking for greener-carpeted pastures full of 4br/2bth/nukitch/gdschools dreamhouses may want to skip Houston, if a new survey is correct. According to the survey, by ForSaleByOwner.com -- you can guess its field -- more people in Houston than in any other American city use the site to sell homes without a broker. 
 Of 30,000-plus homes the service listed last year, 8 percent were in Houston, with Charlotte second, at 6.4. 
 The motive for these independent sorts is clear. With a typical broker's commission at 6 percent, homeowners saved some $110 million last year by selling on the Web site, the company said. After all, about 60 percent of buyers surf a bit before poking around in real closets. HUBERT B. HERRING

14 Months of Torment, Indelible After 2 Decades
 The captivity and psychological torture were unconscionable, he says, but he does not demonize those who inflicted it on him and 51 other Americans.
 In 1979, Moorhead C. Kennedy Jr., who was born and raised in New York City, was the acting head of the United States Embassy's economic section in Iran when anti-American militants seized the building and took hostages, 52 of whom they held for 14 months. 
 Mr. Kennedy became one of the best- known of the captives, largely because his wife, Louisa Kennedy, was a spokeswoman for their families. After the hostages were released in 1981, he left his 20-year State Department career to direct the Cathedral Peace Institute, a group dealing with religion and foreign policy, at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
That role ended two years later when he opposed the church leaders' advocacy of a nuclear-weapons freeze by the United States and the Soviet Union; Mr. Kennedy called negotiations the better route to nuclear cutbacks. His 1986 book, "The Ayatollah in the Cathedral," contended that many freeze proponents were as intolerant of dissent as any Iranian ideologue. 
His later ventures included the Moorhead Kennedy Institute, which offered training in subjects like cultural diversity. 
"I don't think any of us will recover totally" from the hostage ordeal, Mr. Kennedy, 72 and retired, said last week from his home on Mount Desert Island in Maine. He cited a legacy of "bad dreams" and other mental scars. The hostages said their torment had been intensified by threats of execution.
But even as he denounced the hostage- takers, "you have to understand," he said, "why they acted as they did" -- their enmity toward America for its having supported the shah of Iran, who had been overthrown earlier that year. 
There is a lesson in this for today, Mr. Kennedy said: the United States should not publicly back the Iranian moderates whom "we may have sympathy for," because doing so would "only strengthen the determination of the ayatollahs" to suppress them.
Mr. Kennedy said the former hostages would continue seeking compensation from Iran, despite a recent federal court ruling that the government agreement that freed them barred them from suing Iran. "It's not the money," he said, "but a feeling that a terrible injustice was done to us."

After Crash, Identifying The Victims' Next of Kin
 Last February, two teenage mothers and their babies were mowed down in Brooklyn by a speeding Jeep Grand Cherokee whose driver was described by the authorities as impaired by illegal drugs. The mothers, Yaritza Santos, 19, and Nery Mejia, 17, were killed, as was Ms. Santos's son, Manuel Noriega Villot, 10 months old. Ricky Mejia, 11 months, survived.
The driver, John V. Zappulla, 25, has been charged with second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty.
The victims' relatives plan to file or have filed lawsuits against Mr. Zappulla and his father, the owner of the Jeep. In this connection, the paternity of each baby has been an issue, even though each of the men in question is on the child's birth certificate as the father. In one case, a blood test showed that the man was, in fact, not the father, and last week custody, guardianship and the right to sue the Zappullas were granted to the maternal grandmother, her lawyer, John S. Carro, said. In the other case, where the man has already filed a suit against the Zappullas, DNA testing is to be conducted.

HEADLINE: Alcohol Ban In Sand Dunes Of Oregon Curbs Trouble 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: NORTH BEND, Ore., July 12 

 BODY:
For six years, Bart Jones and his friends have headed to sand dunes along Oregon's south coast for holiday weekends to party and speed across the slopes on their all-terrain vehicles.
 This year, Mr. Jones and a friend were given $75 tickets for having beer in the dunes and were barred from camping for the rest of the weekend. The arrests were a result of a new Forest Service ban on alcohol in parts of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, where officials say drunken rowdiness is a growing problem. 
 Administrators decided that enough was enough after a chaotic scene last Labor Day weekend in which people drag-raced in their vehicles and left mounds of litter strewn about the park.
This spring, the administrators of the Oregon dunes banned alcohol on the sand, whether people are riding or camping. And they capped the number of permits for groups to camp on the sand at 550.
The few allowed to reserve one of the 232 sites in paved campgrounds with bathrooms can drink and have alcohol in their coolers, but cannot take it with them on the sand to ride.
The crackdown on all-terrain-vehicle users was effective, officials said.
Only one other national forest or park has enacted a drinking ban for all-terrain-vehicle riders, a rule that public lands managers around the country say is too difficult to enforce.
The Forest Service estimates that A.T.V. use nationwide grew from 28 million people in 1995 to 36 million in 2000, helping some rural areas like Oregon's southern coast make up for the loss of timber and fishing jobs with tourism dollars.
A 1999 study by Rebecca Johnson, an Oregon State University resource economics professor, found that A.T.V. riders spent $74 million on equipment in Oregon and $46 million for groceries, gas, motels and other necessities.
But with the growth in numbers has come a growth in rowdiness, drinking and accidents on the three- or four-wheeled vehicles, which can be driven on sand, rocks and trails.
The 2002 Consumer Product Safety Commission report said A.T.V. deaths and injuries had been rising fast in recent years.
The number of A.T.V.-related deaths hit 547 for 2000, nearly double the number in 1997. Injuries requiring an emergency-room visit hit 111,700 in 2001, more than double the estimated 54,700 in 1997.
Although problems with A.T.V.'s and drinking have been reported around the country, alcohol bans have not been widely embraced.
The Bureau of Land Management decided against an alcohol ban in the 150,000-acre Imperial Sand Dunes in Southern California, which can draw 190,000 people on a holiday weekend, said Chief Ranger Robert Zimmer.

HEADLINE: For Richer or Poorer, to Our Visa Card Limit 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
The mermaid-shaped gown with the $4,200 price tag was the first purchase that Cynthia Davis, of Coral Springs, Fla., charged to her Visa card. 
 The tiered cake, the groom's tuxedo and gifts for the bridesmaids followed, putting Ms. Davis and her fiance, David Davis, in serious debt for the first time in their lives. 
 Two more credit cards paid for doves to be released after their vows and for a horse-drawn carriage to take them to their reception, where 340 guests would be waiting.
When the big day was over, the balance due was $12,000 -- a debt the couple struggled with for three years, through bouts of unemployment, until they separated in 2001. 
Wedding bills are weighing down couples and their parents long after the "I do's," and many have been forced to seek financial counseling as a result, according to credit counseling agencies. 
Young couples with modest incomes are having the most trouble repaying. Whether they celebrate lavishly or modestly, they are more likely than ever to pay for their weddings without help from their parents. And even when parents pay, what more and more people expect of nice weddings is increasingly more elaborate for both the richer and the poorer. And so, with debt do they start. 
Ms. Davis, now 23 and an administrator at an employment agency, has since entered credit counseling to help her manage her wedding debt.
"I hope everyone had a good time, because I'm still paying," Ms. Davis said, laughing, then quietly added, "really paying in a big way -- not only financially, but with my marriage."
Howard S. Dvorkin, the president of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services Inc., in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said, "Paying off these weddings is going to take a heck of a lot longer than the few hours the party lasted, maybe longer than the marriage lasts." He added, "Because there's the emotional aspect, people lose sight of the finances when they're getting married." 
Springboard Non-Profit Consumer Credit Management, based in Riverside, Calif., says that in 2002 close to 240 customers -- about 2 percent of its clients -- named wedding spending the primary source of their debts, more than double the figure for 2001. Springboard said that with the exception of poor budgeting every other cause of debt that clients cited at least as frequently was unavoidable, like unemployment or illness.
Consolidated Credit, one of the country's five largest accredited agencies, reports that so far this year 5.2 percent of its 6,000 new customers have cited wedding debt as a reason for seeking credit counseling, double the rate of wedding-related cases the company took on in 2000, just before the last recession began.
There has been no data collected on whether wedding debt is a factor in the increase in personal bankruptcies. But in some cases, such counseling is a step on the road toward bankruptcy.
For Mitchell and Sandra Crim of Bellevue, Wash., spending for their daughter Sarah's wedding day "was a matter of pride," said Mr. Crim, a customer service representative for Nintendo. "We did not want to appear cheap, or that we were incapable of giving her the wedding she wanted. And that's just part of the illusion." 
The 250-guest affair that the Crims held for their daughter in August 2001 saddled them with $4,000 of credit-card debt. The payments were a burden from the start, they said, and after Mrs. Crim's employer reduced her hours, the debt made even paying for groceries difficult. "And it was hurting our relationship," Mr. Crim said of his own marriage. "It's so difficult when the main focus of your existence is trying to find a way to pay these people," he said, referring to the creditors.
The Crims went for credit counseling this past February. They now make monthly payments under a plan that, Mr. Crim wryly notes, will take four to five years to pay the remaining bills from their daughter's big day. 
"If you have to buy something on credit, buy a house. Buy a car," he said. "Certainly do not buy a wedding."
But wedding planners across the country say that couples are, in fact, buying weddings on the installment plan. And although there are no numbers on how often brides and their families are borrowing, a recent survey of 1,400 bridal magazine readers found that last year 43 percent spent more on their weddings than they had budgeted.
The survey, from the Conde Nast Bridal Infobank, a research service for its wedding magazines, also found that the average wedding now costs $22,000, representing more than five months' worth of wages for amiddle-income family, according to data from the Census Bureau.
Yet after adjusting for inflation, that $22,000 represents only a 7 percent increase over the average cost of a wedding in 1990. Moreover, the average wedding consumes no more of a middle-income family's earnings than it did in 1990, suggesting that weddings are not necessarily less affordable than they were a decade ago. 
So why is wedding debt an issue now? 
For one thing, more couples are paying for their own weddings -- 27 percent last year versus 23 percent in 1997, according to the Bridal Infobank. And an additional 30 percent are paying at least part of the bill, up from 18 percent in 1997. Newlyweds typically earn less than their parents, and often already carry the burden of student loans. Many are also trying to save enough to make a down payment on a house. 
Wedding expectations, meanwhile, have far outgrown people's incomes, especially those in the low to moderate end, said Chrys Ingraham, an associate professor of sociology at Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., and author of "White Weddings," a book about America's fascination with weddings. Couples who years ago would have simply married at City Hall are now "emulating what they believe to be an upper-class model," Ms. Ingraham said. "There is this notion that the big wedding is a good thing for everybody."
Pamela J. Smock, a sociologist at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, last year interviewed about 120 people who were living with their romantic partners and earning low to moderate incomes. She said she found that the inability to pay for "a real wedding" was keeping a fifth of them from marrying. 
"The perceived cost of the wedding -- what we as a culture have now decided is the standard for a wedding -- is very powerful," Ms. Smock said.
A sluggish economy is also making wedding debt more of a problem. Only two months after Stacey and Justin Blair amassed $20,000 in credit card debt to pay for their May 2001 wedding, Mr. Blair was laid off from his job as a laboratory technician. Ms. Blair said that because of their wedding debt, the couple had to move into her aunt's house to save on rent.
They also parted with their two leased cars in favor of sharing a used car, and they enlisted a financial planner to monitor their spending, even submitting their credit card statements for review each month. "Everything was just a mess," Ms. Blair said. Still, she considers the wedding well worth it: "It was such a fun day, I didn't care how much we put on our credit cards."
But the impact of wedding debt goes beyond finances. During the first five years of marriage, the most common and intense source of conflict among couples under the age of 30 is debt brought into marriage, according to a large national study conducted in 1999 by the Center for Marriage and Family at Creighton University in Omaha. Among all of the nearly 800 spouses surveyed, regardless of age, it was the third-most-troubling issue, behind time management and sexual issues.
For Trisha Betts, a 26-year-old office manager from Houston, repaying her $6,000 wedding loan meant spending more than three years scrimping and living with the occasional suspension of telephone service. It meant frequent arguments with her husband. The two divorced on Feb. 13. "If we didn't have any debt, things would have been different," Ms. Betts said.
At the same time, Ms. Betts shares the opinion of many marriage therapists that financial stress is commonplace in married life. 
Michael G. Lawler, the director of the Center forMarriage and Family, said, "It's the United States of America, after all, and there's going to be some sort of debt." He added, "The question is what strategies do you have, together, to deal with the debt?" 
Douglas and Jacqueline Weaver, who live in Rockmart, Ga., spent more than a decade dealing with the $5,500 or so in credit card debt that they incurred for their wedding in 1992, when they were barely 21. 
They finished repaying it last month, after nearly five years in a debt management program.
Ms. Weaver said the experience has taught them patience: whether that meant waiting to use their single car while the other was out, or saving enough to buy a second car, or taking day trips instead of having out-of-town vacations, or chipping away at debt keeping them from buying a house. Mostly, Ms. Weaver said, the debt taught them to have patience with each other.
Last week, the Weavers took their two sons on a trip to the Smoky Mountains for the family's first big vacation since a honeymoon trip to Orlando, Fla. 
"We've been married for 11 years, and we just are finally seeing light," Ms. Weaver said happily.
And when they returned home on Friday night, it was to their own house, which they bought last year.

Art on Main Street
Westport has invited 128 artists from 18 states and Canada to exhibit their juried work in the town's 30th annual Fine Arts Festival on Saturday from 9 to 7:30 and Sunday from 9 to 6. Main Street will be closed to traffic to accommodate the event.
 Artists from many states, including California, Alabama, Florida, New England, Ohio, Oregon and Virginia will be displaying oils, watercolors, pastels, sculpture and etchings. There will also be plenty of entertainment, including the Mystic Paper Beasts, Giacomo Gates and Friends, the Wiggins Sisters, the Jimmy Kelly Band, Dan Bonis and Friends. Cafe Musette will feature Cynthia McCorkindale, a jazz song stylist and pianist, Larry Urbon on guitar, and Jeff Eyrick on bass on stage almost continuously. 
 Part of the proceeds from an art auction scheduled on Wednesday from 7 to 10 p.m. will help support the Hole in the Wall Gang camp for seriously ill youngsters. 

Books Around the Corner
Festival-goers have another reason to be in Westport on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday as well, when the library, across the Post Road from Main Street, holds its summer book sale. 
Sci-fi devotees will head for the 67 Star Trek video tapes, offered as a collection until 11 a.m. Saturday; and thousands of books will be available on sports, games, homes, gardens, wine, food, business, computers, religion, philosophy, adult and children's paperbacks and hard covers ranging from 50 cents up. Videos, CD's, audio and music cassettes, books-on-tape and LP albums should turn up something for almost everyone. 
Hours on Saturday and Sunday are 9 to 5, Monday is half-price day from 9 to 9, Tuesday everything is free from 9 to whenever, with cash contributions welcome. Information: (203)227-8411.

Blooming Roxbury
 Eight private gardens will be opened to the public, some for the first time, in Roxbury. They include Richard Daniel Daylily Gardens in peak bloom, the writer Tovah Martin's cottage garden of heirloom plants, wildflowers and hollyhocks, and the organic vegetable farm owned by David Blyn and Laura McKinney. 
Visitors will be welcome from 1 p.m. Saturday until 6:30, when they will convene at the library, 23 South Street, for a champagne reception until 7:30. Tickets with self-guiding maps for $50 in advance and $65 on Saturday may be picked up at Minor Memorial Library, 23 South Street, whose Contemplation Garden is the beneficiary of the event.

Information: (860) 350-2181.

Uncle Sam in Sherman
 James Montgomery Flagg's famous 1917 poster of Uncle Sam pointing a finger at the viewer, with the caption "I Want YOU for U.S. Army," was the catalyst for the Sherman Library's new exhibition called "Uncle Sam in Propaganda -- WWI to Gulf War II."
According to the library, the Flagg poster was designed to "give the masses a sense of personal involvement in the 'Good War' the virtues of self sacrifice and participation." Other prominent commercial artists of the time like Edward Penfield and J.C. Leyendecker created similarly rousing art for the government
By the time World War II rolled around, artists including Flagg, Norman Rockwell, N.C. Wyeth and Ben Shahn were giving Uncle Sam a more militaristic aspect, a warrior opposing an evil foe, and an icon for many causes including espionage and the economy. 
Seymour Chwast's 1967 anti-war caricature poster of Uncle Sam, "End Bad Breath," shows a wild-eyed uncle in his stars and stripes top hat, with a flight of bomb-dropping planes flying over houses in his gaping mouth. 
The library, on Route 39 in Sherman's town center, is open Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, 11 to 6; Thursday, 11 to 7, and Saturday, 10 to 4. Information: (860)354-2455. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: If You Build It, They Will Come? 

BYLINE:  By TERRY GOLWAY

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
RICK CERONE, son of Newark and a New Jersey baseball legend, has no answers.
 Sitting behind a desk 18 stories above Broad Street here, in a building no more than 200 yards from a baseball stadium born of his imagination and passion, the 48-year-old former Yankee catcher is trying to explain why so few people are coming to watch the team he revived, the Newark Bears. 
 "I'll be honest with you, I thought we'd be selling out the stadium every night," Mr. Cerone said in a recent interview, jerking his head to the left. The ballpark -- Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium, named for the old Bears and the Eagles, which played in the Negro League -- is somewhere over his left shoulder, between Broad Street and Route 21. It is early in the morning in Newark, so the grandstands are empty. 
 The trouble is, when game time arrives those grandstands remain painfully vacant.
 Of course, there are reasons for the rows of empty stands: fear of traipsing through the darkened streets of Newark late at night, and so many other sports and entertainment venues in the New York area. But the fact that residents of North Jersey will not venture into the heart of the state's largest city to watch a ballgame on a summer's night is a cautionary tale for those who want the Nets and the Devils to abandon the Meadowlands for a new sports arena in Newark. 
 "With the Bears, we have a great product," Mr. Cerone said. "We've had big-name players like Rickey Henderson. We've won the league championship and should have won another, and we have great sponsor support. The only thing missing in Newark are the bodies. I don't know why."
 For emphasis, he repeated himself, twice: "I don't know why. I don't know why." 
 This year marks the fifth season in the life of the stadium, which opened -- or half-opened, since it was not quite finished when the gates opened in 1999 -- at a cost to Essex County taxpayers of $34 million.
 Despite outsized publicity, including articles in national magazines and coverage on ESPN, this year the Bears' have been drawing only about 3,000 at each game through early July, about half the stadium's capacity -- even with the presence of one of baseball's greatest leadoff hitters, Mr. Henderson, who joined the Bears this year in an effort to work his way back into the major leagues at age 44.
 Yet other minor league teams in New Jersey are doing better, and in some cases spectacularly well. The Trenton Thunder, a Double A team affiliated with the Yankees (and formerly, the Boston Red Sox), have attracted four million fans since the team's founding in 1993.
 The Lakewood Blueclaws, a Single A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, regularly draw 6,000 or more. Among teams like the Bears, which play in the independent minor leagues -- those not affiliated with Major League baseball -- the Somerset Patriots average about 5,000 fans at each home game, and the Camden Riversharks, playing in a city that has replaced Newark as a symbol of New Jersey's urban decay, draw close to 4,000 a game. 
 Going into this year, the Bears had drawn about 800,000 people since the stadium opened in mid-season in 1999. Attendance declined from a high of 243,255 in 2001 to 208,634 last year. 
 What is worse, the Bears' official attendance figures, based on ticket sales, do not always square with actual attendance. On the night of June 30, for example, a warm, pleasant evening with the Bears playing host to the Pennsylvania Road Warriors, the announced crowd of 3,900 seemed more like 1,000, maybe 1,500.
 The crowd at a July 4 matinee against the Camden Riversharks, announced at 2,281, seemed a good deal less than 1,000. There were yawning gaps in the box seats ($9per seat), and only a few dozen people were scattered throughout the bleachers ($7) down the right field and left field lines.
 Last September, when the Bears won the championship of the independent Atlantic League, the announced crowd was disappointing enough at 2,014. But by all accounts, including Mr. Cerone's, only about 800 to 1,000 people were actually on hand to cheer Newark's first professional baseball championship since the days of the old Newark Bears, the celebrated and long-gone Yankee minor league team that once featured a catcher from St. Louis named Lawrence Berra.
 A few months after that bittersweet day in September, Mr. Cerone sold half his interest in the team for what he described only as "less than market value," though the team is worth an estimated at $3 million.
 Mr. Cerone -- who grew up in the North Ward in the shadow of the Sacred Heart Cathedral -- was exhausted, he admitted, and frustrated, too.
 "My vision was to help bring people back to Newark, which the stadium has done," he said. "But what I didn't calculate was the competition for the entertainment dollar in North Jersey. Still, there are millions of people within a 15-mile radius of the ballpark. I don't know, I don't have the answer. I got a little tired."
 His new partner is Steve Kalafer, the 53-year-old owner of an automobile dealership, Flemington Car and Truck County, who lives in Annandale, Hunterdon County. Mr. Kalafer, who grew up in North Caldwell, is also a documentary film producer, real estate developer and owner of the highly successful Somerset Patriots, an Atlantic League team that plays in Commerce Bank Stadium in Bridgewater. 
 The Bears essentially are Mr. Kalafer's now, and he recently named Marc Berson of Millburn, a friend and business partner, as the team's chairman. He said that while his ownership stake is 50 percent, he is 100 percent responsible for the team's daily operations. 
In fact, Mr. Cerone conceded that he soon may sell 45 percent of his remaining 50 percent share of the Bears, though he would not disclose to whom. But even if he did, he said, he would continue to play an active role as the team's founder and best-known cheerleader. 
 "That will never change, whether I own 50 percent, as I do now, or 5 percent, as I might in the future," he said.
 In any case, writing Mr. Cerone out of the team's life would seem to be premature. Encased in glass outside the Bears' executive offices is Mr. Cerone's uniform from his days as an All-American catcher at Seton Hall University in neighboring South Orange, where he starred from 1973 to 1975. Lining a corridor near the ballpark's press box are more than a half-dozen plaques presented to Mr. Cerone in recent years. And a Bears' fan in search of a mixed drink and shade is welcome to visit "Rick's Upper Deck" on the first base side of the stadium. 
 Mr. Kalafer, while not about to rewrite history, is clearly looking to break with the team's recent frustrations. Sitting in the dugout of Commerce Bank Stadium and watching rain threaten a sellout between his Patriots and the Atlantic City Surf, Mr. Kalafer said he was committed to the Bears and to Newark. 
 "This is a building year," he said of the 2003 season. "During the next two years, we will be reintroducing the Newark Bears to the Essex County community and to the city of Newark."
 It takes two to become reacquainted, however, and even some Bears' fans wonder if the relationship will work out. Those concerns range from the prosaic -- a lack of parking and the abandoned buildings, razor wire and security gatesthat define the streetscape near the stadium -- to the cosmic, like the reasonable question: Is the much-hailed Newark renassiance more hype than substance? 
 As seen through Mayor Sharpe James's prism, the problem with the Bears would seem to be largely racial -- even though minorities make up almost the entire team. "To the best of my knowledge," Mr. James said last week, "there has never been any visible or known minority personnel within the organization involved in significant administrative roles." 
 From a business standpoint, the mayor said he thought the "organization needs to reevaluate its marketing strategy and look at this city's demographics."
 "We have a large senior presence here, many of whom remember when minor league baseball in Newark was king," he said. "Why isn't more outreach done to them? It is not an impossibility to fill those seats, but it does help to have a comprehensive strategy." 
 Based on the Bears' attendance problems, it is clear that the economic revival of Newark will require more than a new stadium. But the city's defenders point to the notable success of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, just down Broad Street. 
 Jeff Norman, spokesman for NJPAC, said the concert hall, which opened in the fall of 1997, has drawn 3.2 million people in its six seasons of operation. And in the 2001-2002 season, Mr. Norman added, it sold more than 18,000 subscriptions. 
 Then again, the comparison is not entirely fair, since NJPAC had nearly 400 dates in the 2001-2002 season, compared with the Bears' 72 home games, and a full house in Prudential Hall is 2,750 -- which is somewhat less than the Bears' average attendance this year.
 Still, Mr. Kalafer cited the success of NJPAC as proof that suburbanites will venture into Newark for the right experience. 
 "Is Newark so different from other urban areas that have been able to build a relationship with a minor league team," he asked -- his voice suggesting that he believed the correct answer was no, Newark was not different from, say, Camden.
 Perhaps the problem is something else. 
 "Does there need to be a structural change between the Bears and the city of Newark, Essex County, the corporate community?, Mr. Kalafer asked. "The answer is yes."
 Many fans -- white, black, Hispanic, Asian, urban and suburban -- would agree that change of some sort is desperately needed. What they do not necessarily agree on is the problem, other than pointing out that minor league baseball is now a statewide industry. Eight teams dot the New Jersey map, and all have come into existence since 1993. One team, the New Jersey Jackals of the Northeastern League, plays in Little Falls, plays just a few miles from Newark.
 During the first few soggy weeks of the 2003 season, the two teams occasionally played on the same night, diluting each other's market. Put the two teams' attendance together, and you would have about 5,000 fans a night in one of the two parks.
"If you plot out the locations of minor league baseball on a map of New Jersey, Newark and the Jackals are the only two teams that share what I could consider a common market," said Mark Magyar of the Public Policy Center of New Jersey.
 Sitting in a box seat near home plate in late June, Wayne Johnson of Hillside complained that concession prices, not a market glut, keeps many Newark residents away. With his 5-year-old son, Wayne Johnson Jr., at his side and wielding a miniature Bears bat, Mr. Johnson noted that he had spent $5.50 for two hot dogs. 
 "That's a lot of money for people in Newark," he said. On the other hand, it is not as steep as Major League prices. At Yankee Stadium, for instance, a hot dog costs $4.
 Others wonder whether any sports venture in New Jersey can succeed, pointing to the empty seats in Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands, home to the New Jersey Devils hockey team and current owners of the Stanley Cup and the New Jersey Nets, two-time finalists in the National Basketball Association. Nor does Seton Hall University or Rutgers University draws huge crowds for their big-time collegiate schedules.
 "I just don't think New Jersey is a great sports area," said Drew Bauman, a lawyer from Maplewood and an old-fashioned fan who still studies box scores. 
 "Let's face it," Mr. Bauman added, "I don't think there would be much weeping if the Devils and Nets left the state. There isn't a strong allegience to New Jersey teams, which is why the Nets and Devils don't sell out, even for playoff games. As for the Bears, their problem is Newark's problem: People don't want to go there."
 Even those who do go -- and Mr. Bauman is a regular, despite his gloomy view -- seem aware that they are a lonely few. On July 4, Corey Winograd drove his two boys, 7-year-old Jack and 4-year-old Eric, from their home in Livingston to the Orange station on New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex line. From there, they took a Hoboken-bound train to Broad Street station, less than a five-minute walk from the stadium. 
 The unusual route was prompted not by fear of parking in Newark, but by nostalgia. "Taking a train to a minor league game on July 4 -- that's Americana," Mr. Winograd explained. 
 Asked why there weren't more people sharing his red, white and blue dream, he pointed to a gutted skeleton once known as the Lincoln Motel, one of the ballpark's less-attractive neighbors. "Who wants to come here?" he asked.
 Of course, as dreadful as the shell of the Lincoln Motel is, Joseph DiVincenzo, the Essex County executive, has met with Mr. Kalafer to discuss not only the county's role in rehabilitating the surrounding area, but also to talk economics. The Essex County Improvement Authority, an arm of the county government, issued the bonds to build the ballpark and reserved for the county the right to sell the stadium's 20 skyboxes and its naming rights. Five seasons later, the boxes remain unsold, and Mr. DiVincenzo says he is now willing to return those rights to the team.
 "We're refining the lease because there are things we would not be doing," he said. 
 In return for their use of the stadium, the Bears give the county $1 for every ticket sold and a quarter of the revenue from the concessions. In addition, the county runs the limited parking concession, collecting $5 per car. Debt service on the bonds that financed the ballpark runs $1.6 million a year.
 Mr. DiVincenzo makes a distinction between the stadium and the Bears, contending that the ballpark has been a success even if the Bears are having a hard time keeping it half-filled.
 "The stadium is not just for baseball," he said. "It is for multiple purposes, and it has been successful for the community activities that take place there. We have 300,000 people who come there every year for baseball or other activities, like the Greater Newark Baseball Tournament, which used to be in Verona. We also have concerts there."
 Still, he said he understood that changes had to be made and that the city and the countywould have to work closely with Mr. Kalafer to make the neighborhood more welcoming and convenient. For instance, he said the music store would come down, and a parking deck would be built. 
 Because while the Bears may be a minor league outfit, they share a problem with major league in cities: Where to put the cars? Colleen McDonald of West Orange said she enjoyed going to Bears games with her 8-year-old son Patrick a few times a year, though she would come more often if the parking was more convenient.
 Despite the obvious concerns, fans at the stadium expressed few, if any, complaints about the team or the facility itself. The romance of minor league baseball -- the enthusiasm on the field and the child-friendly outreach in the grandstands -- is very much alive in Newark. 
 For now, Mr. Kalafer seems convinced he can remove whatever obstacles stand between his team and a warm embrace by the surrounding community that translates into ticket sales and fan loyalty over the next two years as he tries to rebuild the Bears in the mold of his Somerset Patriots. 
 As for Mr. Cerone, whose determination stood him in good stead during his 18 seasons in the Major Leagues, he is already thinking about yet another sports venue.
 "You know," he said, his eyes looking away, "I think Newark should get a new arena for the Nets and Devils. But if we don't, I'd love to talk to somebody about building a smaller arena, with 7,000 seats. You look around the country -- these smaller arenas are making a ton of money. That's an idea I'd be willing to put my efforts into."

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of the Stadium, an Eyesore 

BYLINE:  By TERRY GOLWAY

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
DON'T talk to Steve Kalafer, the new owner of the Newark Bears, about the Lincoln Motel, which sits conspicuously in the shadow of Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium. 
 The decrepit shell of a motel that once featured a kitschy picture of Lincoln has been closed for years, though to describe it as shuttered would be wrong, since many of walls are missing from the litter-strewn building that once sheltered homeless people. 
 For years, the motel -- situated along stretch of town hard by Interstate 280 -- was known for its short stays and constant mentions in police reports. 
 The building that became the Lincoln was erected in 1966 as a Holiday Inn. But when the city's economy faltered after the race riots in 1967, travelers began to stay at the hotels springing up at Newark International Airport, and the Lincoln fell into disrepair. It had closed by the time Miles P. Berger, a developer and currently a leading ally of Mayor Sharpe James, bought it in 1976 for the rock-bottom price of $500,000. Mr. Berger later bought several other hotels in the city and converted them for use by welfare recipients, earning him millions in government social service contracts.
 In 1999, with the stadium going up not more than 1,000 feet from the motel's door and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center just around the corner, Mr. Berger said he believed the time was right to invest in Newark's tourist trade. His plan was to gut the structure, install new furnishings, revive the swimming pool, restore the second-floor ballroom and reopen as a franchise. Though he declined to be specific about the timing, he said in June 1999 that it would happen within the next five months and that "the end is near." 
 Four years later, however, the end does not seem any nearer. Fenced in and with its 200 tiny rooms exposed, the motel runs the length of the left field grandstands. Rail commuters who pass through the Broad Street station are left to ponder the imagery of a crisp new taxpayer-built baseball stadium side by side with the shell of a onetime crime-ridden homeless shelter.
 "The fact that the Lincoln Motel is there, half-demolished, is disgraceful and inexcusable," Mr. Kalafer said. 
 Or as Corey Winograd of Livingston, who took his two young sons to a Bears game on July 4, put it, "For a fan to see that, what message is that giving of Newark?"
 Visions of a gleaming new hotel, along with economic development on Broad Street and the Passaic River, now seem relegated to late-90's happy talk. Adjacent to the park are not the hoped-for sports bars and restaurants, but gated storefronts, an abandoned music store, a check-cashing store and a beauty supply shop advertising 100 percent synthetic and human hair. 
 The music store is scheduled for demolition, said Joseph DiVincenzo, the Essex County executive. But action on razing the Lincoln Motel has been delayed because of reconstruction of Route 21, just beyond the stadium's left field fence. To Mr. Kalafer, that is no excuse. "Nobody has attempted to secure the visual appearance of the property," he said. "Many times you can close a site like that with plywood and invite schools to decorate it with artwork. That would take an eyesore and turn it into something neutral."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
Science Fiction, A Scary Proposition

BYLINE:  By LEWIS BEALE

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
GORDON VAN GELDER'S business is in the black these days, but that doesn't mean he is rolling in money. Far from it. Monthly profits can usually be measured in the three-figure range for Mr. Van Gelder, who is the owner, publisher and editor of a venerable but struggling science fiction monthly that specializes in short stories.
 "I never got into this thinking I was going to get rich," Mr. Van Gelder, 36, said from his cluttered apartment here, which serves as home and intergalactic headquarters for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, the 54-year-old magazine he bought three years ago. 
 "I bought the magazine because it was the only way I could be sure I could continue editing it," said Mr. Van Gelder, a native of Harrington Park who was editor of the magazine for four years before acquiring it. "I do the business end of it just so I can be able to play with the magazine and find new writers. That's the best part of it." 
 Business was not Mr. Van Gelder's original career path. A science fiction fan since childhood, he majored in creative writing at Princeton, then worked for St. Martin's Press for more than a decade, editing science fiction, mystery and pop culture titles. Because St. Martin's published several story collections culled from Fantasy and Science Fiction, Mr. Van Gelder became friendly with Ed Ferman, then publisher of the magazine. Mr. Ferman was about to retire and asked Mr. Van Gelder to consider editing the publication. Mr. Van Gelder said yes, juggled his responsibilities at St. Martin's and the magazine for the next several years and then bought the magazine in October 2000 for less than $100,000.
 What Mr. Van Gelder acquired was a well-known niche publication struggling to maintain readership in a difficult market. Founded in 1949, Fantasy and Science Fiction is the second longest-running science fiction magazine in the country. (In first place is Analog, founded in 1930 as Astounding Science Fiction.)
 It has published such writers as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Walter Moseley and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. It was also the original publisher of Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" and the short story "Flowers for Algernon," which became the 1968 Oscar-winning film "Charly."
 But even though science fiction remains a popular genre read by millions of fans, its short-story category has fallen on hard times. That is a major reason the magazine's circulation has fallen to around 29,000 from 35,000 monthly (15,000 from newsstand sales) since Mr. Van Gelder took over the publication. 
 "A lot of the older readers are dying off, and we're not getting enough new subscribers," he said. "Fiction magazines as a whole have been dying since television came up. Many readers, when they take time to read something, want a big long book they can get lost in. They don't want it to be over in 30 pages, and then make the commitment again to something new."
 Still, the magazine remains a must-read for its core audience, which Mr. Van Gelder says is predominantly male, middle-class, college-educated and over 40. And it continues to attract tyro writers who hope to break into the field -- the magazine receives 500 to 700 submissions a month, of which only 1 percent make it into print, he said.
 The magazine pays authors 5 to 8 cents a word, which means that even a superstar author like Joyce Carol Oates, who recently appeared in the magazine's pages, earns less than $1,000 a story. So what's in it for them?
 "Not much," said Mr. Van Gelder, "which is why most agents don't even represent short fiction anymore. Their commissions are too low to make it worth their time. But for the writers, it's what they love doing. Some will write short stories to try out an idea they want to adapt for a novel. Stephen King loves the short-story form; he started out writing for us and for men's magazines."
 In this kind of financial atmosphere, economies of scale are important. Mr. Van Gelder's bare-bones staff is mostly freelancers who work part time. He takes a salary that he says is less than $50,000 a year, similar to what he was making at St. Martin's. The magazine's monthly editorial budget rarely tops $5,000, and printing costs are $10,000 per issue. Full-page ads run about $900, and the back cover, the only full-color advertisement in the publication, costs $2,200. Mr. Van Gelder estimates that he needs to sell 10 ads an issue to pay his printing bill but usually sells only about half that number.
 When it came to business, Mr. Van Gelder had to unlearn a lot of things he knew about book publishing that simply did not apply in the magazine world.
 "In book publishing," he said, "I could look at a book and say, 'This book you can estimate X number of copies sold,' and you'd probably want X plus 1,000 for your firstprinting, and if that sells out, you go back and reprint. With magazines you don't have returns, so you try to pare down your print run to precisely the right level, because in a month nobody wants the issue."
 Mr. Van Gelder's learning curve also involved subscription matters. He knew nothing about the subscription renewal process, how to seek new readers (he now does a direct-mail promotion every year) or what to say to angry subscribers -- like the Canadian sci fi fans who recently canceled their subscriptions after they realized the mail between the two countries was so slow that the magazine appeared on newsstands weeks before they got their issues.
 At least the magazine isn't bothered by a lot of competition. Mr. Van Gelder says that "you can pretty much count on one hand" the number of publications, including Analog, Realms of Fantasy and Asimov's Science Fiction, that vie with his on the newsstands, and that "the real competition is to get the best writers to write short fiction at all." Nor is he particularly concerned that he works in what many people consider a marginalized literary genre.
 "If science fiction isn't marginalized, it's doing something wrong," he said. "The form is so amorphous, I think it's fundamentally more threatening, more radical, that a lot of people who turn to fiction for comfort reading are inherently going to be put off by it. It's much more difficult than fantasy, which vastly outsells science fiction in book form."
 Which is to say that as far as the owner of Fantasy and Science Fiction is concerned, he's fighting the good fight: keeping the publication alive, publishing the best fiction he can find, developing new authors. He hopes to inject some much-needed capital into the business with two story collections culled from the magazine's pages, the first to be issued by the independent publisher Four Walls Eight Windows. And he has contingency plans, like cutting back on the frequency of publication, to keep the magazine alive in case falling subscriptions threaten its existence. 
 "The only way to make it work," he said, "is to go out there and hustle and keep hustling and just don't let up."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Hold Your Applause For the Budget Show

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE 

 BODY:
So, was the fight over arts financing just a shadow play after all? 
 It sure seemed that way back in April, when Governor McGreevey held a number of ostentatiously private meetings with groups representing various key beneficiaries of state funds, particularly in the arts. The meetings were private only in the sense that they were held behind closed doors. But they were public in the sense that the participants were all but ushered into the arms of waiting reporters to describe the grim news the governor had delivered: under the duress of budget woes, state financing of the arts would go to zero, from $18 million. 
 In the convoluted paths of politics, the idea was to so alarm a key constituency, a vocal, organized and politically connected constituency, that its members would fan out and do the governor's heavy lifting for him, requesting, nay demanding, a full restoration of the arts money by whatever means it took.
 Jeffrey Woodward, managing director of the McCarter Theater Center and chairman of Art Pride New Jersey, an advocacy group, was at the meetings. "The governor, in his first meeting with us, when he announced what he wanted to do, said, 'You should scream bloody murder,"' Mr. Woodward recalled in an interview. "Those were his words, and we did."
 In other words, the governor was putting on a bit of theater of his own, expressing outrage at the cuts the budget crisis was forcing him to perform, and urging his friends to protest.
 But was it theater of the real, or a sham? The guessing here back then was that it was a fix, that the governor would use the outcry to reluctantly enact the new taxes he wanted all along so as to preserve a vital part of the state's cultural life. But the people who lived through those days say that outcome was far from a certain.
 "I don't think it was a given that we were going to get it restored," Mr. Woodward said. "If you look around the country, in states like Florida and Colorado and others, you'll find any number of places where the arts have been cut to nothing because of budget problems."
 Joe Roberts, the Assembly majority leader, said the same.
 "You probably could have concluded that it would not have been zeroed out, $18 million to zero, and there certainly was an element of the governor trying to mobilize the arts community to appeal to the Legislature," Mr. Roberts said in an interview. "He admitted as much. But even after the marches on Trenton and a lot of focus on this issue," he went on, Mr. McGreevey considered easing the cut, spending no more than $9 million on the arts. In fact, Mr. Roberts said, the $9 million that the governor was contemplating would have been shared by arts groups as well as historical organizations that now receive about $10 million from the state. 
 Budget time is always the season of marches on Trenton, but the arts people wouldn't be arts people if they didn't know how to put on a show. Tony Randall, Eric Bogosian and other marquee names guaranteed plenty of news coverage, and you could hardly attend the theater, go to an opening or visit a museum in New Jersey all spring without hearing or reading an appeal to call your legislator and demand more money for the arts.
 In the end, the arts got what they wanted and more: a dedicated piece of the new state hotel and motel tax that restores their money and that will increase next year as the tax kicks in. With their financing restored and a secure line in the budget, at least until a more powerful constituency poaches it, Mr. Woodward and the rest of the arts community are too relieved and too grateful to say anything bad about the governor's budget brinkmanship.
 "The last five months have been incredibly disruptive in cultural institutions, both in the time needed to restore funding and the distractions of not knowing what we were going to receive," Mr. Woodward said. "So I can't say that it been an easy period of time." 
 "But that said," he added, "I understand this has been a tough time economically, and I hope with the tax in place, things will be easier next year."

HEADLINE: Judge Orders Lower Flow On the Missouri 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
A federal judge today ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to consider environmental issues more fully when it makes decisions about water flow for the Missouri River that could threaten the region's most endangered wildlife. 
 The judge, Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court here, granted an injunction sought by several environmental groups that have filed a lawsuit against the corps, which manages the river's dam and reservoir system. The groups say high water flows in parts of the river in the summer cause nesting and breeding problems for at least two species of birds and one type of fish. 
 Under federal law, the corps' actions cannot jeopardize endangered or threatened wildlife. The environmental groups want the plan to include a component that will require low flows in the summer. Judge Kessler's injunction prohibits the corps from putting a plan into effect without such a component.
Tim Searchinger, a lawyer for Environmental Defense, one of the plaintiffs in the case, described the court order as a "prelude" to the river operating in a more natural state. Beginning Tuesday, Mr. Searchinger said, the corps will be required to lower water flows on the river for six weeks.
He acknowledged that low water levels would probably have a negative economic effect, especially on barges on the Missouri. The effects might be especially significant in Nebraska and Missouri, and may include higher electrical costs. 
Carol Sanders, a spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers, said the case was "another example of the conflicts that we face in the future regarding the nation's scarce water resources." 
Ms. Sanders added, "In the corps's operation in the Missouri, we've always tried to address the needs of wildlife and our navigation and reservoir users, and of course to comply with the law."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: In Manhattan by the End of 2005; 
14 New Hotels Are Planned

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The sag in tourism notwithstanding, developers are planning to establish 14 new hotels in Manhattan by the end of 2005 that will add 2,338 rooms to the 63,600 currently available, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm.
 Five of the new hotels will be limited-service operations flying such flags as Doubletree and Hampton Inn in contrast to the high-end boutique and large-scale hotels that were most common in recent years, according to the report. 
 In the last five years, 53 hotels opened or were extensively refurbished in Manhattan. Of these, 17 were boutiques, with planned rates as much as $400 a night, and five were large-scale, with more than 500 guest rooms.
"Continued interest in building hotels in Manhattan reflects the optimism of market participants and the sustained faith in the New York City economy," said Sean Hennessey, director of the firm's hospitality and leisure practice in the metropolitan area.
Hotel developers are also seeking locations outside the Midtown and Downtown business cores, according to the report. A 115-room hotel to be called Surface is being built at 107 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side and is scheduled to open later this year. And on the Upper East Side, a Courtyard by Marriott, with 226 rooms, is planned for East 92nd Street. JOHN HOLUSHA

HEADLINE: Investing; 
In DevelopingCountries, Prices May Be Right

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
INVESTMENTS can be popular or cheap, but rarely both. Emerging markets today are one of the exceptions, in the view of many portfolio managers.
 Professional investors around the world are heavily invested in the stock markets of developing countries. Forty-six percent of portfolio managers polled by Merrill Lynch in early June said they were overweight in emerging markets, meaning that they had a higher portion of their portfolios in these markets than would be suggested by a benchmark global index; 13 percent said they were underweight, while the remainder said their portfolio weighting was neutral. 
 The relatively large sums flowing into developing markets have helped them produce better returns than in larger ones. The global index of emerging markets compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International returned 15.9 percent this year through June, compared with an 11.1 percent return for developed markets. 
Latching on to a hot investment sector can be dangerous, but advocates of emerging markets say that even after considering their strong performance this year, shares in these markets still look less expensive than those in developed countries.
"They are cheap on a number of measures relative to their own history, relative to developed markets and on an absolute basis," said David Gait, a senior analyst specializing in emerging markets in the Edinburgh office of First State Investments, a fund management firm. "It's not uncommon to find good-quality companies trading on single-digit price-earnings ratios, with double-digit growth rates and good and growing yields."
Many of those companies are traded on American markets. Others can be bought only on local markets through global brokerage houses. Alternative investment routes include traditional mutual funds -- Morningstar has 163 in its database that focus on emerging markets -- and closed-end funds, which often trade at a discount to their underlying asset values. Some funds concentrate on single countries, others on regions or on emerging markets worldwide. In addition, there are many exchange-traded index funds, some focused on a broad range of emerging markets, and others on smaller geographic slices.
Sam Mahtani, who runs an emerging markets fund for F&C Management in London, said that based on estimated 2003 earnings, developing markets over all have been trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 10, roughly half that of the American market. "That's a significant discount," he said, "but where it gets more interesting is when you look at returns on equity."
The typical publicly traded company in the developing world returns about 15 cents a year for every dollar of equity, he said. That is about the same as American companies, but by this measure, developing and developed markets have been heading in opposite directions. After the crisis of the late 1990's, when emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere experienced declining economies, currencies and share prices, their returns sank. In August 1998, Mr. Mahtani said, the returns on equity in the developing world were 7 percent, compared with more than 20 percent in the United States.
"The crisis forced policy responses from governments and the corporate sector because balance sheets were really bad," Mr. Mahtani said. "That has led to significant increases in profitability and shareholder returns." Many American companies, meanwhile, are beset by sluggish growth and excess capacity in many industries.
Mr. Mahtani acknowledged that shares in emerging markets often trade at lower price-earnings ratios than those in developed markets, but said that the present gap was excessive, especially considering the progress made since the slump of the 1990's.
"We feel such a huge discount is unwarranted given the significant change in corporate and government balance sheets since the Asia crisis," he said. "We do feel that emerging markets should trade at a discount to developed, but we feel a level of around 14 times earnings is more appropriate."
Growth in emerging markets has been aided by the decline of the dollar. "For many countries a weak dollar will help them to give a bit of internal stimulus to their economies, particularly to commodity exporters with U.S. dollar debt," he said.
Asia is a favored destination for fund managers. Mr. Mahtani prefers burgeoning consumer markets like India and South Korea. One of his fund's larger holdings is Reliance Industries, a diversified Indian holding company with extensive business in petrochemicals, a sector he likes. Another Indian company he owns is Ranbaxy Laboratories, a maker of generic drugs.
In Korea, which accounts for 21 percent of the fund's assets, the largest of any country, holdings include Kookmin Bank and SK Telecom. Both trade in the United States.
A European companyMr. Mahtani cited is Telekomunikacja Polska, the main Polish phone company. "We're finding a lot of value in fixed-line incumbents," he said.
Hugh Young, head of global equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, expressed interest in an eclectic range of stocks. Among his preferred Asian investments are Samsung Electronics in Korea, which makes computer chips and electrical appliances; PetroChina, the Chinese national oil company; GAIL, a natural-gas company in India; Hyundai Motor in Korea; and China Mobile (Hong Kong), the subsidiary of a government-owned Chinese phone company.
Mr. Young's selections in Latin America include Petroleo Brasileiro, the Brazilian national oil company also known as Petrobras; Telefonos de Mexico and Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of British American Tobacco. The stocks he names are "all pretty cheap and leaders in their field." Many of his choices, including China Mobile, PetroChina and Petrobras, trade in the United States.
Mr. Gait looks for companies that have strong management and are industry leaders in the markets where they do business. He mentioned two of Mr. Young's holdings, Samsung Electronics and Petrobras.
Petrobras is "a leader in terms of offshore drilling and exploration," he said. "Its assets are clearly oil," he added. "It generates dollar revenues, so it's insulated from the ebbs and flows of the real and the local economy." (The real is Brazil's currency.) Mr. Gait called the stock a bargain, noting that it trades at half the valuation of similar oil companies in the developed world.
TWO Mexican companies Mr. Gait likes are Coca-Cola Femsa, a Mexican company that bottles Coke products across Latin America, and Grupo Televisa, the country's largest broadcaster. Televisa offers an opportunity to bet on economic recovery, he said, because media companies are more economically sensitive than others. Both stocks have American listings.
Two Indian companies Mr. Gait recommends, each with an American listing, are Infosys Technologies and HDFC Bank. Infosys supplies computer programming to companies in developed markets. Lower salaries in India allow it to compete effectively against Western rivals. While Infosys has been hurt by the downturn in technology spending, Mr. Gait described it as "a shining light in emerging markets, an extremely well-managed company that has done well building up its franchise."
He offered similar praise for HDFC, which he said had strong executives who were "conservative but innovative," a combination that has allowed them to compete effectively against India's inefficient state-run institutions. "When operating a bank in a country like India, the temptation must be to expand too quickly and grab every opportunity you can," he said, "but management has shown the awareness to grow the business at an appropriate pace."
Another selection from the region is John Keells, a Sri Lankan company with interests in beverages, ports and software. Conglomerates are out of favor elsewhere, "but in a place like Sri Lanka, with such a small economy, it probably makes sense to operate with that model," Mr. Gait said. Offering further justification for owning the stock, he declared: "They make the best ginger beer I've ever had."

HEADLINE: FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; 
Playoff or Cook-Off, It All Depends on the Batter

BYLINE:  By Kathryn Shattuck

 BODY:
JACQUES PEPIN, Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, Paul Bocuse, Alain Ducasse: never mind that some of the biggest names in cooking are men's. In Eddie Ogden's household, baseball rules and the only place for a male interest in food is at the receiving end of a fork.
 So when Eddie, a star first baseman whose father happens to be the team coach, trades in his mitt and bat for a spatula and whisk, you can be sure there'll be plenty of heat in the kitchen. 
 "Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off," a Disney Channel Original Movie that has its premiere Friday at 8 p.m., follows the escapades of 14-year-old Eddie as he struggles to keep a lid on his passion for cooking in order to fulfill his father's and schoolmates' expectations. He experiments in the family kitchen under cover of darkness. He feigns disdain for the home economics class that he tricks his friends into taking with him. And when he signs up for the Scholastic Million Dollar Cook-Off and makes the finals -- which take place on the same day as the baseball playoffs -- Eddie must decide: does he follow his head or his heart? 
 "My parents are really supportive of me," said Taylor Ball, who plays Eddie, while talking about the acting career he began at 9 in his hometown, Granbury, Tex., before moving to California where he landed a spot on the CBS sitcom "Still Standing" and representation with the William Morris Agency. Off the set, Taylor rock-climbs, wails on the electric guitar and shoots home videos. On set, he spends his down time being tutored. "It's so much harder than normal school," he said. "First of all, I don't like school to begin with. And I'm a sophomore now, but I don't get to have a real school life with my friends and it is kind of discouraging."
 And even though his culinary skills are limited to cereal and French toast, Taylor does share with his character a passion for Food Network. "My mom and I sit there and watch it all the time," he said. "I watch 'Naked Chef,' Emeril and Bobby Flay."
 So Taylor found it "really, really cool" when he got to work with Mr. Flay, who portrays the million-dollar cook-off's enthusiastic host.
 "This was my first film and it's going to be my last," Mr. Flay said, chuckling at his self-consciousness about playing a scripted version of himself -- though as host of Food Network's "Hot Off the Grill With Bobby Flay" and "FoodNation," he's no stranger to the camera.
 Still, he could relate to Eddie's -- and Taylor's -- plight.
 "I was a pretty poor high school student, and I needed something other than book work," Mr. Flay said. At 17, he took a job in the kitchen at Joe Allen Restaurant in Manhattan, where his father was a partner. Mr. Allen was so impressed by Mr. Flay's natural talent that he paid his tuition to the prestigious French Culinary Institute in Manhattan.
 "It's never too early to start," said Mr. Flay, who recommended that youngsters interested in cooking begin as busboys in restaurants and then apprentice for a month in a kitchen before making a decision. "It's a great life, but it's so much harder than it looks." Kathryn Shattuck

HEADLINE: The Road Ahead in Iraq -- and How to Navigate It 

BYLINE:  By L. Paul Bremer III; L. Paul Bremer III is the top American administrator in Iraq.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
Americans can be proud of the role their fighting men and women played in freeing Iraq of Saddam Hussein and his cronies. The people of Iraq are now on the road to political and economic independence.
 The first official step in this political transition at the national level occurs today, with the convening of the Iraqi Governing Council. This is the latest sign of progress. For the first time in decades, Iraqis are truly free. More than 150 newspapers have been started since liberation. All major cities and 85 percent of towns now have a municipal council where Iraqis are increasingly taking responsibility for management of local matters like health care, water and electricity. 
 Iraqis are speaking out and demonstrating with a vigor borne of 35 years of imposed silence. This is not yet a full democracy, but freedom is on the march, from north to south. Sadly, this progress is despised by a narrow band of opponents. A small minority of bitter-enders -- members of the former regime's instruments of repression -- oppose such freedom. They are joined by foreign terrorists, extreme Islamists influenced by Iran and bands of criminals. These people do not pose a strategic threat to America or to a democratic Iraq. They enjoy no support since their only vision is to reimpose the dictatorship hated by Iraqis. Our military will hunt them down and, as President Bush said, "They will face ruin, just as surely as the regime they once served."
These shadowy figures are killing brave Iraqis working with us, attacking soldiers and civilians, and trying to sabotage the fragile infrastructure. The attacks have drawn concern worldwide. My coalition colleagues and Iraqi friends have noticed that the attacks are often aimed at successes in the renewal of this nation. A week ago, an American soldier was mixing with students at Baghdad University, which reopened on May 17. Their presence was testimony to the educational progress that is blossoming here (public schools have also reopened). But our enemies fear enlightenment, so one of them killed the soldier. 
The day before, 250 Iraqi police recruits graduated, the latest success in re-staffing law enforcement. Tens of thousands of Iraqi policemen are now on duty. But the enemies of freedom correctly felt threatened by the cooperation and professionalism the day represented, so they set off a bomb that killed seven new officers. Before the war, women had to travel miles for propane. Now, local councils are establishing distribution centers that make the gas readily available to households. On June 18, one American soldier was killed while guarding a center. The June 24th explosion at an oil refinery in Barwanah is another example of political sabotage on Iraq's energy supply. 
With these attacks on Iraq's new successes, citizens of coalition nations ask how long we will remain in Iraq -- and some Iraqis may doubt our ability to improve their lives. As President Bush has made clear, we are committed to establishing the conditions for security, prosperity and democracy. America has no designs on Iraq and its wealth. We will finish our job here and stay not one day longer than necessary.
We have a plan to support the establishment of this government of, by and for Iraqis. After months of consultations with Iraqis, we have taken the first step in establishing an interim administration. Today, the Governing Council of Iraq will meet. It represents all the strands from Iraq's complicated social structure -- Shiites, Sunnis, Arabs, Kurds, men and women, Christians and Turkmens. The council will immediately exercise real political power, appointing interim ministers and working with the coalition on policy and budgets.
At the same time, the council will establish procedures to write Iraq's new constitution. Once it is ratified by the people, elections can be held and a sovereign Iraqi government will come into being. So the question of how long the coalition will stay in Iraq depends in part on how quickly the Iraqi people can write and approve a constitution. 
The coalition recognizes the urgency of marrying economic well-being to political freedom. For 35 years, the country's assets were misappropriated or stolen. We are pouring resources into re-establishing basic services and creating jobs. Our economic reform plan will entail a major shift of capital from the value-destroying state sector to private firms. We are also creating a social safety net for any resulting disruptions. And we believe that a method should be found to assure that every citizen benefits from Iraq's oil wealth. One possibility would be to pay social benefits from a trust financed by oil revenues. Another could be to pay an annual cash dividend directly to each citizen from that trust. 
In all this, the coalition is working closely with Iraqis who will eventually be responsible for their country's well-being. For our three priorities -- security, politics and the economy -- the strategy provides for the successful transition to a stable and reformed Iraq. This does not mean that the road ahead is without danger. The combination of a broken infrastructure and acts of sabotage could mean a rough summer. We will suffer casualties, as the bitter-enders resort to violence. We are also braced for an increase in terrorism by non-Iraqis, but no one should doubt our determination to use our power in the face of violent acts.
Once our work is over, the reward will be great: a free, democratic and independent Iraq that stands not as a threat to its neighbors or the world, but as a beacon of freedom and justice.

HEADLINE: Near End of His Africa Trip, Bush Focuses on Liberia 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, July 12 

 BODY:
President Bush held talks today with Nigeria's leader on how to bring peace and stability to Liberia as the United States moved toward a decision about whether to send peacekeeping troops there.
 Wrapping up his swing through Africa, the president met with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who updated Mr. Bush on the Nigerian effort to persuade President Charles Taylor of Liberia to step down. Mr. Obasanjo has played a leading role in an American-backed plan to pressure Mr. Taylor to quit and to pave the way for a cease-fire in a civil war that has ravaged Liberia and destabilized its neighbors. 
 A senior American official said Mr. Obasanjo had told Mr. Bush that Mr. Taylor was negotiating the terms of the proposal for him to come to Nigeria. The official said Mr. Taylor's primary concern was bringing his family with him.
The official said Mr. Bush and Mr. Obasanjo did not discuss whether Mr. Taylor would receive immunity from the war crimes charges lodged against him by a United Nations-backed court in neighboring Sierra Leone. Nigeria does not have an extradition law that would force Mr. Taylor to go to Sierra Leone to face the charges, which stem from accusations about his part in brutal factional fighting in Sierra Leone.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly called for Mr. Taylor to step down, and has said the United States will play a role in peacekeeping efforts being led by a group of West African nations. He has left open the possibility that the United States would send troops to Liberia, but he has not yet made a decision.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said this week that Mr. Bush might make a decision within a few days. Mr. Bush is to discuss Liberia at a meeting on Monday in Washington with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan. He is also scheduled to receive reports from two military teams sent to the region to assess what role the United States should play.
Asked by a reporter today if he would make a decision in the coming week, Mr. Bush replied, "I'm not sure yet when."
Mr. Bush also used his stop in Nigeria, the fifth and final nation on his first tour of Africa as president, to promote his proposal to spend $15 billion over the next five years to help some of the world's poorest countries combat AIDS.
As he has on nearly every day of the trip, Mr. Bush, who has made holding down federal spending on nearly all nonmilitary programs a cornerstone of his agenda, pledged not to let Congress reduce the budget for his AIDS plan.
"The House of Representatives and the United States Senate must fully fund this initiative, for the good of the people on this continent of Africa," Mr. Bush said in a speech.
With a group of AIDS officials at a hospital here, he was more direct. "We have talked and now it's time to write the check," Mr. Bush said "We're in the process of debating the appropriation process. I'm confident this trip will provide the impetus to appropriate the funds."
But there has been considerable confusion in Congress and among groups advocating more money for AIDS programs about what Mr. Bush considers full financing for the program. Mr. Bush originally requested $2 billion for the coming year, with the idea that financing would increase in future years so that $15 billion would be spent over five years. But legislation that Mr. Bush signed this spring called for $3 billion for next year, a level that advocacy groups said the White House needed to honor.
This week a House subcommittee moved to appropriate $2 billion for the coming year. A senior White House official said Mr. Bush was happy with that figure, although he still wanted to remove some restrictions in the legislation on how the money could be used.
"In the first year it's going to take less money to get the job done than in the out years," the official said.
Mr. Bush's visit underscored Nigeria's progress in developing a democratic government and reducing its AIDS rate, and -- perhaps most of all -- highlighted its growing importance as a source of oil. Its status as one of the world's fastest-growing oil-and-gas producers guarantees it regular attention from Washington.
In the past, much of Nigeria's oil wealth has been siphoned off by corrupt government and private-sector officials. But Mr. Obasanjo has tried to crack down on corruption, a point he emphasized to Mr. Bush today.
An administration official said Mr. Bush suggested to Mr. Obasanjo that Nigeria use its energy wealth to plan for a future in which it would be a bigger part of the world economy. Mr. Bush, the official said, told Mr. Obasanjo that Africa's economic future was not in textiles, a major industry here and in many other African countries, because it faced increased competition from other low-cost producers like China.
Instead, Mr. Bush said, Nigeria should develop a high-tech sector.
About two-thirds of Nigerians live below the poverty line.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE OVERSEER; 
Overseer Adjusts Strategy As Turmoil Grows in Iraq

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 12 

 BODY:
L. Paul Bremer III rises at 5 a.m. in his modest residence in a white, air-conditioned trailer that overlooks the Tigris River -- if you don't count the portable toilets that partly block the view.
 Most days, he jogs around the once splendid gardens of Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace, behind which his trailer is perched, and is at his desk inside the marbled halls an hour later wearing a suit and Army-issue combat boots. 
 When he moves out beyond the palace walls, now girded by an endless helix of razor wire, he has around-the-clock protection from a force of former Navy Seals and Army guards. Most Iraqis know very little about him except that he is whisked through their streets sandwiched between machine gunners in a convoy and that he appears on television with a fresh kerchief in his pocket and those size 10 1/2 desert boots, which he even wore to the World Economic Forum in Jordan last month. ("I thought he had forgotten to change," a Western colleague commented.) 
In the dust of Iraq, the boots, Mr. Bremer says, are an attempt to spare his dress shoes. But they also signify that he is engaged in managerial combat.
For Mr. Bremer, the 61-year-old occupation administrator of Iraq, the daunting problems of the most complex and expensive nation-building tasks the United States has undertaken in a half-century have only intensified since President Bush appointed him on May 6.
The economy remains devastated and moribund. Electricity supplies to the capital are failing. Guerrilla attacks on American troops are increasing. Mr. Hussein has returned as a disembodied voice on audiotape exhorting his followers to rebellion and sabotage.
Mr. Bremer's notion that he could run Iraq on the strength of decisive and firm management policies has given way, a number of Western and Iraqi officials say, to the realization that he desperately needs an Iraqi governing body to share responsibility -- or blame -- for the long-term task of establishing postwar order and stability.
"There has been a process of coming down to earth," said Hoshyar Zebari, the affable policy aide to the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani.
When Mr. Bremer arrived in Baghdad on May 12, he inherited a landscape of collapsed government, burned-out ministries, looted universities and commercial centers and police and security forces that had fled or abandoned their posts.
The devastation had overwhelmed the first wave of diplomats, civilian aid workers and military personnel working under Jay M. Garner, a retired lieutenant general. General Garner was the reconstruction administrator selected by Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the overall commander of allied forces during the war.
"They told us to bring two suits," said one of General Garner's former aides. "We thought we would be walking into functioning ministries, that we would fire the Baathists in the top jobs, and get the trains running again in a couple of months." It was not to be. 
But when Mr. Bremer arrived with a personal mandate from Mr. Bush and an "I'm-in-charge" message, he conveyed a sense that the mayhem would soon be over. On his desk in the elegant wood-paneled study he appropriated from the Iraqi dictator, Mr. Bremer planted a hand-carved motto: "Success has a thousand fathers," an admonition for teamwork and an implicit rejection of the second line of the aphorism that failure is an orphan. 
"There won't be any failure," he said.
In selecting Mr. Bremer for the job of winning the peace in a country that has known only iron-fisted totalitarian rule for a quarter-century, Mr. Bush settled on the candidate who appears, up to now, to have straddled the ideological divide between the State Department and Pentagon over the kind of crisis management needed to protect the allied victory here.
To Pentagon conservatives, Mr. Bremer has strong credentials as the tough counterterrorism chief in the Reagan administration and as a longtime protege of Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state. With Mr. Bremer's 23-year career as a diplomat, his conservatism is leavened with a strong pragmatic instinct. 
"As forceful as he is, he certainly is not dogmatic," said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations special representative in Baghdad. 
Barham Salih, a senior aide to another Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, said: "He came with some very definite ideas on what needed to be done," adding that Mr. Bremer "believed that Iraq needed to be rebuilt along free-market principles."
Mr. Salih said Mr. Bremer initially resisted a more nuanced assessment. 
"I told him that Iraq is a welfare state and its government is dependent on oil revenues and the people have gotten used to be given handouts," Mr. Salih said. "I told him it would be disastrous policy if he is thinking of ending the welfare state overnight."
Mr. Bremer accepted part of this advice. He protected the food aid operation on which 60 percent of Iraqis rely for sustenance, and he accelerated the distribution of subsidies and salaries to Iraqi civil servants, most of whom are still sitting at home.
But he took a cleaver to the salaries of the defeated Iraqi Army, enraging thousands of military men who had obeyed the leaflets that American planes dropped urging them not to fight for Mr. Hussein. 
The onset of guerrilla-style attacks on American convoys in May and weeks of demonstrations by disgruntled officers that culminated in violence prodded him to reconsider. He agreed to pay back wages and reinstitute salary payments to the officer corps. Enlisted soldiers got severance payments.
"In retrospect, we probably should have gotten to that decision faster," Mr. Bremer said in an interview. "And it certainly was the case that our military commanders made the case that these people were threatening our coalition forces."
He has since extended the same subsidies to Mr. Hussein's most ardent propagandists, the staff of the Ministry of Information whose chief, Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, so cluelessly informed the world that American forces were committing suicide at the gates of Baghdad. 
The adjustments, Mr. Bremer explained, were "tactical."
"I think I said at my first press conference that I expected we would be calling a lot of audibles," he said, using the football term for calling plays from the line of scrimmage. "But our strategy hasn't changed."
Part of that strategy, he says, has been "to get real political responsibility in the hands of a representative group of Iraqis." 
Yet it has not always seemed that way to the Iraqi political figures and former opposition leaders. From the day Mr. Bremer arrived, one of his staff members said, he disparaged the former Iraqi opposition leaders -- the people General Garner had implored to come to Baghdad to form a provisional government -- as "disorganized," unable to work together and not competent to run a country.
Mr. Bremer's change in tack came as the Bush administration was seeking to win the backing of the United Nations Security Council to lift sanctions against Iraq, unfreeze assets and begin pumping oil to pay for national reconstruction. But it also came as alarms were sounding that Iran was exploiting the chaos in Iraq and was seeking a political foothold in Baghdad through the Shiite religious leaders in the Iraqi opposition. 
Mr. Bremer had quickly jettisoned the provisional government idea, telling Iraqi political figures that they were not representative of the Iraqi people. Later, he announced a new plan to appoint an advisory "political council" of 25 to 35 Iraqis. It could nominate, it could suggest, it could consult, Mr. Bremer said, but he would make the decisions.
Iraqi political figures accused Mr. Bremer of "retracting" General Garner's promises, and one said it seemed as if he were looking for "35 lackeys." 
Thus began the two months of political wrangling that brought Mr. Bremer and the former Iraqi opposition leaders to this point: ready to announce the formation of a "governing council" that Mr. Bremer has pledged will have extensive executive powers to hire and fire ministers, draft and approve a budget and send diplomats abroad. 
Mr. Bremer says now that he cannot recall using the term "advisory" in his original formulation. "I don't think the original concept has changed very fundamentally," he said in the interview. "We did change the name, and I think that was an important symbolic change that many Iraqis are very pleased with."
Mr. Vieira de Mello, the United Nations representative who has mediated between Mr. Bremer and the Iraqi political groups, said that in private, Mr. Bremer had shown a pragmatic streak in moderating his views as it became increasingly clear that he could not govern Iraq alone.
To the Iraqi political groups, especially the Shiite leaders mistrustful of Mr. Bremer, Mr. Vieira de Mello has delivered a different message: "I have urged them to take more power once they become a coherent body because Bremer will not be able to stop them."
Thus the conflict over the governance of postwar Iraq may be only beginning. There is a constitution to draft and elections to prepare for.
"I am here until I can pass full responsibility to a fully sovereign Iraqi government," Mr. Bremer said.
But no one, including Mr. Bremer, knows how long that will take.

Yes, Let the Waves Swallow the Stone Pony

BYLINE:  By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
SOME well-intentioned folks gathered on the beach in Belmar the other day to make their annual pitch for people to be more considerate of our east-side neighbor, the ocean. Nothing wrong with that. But boy did they miss an opportunity to make a major splash, as it were, one that would gain international recognition for their cause and would also rid us of a rock-'n'-roll albatross.
 The occasion was a news conference held by Clean Ocean Action, the advocacy group, which every year at beachgoing time tries to get people to stop treating the ocean like a giant toilet/garbage can. It was a hot day and the group promised to have a few dignitaries on hand to drive home its points. 
 There's nothing I like better than seeing dignitaries in sweat-inducing suits standing on the beach in the blazing sun, so I rushed right over. I wasn't disappointed. The scene looked like a party whose invitations were unclear, some guests turning up in black tie, some in backyard casual. Among the suit-wearers was Senator Jon Corzine; the locals, including Belmar's mayor, Kenneth E. Pringle, were in shorts. 
 They all had important things to say about the ocean. At least, I think they did. Most of it was inaudible because, frankly, the beach in Belmar is a poor place to hold a news conference, what with the noise from the traffic on Ocean Avenue on one side, the frolicking beachgoers on the other, and the advertising-banner-towing planes overhead. 
 Anyway, everyone seemed eager to support Clean Ocean Action's "10 Tips" campaign, which consists of brightly colored cards that list simple things people can do to reduce pollution -- a yellow card with "10 Tips for the Beach," a blue one with "10 Tips for Boaters," and so on.
 The tips are not exactly of eureka caliber. They are "Don't litter" and "Never discharge raw sewage into the water" and similar no-brainers.
 "These things are simple, but people forget about them," Mr. Corzine said during a lull in the background cacophony. 
 Clean Ocean Action will have volunteers at Monmouth and Ocean County beaches throughout the summer offering the tip cards and other literature; with any luck the stuff won't turn up as litter itself, the way advertising fliers do on New York sidewalks. 
 The 10 Tips campaign is laudable in a lightweight sort of way, but Mr. Corzine and the other speakers also had bigger things on their minds. They talked about ocean dumping, still troublesome after all these years.
 They talked about the economic role the ocean plays in our state, and how it can play that role only if it isn't a cesspool. They talked about the latest worry, the revived prospect of ocean drilling.
 It was all commendable, heartfelt; might even get a few people to change some bad habits or laws. And the ocean (assuming it could hear better than I could) may be moderately pleased at the good intentions voiced. But the ocean may also be thinking: "That's it? Persuading a few people to stop tossing cigarette butts into the sand is the only compensation you're offering for the centuries' worth of abuse you've been dishing my way?" 
 Which is why, in addition to the small gestures on those colorful tip cards, we need a big gesture, something to show the ocean not only that we respect it and value it, but that we fear it and abjectly apologize for our past wrongs. Happily, a perfect candidate for such a gesture emerged just a few days before the Belmar news conference, and a few miles up the coast: the Stone Pony.
 That's right, I'm arguing that we should offer the Stone Pony as our apology to the ocean -- in the process getting rid of a building that we should have gotten rid of years ago. The Stone Pony, the club in Asbury Park where some bands once played that later went on to much bigger things, has stumbled back into the news for the zillionth time because it's being sold, or moved, or something -- who the heck can follow this increasingly pathetic tale anymore? 
 Certain stuck-in-the-past factions are treating this building as if it ranks with the Parthenon. It's embarrassing. Let's end it.
 Let's put the venerable S.P. on a barge, tow it about half a mile offshore and set it on fire, like a Viking funeral ship. Imagine the crowds on the beach to watch. Imagine the TV rights. Imagine the fund-raising concert. Imagine all the proceeds going to ocean cleanup and protection. Then the ocean will know that at least we messy humans are trying.

Re "How a Seed-Money Loan of $60 Turned Melanie Pico Into an Entrepreneur," by Andres Martinez (Editorial Observer, July 8): 
 There are so many good things about microfinancing that it's hard to know where to begin praising the programs. Increased self-respect for women, greater economic self-sufficiency for the family and improved business skills are all signs of healthy growth for a family. 
 The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh uses a simple means for women to dramatize their self-respect: when a woman finishes her transaction at the teller's window, she and the bank official salute each other, a sign that the transaction takes place between equals. 
Microfinance programs abroad, as well as domestic ones, deserve financial support from Congress.

HEADLINE: Fujimori May Be Disgraced, but to Many in Peru He Looks Good in Comparison 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 13 

 BODY:
Like many Peruvians, Martha Blas says she is tired of President Alejandro Toledo and contends that he has done little for ordinary people. She offers a surprising solution: bring back the country's thoroughly disgraced former president, Alberto K. Fujimori. 
 Mr. Fujimori has lived in exile in Japan since 2000, when his government collapsed in a corruption scandal. Peru's current government would like to see him return, too, but for an altogether different reason: to try him on charges ranging from embezzlement to treason. 
 But no matter. Ms. Blas, a 30-year-old mother of two who works in a government-subsidized soup kitchen, said the accusations against Mr. Fujimori were "political."
She dismissed the repression that characterized his 10-year rule, and recalled the former president as strong and decisive. In contrast, she said, Mr. Toledo is weak, disorganized and leading Peru toward calamity. 
"With Fujimori, we had many things because he supported us," Ms. Blas said. "We are waiting for him to come back."
Whipsawed by protests and personal scandal, Mr. Toledo's approval rating has fallen to a dismal 11 percent from nearly 60 percent shortly after his election in 2001. 
At the same time, political analysts note that while Mr. Fujimori has a lower approval rating than other opposition figures and is viewed by many here and in Washington as a corrupt strongman who hijacked democracy, he still receives more popular backing than Mr. Toledo in opinion polls. 
"He's at fairly high levels, quite good for someone who is in that type of political and legal situation," said Guillermo Loli, a pollster at Apoyo, a Lima-based polling firm. "This is a guy with 52 accusations against him. That's incredible." 
Every week, Mr. Fujimori's supporters, an eclectic mix that includes day laborers as well as some former members of Congress and publicists, meet in a newly rented office covered with pictures of the former president. They run newspapers, including one called Fuji News, trumpeting the accomplishments of the Fujimori government, which they say fixed a broken economy and brought to heel two rebel groups. 
At a recent session, more than 100 of these supporters gathered and listened to one speaker after another hail Mr. Fujimori and demonize Mr. Toledo. Then they erupted in a chant, "We feel it, we feel it, Fujimori as president!" 
Hoping to shore up his own support, Mr. Toledo has just replaced six cabinet ministers and appointed Beatriz Merino, a Harvard-educated tax specialist, to be his new prime minister. But the president still has been unable to win over Peruvians, despite the country's strong economic growth, which, at 5 percent, was the highest in the region last year. 
Most Peruvians instead believe that the Toledo government has failed to deliver on promises of a better life. With criticism coming even from Mr. Toledo's own party, many Peruvians, as well as political analysts, speculate that the president may not finish out his five-year term. 
With the help of his determined group of allies, Mr. Fujimori, 64, has long been trying to orchestrate a possible political resurrection. On his Web site, albertofujimori.org, and in recent interviews, including one with The New York Times in March, he has said that one day he intends to return to lead this troubled Andean nation of 26 million people once again. 
"He's planned to come back to Peru from the moment he landed in Tokyo," said Carlos Raffo, a spokesman for Mr. Fujimori in Lima. "I go to Tokyo and he says, 'We're going to work for a plan of return.' "
Even in Peru there is a precedent for such a long shot, analystsnote. Alan Garcia, whose five-year presidency in the 1980's was marked by hyperinflation and corruption so widespread that it forced his own exile, returned in time to run for president in 2001, and barely lost. He is now Peru's leading opposition figure, with an Apoyo poll in April giving him 42 percent support. 
What would make Mr. Fujimori's return difficult, however, is that even his supporters acknowledge that he would almost certainly face charges of corruption and other offenses.
Indeed, if Mr. Toledo's government has its way, Mr. Fujimori would return -- but to face those charges. The government is preparing a 700-page extradition request. But Japan and Peru do not have an extradition treaty, and Tokyo has made it clear that any such request would not be honored. In Japan, Mr. Fujimori has virtual immunity; he is a citizen there, by virtue of his parents' Japanese birth. 
The fact that even a small but vocal group of supporters is actively working for Mr. Fujimori's return to government worries human rights officials and other Peruvians mindful that, while president, he abolished Congress, ran an intrusive secret police force, and set up secret courts with hooded judges that wrongly convicted hundreds of Peruvians. 
There is also some concern about Mr. Fujimori's ability to stir trouble from abroad in Peru, where the tentacles of his security apparatus once permeated virtually all of society. Government officials here charge that Mr. Fujimori and his operatives have tried to destabilize the current government through a sophisticated media campaign aimed at distorting the blemishes of Mr. Toledo's administration, an accusation Mr. Fujimori's allies reject. 
"It's so troubling that some Peruvians seem to have a very short memory of somebody like Fujimori," Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said from Washington. "He was the head of a government that corrupted basically all the institutions of state through bribery and intimidation." 
How much Mr. Fujimori actually steers his admirers' activities from abroad is unclear, though high-level supporters are in constant contact with the former president. Obed Bernuy, 39, a rank-and-file supporter and a shopkeeper who warmly calls Mr. Fujimori "El Chino," a reference to his Asian ancestry, has eagerly put up posters of Mr. Fujimori across Lima.
"El Chino contacts us and tells us what to do," Mr. Bernuy explained. "We then go out and do it." 
For now, however, the former president seems mostly limited to using his Web site to send long-distance political missives, leveling charges against the beleaguered Mr. Toledo, whose supporters angrily say that Mr. Fujimori has no moral standing to criticize Peru's current leader. 
The political messages, while bothersome to the Toledo government, are just as often merely playful. 
In a Mother's Day message, Mr. Fujimori told Peruvians, "Good night, and a big hug from Tokyo." More recently, he promised, "See you soon!"

HEADLINE: Eliminating Options at Microsoft 

 BODY:
The news from Redmond, Wash., is not good for anyone still hoping for a return of the financially exuberant 1990's. Microsoft, the software giant that minted hundreds of millionaires by doling out stock options to a generation of employees who happened to be at the right place at the right time, will no longer grant stock options.
 The move reflects a change in business culture as well as the evolution of an iconic American corporation. There is nothing inherently wrong about rewarding employees with options -- a form of compensation that is dependent on a company's future success. Many corporations, including The New York Times Company, have stock option plans, and options will likely remain an important fixture of Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial culture. 
 Options, however, have lost some of their luster because in the mania of the late-1990's financial bubble, they were sometimes abused. Some corporations relied on them excessively as a form of compensation, a practice that in some cases led to creative accounting. Some executives sought to manipulate quarterly earnings to cash out their options at a favorable price, with little regard for the long-term welfare of their company. They were also able to load up on options because accounting rules allowed them to be treated as though they were cost free and needn't be expensed. 
As some companies review their practices, regulators should be tightening accounting rules and corporate governance standards to prevent the misuse of options. A new Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring shareholder approval for any stock option awards is one welcome reform. 
For Microsoft, the decision to move from options to restricted stock awards -- whereby employees are granted shares outright rather than the option to buy shares in the future at a predetermined price -- also signals a recognition that the company's days of exponential growth may be coming to an end. Bill Gates's software giant has become to the information age what General Motors was to the industrial age, a stable proxy for a vital economic sector. 
As at other high-flying tech companies that have become healthy if stolid middle-aged entities, Microsoft's old stock option plan had become culturally divisive, separating employees hired in the gold rush years from more recent hires. A move to restricted stock awards is meant to create a more equitable environment.
Microsoft says that managers will be awarded shares only if they meet certain performance targets. That is the right approach. The last thing shareholders want to see is for companies to replace tarnished option plans with another form of compensation that top executives then turn around and misuse.

HEADLINE: European Welfare Farmers 

 BODY:
The European Union recently took a small, grudging step toward reforming its farm-subsidy policies that undermine the global trading system and cheat farmers in the underdeveloped world. The one advantage of the move is that it amounts to a welcome admission that the status quo can no longer be justified. It should also serve to spur some changes in the United States and Japan as World Trade Organization members negotiate a further liberalization of trade. 
 Under the new changes, farmers will no longer always be able to greatly increase their subsidies by growing more food. In addition, subsidies to the largest farms will be diverted to "rural development projects," and payments to farmers will depend partly on environmental criteria. All well and good, but far too little. European leaders will need to offer more concessions in coming months -- the W.T.O.'s September meeting in Cancun, Mexico, would be a good time -- if overhaul of its venerable "common agricultural policy" is to mean much for struggling farmers in poorer countries. 
 Europe, the United States and Japan have aggressively sought to lower barriers to the flow of manufactured goods and services, and succeeded in forcing onto the trade agenda issues important to them, like foreign investor rights and intellectual property protection. Yet the rich world's reluctance to dismantle market-distorting agricultural policies, like tariffs and subsidies, betrays an unwillingness to make the sacrifices that poorer nations, with less negotiating leverage, have been asked to make in the name of economic orthodoxy.
Tellingly, the reform announced recently by European agricultural ministers does not address export subsidies. Nor does it cut the overall amount of farm aid the European Union doles out, a staggering $49 billion a year. Price guarantees for certain commodities also remain in place.
While the changes made have some value, it is unfortunate that the European Commission's initial proposal was watered down to meet French objections. The commission had sought to assist farmers without giving any incentives to produce wasteful surpluses, which drive down commodity prices for farmers elsewhere in the world. Such surpluses are often "dumped" in foreign markets with devastating consequences for farmers in poorer countries who have no government support.
These issues will only gain in prominence as the Cancun meeting nears, and sensible European leaders know full well they must offer further reforms of their agricultural policies. The only question is whether they can do so before much of the world gives up hope that the World Trade Organization offers a trading system that is fair to all.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: VOICES; 
Hope Mingles With Doubt On the Streets of Baghdad

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 13 

 BODY:
Farouk Muhammad and Nafaa al-Khafaji, both 55, with weathered faces, live in busy Baghdad neighborhoods. They both believe that the new Iraqi Governing Council will be heavily influenced by its American overseers.
 But their agreement stops there. 
 Mr. Muhammad, a retired soldier who lives in Adhimiya, an old and conservative Sunni district where American troops have been attacked, describes the Council's 25 members mostly as compliant frontmen installed by the Americans. 
"All these people, they don't represent the people. They don't have credibility," Mr. Muhammad said. "They won't have any real authority as long as they represent the occupying authority. The Americans came here to liberate, and what do we get? No electricity, no services. They haven't done anything good for the country."
Mr. Khafaji, a mechanic who lives in the prosperous Karada district, an ethnically mixed neighborhood that is heavy with Shiites, says the Council will pave the way toward a better life for all Iraqis. He says he is depending on American officials to strongly supervise the new government.
"We hope the Americans have a lot of influence," he said, adding that the newly appointed Council members "don't have so much experience." With the guiding hand of the Americans, he said, "They should get jobs for the people and provide electricity."
After the Council's first meeting today, interviews with many Baghdad residents echoed the two men's views, with those in Mr. Khafaji's neighborhood offering a much more confident view of American involvement.
But several common themes emerged in each neighborhood, among Sunnis and Shiites as well as critics and supporters of the new Council.
There was agreement, for example, that the Council will be able to extract more power from the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority if it can hang together as a unified body and avoid fissures among the varied political, ethnic and religious factions represented on the panel.
Asked about the Council's makeup, a number of people said they were impressed with Adnan Pachachi, who served as foreign minister before Saddam Hussein took power and is now leader of the Iraqi Independent Democrats and viewed with trust by a wide range of Iraqi groups.
Even those who sharply criticized the Council and the way it was selected nevertheless expressed optimism that it would rejuvenate the country's devastated economy and dilapidated social services.
A typical view in Adhimiya was shared by Hussam al-Adhami, a 50-year-old businessman. "These people really don't represent a true mix of Iraqi society," he said. "If they were going to make a Council that represents all of Iraq, they should have done a census. This is some sort of reality forced upon us -- and reality and what should happen are two different things."
Yet Mr. Adhami conceded that many Iraqis may embrace the new government if it can simply demonstrate some ability to bring the country out of its chaos. "The Iraqi people will agree because they want security," he said. "The wheel of life should start again."
Hamid Mahmoud, 50, declared: "What do you expect me to think about the new government? It's just a tool for the Americans." Many of the Council members, he complained, "were raised abroad. They're not capable of running a country." Yet he praised Mr. Pachachi as a trusted consensus figure. "He's good," Mr. Mahmoud said.
Mr. Pachachi, a Sunni Muslim who in recent weeks has been visiting Shiite neighborhoods and mosques, also has admirers in the Karada district. Wael al-Rubai, 34, a Shiite and electrical technician, said he has difficulty trusting the 12 Council members who are not Shiites. But of Mr. Pachachi, he said, "We trust him and I hope he will become the head of the Council."
Abbas, a 40-year-old driver in Karada who would not give his full name, was ambivalent. "Do you really think that these 25 people can make a decision without the Americans?" he asked.
But ultimately, he said, "It doesn't matter who it is on the Council. We just want someone other than Saddam." Political power, he added, should be diffused. "If it ever gets down to one person, we could have another Saddam on our hands."

HEADLINE: TEENAGERS FACING HARD COMPETITION FOR SUMMER JOBS 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Teenagers are facing the worst summer job market in years, with the percentage of those holding summer jobs at its lowest in 55 years and the unemployment rate at its highest in a decade.
 Governments have cut money that used to help put teenagers in jobs. Retail stores are increasingly favoring older sales clerks. And teenagers are suffering a kind of push-down effect of the bad economy: older workers are returning to the job market, the laid-off are settling for jobs they might once have thought beneath them and college students unable to find better work are hanging onto jobs that usedto go to high school students, squeezing out the youngest workers. 
 It stands in cold contrast to the situation three summers ago, when teenagers were snubbing jobs cleaning parks in favor of air-conditioned clothing boutiques and offices, sometimes bouncing from one job to a better-paying one in the space of a season.
David Solomon, 18, ticks off a list of retail stores he has been badgering for a job. "I stay on CVS, I stay on Toys 'R' Us, I stay on Timberland, I stay on the Gap," said David, who had come for help to a job center for teenagers in this city's Roxbury section. "It's not like I'm lying down, letting days go by. I'm actually trying to get a job. But they just say, 'We'll call you.' I think they put my application in the garbage."
Here, in a city that has long prided itself on its youth jobs program, City Hall has cut the summer jobs budget from $8 million in 2000 to $3.3 million. Mayor Thomas M. Menino has started a fund-raising drive to help pay for the camp counselors the city usually provides to the Y.M.C.A.'s and the boys' and girls' clubs. The city had to eliminate its Gray Shirts program, which for years has employed about 1,500 14- and 15-year-olds to clean city parks and streets. As Tim McCarthy, the director of the Boston Youth Fund, said: "We're closing firehouses and laying off policemen. It's difficult to hire a kid when you've fired his father."
A private group that typically places upward of 5,000 teenagers with area companies this year said it could manage only 4,000. Big corporations like State Street Bank and Fleet have absorbed 1,400. About 2,600 are still waiting for jobs at smaller employers that have traditionally taken the program's teenagers. But many of those places -- stores, restaurants, the concession stands at Fenway Park -- say they do not have room.
"Last year there was some residual good will, even in a bad economy," said Chris Smith, a director at the program, run by the Boston Private Industry Council. "This year it's stone cold."
The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds, at 19.3 percent nationwide in June, is rising particularly fast for black teenagers. But the trouble finding jobs hits across the country, and all demographics. 
In Portland, Ore., teachers with years of experience took jobs as playground supervisors in city parks -- positions that traditionally went to college students. Knott's, which runs amusement parks and a resort in Southern California, drew three times as many applicants as usual to its annual summer jobs fair in March, prompting the company to cancel the one it usually holds in April. Even last week, the parks got 500 applications. At Valleyfair, a summer amusement park 35 miles south of Minneapolis, 500 applicants, mostly high school students, showed up for an annual recruiting fair in mid-May -- twice the usual number. 
"We told them they didn't have to wait in line, they could just drop off the application, but they stood in line for two, three hours," said Amy Maikkula, the park marketing manager. "Generally we're not fully staffed until the end of July. This year we were done by early June. We've never been in a situation like this."
Since 2000, the employment rate for teenagers has dropped about 9 percentage points. "If you had a nine-point drop for adults, you'd call it a depression," said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University here. If the pattern of the past three summers holds steady, July and August will not look any better.
Anita Yip, who just graduated from Boston Latin, the city'smost prestigious public high school, has a scholarship to Wellesley College, but no summer job. Last year, her local Starbucks offered her a job, but she had a paid internship at a magazine. "Come back next year," Anita said the manager told her. When she did, the same manager said there were no openings. Last summer's internship was full, the one at the Museum of Science took only college students, and places at the mall said they were not hiring, Anita said.
Now, she has her heart set on a job at Winston's, an upscale florist where she saw a Help Wanted sign when she bought her prom date a boutonniere. Still, she has not heard back about her application.
"Every week I say, 'I'm going to be working next week,' " Anita said. "This week I'm still saying the same thing." 
Traditionally, most teenagers have found summer jobs in retail. But increasingly, retail stores, including big chains like Home Depot, are refusing to hire anyone under 18.
Renee Ward, president of an Internet job board called Teens4Hire.org, said most of the 1,300 retailers who have posted jobs in the past few years said they were not hiring teenagers under 18 this summer. 
Some are pushing her to start Seniors4Hire: they are more experienced, often more reliable and willing to accept the same money.
This has made the squeeze particularly hard on younger teenagers.
In Fayetteville, N.C., Shari Dillard, 16, heard nothing about her applications to the stores at the mall, restaurants or telemarketers. She finally got her first interview last week, at a movie theater.
"I've been trying to prepare myself for what questions they might ask," she said. "The question I'm worried about is, Why do I want this job? The only reason I want the job is because I really want to start working."
In part, the low rate of teenagers with jobs simply reflects fewer teenagers entering the work force. The teenage participation rate dropped from 51 percent in June 1993 to 45 percent this June, and has generally declined since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping records in 1948. 
The bureau says the lower employment rate partly reflects more students staying in summer school.
But sometimes, students volunteer for summer school simply because they cannot find jobs -- the choice Ricardo Santiago, a 17-year-old high school senior in Chicago, made after hearing "We'll call you" one too many times.
"You wear baggy clothes, they think you're a gang-banger," he said. "I cleaned up my appearance, I threw on some khakis and a nice shirt. I was hoping it would work, but they just tell me they're going to call me. I wait and I hear from nobody."

HEADLINE: Iowa Town Survived Flood, But Teetered in the Aftermath 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: CHELSEA, Iowa, July 12 

 BODY:
The last time William Boyer Sr. ran into one of his old friends from this community, the place Mr. Boyer called home for 30 years, the man brushed past him with no hello, no smile, not even the slightest of nods.
 "I couldn't believe it," said Mr. Boyer, who is in his late 60's and in poor health. "Just walked right on by." 
 That does seem difficult to believe in a city of fewer than 300 people, a place where family names have stayed the same for decades and where drivers wave to one another as they pass. Unbelievable, unless you consider what happened here after the flood. 
During one long summer 10 years ago, floodwaters swamped Chelsea and hundreds of communities across the Midwest, killing 50 people and damaging 50,000 homes in nine states. Still, the flood itself, residents here say, brought out everything people like about living in small places.
They united. On each waterlogged edge of Chelsea that summer, volunteers in boats stayed up night after night to keep looters out. Young firefighters hoisted furniture above muddy waters in living rooms. People rode tractors through high waters to deliver meals to older residents who insisted on staying put.
But after the waters receded, so, too, did some of that unity. A community that had cheerfully worked together to tough out a natural disaster seemed more challenged by the political storm that followed. People were split over whether to move away from this low spot beside the Iowa River or to stay put.
Many who stayed insist that there are no lingering sore feelings. Sure, they have watched Chelsea's already shrinking population shrink some more in the years since the flood. Still, says Larry Frese, who owns one of the remaining businesses in Chelsea, the tavern, "The city looks better than ever." 
What happened after the storm, he said, has simply meant that the most dilapidated homes have emptied and been demolished, adding, "We got rid of the negative people, too."
For some who left, like Mr. Boyer, who accepted a government buyout for his Chelsea home, memories are raw.
"Too many people were arguing and fighting," Mr. Boyer said, as he watched television in his new three- bedroom home in Tama, a town 11 miles down the road. "So many people were trying to make you do what they wanted you to do, and I really had to get away from all that water." 
The onetime friend who ignored Mr. Boyer in the grocery store not long ago was part of "the clique" that wanted everyone to stay in town, Mr. Boyer said. "I don't hold it against Chelsea," he said. "It was a very good town to live in. But this kind of took the enjoyment out of it."
Around the Midwest, the fall of 1992 was a wet one, and then, the next March, more rains began soaking ground that was soaked already. As summer approached, the rain kept coming. Although river flooding can happen with regularity in this region, as it did this past week in Indiana and Ohio, the 1993 flood was devastating and widespread.
Soon, the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers, and many tributaries including the Iowa, had risen out of their banks. Barge traffic stopped. At different times, bridges closed from Davenport, Iowa, to St. Louis on the Mississippi and from Kansas City to St. Louis on the Missouri. Airports, railroad lines and parts of interstate highways shut down.
Here, in a lush valley of farms 70 miles northeast of Des Moines, Chelsea was covered in slow-rising waters, from the Iowa River on one edge, Otter Creek on the other. But in Chelsea, which was settled in the 1860's, mild flooding can come almost as often as the new corn crop, and people here take a certain amount of pride in not being bothered by a touch of water. 
Longtime residents, many of whom are of Czech descent, rattle off the big flood years: 1918, 1944 (when two local girls were killed), 1969 and of course, 1993.
When water began covering the first floor of Bill Kent's house 10 years ago, he and his wife, Alice, simply moved upstairs. Mr. Kent was born in this house 100 years ago, and the idea that one more flood might scare him, or even send him packing from a place that holds so much significance to his past, amuses him.
"There are other floods that are far more negative than water," Mr. Kent said on a recent evening, as he sat in his backyard watching trains chug by. "Like bootleggers and drug peddlers -- those are floods other places. If we wanted to be somewhere else, we would be."
But even for people accustomed to flooding, 1993 was frustrating. The water did not recede for days. And when the levels finally did drop, they rose again, more than once, erasing the smells of Clorox scrubbings that had come in between.
When it was over, local, state and federal officials began meeting. All over the Midwest, the authorities were looking for ways -- by moving whole towns or individual families or something else altogether -- to get homes out of flood zones for good. The idea, too, was to protect the government from having to pay, again and again, to rebuild the same communities.
In the end, the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent more than $150 million in the nine states affected in 1993, a FEMA official said, buying and tearing down nearly 12,000 homes, moving more than 300 homes to safer places and elevating 31 others.
In Chelsea, the City Council voted in 1994 to move as much of the community as possible to a nearby hill, out of harm's way, with what was to be millions of dollars in federal help. It would be a new, higher Chelsea. 
But people took sides. Those in favor said they could not bear another flood. Those against said they could not sacrifice the rich history of their community for the certainty of staying dry in some new, generic place. The mayor at the time favored the move. The tavern owner, Mr. Frese, was against it. And the banker, who owned part of the hill in question, did not want to sell.
"Too much land is being eaten up by concrete," the banker, Gary Fattig, said on a recent afternoon, from behind his desk at the Chelsea Savings Bank where he is vice president. He said that he also had concerns about possible Indian burial mounds on his property, as well as an endangered species. 
Complicating matters, state and federal officials had little experience at that time trying to move whole towns. 
"Every agency had a different deadline and a different idea, and it wasn't working," said Jerry Knox, an Iowa State University professor, now retired, and part of a team that tried to help Chelsea plan its future. 
So, as the plan seemed to be slipping away, some residents quietly began moving to higher ground on their own. Many accepted government buyouts of their homes, which would then be demolished. Some received about $30,000, they said. 
"I would have stayed in Chelsea. I had every plan to move up the hill, but it wasn't going to happen," said Frank Fetter, a former City Council member who moved to nearby Toledo, Iowa. "There were hard feelings, bone hard feelings."
One man was heckled near the tavern as he and his house, pulled along on wheels, left town. 
The owners of about 45 homes left, but the majority in the city remained. Still, a place that was struggling long before the flood, as so many small farm-based towns have, showed more signs of trouble. The oat processing plant closed. 
The city's latest economic hope is a housing development -- on a nearby hill. The city bought the land, ran utilities to it and called it Riverview Estates. Only three people bought lots, so the city tried a radical measure: it would give away lots as long as the takers agreed to promptly build houses.
More than a year later, though, only one man is finishing his new house. Eleven lots await. "We thought they would just go like hot cakes," said Roger L. Ochs, who is now mayor.
From Beverly Gerard's front stoop on Station Street, the view has changed entirely since the summer of 1993 when muddy water ran in the street. The water is gone now, of course, but so are many of her neighbors. Houses that were once beside hers are demolished.
"They've all moved away," said Mrs. Gerard, 75, pointing next door to a blank lawn and recalling with a smile how the children who used to live there had once enjoyed her baking skills. "It's kind of like living out in the country now, so much open space."

HEADLINE: Old Tensions Over Immigrants Surface After Firebombing 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: FARMINGVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The firebomb that gutted the simple wood-frame house on Granny Road on July 5 did more than leave a family homeless and their neighbors shaken.
It also pierced what had been a relatively quiet, if uneasy, coexistence between Spanish-speaking immigrant day laborers and some of their neighbors.
 And more than two and a half years after this Long Island community in central Suffolk County was thrust into the national spotlight by a brutal attack on two immigrant workers by young men posing as employers, it was a reminder that many of the problems that festered then, still fester now. 
 "I think there was a sense of hope that this was as bad as it could get, and that was the wake-up call that would serve as the impetus to address really important issues," Nadia L. Marin-Molina, executive director of the Workplace Project, an immigrant worker organization in Hempstead, said of the attack on the two men. "While it did wake people up in terms of the issues, it didn't lead to any concrete solutions." 
Around 1 a.m. on July 5, the police said, a neighbor saw someone in a black vehicle throw a flaming object through the window at 45 Granny Road. Neighbors still celebrating the Fourth of July heard shattering glass, saw the flames, and helped rescue the four adults and two young children inside. Now, the Suffolk County Police Department, the F.B.I. and the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York are investigating whether it was a bias crime.
But even without answers as to who did it and why, the fire has sounded an eerie echo of what happened on Sept. 17, 2000, when Israel Perez Arvizu and Magdaleno Estrada Escamilla, who lived in the house next door, were lured to an abandoned building in nearby Shirley with the promise of work, then attacked with digging tools. The two assailants, Ryan D. Wagner and Christopher Slavin, were each sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Since then, some pieces of the puzzle have shifted. Workers and their advocates say it is no longer common these days, as it was three years ago, to have empty bottles hurled at Hispanic men on the street. The Workplace Project has been trying to help the laborers organize themselves under the umbrella of the United Day Laborers.
Gaudencio Garcia and Salvador Escamilla, members of that group, said their organization has put out about a dozen newsletters. In interviews translated by Ms. Marin-Molina, the men said the group's members have met with police officials and written newsletter articles explaining housing and driving laws.
"People are beginning to realize that we're not alone, and that we can bind together in a group," Mr. Garcia said. Still, he said, the firebombing had a chilling effect.
"It's a renewed threat," he said. "We had felt tranquillity."
There have also been shifts in the Sachem Quality of Life, a local group that opposes illegal immigration and which, while it was not connected to the attack nearly three years ago, was criticized by some public officials and immigrants' advocates for contributing to the charged climate in which it took place. A few years ago, workers say, more than a dozen members of the group would gather by the local 7-Eleven on Saturdays, holding signs with slogans like "Deport Illegal Aliens." Now, the number has dwindled to no more than five, and in general, their presence in the hamlet has diminished.
Recently, however, the Sachem group has split, alarming some critics. Its longtime spokesman, Ray Wysolmierski, who still answers to that title, said members of the breakaway group "want to be a little bit more radical in their approach."
Members of the new group did not return telephone calls seeking comment. About a month and a half ago, they held a conference featuring Chris Simcox, founder of a volunteer armed watch group that intercepts illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona and turns them over to the authorities.
And the basic ingredients that proved combustible a few years ago, for the most part, have remained.
The Suffolk County Legislature considered, but ultimately rejected, several proposals to limit the presence of day laborers. One would have had the county file a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service, now the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, to move against the immigrants. Another would have revoked the licenses of contractors hiring undocumented workers.
Other Suffolk legislators proposed spending county money for a hiring hall where workers and employers could meet in an organized fashion, but Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, vetoed the measure.
Now, as three years ago, there is a shortage of cheap housing, so the men still crowd into single-family houses. There is no hiring hall, although Mr. Gaffney said in a telephone interview that he thought more and more men were being picked up at home by their employers. Immigration authorities have not raided the community. And while the economy may have been in a slump, Long Island still has a fertile market for people willing to mow lawns, paint houses, lay bricks and the like.
Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, commander of the bias crimes unit of the Suffolk police, said virtually no bias crimes against immigrant workers have been reported in Farmingdale since the 2000 attacks in Shirley. But he said he thought day laborers were still reluctant to report crimes, saying, "They're still very much in fear of the Police Department."
For some residents, the issue is still raw. "This is a political problem here, and nobody seems to want to come in," said Frank Hardina, a Farmingville retiree.
Mr. Hardina said that the issue of day laborers has not been in the news, but has been on his mind. His car and house have been pelted with eggs, he said, and his television cable cut. He has no proof, but he suspects the laborers.
His neighbors Joseph and Deborah Mudaro said that until the firebombing, they had thought things had been settling down. Now, they wonder.
"A lot of people have turned the other cheek and just accepted what's going on," Mr. Mudaro said. "You had promises that people were going to do something for a while, then it all faded away. Now it looks like it's coming to a boiling point again."
But the Rev. John M. Derasmo, pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of the Resurrection, opposite the firebombed home, was not so sure. Things are not the same, he said, as they were when he arrived at the parish five years ago. The handful of parishioners who barraged him with complaints that the parish was doing too much to welcome undocumented workers no longer attend Mass there.
Other, milder gripes about the workers' presence in the community, if not the church, virtually stopped after the terror attacks of Sept. 11. At recent trilingual Masses, featuring prayers in English, Portuguese and Spanish, he said, "the church was packed."
"I don't know if it's so much that they changed their views about the laborers, but they focused their attention on something else," Father Derasmo said. "I think there are people in the community who are concerned, but I think they're willing to see how we can live in peace with one another."

HEADLINE: With Fewer Dollars to Go Around, More Are Going Around World 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Abel Portillo scanned the currency exchange rates at the Delgado Travel Agency in Jackson Heights, Queens. He used to send $500 a month to his mother in Veracruz, Mexico, but now he sends twice as much, and he wants to be sure that the rates are favorable.
 Mr. Portillo began sending his mother more money so she could buy property. After three years in New York, he said, "I want to leave soon." 
 And when he does, he expects to have land that his mother bought in Mexico and to be able to start a business. In the meantime, he manages a nightclub in Manhattan and stands in line at Delgado Travel, where men and women wait beneath the glow of pink neon signs each Friday night to send money home. 
According to recent reports from the Multilateral Investment Fund at the Inter-American Development Bank, the amount of money sent last year to Latin America from the United States increased about 18 percent, to more than $32 billion. And despite the tough economic times and new federal restrictions on sending money abroad, experts say they do not expect the volume of these remittances to decrease anytime soon.
"Remittances didn't fall at all during the recession," said Manuel Orozco, a leading expert on remittances to Latin America and the director of the Central America Program at Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. "It was surprising." 
When the economy is sour in the United States, it is generally worse in Latin America, immigrants and experts like Mr. Orozco say. So even as unemployment and the cost ofliving rise, they say, immigrants feel an even more acute need to send money to their families to cover basics like food and medicine. 
Studies show that the typical sender remits a monthly average of $250. A survey last year by the Pew Hispanic Center found that almost half of all Latino immigrants send money regularly to their home country. Mr. Orozco said that since remittances are tallied at the receiving end, it is hard to say how much money comes from the New York area. But given the metropolitan region's large Latino population, Mr. Orozco estimated that at least $3 billion is sent annually from New York. 
The experience of individual businesses like Delgado Travel reflects the changes in remittances this past year. Linda Delgado, vice president of the agency, which has 28 offices in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, said the company experienced an unanticipated decline over the last year in the amount of money per person sent to Latin America, roughly $50 to $75 a week instead of the usual $100. 
But that was offset by a large increase in the number of people sending money. The company now serves up to 10,000 customers a day, up from 8,000 a day last year, she said, adding that the jump represents new customers, not old ones sending money more often.
"There are always new faces here," she said about her office on Roosevelt Avenue, in Jackson Queens, a commercial area catering mainly to Mexicans and Colombians.
In Washington Heights, Dominicans have also been sending more money home, said Eduardo Cuesta, the general manager at Remesas Agil, a company with more than 200 agents throughout the city who are licensed to transfer money.
"Not many people are going back home," he said. In particular, the crash in November 2001 of American Airlines Flight 587, which had just taken off from Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Santo Domingo, made people wary of traveling, he said. His company has seen about an 18 percent increase in the money being sent to Latin America, especially around holidays like Christmas and Mother's Day.
Immigration issues might also account for the increases in remittances, experts say. Since Sept. 11, even legal immigrants have been afraid to return to their home countries because they fear complications when they try to re-enter the United States. Instead of spending money on plane tickets, this theory goes, they send the money home. Some immigrants have also increased the amount they send, in case they lose their jobs in the United States or are deported. Newer immigrants, who are more likely to send money back home, are likely to have jobs in the service sector, which has remained relatively vibrant in comparison with the hard-hit dot-com industry, Mr. Cuesta and other business owners say. 
Remittances have also become big business in the last three years as banks like Wells Fargo and Citibank have begun providing the service and even A.T.M. cards for those sending cash to Mexico. That, coupled with more competition among small niche companies, resulted in a 9 percent drop in transfer costs last year, making it cheaper to send money. On average, the cost of sending $200 to Latin America dropped to about $16 last year, though it can vary according to the wire service and the receiving country. Sending $200 to Cuba, for instance, costs $25, while sending $200 to El Salvador costs $12.
The increase in remittances also occurred even as the federal government began demanding that companies report transfers and also check proof of customers' identities. 
Latin America is considered a highlycompetitive market in remittances because so many companies vie for the volume of transfers headed there.
An estimated 33 percent of remittances worldwide are sent there, Mr. Orozco said, more than to any other part of the world. South Asia is next, receiving 20 percent. Mr. Orozco attributed part of the increase last year to more thorough accounting practices at the central banks of Latin American countries. He said the Multilateral Investment Fund also began tracking remittances to and from more countries last year. But even countries like Mexico and the Dominican Republic, where remittances have been carefully studied for years, have experienced an increase in incoming funds, he said. 
Adriana Caro, 27, who lives in Inwood, said she had been sending more money to her parents in the Dominican Republic to help them with necessities and in remodeling their home. Although she usually sends $100 every payday, last month she sent an extra $200. 
"With just $100, they can buy food for a month over there," she said. "And there will be money left over."
Experts also say that the decline in the economy in the metropolitan region has not decreased remittances because immigrants usually make sending the money a high priority and juggle their other expenses. Most wire the money as soon as they get paid and take care of basic costs like rent and food. 
Carlos Aguasaco, 28, used to buy telephone cards to call his family in Bogota, Colombia, three times a week from his home in Woodside, Queens. But since the subway fare increase, he said, he has started to call home just once a week so that he can still send home $100 a week. 
"Those three or five dollars that I can save are very valuable to them," Mr. Aguasaco said. "They're still poor, but they haven't lost their apartment."
At Delgado Travel, new immigrants continue to arrive each Friday night. Among them recently was Carmen Ruiz, 47, who held her yellow slip filled out for $100. She arrived in Queens last year from Mexico, she said, and sends money home every week to her two sons in Mexico City.
Ms. Ruiz, who was an office worker in Mexico, now looks after her granddaughter, for which she is paid by her daughter. She is also looking for a restaurant job but says no matter what she does here, it generally pays more than similar work back home. "The need is always growing" for dollars in Mexico, she said, "so I'll do whatever I have to."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the increasing amount of money sent home by Hispanic immigrants to their families referred incorrectly to offices of the Delgado Travel Agency, a business that makes transfers to Latin America. They are in several states, but not in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Kirshenbaum Wins Andrew Jergens Job

BYLINE:  By Lisa Napoli 

 BODY:
The Andrew Jergens Company has named the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York to handle the account of its personal-care brands, which include Ban antiperspirant, Jergens lotion and John Frieda hair products. Although billings were not disclosed, Jergens and Frieda spent $90.1 million on advertising in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 The decision came after a one-month review that had been narrowed to Kirshenbaum and one other finalist, the New York office of Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas. 
 The brands had been handled by Bozell in New York until that agency was merged last winter by its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, into a sibling, Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York. The account was shifted to Lowe at the same time, leading Jergens to start a review out of concern that conflicts could arise with a big Lowe client, Johnson & Johnson. AAR Partners in New York managed the review for Jergens, which is part of the Kao Corporation.

Iraqi Council in Place; A New Holiday Is Declared
The first interim government of Iraq has been declared and its 25 members will begin meeting today to decide on a leadership structure. As its first act, the council abolished six national holidays that had been celebrated under Saddam Hussein's rule and created a new national day, April 9, the day Baghdad fell to allied forces. A1

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the United States might need to send additional troops to Iraq to quell an increasingly well organized guerrilla resistance, and warned that more American soldiers would die in attacks this summer. A1

The United States has called for a fund-raising conference, which will be attended by dozens of nations, in an effort to return Iraq to economic self-sufficiency. But potential donor nations are uneasy about financing a military occupation, and there will have to be more involvement by other countries in deciding how money is raised and spent. A6

Arab Researcher Attacked
A mob attacked an eminent Palestinian political scientist as he prepared to announce that only a small minority of Palestinians would exercise a right of return to Israel, perhaps the deepest divide between the Israelis and Palestinians, as part of a peace agreement. A1

Israel arrested a suspected Irish bombmaker who entered the country three weeks ago and traveled to the West Bank to train Palestinians in making explosives, an official said. A5

Norway vs. the Glass Ceiling
Norway's Parliament, despite opposition from business groups, is expected to pass legislation soon that would force the country's largest publicly traded companies to increase the share of women on their corporate boards to 40 percent by July 2005. A3

Hong Kong Rally for Democracy
Thousands of demonstrators appealed for democracy in Hong Kong, but the government responded by announcing that it would not accelerate its four-year plan to review possible constitutional changes. The statement is the first official response to a series of rallies. A3

Worst Market in Years Limits Jobs for Teenagers
Teenagers are facing the worst summer job market in years, with the percentage of those holding summer jobs at its lowest in 55 years and the unemployment rate at its highest in a decade. They are suffering a push-down effect of the bad economy: older workers are returning to the job market and the laid-off are settling for jobs they might once have thought beneath them. A1

Muslim Group Draws Scrutiny
Tablighi Jamaat is one of the oldest and most conservative Islamic movements in the world, describing itself as nonpolitical and nonviolent. But since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, it has increasingly attracted the interest of federal investigators, cropping up on the margins of at least four high-profile terrorism cases. A1

Democrats Criticize Bush
Democratic presidential candidates offered a near-unified assault on President Bush's credibility in his handling of the Iraq war, signaling a shift in the political winds by aggressively invoking arguments most had shunned since the fall of Baghdad. A15

Teetering in Flood's Aftermath
During one long summer 10 years ago, floodwaters swamped Chelsea, Iowa, and hundreds of communities across the Midwest, killing 50 people and damaging 50,000 homes in nine states. Still, the flood itself, residents say, brought out everything people like about living in small places. But after the waters receded, so did some of that unity. A1

Slave's Descendants Gather
Nearly five years after DNA testing provided evidence that Thomas Jefferson, or a close relative, fathered at least one child with a young slave named Sally Hemings, about 150 of her family's descendants gathered for their first reunion on the grounds of Jefferson's hilltop plantation, Monticello. A9

E.P.A. Raises Criticism
The Environmental Protection Agency has delayed or refused to do analysis on proposals that conflict with the president's air pollution agenda, critics say. Some agency employees say they have been told either not to analyze or not to release information about mercury, carbon dioxide and other pollutants, prompting inquiries and complaints from environmental groups, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

Despite the Poor Economy, More Money Heads South
Though economic strife persists, and even with new federal restrictions on sending money abroad, recent reports show that the amount of money sent last year to Latin America from the United States increased about 18 percent, to more than $32 billion. Experts say they do not expect the volume of these remittances to decrease anytime soon. B1

French-Free Bastille Party
Although there were crepes for sale and oceans of cafe au lait to sip, a Bastille Day party on the Lower East Side brought out nary a French national. B3

More Early-College Schools
New York City is getting two more "early-college high schools" this fall, part of a national wave of schools designed to help minority and low-income students complete high school and get a jump on college before they graduate. Both schools will be small, with no more than 500 students, and will emphasize science. B1

HEADLINE: Learning to Love the French as They Are; 
Canadian Couple's Book Dissects the Oddities and Irascibilities

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
"After graduating from high school, I went on my mandatory military service, which was an obligation for all French boys when they turned 18," recalls Robert Arbor, now a New York restaurateur, in the introduction to his new book, "Joie de Vivre: Simple French Style for Everyday Living" (Simon & Schuster).
 "I chose to serve in one of France's overseas territories -- Tahiti," Mr. Arbor continues. "There I observed and took part in eight underground nuclear tests. A more interesting skill I acquired was how to cook fresh fish wrapped in banana leaves in an outdoor oven." 
 Ah, the French, with their disproportionate concern for cuisine and careless attitudes toward the balance of power! Not so long ago, this whimsicality was thought to be charming. There have been serious foreign-policy spats with France before -- de Gaulle pulling out of NATO not least among them, forcing the NATO-crats to find a new home in Belgium. 
But books in which foreign sojourners encountered French idiosyncrasies with bafflement and affection were hits nonetheless. Peter Mayle's "A Year in Provence" spent years on best-seller lists in the early 1990's and spawned several best-selling sequels. In 2000 Adam Gopnik collected his New Yorker reportage from France into "Paris to the Moon," another best seller.
 Then came the war with Iraq. The French scorned United States foreign policy; congressmen retaliated with freedom fries. But fast wars, apparently, bring fast rapprochement. So now Woody Allen, Wynton Marsalis and Robert De Niro are appearing in a promotional video for France being shown to American travel writers in which Mr. Allen expresses a longing for French fries and a preference for French kissing.
Mr. Arbor's handsome book -- part memoir, part instructional manual with recipes -- urges Americans to concentrate on homely French virtues like taking naps after big meals and drinking coffee out of bowls. He doesn't discuss politics.
 Good timing for Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow, two Canadian journalists, and their newly published "Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong." The book tells its share of cute stories about cross-cultural infractions that this married couple -- one a French speaker from Quebec and the other an English speaker from Ontario -- suffered and inflicted during their two-year stay in France. But the authors' intent was more anthropological than literary as they aimed to find historic, geographic and linguistic reasons for French behavior -- not just at the table but also in business and politics and school, as well as on the subway and at the market. 
 They examined the many paradoxes of France. It has an overregulated economy with high taxes and double-digit unemployment, but is also one of the world's most productive countries. Its people drink, smoke and indulge in high-cholesterol food with abandon, yet have far less obesity and fewer heart problems than Americans. French attitudes are sometimes disparaged as anti-Semitic, but France was also the first European country to grant civil rights to Jews and has had Jewish presidents prime ministers.
"We wanted to decide what were perceptions and what were the results of prejudices we grew up with," Ms. Barlow explained in an interview.
 Unlike Mr. Gopnik and Mr. Mayle, whose writerly reflections on their expatriate experiences were the culmination of long-held fantasies about living in France, Mr. Nadeau and Ms. Barlow had little interest in the country before they ended up living there -- even though Mr. Nadeau descends from 13 generations of a Quebec family and speaks fluent English with a French-Canadian accent. "Gerard Depardieu, I knew who he was," Mr. Nadeau said. "I read some French novels."
 He explained: "There are two types of Quebecers. The ones who identify very very strongly with France and the other type. I am the other type."
 Ms. Barlow, from Ontario, studied French grammar in school but did not speak the language until she was 20, after she met Mr. Nadeau at McGill University, where they were students. "France wasn't part of my experience at all," she said. "English Canadians identify with England."
 They did venture to France together on a trip in 1992, just before they married. "It was a catastrophe," Mr. Nadeau said. "I didn't understand how to speak to the French. I didn't know how to strike up a conversation with them. I didn't know what made them tick. I knew nothing."
 He touched on a special complication that afflicts Canadians from Quebec. "Because language is dominated by Paris, we learn very young that we don't speak good French in Quebec," he said. "So being snickered at by a Parisian or anyone from France is hard."
 After that first trip he and Ms. Barlow felt no urge to return. They were drawn back, however, in a novelistic way -- not by any romantic yearning, but through the auspices of a Chicago industrialist who had nothing to do with France. The man from Chicago was Charles R. Crane, who had been an adviser to President Woodrow Wilson and a diplomat in China. In 1925 Mr. Crane began the Institute of Current World Affairs in Hanover, N.H., whose purpose was to send men under age 36 (and later, women, too) to study foreign countries and then write reports on their experiences. The stated purpose? Simply to edify the institute's trustees,who have included diplomats, lawyers in foreign affairs and journalists. In the past 78 years 155 fellows have studied in more than 100 countries.
 When Mr. Nadeau applied five years ago, he was a 34-year-old freelance writer; Ms. Barlow, three years younger, was finishing up a freelance book-editing job. Within six months of his being chosen, they sold their house in Montreal and moved to France. His assignment had been to investigate why the French were resisting globalization, but he and Ms. Barlow soon discovered that was not exactly true. For one thing, French companies like Airbus, Renault and Carrefour were major players in the global market. "We quickly realized it was mainly not that the French were resisting globalization but what the Americans thought about the French," Ms. Barlow said. 
 Mr. Nadeau received permission to change his inquiry to nothing less ambitious than deciphering the essential difference between the French and North Americans. "We decided we would not be working as journalists but as anthropologists," he said. "We wanted to interrogate our impressions. Why does it anger me that the dry cleaner is closed at lunchtime?"
 Ms. Barlow wanted to know why, when she asked a salesclerk for gray stockings, the clerk told her "they don't exist" instead of "we don't have any."
 Or Mr. Nadeau added, "Why are the people there so calm when the subway shuts down on a wildcat strike and why am I angered?"
 Or Ms. Barlow asked, "Why does everybody keep correcting my French? How can you have a whole country full of rude people? Or are they rude?"
 Over the next two years Mr. Nadeau produced, sometimes with Ms. Barlow's help, 23 reports, each 5,000 to 7,000 words long. He wrote about hiking in the Alps and visiting a mosque; about why the French give almost nothing to charity and how the country still lives in the shadow of World War II. The articles became a launching pad for their book, which is published by Sourcebooks, in Naperville, Ill. 
 Little by little they found themselves seduced by France's oddities and contradictions, which acquired logic and consistency as they learned about how the country's institutions developed. The book barely mentions the country's literature, art and restaurants -- the tourist's France -- but focuses on the systems and structures that define the French. They found something essential. "Being liked is very important in American culture," Mr. Nadeau said. "Being liked is not important in France. Being appreciated, yes, being in power, being right. But being liked? The French don't like being liked."
 Mr. Nadeau and Ms. Barlow discovered, however, somewhat to their surprise, that they did like the French. When it was time to leave they wanted to stay. But by then they appreciated the French system well enough to know they couldn't.
As foreign freelance journalists, the work possibilities were limited. Now, back in Montreal, they find they have become more like the other type of Quebecers, the ones who not only recognize Mr. Depardieu but who also identify with France. Indeed, they are working on another book, tentatively titled "The Story of French," a popular history of the French language.

HEADLINE: Back From Africa: Bush's Promises Will Be Watched 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
President Bush made a lot of promises to Africa over the past week. Now, back home again, he has to make good on them.
 As he visited five African countries, he pledged that the United States would play a leading role in combating AIDS, which is inflicting an almost unimaginable toll on the African continent. He promised to go all out to make sure that Congress fully financed his proposed five-year, $15 billion program to attack the disease in the world's poorest countries. 
 Mr. Bush said he would help Africa gain a toehold in the global economy and begin clawing its way out of poverty by selling more goods around the world. African leaders told Mr. Bush they appreciated the money rich nations send them. But they said that what they really needed was more access to the American market and for the United States to end heavy subsidies to its own farmers that price African agricultural products like cotton out of world markets.
He promised that the United States would play a role in resolving one of the many conflicts scarring Africa, in Liberia. He even left open the possibility of sending American troops to police a cease-fire, a use of the military of a sort that he derided during his presidential campaign. More generally, Mr. Bush gave hope to African leaders that he would not forget their nations once he returns to Washington and the press of other business.
Mr. Bush had evinced little public interest in Africa until this year. But with the United States seen in many quarters as a global bully, and the need for an image makeover becoming obvious, his administration developed a national security rationale for helping the poorest countries avoid turning into breeding grounds or safe harbors for terrorists.
Mr. Bush's associates say his religious and moral convictions led him to believe that the United States has an obligation to address the suffering that has defined Africa through a history of colonialism, brutal regional conflicts, dictatorships and disease. His AIDS proposal and his willingness to spend nearly a week there were significant practically and symbolically.
But it is hard to assess the depth of his commitment. His trip had a dutiful, check-off-box quality that suggested a limit to his passion. He did not visit a single rural village. He stopped by no urban slums. Sticking to his AIDS and trade message, he did not focus on other, equally compelling issues, like the need to bring clean water to much of the population.
Then there is the question of whether Mr. Bush's trip was really about domestic politics, about appealing to black voters who have spurned him or -- more likely -- to moderate white voters, especially women, who might respond to a message of compassion.
Mr. Bush's closest advisers dismiss any suggestion that his engagement with Africa is temporary or for show. "The purpose of the trip was not a political exercise and was not designed to influence the election of next year," said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. "It was designed to deal with real problems facing people in need in Africa."
Whatever his own feelings, and whatever other demands on his time and political capital, Mr. Bush's foreign policy is being shaped by advisers committed to helping Africa. Mr. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, are two of the most influential African-Americans to have served in any administration, and Dr. Rice said this trip made a deep impression on her. "I have found this an incredibly moving trip in a lot of ways," she said aboard Air Force One en route from South Africa to Uganda on Friday.
She said she was especially struck upon visiting Goree Island in Senegal, from which slaves were shipped across the Atlantic. "You can almost imagine these stolen people suddenly arriving on the shore of this absolutely beautiful place and being put in these horrible cells where large numbers of them would die," she said. "And when I think of the Gate of No Return, I still have a lump in my throat from thinking which one of my ancestors might have actually gone through that gate on their way to the United States."
Still, Mr. Bush will have to show a steady willingness to use his political clout and capital on Africa's behalf, often in the face of domestic pressures that will only intensify as election season heats up.
Largely because of budget pressures created by the administration's own policies -- from tax cuts to increased spending for the military -- money for Africa will be extremely tight. Last week, a House subcommittee moved to cut financing for Mr. Bush's main economic aid proposal, known as the Millennium Challenge Account, to $800 million from the $1.3 billion he had sought for next year. The same subcommittee voted to finance Mr. Bush's AIDS plan at about $2 billion next year, about what Mr. Bush now says he wants but $1 billion less than allowed under the legislation creating the program.
On the trade issues, Mr. Bush will confront intense pressure from powerful constituencies as he is getting his re-election campaign into gear.
Granting African countries increased access to the American textile market, for example, would run into opposition from lawmakers representing southern textile-producing states that have already lost many jobs to lower-cost nations. Cutting agricultural subsidies has proven to be a very tough sell to Congress, where farm-state lawmakers from both parties hold considerable sway.
Mr. Bush has been signaling that he is unlikely to send American combat troops into Liberia, at least not in substantial numbers or for long. But should he decide to do so, he would face skepticism from some members of his own party in Congress, who say they see no national security justification for putting American lives on the line in Liberia.
Standing beside Mr. Bush on Saturday, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said, "We in Africa realize the extent to which we are ultimately responsible for our own development, and that we are the architects of our own fortune or misfortune."
He added that Africa cannot transform itself without help from its friends. He, and millions of other Africans, are now waiting to see how good a friend Mr. Bush will prove to be.

HEADLINE: Critics Say E.P.A. Won't Analyze Clean Air Proposals Conflicting With President's Policies 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
In the last several months, the Environmental Protection Agency has delayed or refused to do analysis on proposals that conflict with the president's air pollution agenda, say members of Congress, their aides, environmental advocates and agency employees.
 Agency employees say they have been told either not to analyze or not to release information about mercury, carbon dioxide and other air pollutants. This has prompted inquiries and complaints from environmental groups, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
 "It's totally unacceptable," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. "This is an administration that lets its politics and ideology overwhelm and stifle scientific fact." 
Mr. Lieberman said the agency refused to analyze legislation that he and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, sponsored to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas implicated in global warming.
Lisa Harrington, a spokeswoman for the agency, said, "These decisions were not motivated in any way by politics." 
The agency routinely assesses important proposals for environmental laws and regulations, using computer modeling to predict their environmental and economic consequences and to calculate their risks and benefits. The results are often used to bolster or attack policy positions.
The question is whether the agency is deciding which analyses to release based on which side the studies favor in environmental debates.
"Whether or not analysis is released is based on at least two factors," said William D. Ruckelshaus, who was the first agency administrator under Nixon. "Is the analysis flawed? That is a legitimate reason for not releasing it. But if you don't like the outcome that might result from the analysis, that is not a legitimate reason."
Take the case of mercury. It is a leading pollutant from coal-burning power plants, but it has never been controlled under the Clean Air Act.
Because mercury lasts a long time in the environment and can harm people and animals, the agency is under a court order to propose regulations by the end of this year and to put them in force within five years.
The agency had set an interim deadline of Aug. 1 to have proposals ready for review by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Typically, such regulations require many rounds of modeling to compare costs and benefits.
A dozen staff members met with Jeffrey Holmstead, the assistant administrator for air programs, on March 27 to explain the options they planned to assess. Employees at the meeting set Mr. Holmstead said he had to consult the White House before they proceeded. Four days later, a meeting at which the staff members were to present results of their modeling to outside advisers was canceled. It has not been rescheduled.
Mr. Holmstead said he decided to postpone the modeling because the agency was not sure if some of the proposed regulations would be legal under the Clean Air Act. He said that even without the modeling, "we are on track" to produce regulations.
The administration has proposed its own standards for mercury emissions in draft legislation to update the Clean Air Act, a bill that it calls Clear Skies. Environmental groups and members of Congress say those regulations could be weaker than the ones being considered by the environmental agency. Recently 138 representatives, including 13 Republicans, sent a letter to the president urging him not to weaken the mercury proposal.
On another environmental front, Christie Whitman, then administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, sent a letter in June to Senators McCain and Lieberman, refusing to do economic analysis on their bill to limit carbon dioxide emissions.
"I am disappointed that the E.P.A. declined to review the bill and do not feel it was normal procedure to refuse to analyze a bill that is under the agency's jurisdiction," Senator McCain said.
Mrs. Whitman, who has since resigned, wrote the senators that the Energy Department's statistical office, the Energy Information Agency, was already conducting an analysis and "based on past analyses, I would expect that E.I.A.'s cost estimates should not be significantly different from the estimates that E.P.A. would have produced."
The energy agency and the Environmental Protection Agency did do models on legislation to clean up power plants proposed by Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont; Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; and Senator Lieberman. In that case, the two models differed significantly; the energy agency showed a greater decline in use of coal.
This is in part because the energy agency typically uses a more conservative model, experts said. 
"It's not thought of as a model that captures the flexibility in the economy," said Vicki Arroyo, director of policy analysis at the Pew Center for Climate Change, one of the outside groups that the energy agency asked to review its analysis of the McCain-Lieberman proposal. 
Mr. Lieberman said that the environmental agency's decision not to conduct an analysis "was an intervention from above that closed down an effective scientific inquiry for political and ideological reasons." 
Staff members at the agency said it did compare the administration's environmental plan with one sponsored by Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Lincoln Chaffee, Republican of Rhode Island. But the agency released only a raw data print-out of its findings. A summarized report, which indicated that the Carper-Chaffee proposal had some advantages, was not released.
At a meeting on May 2, employees who attended it said, Mr. Holmstead of the E.P.A. wondered out loud, "How can we justify Clear Skies if this gets out?"
When asked if he made that comment, Mr. Holmstead said he did not "recall making any specific remarks."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: REBUILDING; 
U.S. Seeks Help With Iraq Costs, But Donors Want a Larger Say

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
Faced with the huge cost of rebuilding Iraq, the United States has called for an international conference in October to be attended by dozens of nations -- many of which opposed the war to oust Saddam Hussein -- to raise billions of dollars to restore Iraq's economy.
 But the Bush administration has run into a now familiar diplomatic problem. Potential donor nations say they are uneasy about financing a military occupation, and some American officials concede there will have to be more participation by other countries in deciding how money for Iraq is raised and spent. 
 "The donors want a say on the allocation of funds," said a Western diplomat involved in aiding Iraq. "They want credit for what they give, and they don't want to commingle their money with money for the occupation. The way things are set up now will have to be changed." 
Among the nations that want a different structure for international aid to Iraq are Germany and France, two countries that opposed the war, although French and German officials emphasize that they are ready now to help rebuild Iraq.
In response to donor concerns, American officials are pressing for the creation of another element of the occupation bureaucracy, a trust fund for donations by other countries. But it is not clear whether the fund will be seen by donors as sufficiently independent.
"We've believed from the beginning that many donors would like to see a separate trust fund for donor contributions, possibly under the World Bank or the United Nations," said Alan Larson, the under secretary of state for economic affairs. "Now we are hard at work on it."
The call for aid comes at a time when the occupation of Iraq is costing the United States more money across the board. Last Wednesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld disclosed that military operations in Iraq were costing $3.9 billion a month, nearly twice the estimate the administration issued in April.
The more the United States needs others to help run Iraq, the more likely it is to share power. Some experts say the same dynamic could unfold militarily.
"The administration faces a classic trade-off between keeping control and getting outside participation," said James Dobbins, who has run or helped run the reconstruction of Kosovo, Haiti, Afghanistan and other countries. "This administration does not want to lose control, but they'll have to take another look at that position."
Mr. Dobbins, who is currently director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation, said that providing security in Iraq would probably require twice the roughly 160,000 foreign troops who are there now, and that other countries that join the rebuilding effort might not want to serve under the command structure set up by the American military.
Similarly, he said, international aid to Iraq may have to be carried out under an entirely different structure than the one currently contemplated.
"The United States will have to share power to secure resources for Iraq and to establish an image of legitimacy," he added.
The donor conference for Iraq is to take place in New York City in October. A preliminary meeting last month in New York drew more than 50 interested nations as well as representatives of the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and several independent relief organizations.
The financial reserves being used to run civilian operations in Iraq are going to run out at the end of the year, or perhaps shortly thereafter, and it is far from clear how much oil revenue will be available for Iraq's reconstruction.
The current supply of about $7 billion for Iraqi nonmilitary operations came from several sources, administration officials say. These include $1.7 billion in Iraqi assets frozen in American banks since 1991, $900 million found in hiding places in Iraq and $1.6 billion from Iraqi oil sold before the war.
In addition, the United Nations has set aside $1 billion in development funds for Iraq, and Congress appropriated $2.4 billion for Iraqi reconstruction contracts by the Bechtel Group and other companies.
Administration officials say this money will be used up by the beginning of next year.
Meanwhile, L. Paul Bremer III, the occupation administrator, has submitted a budget of roughly $6 billion for the rest of this year, and it is expected that the amount for 2004 will be considerably higher.
Oil revenues for Iraq, if the country somehow manages to resume pumping two million to three million barrels a day, could bring in $15 billion to $22 billion per year at currently projected oil prices, administration officials say. But a considerable amount of this money will have to be used to pay for food, medicine and other basic needs.
The Bush administration is exploring a number of ideas about how to use oil revenue to pay for the reconstruction, according to John Taylor, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs.
One proposal would generate tens of billions of dollars by "securitizing" the oil revenues -- borrowing large sums up front and having them repaid over several years. But Mr. Taylor said that this idea would run up against Iraq's tens of billions of dollars in debt to foreign countries and companies, which would almost certainly challenge the first claim of any Iraqi "oil bonds" to oil revenues.
Other ideas include setting up a fund like Alaska's and making payments to individual Iraqis, perhaps by establishing individual retirement accounts. Some officials want to privatize Iraq's oil industry and use revenues for a widely held private company. Still others say that the revenues could be managed by a development board for use in major projects.
Administration officials say there may be resistance if other countries want some say in how money is spent for Iraq. Many officials are adamant that it will be the Coalition Provisional Authority, or C.P.A. -- the current name for the American and British led occupation -- that decides.
"It still hasn't entirely sunk into the international community, but the C.P.A. is the government of Iraq," said a senior administration official. "There are already unfortunate misunderstandings on that. But I cannot underline that often enough. The C.P.A. is the government of Iraq."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OCCUPATION; 
Rumsfeld Says Iraq May Need A Larger Force

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that the United States might need to send additional troops to Iraq to quell an increasingly well-organized guerrilla resistance, and warned that more American soldiers would die in attacks this summer.
 Mr. Rumsfeld also said for the first time that the attacks against American troops by remnants of Saddam Hussein's security forces, fedayeen fighters and Iraqi prisoners released before the war, were being coordinated at least regionally and possibly nationally. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld and his top aides had expressed optimism in recent weeks that American troop levels in Iraq could begin to decline as additional allied ground forces arrived later this summer and more newly trained Iraqi police officers took up positions around the country. 
But the increasing frequency and sophistication of the attacks against American forces and Iraqis helping them have stirred alarm among American officials and caused commanders and Mr. Rumsfeld to rethink force levels.
"It seems to me that the numbers of U.S. forces are unlikely to go up," he said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." "Now, could they? You bet. If they're needed, they will be there."
There are 148,000 American and 13,000 non-American troops in Iraq now, with 17,000 more allied soldiers pledged to arrive over the summer. Mr. Rumsfeld said 28,000 of the 60,000 Iraqi police officers needed were now on the job. American occupation leaders also plan to train a new Iraqi army of 12,000 soldiers within one year, expanding it to 40,000 within three years.
As recently as Wednesday, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Rumsfeld had agreed with Gen. Tommy R. Franks, who recently stepped down as the commander of troops in the region, that the overall number of foreign troops in Iraq would stay about where it is for the foreseeable future. At the same time, he suggested that some troops from other nations would replace United States soldiers, reducing the American presence somewhat.
"It would be incorrect to say that we expect that international forces will replace all of U.S. forces," Mr. Rumsfeld said under intense questioning by senators. "We don't anticipate that."
In his testimony, he also said that if the strains of American deployments of ground troops around the world forced the Pentagon to seek to increase the size of the Army and the Marines, "clearly, we will come to Congress and ask for an increase," adding, "But at the moment, we do not see that that's the case."
Mr. Rumsfeld is to be briefed this week by military commanders on how long troops now in Iraq ought to be kept there, and on which units might leave. They would be replaced by other American forces as part of a rotation that changes the mixture of troops from those specialized in intense combat to those better suited for keeping the uneasy peace and sporadic hostilities.
Today, Mr. Rumsfeld confirmed that American officials were bracing for a possible new wave of attacks against United Statesforces during the next week to coincide with anniversaries tied to Mr. Hussein and the Baath Party.
The anniversaries include July 14, the date of the 1958 coup against the British-backed monarchy, which under Mr. Hussein was celebrated as Iraq's National Day; July 16, the date that Mr. Hussein took power in 1979; and July 17, the date of the Baath Party revolution in 1968.
"We expect that the summer is not going to be a peaceful summer," Mr. Rumsfeld said on the ABC News program "This Week," noting the increased resistance. "It's pretty clear that in a city or an area, there is coordination. We don't have any good evidence that it's nationwide or even a large region, but it's possible."
On "Meet the Press," Mr. Rumsfeld warned of more American casualties, saying: "Are people being shot at? Yes. Is it a difficult situation? You bet. Are more people going to be killed? I'm afraid that's true."
Speaking with more urgency than in the past, Mr. Rumsfeld said capturing or killing Mr. Hussein was paramount so as to deny guerrillas a rallying figure and to ease the fears of other Iraqis that the former president could somehow return to power.
"The fact that Saddam Hussein has not been found does cause a problem," he said on "This Week." "We do need to find him. We do need to get closure."
When asked about the cost of the Iraq mission, Mr. Rumsfeld said on "Meet the Press" that the $2 billion-a-month price tag in April was an estimate by The New York Times. But in fact, the Pentagon comptroller, Dov S. Zakheim, was quoted in The Times on Friday as the source of that figure. Appearing 30 minutes later on "This Week," Mr. Rumsfeld cited the April figure as the Pentagon's and acknowledged that the postwar costs had roughly doubled, to about $4 billion a month.
In discussing the attacks on American forces, Mr. Rumsfeld said on "Meet the Press" that many of them seemed directed at stalling efforts to establish a new Iraqi government and to rebuild the economy.
"The leftovers, the dead-enders from that regime, are targeting our successes," he said. "I'm afraid we are going to have to expect this to go on."

HEADLINE: Why We Die, Why We Live: A New Theory on Aging 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
As you write yet another check to cover your children's ruinous college bills, there is definitely a bright side to consider: if you weren't doing this, you'd long since be dead.
 This cheerful insight comes courtesy of the evolutionary theory of aging. The theory holds that animals generally die shortly after reproducing because extra life would not lead to more surviving offspring, the only criteria for success in evolution's playbook. Species that provide parental care, however, can escape the usual curtain call for a time because in them natural selection has a basis to favor genes that promote post-reproductive longevity -- the so-called grandmother effect. 
 This theory, developed by William Hamilton and others, has become the classic explanation of the way evolution tunes the genes that shape the life cycle of each species. But there are various features of the human life cycle it does not explain well: why juvenile mortality is bunched into the first years of life and then declines, for one.
Biologists and demographers are greeting with considerable enthusiasm a new theory of aging that extends Hamilton's idea and explains the features it doesn't account for well. The new theory, proposed by Dr.Ronald Lee, a demographer at the University of California at Berkeley, was published in today's issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
"I think it's a path-breaking paper of enormous importance in the biology of aging," said Dr. James Vaupel, director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. 
The classic theory explains aging in terms of natural selection and fertility through the life cycle. Dr. Lee's insight is that parental care, too, is of persistent importance. The classic theory acknowledges parental care in the grandmother effect, but Dr. Lee gives it much greater weight, saying it should be factored in throughout the life cycle. People start life as receivers but gradually switch over to being givers as they have children of their own. 
Dr. Lee's theory predicts that mortality at any age through the life cycle is caused by a combination of two factors: the classic effect of how much reproductive life is left and the transfer effect, the economist's phrase for parental care.
In nonsocial species in which parents do not invest in their children, there is no transfer effect, and the classic theory applies. In social species that have reached the optimum balance between how many children to have and how much to invest in them, differences in fertility no longer make much difference and the rate of aging is controlled entirely by the transfer effect, Dr. Lee's theory states.
The evolutionary shaping of the human life cycle was presumably completed during hunter-gatherer days, before the invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Dr. Lee has tested his theory on life cycle data from the Ache, contemporary hunter-gatherers of Paraguay, and on data from 18th-century Sweden. He finds his equation for the transfer effect gives a better fit to these two sets of mortality data at each age than does the classic theory of aging.
Dr. Lee's theory explains why mortality is high among infants but rapidly drops; mutations that cause death late in childhood, when much has been invested, are removed more quickly from a population than are mutations that cause death in infancy. His theory can also explain the reduction of mortality after menopause: women care for children and contribute to their survival. 
Dr. Alan R. Rogers, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Utah, said in an e-mail message that Dr. Lee's paper was the "first theory to provide a cradle-to-grave account of human mortality rates."
"It is remarkable that a single theory can account both for the decline in mortality over the first few years of life and also for the extended postmenopausal life span of human females," Dr. Rogers stated.
"This is the most comprehensive evolutionary theory of aging that we have seen to date," Dr. Rogers wrote in a commentary.
Dr. Lee said he developed the theory after doing basic reading in evolutionary biology while preparing an introductory lecture in demography. "As I started to read, it didn't make sense to me," he said.
Under the classic theory, mortality should be constant throughout childhood, Dr. Lee said, but it seemed obvious that evolution would conserve investments made in a child and act to reduce mortality as a child grew older. "That's how I got started," he said.
Two other problems the theory does not explain well, he said, are postreproductive survival and the way that low fertility evolved in the creation of menopause. "My theory shows that all three problems are closely connected, and all can be solved through attention to parental investment," Dr. Lee said in a e-mail message. "I don't think anybody has realized this before."
He thought of calling his idea the "live-to-give" theory, he said, but it sounded too New Age and Californian.
The theory does not have immediate practical consequences. But by showing the interconnection between fertility, mortality and parental care, the theory may point to new areas of study. "What we have right now from Ron's theory is a framework crying out for empirical work," said Henry Harpending, an anthropologist at the University of Utah. "The theory tells us what to measure."
Dr. Vaupel of the Planck institute said the theory did not explain the gradual increase in longevity that had occurred among many industrialized populations in the last century because this improvement stems from environmental causes, not genetic ones. But it may help explain the evolutionary basis for "why parents are so generous about helping their children."
That's another thing to think about as you grind out those college checks.

 BODY:
 HIGHLIGHTS

GERMANY: PLUNDERED ART
A commission charged by Germany's federal, state and local governments with helping to return art looted by the Nazis to its rightful owners gathered yesterday for the first time. "It's not that we've just discovered the issue," the culture minister, Christina Weiss, told a news conference in Berlin. "We have cleared up legal matters, but that does not end our ethical and moral responsibility." She said the commission, based in Magdeburg, would mediate cases in which both parties asked its help, news agencies reported. Among the eight members of the group are its chairwoman, Jutta Limbach, president of the Goethe Institute and the former chief justice of Germany's highest court; the former German president Richard von Weizsacker; and the former parliamentary speaker, Rita Sussmuth.

MUSIC: DONIZETTI WORLD PREMIERE
This story begins in packets of music bound in soot-covered cloth and found in 1984 in a storage basement in Covent Garden, London. Inside were two acts of "Elisabeth," the French version of a long-lost opera composed more than 140 years earlier by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), perhaps best known for "L'Elisir d'Amore," "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "Don Pasquale." The missing act was found later in the same storeroom, and further detective work has led to the performance billed as a Donizetti world premiere, to take place at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Venetian Theater at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y. The performance will be repeated at 8 p.m. on Saturday. Conducting "Elisabeth" will be the man who found the packets in 1984, Will Crutchfield, above, Caramoor's director of opera. The opera, inspired by an actual event in 1804 that led to a best-selling novel in 1806, tells of a young woman who journeys on foot from Siberia to Moscow to seek the czar's pardon for her father, an unjustly exiled count.

BRANCUSI RESTORATIONS
Rain-damaged Brancusi sculptures are to be restored by an Italian company under a Romanian government contract, the Romanian culture ministry announced yesterday. Among the works of stone and cast iron to be restored by Lithos, a company based in Venice, are "Lovers' Kiss," "Table of Silence" and the 100-foot-high cast iron "Endless Column," Agence France-Presse reported. The restoration, to be completed by the end of October, will be financed by a contribution of $4.9 million from the World Bank and $1.2 million from the Romanian government. The art has been on permanent view in Turgu Jiu, near Brancusi's birthplace in southwest Romania.

EXHIBITION: NEW ENGLAND HISTORY
The little teapot belonged to Crispus Attucks, the first martyr of the Boston massacre. The fish-shaped silver sewing kit was the property of Abigail Quincy, wife of the patriot Josiah Quincy. Along with nearly 200 other objects, including paintings, textiles, furniture, photographs, costumes, jewelry and stuffed animals (like the teddy bear, above), they chronicle more than 300 years of life in New England. All will be on view from tomorrow through Oct. 27 in "Cherished Possessions: A New England Legacy," a touring exhibition making its debut at the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Me. Assembled from the Society for the Preservation ofNew England Antiquities, based in Boston, the show will travel through 2005, stopping in Fort Worth, Honolulu, New York and Grand Rapids, Mich.

EXHIBITION: PETS AND THE CITY
Furry, feathered or finned, pets play a prominent role in the life of the city. Beginning today, the New-York Historical Society and the Humane Society of New York are joining to examine the evolution of pets from their early appearances in the New World to their integration into the urban family. "Petropolis: A Social History of Urban Animal Companions," through Nov. 9 at the New-York Historical Society, includes paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs and artifacts. The exhibition is divided into four sections: "Beautiful Beasts From the Wild Kingdom," examining animal companions from the 17th century through the Colonial and Federal periods; "Creature Comforts: Domesticity and the 19th-Century Pet," dealing with the gradual embrace of domestic companions; "Urban Animals and Spaces," about the alteration of social customs and city spaces by pet owners, and "Obsession: Loving Relations and Deluxe Pet Services," about the services and devices available in New York.

FOOTNOTES

A performance billed as the New York premiere of the Gran Quintetto in Do by the virtuosic double bassist Giovanni Bottesini (1821-1889) will be presented at 8 tonight by the Washington Square Music Festival near the statue of Garibaldi in Washington Square Park, near La Guardia Place and West Fourth Street. The composition, for double bass and string quartet, was discovered at the Conservatorio Niccolo Piccini in Bari, Italy, by the double bassist Jeffrey Levine, the featured player tonight. . . . Acting "upon reflection," Marvel Comics has abandoned plans to portray Diana, Princess of Wales as a mutant superhero in a series titled "Di Another Day" in its forthcoming X-Statix comics, the BBC reported.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OTHER FORCES; 
India Decides Not to Send Troops to Iraq Now

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 14 

 BODY:
In a sharp blow to America's postwar plans in Iraq, India refused today to send peacekeeping troops there.
 The Bush administration had hoped that India would send a full army division of 17,000 or more soldiers to serve in the Kurdish region around Mosul, and exerted considerable pressure on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to do so. 
 That would have made the Indian contingent second in numbers only to the American in the occupation force and given a more international texture to a group that consists overwhelmingly of American and British troops. It would also have permitted the Pentagon either to send some troops home or to redeploy them to more volatile Sunni Muslim areas in the center of Iraq. 
Pentagon officials said that the possible troop contributions by India had not been included in the tally released by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld last week, when he told Congress that 19 nations had forces supporting the Iraq effort and 19 more had promised troops.
About 19,000 foreign troops already are in Iraq, Pentagon officials said today, a number that is expected to rise to at least 30,000 by October. Discussions continue with almost a dozen other nations, officials said. 
The State Department's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had discussed India's decision with the United States ambassador, Robert Blackwill, but declined to say whether the United States was disappointed by the move.
"It is a decision that each country needs to make on its own, depending on its interests and its concerns about the situation in Iraq," Mr. Boucher said. "I think you're aware that we're in discussions with a long list of countries about participation in the stabilization of Iraq, and we welcome those who have made those decisions to participate."
The Indians' vote not to send troops was taken today by the cabinet's committee on security, after several months of uncertainty and debate.
"Our longer-term national interest, our concern for the people of Iraq, our long-standing ties with the gulf region as a whole, as well as our growing dialogue and strengthened ties with the U.S., have been key elements in this consideration," India's foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, said in a brief statement to journalists after the meeting.
The war in Iraq is extremely unpopular here.
Even as American troops were approaching Baghdad in early April, Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the war as unjust and calling on the United States to withdraw. Media reports spoke of antiwar demonstrations in hundreds of cities and towns. A poll in the current weekly newsmagazine Outlook showed 69 percent of respondents opposed to sending troops to Iraq; other polls have put the figure as high as 87 percent.
The politics loomed larger with elections coming this fall for five state legislatures, four of them in the Hindi-speaking heartland that is controlled by the opposition Congress Party. These elections are expected to set the tone for national elections in September 2004.
"Public opinion is sharply critical of the war," said Praful Bidwai, a prominent journalist. "It just doesn't make sense for Indian soldiers to be basically used as cannon fodder when the U.S. is getting bogged down and taking casualties."
The Americans had pressed hard to get India to send the troops. When the deputy prime minister, Lal Krishna Advani, visited Washington this spring, he was greeted by Vice President Dick Cheney; Secretary Rumsfeld; the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and even President Bush.
Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal received similar treatment, meeting with Ms. Rice and the deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz. The Pentagon dispatched a team here to help plan the Indian deployment.
Some in the Indian government argued for the deployment, contending that a closer relationship with the only superpower would strengthen India's international position -- particularly in relation to rival Pakistan, which has tied itself to Washington in the war on terrorism. Some also suggested that India could get a lucrative slice of postwar reconstruction contracts.
A retired general, Satish Nambier, argued in an essay in Outlook that sending a force to Iraq would, in "considerations of realpolitik," give India a chance to be a major player on the world scene. Still, he hastened to begin the essay by underscoring his "total opposition to the unilateral" American operations in Iraq.
Writing in the same magazine, a columnist, Prem Shankar Jha, expressed a more prevailing view, suggesting that the situation in Iraq was changing for the worse.
"To send troops now -- without knowing what they will be called on to do, how long they will have to stay, and when and how their task will be completed -- would be to push many of them to a pointless death," he wrote. "Iraq has not been liberated, but invaded and occupied. The Iraqis know it, resent it and are preparing to resist it. If India sends its troops to Iraq now, it will be as part of an occupation force. Stabilization will mean oppression."
Some within the ruling Hindu nationalist coalition were strongly opposed, including the defense minister, George Fernandes, and other military and security officials.
Two left-leaning former prime ministers, Indar K. Gujral and V. K. Singh, issued a statement against deployment of Indian forces to Iraq. 
"We believe irreparable damage will be done to India's reputation and good name if Indian troops were sent to prop up the occupation of Iraq," they said. "Above all, it will be unwise and unfair to our army to send them on a mission to risk their lives where no national interest is at stake."
The government statement said that "careful thought" had been given to the matter and that India "remains ready to respond to the urgent needs of the Iraqi people for stability, security, political progress and economic reconstruction," adding that India was planning with Jordan to set up a hospital in Najaf as a "concrete gesture of our support to the Iraqi people."
The statement added that "were there to be an explicit U.N. mandate for the purpose, the Government of India could consider the deployment of our troops in Iraq." 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 17, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about India's decision against sending 17,000 troops to Iraq as requested by the United States misspelled the name of an Indian general who recently wrote that troops in Iraq would increase India's international influence. He is Satish Nambiar, not Nambier.
The article also misstated the name of a former prime minister who issued a statement opposing Indian troops for Iraq. He is V. P. Singh, not V. K. Singh.

HEADLINE: Wider Budget Gap Is Seen 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
The White House plans to release its latest projections on Tuesday for the federal budget deficit in this fiscal year, and Congressional budget authorities said today that the figure would be well over $400 billion. 
 That is higher than the $304 billion predicted five months ago for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. It would be the largest-ever budget deficit in dollar terms but, seen as a percentage of the economy, smaller than those in the Reagan administration. 
 The budget experts said their estimates were based on calculations by the Congressional Budget Office and on the announcement last week that it was costing almost $4 billion a month to keep troops in Iraq.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Newsof Strong Profits Fuels Climb, Despite Late Sell-Off

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Better-than-expected profits from Citigroup and Bank of America lifted Wall Street yesterday as investors grew more optimistic about a strong economic rebound. A late-day sell-off, however, limited the gains.
 The Dow Jones industrials rose as much as 158 points before losing momentum in the final hour of trading. Analysts said it was unclear whether reports of a trading error at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were behind the drop or if investors turned cautious after the large run-up. 
 "The rally began March 11 and we're now entering the fifth month. On top of that we had a 160-point move -- so it was up, up and away. There might have been an aspect of too much, too soon," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 57.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 9,177.15. The Nasdaq composite index increased 20.89 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,754.82, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.72 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,003.86.
Dow component Citigroup advanced 97 cents, to $47.12, after the financial institution reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates by 3 cents a share. The bank also raised its quarterly dividend to 35 cents from 20 cents.
Bank of America rose 58 cents, to $83.46, after it posted quarterly profits that also topped expectations.
Intel, another Dow component, gained 68 cents, to $24.02, after Merrill Lynch raised the technology company's stock rating to buy from neutral. The company releases its quarterly earnings report today.
"Citigroup and Bank of America tend to be a pretty good litmus test for the financial services sector as a whole. If they feel good, that's a good sign for the rest of economy," said Doug Sandler, chief equity strategist at Wachovia Securities.
But shares lost some of their early gains after an apparent error in electronic trading in stock index futures. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange was forced to unwind certain trades, and rumors about the error also affected the market, analysts said.
While stocks have surged in recent months, investors have been watching the second-quarter earnings season for evidence that the economic recovery is firmly under way. Analysts say companies will largely meet, if not beat, expectations, creating more opportunities for stock gains.
"We're getting some indications that the rally was actually based on something fundamental" rather than investors' expectations, said Ed Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management Inc. in Boston. "With all this news coming together, it's mostly good."
Two merger announcements also gave the market a lift.
Overture Services climbed $2.54, to $24.05, after Yahoo agreed to buy the Web-search advertising company in a deal worth about $1.63 billion. Yahoo inched up 1 cent, to $32.20.
OfficeMax increased $1.42, to $8.60, after Boise Cascade agreed to buy the office-supplies retailer for nearly $1.2 billion in cash and stock; the deal will double the size of its office products distribution business. Boise Cascade declined $1.56, to $21.87.
Decliners included Cigna, which fell $3.45, to $41.04, after the health insurer lowered its 2003 earnings estimates, citing a $100 million restructuring that had not gone as well as planned. The president of Cigna HealthCare, Patrick E. Welch, is also leaving the company.
McDonald's dropped 66 cents, to $21.92, even though the fast-food chain said it expects to meet Wall Street's estimates for second-quarter profit; the earnings, however, are still 2 cents a share lower than results in the quarter last year.

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury prices fell yesterday as gains in stocks and expectations of faster economic growth curbed demand for fixed-rate investments.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 27/32, to a price of 99 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.73 percent from 3.63 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11 6/32, to 109 6/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.77 percent from 4.68 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Report Criticizes NASA's Shuttle Maintenance and Predicts Further Fatal Accidents 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
Even if NASA corrects the problem that doomed the Columbia, the agency is likely to lose more shuttles before the fleet reaches its planned retirement date of 2020, according to the draft of a study done for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.
 "Given uncertainties about the full set of causes for the loss of Columbia and given unforeseen and unplanned aging issues, it is not obvious that the shuttle system will reach even a 30-year life of useful service," says the draft, written by the RAND Corporation. NASA hopes to fly the shuttles for 40 years. 
 Other studies have concluded that the shuttle fleet is at risk of a high rate of catastrophic accidents. But this examination focuses much more closely on potential safety problems related to the shuttle fleet's age and is implicitly critical of NASA for not doing everything possible to monitor problems like rust and metal fatigue. 
The study, by Dr. Jean Gebman, an expert in aircraft aging, cites corrosion and fatigue of aging metal and parts, as well as the general level of reliability of the shuttle fleet. It is based on an older RAND estimate of shuttle risks, updated with the experience of the Columbia crash earlier this year.
The study, dated June 29, suggests that NASA needs to get a better grip on some potential age-related problems. For example, it says the agency never performed fatigue testing on the shuttles' wings although the wings are susceptible to cracking because they are flexed during liftoff, re-entry and transport. Metal fatigue occurs with repeated flexing; the civilian aviation industry has been attuned to the problem since the roof of a Boeing 737 operated by Aloha Airlines tore off during a flight in April 1988.
Heating on re-entry can also cause strain on materials, according to the report. Even when the shuttle's thermal protection system works as designed, the study says, "different parts expand differently," creating internal tensions.
Dr. Gebman's draft quotes what appears to be a finding by the accident investigation board -- that NASA has not tested the wings or their subassemblies for fatigue.
At NASA, however, Dr. Michael A. Greenfield, the associate deputy administrator for technical programs, said that when the agency was developing its shuttles, in 1979 and 1980, it used the Challenger to test the effects of flexing on the wings. A wing of that shuttle was fitted with 2,000 sensors and bent back and forth to 110 percent of the load it was designed to take, he said. The design life of the orbiter was 100 flights, so the wing was tested to 400 flights, he said. (The accident that destroyed the Challenger on liftoff in 1986 was caused by a faulty seal in its rocket booster.)
"We know the fatigue properties of the materials -- they are very well characterized," said Dr. Greenfield, who is co-chairman of NASA's "return to flight" program. 
Dr. Greenfield said the thermal stresses had also been measured and matched the predictions of engineers during the design.
But Dr. Gebman, when he testified before the Columbia accident board in April, made a point of saying fatigue in composite structures was not as well understood as fatigue in metals. This made an impression on Dr. Sheila Widnall, a member of the board. "I was afraid of that," she said at the time.
Dr. Gebman's draft also says NASA has deferred inspections for corrosion, even though standing water had occasionally been found inside the Atlantis (which is still available to fly) and the Columbia after rainstorms. The Columbia and the Discovery have each had corrosion behind the crew cabin, a spot that is hard to inspect and hard to repair.
At one time, NASA had a "corrosion control board," but the study said it apparently no longer exists.
Al Feinberg, a spokesman for NASA, acknowledged that corrosion inspections and repairs had been deferred at times but said that the corrosion control program itself still existed. Any postponement of an inspection or repair has been made "only after it has been assessed by engineers and been determined that it's minor and absolutely no safety issue," Mr. Feinberg said.
Neither the Challenger accident nor the Columbia one appears to have been caused by aging parts. The Columbia broke apart on re-entry apparently because of wing damage caused on liftoff by a chunk of foam thrown off the external tank. The wing part that the foam hit, a leading edge panel, is known to be susceptible to degradation over time, and the accident board has already complained that NASA is not properly tracking the condition of those panels. But the impact was so severe that it would have damaged even a new panel, board members said.

HEADLINE: Seabiscuit Slept (With Lots of Mares) Here 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: WILLITS, Calif., July 8 

 BODY:
Few people in this scrappy former timber town nestled in the redwoods would disagree that the most famous citizen ever to hail from here was short-legged, knobby-kneed, somewhat scrawny and ill-tempered -- a mud-colored underdog, not unlike Willits itself.
 That is why, as the premiere of a major motion picture based on the book "Seabiscuit: An American Legend" looms, the Willits Chamber of Commerce has recently opened a boutique called All Things Seabiscuit. Why the mayor has issued a proclamation temporarily changing the name of East Commercial Street to Seabiscuit Boulevard. Why the Baechtel Creek Inn and Spa is putting the finishing touches on a new Seabiscuit Room. And why the Mendocino County Museum has installed an exhibit of Seabiscuit memorabilia, including his custom-made leather skullcap -- so he would not hit his head on the overhang of his private rail car -- and a silver-plated horseshoe from the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap on loan from Bob Hope. 
 Though the family of Charles S. Howard, the multimillionaire owner of the racehorse that captivated the nation in the late 30's, pulled up stakes here not long after Seabiscuit's death in 1947, the Seabiscuit connection still runs deep. It is on display at the Noyo Theatre, where the movie will have an advance "hometown" premiere on July 19, and at O'Leary's Feed and Seed, where horse owners buying two doses of Ivercare horse de-wormer get a free Seabiscuit cap. 
But nowhere is Seabiscuit's spirit more deeply felt than at Ridgewood Ranch, a majestic 5,000-acre swath of otherworldly scenery tucked into the Coast Range, where under an oak tree -- exactly which one remains a secret -- the hallowed thoroughbred is buried.
In contrast to Charles Howard's day, when Bing Crosby lolled about the spring-fed swimming pool, today the ranch is owned by the 35 or so members of Christ Church of the Golden Rule, a spiritual community of aging Christians and back-to-the-landers who have owned and tended Ridgewood since the early 60's. 
Last year, after the publication of Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book, the church, along with the Chamber of Commerce and the county museum, started offering "Home of Seabiscuit" walking tours, for which there are now over 400 people on the waiting list. "Guys call and get really emotional," said Lynn R. Kennelly, the chamber's executive director. "It's bizarre."
Although not technically a native -- he was born at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky -- Seabiscuit lived out a cushy retirement on the ranch after his racing career came to a close in 1940. Then the world's richest horse, who had set a dozen records over six distances at eight tracks, he spent his final seven years siring "little Biscuits" and being visited by thousands of fans, ensconced in the red clapboard stud barn that is now being restored by the Rotary Club of Willits.
The ranch was also where the critically injured horse and his jockey, Red Pollard, came to heal in 1939. Shortly after defeating his archrival War Admiral at Pimlico, Seabiscuit had ruptured a ligament in his left foreleg, creating widespread doubt that he would ever race again. Pollard, meanwhile, needed to recover from a potentially crippling injury he had suffered in a race aboard another horse.
Seabiscuit and Pollard spent a year together on the ranch, nursed back to health by Dr. Raymond Babcock, before going on to electrify the nation by winning the $100,000 Santa Anita Handicap, where victory had twice eluded them. It was also Doc Babcock, a beloved fixture in Willits. who tried in vain to save the life of Howard's 15-year-old son, Frankie, after a truck accident on the ranch. 
Around Willits, there are still plenty of old-timers who were delivered into the world by Doc, whose evocative home movies of Seabiscuit and that era have recently been restored by the museum. Among them is Lee Persico, 69, a real estate broker who as a 3-year-old sat on Seabiscuit. 
"Willits was always proud of Seabiscuit," Mr. Persico said. "But it fell through the cracks until the book brought out the notoriety."
George C. Atkins, 86, Doc Babcock's son-in-law, recalls Doc's descriptions of the horse. "The doctor said Seabiscuit was a very intelligent horse; you could almost tell what he was thinking."
"He's a good horse," Mr. Atkins added. "He was the most talked about individual in Willits."
For Willits (population 5,073), the Seabiscuit revival -- "a silver platter," in the words of Ms. Kennelly, the Chamber of Commerce official -- comes at an opportune moment. Situated at "the gateway to the redwoods," as the nostalgic arch across the highway proclaims, the town has yet to experience the affluence that has blanketed Sonoma County to the south and the tourist areas along the coast of Mendocino County. In fact, it has experienced virtually no growth in the last decade. Once home to some 35 sawmills, it is now down to one, and its median household income in 1999 was just $26,283, compared with the national median of $41,994.
Willis represents the more humble side of a geographic and cultural divide; the other side is symbolized by picturesque coastal villages like Mendocino, with their Italian linens and fancy wine lists.
To people in Willits, where manure from horses flecks the streets and feed stores coexist with hydroponic "grow stores" frequented by marijuana cultivators, Mendocino is the equivalent of War Admiral. "When tourists go to Mendocino, they spend the weekend at a B and B, and buy pottery and polo shirts," said Dan Ripke, director of the Center for Economic Development at the Chico campus of California State University. "Willits is a pass-through where they buy gas and go to Burger King en route to dropping off the rental car in Portland, Ore."
Tracy Livingston, 60, the ranch representative of Christ Church of the Golden Rule and chief tour guide, draws parallels between the national obsession with Seabiscuit in the 1930's and the horse's comeback in Ms. Hillenbrand's vivid prose. "Here we have uncertain times again," Mr. Livingston said, walking toward the stud barn along Seabiscuit Drive. "We have war, and lots of displaced workers in Willits."
The church bought the ranch, where the sun breaks preternaturally through the morning fog, in 1962. Over the years, church members have been salvaging bits of history, patching up buildings and encountering horseshoes in the organic garden and yokes in the barns. "There was life left here," said Ellen Bartholomew, 43. "It's a trip when you live in a place with this much history. But then there's the burden of maintaining it."
The ranch tour coinciding with the movie premiere on July 19 is a complete sellout. Tourists will visit the Howard house, where Bing Crosby's guest room has a treble clef in the linoleum; the neo-Classical bathhouse, its faded elegance still palpable beneath the vines; and the stud barn, the roof bearing a still-resplendent weather vane of horse and jockey, believed to be Seabiscuit and Red Pollard, riding upright.
Jani Buron, 66, who grew up at the ranch in the 1940's as the daughter of a foreman, will share memories of yearly fall cattle roundups that featured "pot luck suppers and Orange Crush in a brown-ribbed bottle." She will remember climbing a stool to read the visitors' guest book, looking at names from foreign lands like New York, and Paris, and the lost freedom of riding a horse over thousands of acres.
Mr. Livingston will show off the graffiti etched in paint by iron nails beside the scale, believed to be Seabiscuit's weight; the dining room now filled with Seabiscuit memorabilia and photos; and the horseshoes framed in redwood that have been salvaged from the stud barn -- horseshoes, he said hopefully, that "could have been Seabiscuit's."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about efforts in Willits, Calif., and by the nearby Ridgewood Ranch to promote interest in the racehorse Seabiscuit, who retired there, misspelled the surname of a man who recalled having heard about the horse's intelligence from his father-in-law, the jockey's doctor. He is George C. Akins, not Atkins.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Skid Row Resists an Upgrade 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 13 

 BODY:
The eastern quarter of downtown Los Angeles is a cattle pen, an outdoor outhouse, a human calamity. It is the largest concentration of homelessness in the country.
 Thousands of people in the 50 blocks known as Skid Row live on the sidewalks in tents and cardboard condominiums. Thousands more sleep on mission cots, in the back seats of automobiles and in flophouses. Those who can manage it take hotel rooms with creaking bedsprings that let for $107 a week, plus a $2 deposit for a pillow. 
 A welfare check will buy two weeks in a hotel, an unemployment check will buy three, a Social Security check four. For most, the cash stream dries up in the middle of the month, and then they are back on the street, riding the carousel of misery until a new check arrives. 
Skid Row has been 100 years in the making, but things are changing in the "Nickel," the center of homelessness in a city with 41,000 homeless people, a number that is by all accounts rising. With housing scarce and rents high, there is an effort to revitalize the bleak district bound by Main, Alameda, Third and Seventh Streets into something livable and neighborly.
Downtown property is hot. Government agencies are moving in. The Roman Catholic Church recently consecrated a $189 million cathedral, and developers have plans to convert fleabag hotels like the El Dorado and the Frontier into lofts and condominiums. Five thousand housing units are in the works.
The holdup is Skid Row, whose outer edges are now an incongruous mix of women in rags and mudlike faces and women in sweet perfumes and tailored suits.
Once, long ago, this was the choicest part of the city. Silent-movie stars and presidents stayed in hotels like the Alexandria, with its opulent staircases and marble walls. Today, welfare families live there, and the surrounding streets are chockablock with cut-rate garment shacks, liquor stores, warehouses, flower and fish wholesalers and people felled by mental diseases, drugs and bad luck.
Police Chief William J. Bratton, borrowing a page from his days in New York, has instituted sweeps against the so-called quality-of-life criminals who, as the theory goes, will graduate to bigger crimes if left unchecked.
The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the city, arguing that it is rousting sidewalk sleepers without giving them beds. Recently, the city agreed to pay nearly $170,000 to dozens of homeless people who were caught up in the sweeps and then filed suit, charging improper arrest.
Chief Bratton defends the crackdown. "Many there don't want help," he said. "They'll take food and free clothes, but they want to live on the streets. While I have compassion, my job is to do something about it."
Skid Row reeks of a chicken yard. The portable toilets are often used as shooting galleries by addicts, or as makeshift bordellos. Dealers also peddle in front of churches and in view of the local police station.
The women without shelter sleep near the safety of the missions. The mentally ill are left to their demons. The hardcore stay on St. Julian Street -- stickmen with glittering eyes and violent impulses. The hotels are occupied by Mr. Smith and Mrs. Jones. The rule of thumb says half the guests are drunk, one-third are crazy, a quarter are service veterans and nearly all have a police record.
Five in the morning is when the police start to roust people from their tents and boxes, the missions begin making breakfast and the smell of coffee permeates.
"I walk at night and sleep in the day," says Alonzso Regazzi, 37, a not-so-down-in-the-heels type who says he does not belong on these gum-stained boulevards. He recently had a job in a doctor's office, he says, and his turn in fortune can be blamed on a nagging wife called crack.
Mr. Regazzi is better off than most out here, with his polished shoes and college education. He is one of the few who, when they hit bottom, bounce. His unemployment checks come every other Thursday, totaling about $775.
"You can't go lower than Skid Row," he says, having found himself a room near the Harbor Freeway. He offered to show a visitor around.
The Midnight Mission on Los Angeles Street is considered the superior eatery on Skid Row. A person is not made to listen to a prayer lecture before being allowed to the table, and there are seconds and thirds. 
A clean-looking man, Larry Hatcher, inquires about a friend who fell on hard times. One woman is crying, asking Jesus something. Another says she will not appear in court to answer a ticket for sleeping on the sidewalk.
"They give you a ticket for sleeping on the sidewalk?" Mr. Hatcher asks, arching an eyebrow. "Where are you supposed to go?"
"Jail," says Joy, the one with the ticket.
"Out of the state," says her friend Heidy Pandolfi.
"So my friend could be in jail?" asks the man.
"He probably is," snaps Joy.
Mr. Hatcher appears shocked. He wipes his eyes. "I didn't know it was like this," he says. "There's a lot of misery."
A sign above the women quotes what was, until recently, a rarely enforced law: "No person shall sit, lie, or sleep in or upon any street, sidewalk or other public way."
A man across the street disassembles his tent, arguing with an invisible roommate. The gates on the trinket shops that sell pink poodles and "I <heart> L.A." T-shirts rattle open. When business opens, it's time to get up, and by 8 a.m., the homeless are moving again, headed nowhere.
Homelessness is on the rise across the county, experts say. Unemployment is up, housing is scarce, counties and cities are cutting budgets. In New York, the number of people seeking shelter is up 65 percent since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, officials there say. In Chicago, the number of homeless families is up 35 percent from 2001. But in Los Angeles, the problem is gargantuan. With half the population of New York, it has more people on the streets than New York has in its shelters. An additional 45,000 people are homeless in greater Los Angeles County. While New York will spend $640 million on homeless services this year, Los Angeles will spend just $50 million and provide fewer than 13,000 beds.
"The lack of concern for the homeless in Los Angeles is disgraceful," says Lee Baca, the Los Angeles County sheriff, who is fond of saying that his 20,000-bed jail is the largest homeless shelter and psychiatric hospital in the city. "The punitive approach solves absolutely nothing without services to get these people integrated back into society." 
Officials who drive out the homeless are like children who push vegetables around a plate, claiming they are gone, said Clancy Imislund, the managing director of the Midnight Mission, himself a former Skid Row resident. "Homelessness is an unsolvable dilemma," Mr. Imislund says. "New York throws $640 million to enable people to keep doing what they're doing. In my 29 years here, I'm convinced not much can be done. All we can do is to help the few that want it and give comfort to those who need it."
The history of vagrancy in Los Angeles is a long one, beginning in the 1870's, when the railroads converged on downtown and the first tramps stepped off the trains. The Midnight Mission was founded in 1914, and now serves 55,000 meals a month. In 1936, during the the Depression, the police began their so-called Bum Blockade, keeping out-of-town migrants and tramps from entering the city. In the early 1980's, when the mental hospitals emptied out, the city concentrated services for the down-and-out on Skid Row.
A city within a city has developed, with citizens from everywhere. Some come from prison, some are runaways, some are former foster children who turned 18, some are refugees of the 9-to-5 world, some are mothers with children. More than half are alcoholics, studies show.
As the shadows grow longer and the afternoon cools, the flies dissipate and action on the street picks up. People leave their rooms, the overpasses, the shadows of the missions. Bills change hands, bundles of euphoria are exchanged, and the missions start preparing supper.
Alonzso Regazzi says he is caught in this world. He fell into the street life a few years ago, drew away, and came back. He sees Skid Row as a spectacular social failure.
"They really are right to clean this place out," Mr. Regazzi says, walking down Los Angeles Street, on the shady part of the boulevard, explaining his life to a stranger.
Sobering up was the easy part, Mr. Regazzi says. "The hard part is facing the world after you're sober."
"So people get addicted to the chaos," he offers. "It's easier than working."
There are, of course, programs. He tried them. But programs only work for those who want them to work. "Jesus helps those who help themselves, right?" Mr. Regazzi says.
There are many ways to earn a living here, he adds: drugs, prostitution or selling parking-meter time to commuters using the old slug-on-a-string method. Welfare is available to indigent single adults -- $212 a month from the county -- but recipients must prove they are seeking work, and so many do not bother.
People here commonly die by the knife, by the needle, by the front end of a bus, but rarely by suicide, Mr. Regazzi says. He recommends the Hotel Cecil, a common stop on the coroner's route.
"It's the best on Skid Row," Mr. Regazzi says. He stays there occasionally. The lobby is done up with a two-tone marble. There is a small diner and a security man at the elevator. A thumb print and cash are required. The halls are filled with laughter. The toilet on the 15th floor is overflowing.
Outside the hotel, a few men stand around selling drugs. One thin man tells Mr. Regazzi that it wouldn't hurt him to look, and Mr. Regazzi gets the feeling that this very man will someday be preaching on this very same corner. The police circle by, and the hustlers scatter.
A few duck into Crabby Joe's bar at Main and Seventh, and when a crowd like this enters, a little guy named Ike gives the twice-over before dispensing a drink. 
Mr. Regazzi nurses a beer, considering the totality of his life. It is growing dark outside. "I'm not like the bums out here," he says. "I'm not born to it. I've never lived in a tent. I'm sure I'll look back on this when I crawl out and say I knew what the bottom was like." He finishes his beer. Ike watches him go out. 
A woman is howling under the street lights. "I been in this neighborhood 30 years," Ike says, "and I don't see nothing changing. It's never going to change."

HEADLINE: Their Health Costs Soaring, Automakers Are to Begin Labor Talks 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 14 

 BODY:
The Big Three automakers, which open contract talks with the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday, are making a bigger issue out of reducing medical costs than they have in years.
 But the union has staked out health insurance as untouchable. "We're not going to share costs," said Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, at a recent news briefing. 
 Instead, many in the automobile industry think, the union, knowing the competitive pressures that Detroit is under, may give ground on issues like wage increases, plant closings or work rules. The matter of controlling medical costs would remain largely untouched. 
Health costs have been soaring for many employers. In other industries, businesses have generally passed along more and more of the costs to workers and retirees, if they maintain benefits at all. Not so in the auto industry, where union leaders have negotiated some of the most substantial medical benefits in the country for their members.
What is more, in contrast to recent years when sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks were highly profitable, vehicle prices are falling, if one factors in the effect of interest-free financing and rebates as high as $4,000.
Proposals in Congress to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare would help the likes of General Motors, the largest automaker and also the nation's largest buyer of popular drugs like Viagra, Prilosec and Nexium. A recent Goldman, Sachs report referred to the proposed drug plans in Congress as the "automaker enrichment act."
But even this change would barely scratch the surface of the Big Three's health cost problems. For G.M., which is also the largest private buyer of health care in the United States, such a plan might trim $2 billion from the $57 billion health care liability it projects in coming years.
As contract talks open, few expect anything like a strike over health care payments because both sides have too much to lose. G.M. and the other big American producers, Ford and Chrysler, could little afford a strike in the face of bruising competition from foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda. And as the Big Three go, so goes the U.A.W., whose membership has dwindled to fewer than 650,000 at the end of last year from 1.5 million active workers in the late 1970's. 
"The balance of power has shifted to the unions' favor because they have the power to shut the companies down, and these companies, because of international competition, are very fragile," said Douglas A. Fraser, a former president of the U.A.W. and now a professor of labor relations at Wayne State University.
"There would be devastation if there were shutdowns even for a few weeks," he said. "But the union knows the competitive landscape and will exercise that power with intelligence."
In the late 90's, the booming sales of high-margin sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks helped mask sharply rising health care costs. But now, the hold of the Big Three on the sport utility and pickup truck market is under assault from far more profitable Japanese automakers, which have better reputations for quality.
That has left domestic automakers fighting to hold ground, offering incentives three times as large as those of Toyota, Honda and Nissan, yet still watching their market share diminish in a sputtering market. 
The absence of a national health system in the United States means that the Big Three take on social responsibilities that the governments in Japan and Germany bear. Gary Lapidus, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, referred in his recent report to the Big Three as "H.M.O.'s with wheels" that only happen to make cars. G.M. alone provides medical coverage to nearly half a percent of the United States population, when dependents are included. 
And although Toyota and Honda assemble in the United States most of the cars they sell here, their plants are much newer, their work forces younger and their retirees number in the hundreds, not the hundreds of thousands that depend on the Big Three. They are also not unionized, except in joint ventures with the Big Three.
While the out-of-pocket health costs of auto workers have not risen in years, many American workers have seen quite the opposite, and even white-collar Big Three employees can pay several hundred dollars a month in premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses. Auto union members enrolled in H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s generally pay $10 or less for prescriptions or visits to the doctor. Everything else is covered. 
As a result, many analysts think that the domestic auto industry is in a bind similar to the one that crippled the domestic steel industry. Both feature shrinking companies burdened with health and pension obligations to armies of retirees, as well as labor contracts originating in a time of much less global competition.
Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health care economist, calls the Big Three "a social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself."
"It's insane to think that a company embedded in a fierce global competition can function as a social insurance system," he said. "It is a crazy, anachronistic idea. It's an idea that worked in the 60's, but lost its validity beginning in the 70's when the car market became global." 
The Big Three and their major suppliers spend some $9,000 and up per active worker annually, according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting, compared with $5,758 at the average large company. That rises to about $15,000 for retirees not covered by Medicare, including benefits for dependents, and $3,500 to $4,000 for retirees eligible for Medicare. 
For G.M., the problem is most acute. The company has 2.5 retirees for each active worker in the United States, a function of its domestic market share shrinking to less than 30 percent today from 60 percent in 1960. Ford has one retiree for each active worker in this country. 
Last year, G.M. had medical expenses of $5 billion and Ford $2.8 billion. Drug costs reached $1.4 billion for G.M. and $800 million for Ford.
Both Toyota and Honda declined to provide similar breakdowns of their health costs, but no one disputes that they are far lower. Seventy percent of Ford's $2.8 billion health bill went to retirees, a burden foreign automakers have yet to contend with in this country.
Many Big Three retirees opt for expensive traditional plans that let them choose any doctor. Last year, 72 percent of Ford's blue-collar retirees were enrolled in traditional plans, compared with 23 percent of its active workers.
At large companies nationwide, 6 percent of active workers pick such plans, according to Mercer, and Toyota said its North American factory workers were in line with that figure. 
G.M.'s medical cost is equivalent to about $1,200 a car in this country. 
So what could G.M. do with that money? A substantial job "dramatically upgrading the appearance and the feature portfolio," said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst at Auto Trends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J. Start with a sunroof, which costs a few hundred dollars, Mr. Phillippi said. Or, "$1,200 would buy you the top-of-the-line navigation system," he said, adding that such a feature generally costs a consumer $2,500 "and they could give it to you for free."
"Or it could be used to dramatically improve the overall level of the powertrain of the vehicle," he went on "or you could pour a lot of that money into sharply upgrading the interior. You could go from vinyl to leather."
But how do you ask factory workers who perform grinding physical labor to retreat from hard-won health benefits? More difficult, how do you ask retirees?
"It's a killing job," Mr. Fraser, the former union president, said of the stresses and strains of auto work. "What an auto worker wants is peace of mind and security, and health care is security."
Gregory Stack, 46, a union member who is a car designer for Chrysler and once was a G.M. factory worker, said the problem was with the health system itself -- runaway drug costs, malpractice suits, unnecessary surgery. 
"Once we do give up some aspect of our benefits," he said, "it will continue to escalate. We're the highest of all industrialized nations on health care spending. It is not a sustainable model, but it won't be solved by being placed on the back of the U.A.W. rank and file."
For many analysts, the health care problem is emblematic of the Big Three's broad problems and also an incentive for auto manufacturing to shift to countries like China, where hourly wages can be counted in pennies, or even Canada, which has a nationalized health care system and far lower costs. 
"When the industry lived in a cocoon and could price to reflect its cost, these were not issues," said Maryann Keller, a longtime auto analyst. "But now, the union has to be worried what the cost of production is in China because that's what's relevant to the ability of G.M. to support its benefit structure 10 years from now."
Health care is only one piece of the competitive puzzle. G.M. recently undertook one of the largest sales of corporate bonds, worth $17.5 billion, and used the bulk of the proceeds to offset a $19 billion pension deficit.
Toyota and Honda also benefit from currency and quality advantages. And while G.M. has been making significant advances in quality, it takes years for consumer perceptions to catch up. 
Ms. Keller said, "If G.M., Ford and Chrysler can't find a way to make huge margins on some of their production, like they did with sport utilities in the late 90's, there is absolutely no way they can afford to pay these benefits."

HEADLINE: Officials Favor Larger Site For Trade Center Complex 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Struggling to solve an urban-planning Rubik's Cube, the Port Authority is now inclined to expand the World Trade Center redevelopment site to the south by acquiring the property on which the doomed Deutsche Bank tower stands.
 Since planning began last year, it has never been clear how the trade center superblock alone could comfortably accommodate 10 million square feet of commercial space -- roughly what used to be there -- and also provide room for a memorial, transportation and cultural centers, new streets, shops and the space and infrastructure below ground needed to make it work. 
 "If we maximized it to 10 million square feet, I don't think it would be as distinguished as if we were to move some of that square footage off the site," Joseph J. Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
"It would make it better from a city planning point of view to move one of the buildings to the Deutsche Bank site," he said. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. Seymour said, that prospect has been in the public eye for months, since one of the best-known renderings of the redevelopment plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind clearly shows a large new building on that site, bounded by Liberty, Albany, Washington and Greenwich Streets.
While public discussion has focused on the memorial, the Freedom Tower and the Wedge of Light, the Port Authority turned its attention to Daniel Libeskind's idea for a 50-story tower on the property owned by Deutsche Bank, whose building was damaged in the Sept. 11 attack. 
"We said, 'Let's at least explore it and see what it would buy us,' " said Anthony G. Cracchiolo, director of priority capital programs at the Port Authority. "In this preliminary look-see, it looks like it could buy us a lot."
Mr. Seymour said the Port Authority has held discussions with the bank, which an official at Deutsche Bank confirmed. Whether the property would be purchased or acquired by condemnation is subject to future negotiation, Mr. Seymour said. The amount of floor area to be built on the site might range from 1.5 million to 2 million square feet.
Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said that the corporation's interest is in preserving Mr. Libeskind's architectural vision. "Putting a building on the Deutsche Bank site is one way which would ensure we could realize that vision," he said.
Mr. Seymour said the authority also wanted "to make sure the city is on board" with the proposal, acknowledging the possible interest of the Bloomberg administration in a mixed-use building that also had apartments. Requests for comment from the mayor's press office were not answered.
What stands on the site now, shrouded in black netting, is a 40-story tower formerly known as 1 Bankers Trust Plaza that was taken over in 1999 by Deutsche Bank.
The 1.4 million-square-foot building was seriously damaged in the 2001 attack and has never reopened. After months of uncertainty, it was learned last month that the structure was to be taken down.
The Port Authority also has its eye on a block bounded by Liberty, Cedar, West and Washington Streets. Mr. Seymour said, "That would be the next step" after talks with Deutsche Bank.
An undefined mid-rise building is shown on that block in the Libeskind rendering. A spokesman for the Port Authority said no definite use has been assigned to the site.
This block was where the tiny St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church stood until it was crushed under the collapse of 2 World Trade Center. The rest of the block was a parking lot owned by the Milstein family.
Port Authority planners envision a park on either or both of the southern sites. And they held out the possibility of reconstructing St. Nicholas near its original site.
An important impetus for expanding the site lies below street level, said Robert I. Davidson, chief architect for the Port Authority.
The underground volume at the trade center site will be shared by the sunken memorial; the PATH tracks, passenger platforms, mezzanine, concourse and electrical substation; the subway tunnel for the 1 and 9 trains; utility lines; concourses for commuters and shoppers; and building foundations.
To this, add the labyrinth of driveways, ramps and security devices for inspecting vehicles. "It's a Rubik's Cube," Mr. Davidson said. If the main ramp is on the west, it cuts into the memorial zone. If it is moved eastward, it interferes with tracks, foundations and retail space.
But if the underground security area is moved south of Liberty Street, he said, it creates considerably more flexibility for the ramp network and also opens new space.
If the trade center site alone is used, Mr. Seymour said, it might be necessary to build an office tower directly over the PATH transportation center on Church Street, which renderings show as a vast glass-enclosed chamber.
Mr. Seymour likened that to plans advanced in the 1960's to build a skyscraper over Grand Central Terminal, which New York City fought all the way to the United States Supreme Court. "We're supposed to be smart enough," he said, "to learn from the mistakes of the past."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Crossing the Street, Expanding the Site"In the plan put forward by Studio Daniel Libeskind, two buildings across Liberty Street from the original World Trade Center would complete a ring around ground zero. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering the acquisition of one or both of those two sites: the Deutsche Bank building (formerly 1 Bankers Trust Plaza), which has stood empty since the Sept. 11 attack, and a block on which St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church used to stand, surrounded by a parking lot. The church might be rebuilt on that site, authority executives said. Map of New York City shows the proposed site plan.

A Holiday To Keep Under Wraps

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
YESTERDAY, according to a decades-old tradition, was Iraq's national day, commemorating the overthrow of the British-supported monarchy in 1958.
 Across New York City, countless Iraqis observed the day by not holding parades or rallies or street fairs. There was nothing going on outside the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations, on East 79th Street. No glad-handing local politicians showed up. The city didn't even bother to suspend the alternate-side parking rules. In New York that is the ultimate sign of a holiday's not making the grade. 
 You could hardly blame Iraqis here for not getting into the spirit of things, what with the war and all. Besides, over the weekend, a self-declared interim government abolished a bunch of holidays associated with Saddam Hussein's rule, July 14 among them.
Even at the Iraqi Mission, people were at a loss about whether to celebrate. "We don't have anything coming from Baghdad," an official there said over the phone, "so I can't tell you."
Fair enough. That is why it seemed reasonable to let the Iraqis sort things out for themselves and to turn instead to another country whose day of glory arrived yesterday. Like Iraq, this is a place that many Americans have come to view with anger, suspicion, scorn and even, at its most virulent, hatred.
What finer moment than Bastille Day to check out how the French are faring?
After the bashing of their country for opposing the Iraq war, after the headlines calling them "weasels" and "cheese-eating surrender monkeys," after the vows to boycott wine and other things French, after the chest-thumping about how true American patriots clog their arteries with "freedom fries" instead of French fries, has the climate improved for the French in New York, at least un peu?
"It seems to have calmed down a bit," said Jean Lachaud, a translator who sits on a council that advises the French government on expatriate matters.
The recent meeting between President Bush and President Jacques Chirac, though hardly warm, has helped improve the mood. So have the questions about whether Mr. Bush bent certain facts about Mr. Hussein's pursuit of nuclear weapons. "That might make some of the more extremist members of the press be a little calmer, right?" Mr. Lachaud said.
Even so, he acknowledged, some of his compatriots remain self-conscious. It does not mean they are hiding the Chateau Margaux in brown paper bags. But "some people did say they were worried about showing their French accent in public," Mr. Lachaud said.
David Black, executive director of the French Institute Alliance Francaise on East 60th Street, also detects skittishness among French expatriates. "I don't think they're used to being cast in a negative light as they have been," Mr. Black said.
Still, his institute held its annual Bastille Day fair along 60th Street on Sunday, and by his count some 10,000 people turned out, all friendly. "There could have been demonstrators," Mr. Black said. "There could have been bad feelings. There was none of that -- absolutely nothing."
Another fair was held yesterday on Macdougal Street outside the restaurant Provence, at SoHo's northern edge. Men and women played petanque, a French version of lawn bowling comparable to the Italians' boccie. To the inexpert eye, it seemed a game best enjoyed in the absence of complete sobriety.
INSIDE, the restaurant manager, Marc Minet, acknowledged that business was down this year, by perhaps 20 percent. The war and the anti-French mood have hardly helped, he said. Then, too, neither have the limping economy and the city's new smoking ban.
"It can only get better now," Mr. Minet said. The restaurant owner, Michel Jean, also saw no reason to despair. After all, he said, this is not a small town like Beaufort, N.C., where a restaurant called Cubbie's has made a name for itself by putting "freedom fries" on the menu. Never mind that "restaurant" and "menu," not to mention "Beaufort," are French in origin.
"New York is New York," Mr. Jean said. "New York is not America, like Paris is not France. People are more open."
A dash of mature behavior would not be bad, suggested Walter Wager, a mystery writer who made sure on the Fourth of July that he dined at a French restaurant near his home on the Upper West Side. "I think there are all kinds of French," he said. "There are as many jerky French as nice French. And vice versa."
Much the same may be said about Americans, sans doute.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OCCUPATION; 
G.I. Killed and 6 Are Wounded in Ambush

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 14 

 BODY:
An American soldier was killed and six others were wounded in a bold guerrilla attack at dawn today in the heart of the city's affluent Mansour district. 
 Unidentified assailants fired several rocket propelled grenades at a military convoy of the Third Infantry Division, military officials said. Evidence of the firefight had been cleared by the time Iraqis headed to work in morning traffic. 
 American forces are at a higher state of alert this week after the formation of the first postwar government since Saddam Hussein was deposed in April. The alert is also associated with Saddam-era anniversaries: July 14, marking the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, and July 17, marking the coup that brought the Baath Party to power a decade later. 
The holidays were abolished by the interim Iraqi Governing Council, which was formed on Sunday. 
This morning's attack occurred on the first full day of deliberations by the 25 members, who met privately for more than five hours. Iraqi officials said the Council would send a delegation to New York this month to claim Iraq's seat at the United Nations. The step, some members said, would confer greater legitimacy on the governing body, though a spokesman for the United Nations special representative here said the staff was not aware of the plan.
An hour after the Council members finished meeting, an unknown assailant threw an explosive device from a speeding taxicab at a car parked nearby, engulfing the vehicle in flames, the Iraqi police said. 
An Iraqi official said the delegation going to New York would include Adnan Pachachi, a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations; Ahmad Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National Congress, and Akila al-Hashemi, who worked in Iraq's Foreign Ministry under Mr. Hussein. Another official said the group might include Jalal Talabani, a Kurdish leader who is also a council member. 
In their session today, the Council deferred the sensitive question of who would be chairman by setting up a rules committee to recommend ways to rotate the leadership. The Council formed two other committees, one to develop an agenda of priority issues and a second to draft a policy statement. 
Iraqi officials said that L. Paul Bremer III, the American occupation administrator in Iraq, joined part of the discussions. He asked the Council for recommendations on how to develop an accelerated training program for 70,000 municipal police officers and on how to set up a special court for prosecuting those charged with war crimes. 
In addition, Mr. Bremer asked the Council to review the problems of re-integrating the 400,000 members of Mr. Hussein's armed forces through job training and other programs. 
But some of the most intense discussions centered on how the Council would project itself to Iraqis, many of them skeptical that the body is anything more than an extension of Mr. Bremer's authority.
At one point Mahmoud Othman, the elderly Kurd who was an adviser to Mustafa Barzani, the late leader of the Kurdish revolt of the early 1970's, asked the group where it derived its legitimacy, a sensitive point.
Mr. Hashemi, a seasoned diplomat under Mr. Hussein, replied that the interim government's legitimacy was derived from a United Nations resolution that called for an interim administration. 
Mr. Chalabi objected, and said the new government had to assert its independence from both the occupation powers and the United Nations. The interim government's legitimacy, he said, according to those present, arises from "the struggle of the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam Hussein and our participation in that struggle."
In brief comments to reporters, Mr. Bremer suggested that the occupation powers would still direct the rebuilding of Iraq.
Asked whether the Council would have the authority to sign contracts and make decisions about privatizing state corporations, Mr. Bremer responded, "The coalition made it very clear in its discussions yesterday with the Governing Council that we consider that the coalition has very broad authorities to determine the direction of the Iraqi economy."
Foreign investment in Iraq, Mr. Bremer added, "is an issue on which the Governing Council will obviously want to give its advice, and we intend to listen very carefully to whatever the Governing Council has to say."
Another council member, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said he expected Iraq to have a fully functioning government within two years, at which time, he said, American and British troops should leave.
"Nobody wants the Americans to stay one day longer than they are necessary," Mr. Rubaie said.

Longer Commitment of G.I.'s
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) -- The Pentagon said today that thousands of soldiers from the Army's Third Infantry Division would not return home by September as expected but would stay in Iraq indefinitely.
Maj. Gen. Buford C. Blount III, the division's commander, last week announced plans for the division to return home during July and August. But the Army reversed itself today, saying the return of 9,000 of the division's troops had been suspended.
The Pentagon deployed about 16,500 Third Infantry Division soldiers during the war, and about 15,000 remain in Iraq and Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Bush Seems to Favor Sending a Modest Force to Liberia 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
President Bush today gave his strongest indication yet that he would send a small force of American troops into Liberia to help enforce the cease-fire there. But he said that he was waiting for further information from military teams in the region before deciding, and that the peacekeeping operation would ultimately be taken over by the United Nations.
 After meeting at the White House with the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, Mr. Bush said the United States would help West African countries bring peace to Liberia, which has been racked by fighting between rebels and troops loyal to the government of President Charles Taylor. 
 Mr. Bush, who spent last week in Africa, said any American military involvement would be limited in scope and duration andwould be conditional on Mr. Taylor's stepping aside.
He said that if he sent in American troops it would be to support those coming from other African countries under the umbrella of the Economic Community of West African States, which is known as Ecowas.
His remarks were hedged but seemed to indicate that his remaining decisions were less about whether American troops would be involved than about how they would be deployed and in what numbers.
"What I'm telling you is that we want to help Ecowas," Mr. Bush said in response to questions from reporters. "It may require troops, but we don't know how many yet. And therefore it's hard for me to make a determination until I've seen all the facts."
He said American military teams in Africa were "assessing Ecowas strength -- how soon, how quick, what kinds of troops, who they are -- to determine what is necessary from our side to fulfill the commitment I have made that we will help maintain the cease-fire," Mr. Bush said.
Pentagon officials have been considering a variety of options, including limiting the American participation to logistics, command and communications support. Among many in Liberia, the presence of even the assessment team in the capital, Monrovia, has raised hopes that the United States will finally bring peace after years of fighting.
Mr. Annan, who has been pressing the United States to take a military role in stabilizing Liberia, said he was pleased with what he heard.
"I'm satisfied with the discussions we've had and the approach the U.S. government is taking," Mr. Annan said. "And of course there is an assessment team in West Africa. But we have more or less agreed to a general approach on the Liberian issue, and I'm very pleased with that."
Mr. Annan, who was in Africa last week discussing the issue, said his understanding was that the West African nations would send 1,000 to 2,500 troops to Liberia. He said Mr. Taylor would then leave Liberia, as Mr. Bush has been urging him to do, at which point more peacekeeping troops, perhaps including some from the United States, would arrive. Then, he said, the United Nations would take over the peacekeeping operation and American forces would leave.
One American assessment team is in Liberia and another is working with the countries of Ecowas on what kinds of forces they intend to contribute.
"I think everybody understands that any commitment we had would be limited in size and limited in tenure," Mr. Bush said. "Our job would be to facilitate an Ecowas presence, which would then be converted into a U.N. peacekeeping mission."
The fighting in Liberia has led to widespread bloodshed, a growing refugee crisis and the threat of the conflict spreading.
Mr. Taylor has agreed to a cease-fire plan under which he would step down as president and leave the country, probably for Nigeria. But it is unclear whether he will follow through on the agreement, especially because he faces war-crimes charges lodged by a United Nations-backed tribunal in neighboring Sierra Leone.
While the State Department has been pressing for a vigorous response from the United States to Liberia's problem, the Pentagon has been skeptical, reflecting a long-held view within the military that American forces should not be put at risk for peacekeeping operations in which there is no compelling national security interest for the United States.
From the Pentagon's perspective, the loss of 18 American soldiers in Somalia during a peacekeeping mission in 1993 still stands as a lesson in the perils of inserting the United States into African conflicts. In an indication of how sensitive the Pentagon remains to the safety of American military personnel in the region, it said today that it had moved four aircraft and about 100 troops into Sierra Leone and Senegal in case the assessment team in Monrovia needs to be evacuated.

HEADLINE: No-Show Equals No Vote, Irate N.A.A.C.P. Hosts Say 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, July 14 

 BODY:
Leaders of the nation's most prominent black civil rights organization attacked three Democratic presidential candidates today for failing to show up for a forum that the group held here at its annual convention.
 The six Democratic presidential contenders who did attend the forum by the N.A.A.C.P. appeared on a stage alongside empty chairs with placards bearing the names of the three who did not attend: Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio. 
 President Bush did not attend either -- a chair was placed on the stage for him, too -- but his absence was not unexpected, particularly since he has not been to a convention of the N.A.A.C.P. since he took office.
It was the absence of the Democrats that appeared to cause the biggest stir among the delegates who were attending the meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at the Miami Beach Convention Center. 
"You now have become persona non grata," the N.A.A.C.P president, Kweisi Mfume, said, referring to the candidates who did not attend. "Your political capital is the equivalent of Confederate dollars."
Georgia F. Allen, the president of the Virginia Beach chapter of the N.A.A.C.P, agreed. "I would say to the African-American community nationwide not to even consider voting for any of the candidates who did not attend this forum," she said.
In one sense, the incident reflects the difficulties every candidate has had in trying to accommodate the crushing demands of the various and sometimes competing constituencies that make up the Democratic Party.
But that said, the campaigns of Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Kucinich moved quickly to quell the controversy, issuing statements saying, in effect, that the candidates meant no offense by their absence.
Jano Cabrera, a spokesman for Mr. Lieberman, said that the campaign had notified the N.A.A.C.P. days ago that the senator had a prior commitment and therefore could not attend today's forum. He noted that in June, Mr. Lieberman attended the 32nd annual conference of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the organization run by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
"While we cannot accept every invitation that is extended, no one should question Senator Lieberman's commitment to racial equality and equal opportunity," Mr. Cabrera said. "His record, dating back to the 1960's when he marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and personally fought for the rights of African-Americans to vote in Mississippi, is as strong as anyone's."
Erik Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Gephardt, said that he, too, attended last month's Rainbow/PUSH conference but could not take part in the N.A.A.C.P. forum because of an "unavoidable family obligation."
Jeff Cohen, a campaign spokesman for Mr. Kucinich, said that the congressman thought it would be a mistake for him to leave Washington on a day when Congress was voting on important legislation, including expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
"Congressman Kucinich has the utmost respect for the N.A.A.C.P., its leadership, its members and its mission," he said, but "strongly believes that it is wrong to campaign across the country on the issue of expanding health care coverage and then miss one of the most important health care votes in years."
The forum itself offered few surprises, with the Democrats in attendance taking just about every opportunity to attack Mr. Bush's policies on a hostof issues.
At the same time, they reaffirmed their commitment to affirmative action and creating economic opportunities for black Americans, who have a significantly higher unemployment rate than white Americans.
While most of the audience was black, all of the candidates were white, with the exception of Carol Moseley Braun, the former senator from Illinois, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who drew the most cheers with his typically caustic oratory.
In her opening comments, Ms. Braun warned of extremists in the Republican Party in Washington who "threaten the progress we have made." Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts retold a story he told to Mr. Jackson's group last month, one about the kinship he forged fighting alongside a black man in Vietnam. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina spoke of having grown up in the South witnessing the indignities of segregation. Senator Bob Graham of Florida spoke of his role in expanding opportunities for minorities when he was governor of Florida. Howard Dean reaffirmed his opposition to the war in Iraq and talked about expanded access to health care when he was governor of Vermont.
But it was Mr. Sharpton who brought the crowd to its feet. Mr. Sharpton compared the Democratic Party to the late Lester Maddox, the former governor of Georgia who in the 1960's chased black patrons from his restaurant with an ax handle.
"Any time we can give a party 92 percent of our vote and have to still beg some people to come talk to us, there is still an ax-handle mentality among some in the Democratic Party," he said, raising an ax handle. "I want to stop people from wanting our vote but not wanting to be seen with us in public, treating us like we are some political mistresses."

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SAYS IT HAS MADE FUEL FOR ATOM BOMBS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
North Korean officials told the Bush administration last week that they had finished producing enough plutonium to make a half-dozen nuclear bombs, and that they intended to move ahead quickly to turn the material into weapons, senior American officials said today. 
 The new declaration set off a scramble in American intelligence agencies -- under fire for their assessment of Iraq's nuclear capability -- to determine if the North Korean government of Kim Jong Il was bluffing or had succeeded in producing the material undetected. 
 Officials said today that the answer was unclear. A preliminary set of atmospheric tests for the presence of a gas given off as nuclear waste is reprocessed into plutonium is the best indicator the United States has from one of the world's most closed nations. The most recent tests suggested that nuclear work has accelerated, but the results were inconclusive. More test results are expected at the end of this week. 
"It's the mirror image of the Iraq problem," one official said. "We spent years looking for evidence Iraq was lying when it said it didn't have a nuclear program. Now North Korea says it's about to go nuclear, and everyone is trying to figure out whether they've finally done it, or if it's the big lie."
North Korea boasted in April that it was working to convert its 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into weapons-grade plutonium. The rods had been held under seal by international inspectors until the inspectors were expelled from the country on Dec. 31. Several months ago, American spy satellites saw the rods being hauled away from a storage shed, though it is unclear where they were taken.
North Korea's latest declaration, if true, would pose a direct challenge to President Bush,who said two months ago that a nuclear-armed North Korea "will not be tolerated." 
Mr. Bush will be faced with difficult choices. Early this year, he decided it was too risky to take military action against the the North's main nuclear reprocessing plant, at Yongbyon, even before the reprocessing started. Now, though, the Pentagon may be asked to revisit the military options that Mr. Bush has always said are a last resort.
But the president must also decide whether to negotiate with the North -- under its implicit nuclear threat -- or hold fast to his insistence that any talks must include other regional nations, and that nuclear blackmail would be met with increasingly harsh sanctions.
In the months since the spent nuclear fuel rods were transported to an unknown location, North Korea has regularly escalated its claims. First, it said it needed a "strong physical deterrent" to protect itself against invasion by the United States. Then, after the Iraq war, it said it needed a "nuclear deterrent." 
But intelligence agencies have scant evidence that North Korea has produced enough plutonium to build a nuclear weapon, officials said. As recently as two weeks ago, American intelligence officials told South Korea and Japan that they believed that, at most, only a few hundred rods had been converted into weapons-usable material. Then they warned that the North was experimenting with the conventional explosives needed to ignite a nuclear explosion -- further evidence of intent to produce weapons.
The C.I.A. believes that North Korea may have produced two nuclear weapons in the early 1990's, but the evidence is in dispute. In any event, officials say the ability to produce a half-dozen more would greatly increase the North's leverage: it could conduct a nuclear test, store a few weapons and threaten to sell any leftover plutonium.
The North's latest declaration came on Tuesday in New York, during an unannounced meeting between North Korean diplomats at the United Nations and Jack Pritchard, a State Department official who handles North Korea issues.
"They went into new territory," said one official familiar with the meeting. The North Korean diplomats read a statement from Pyongyang declaring that the reprocessing of the rods, a chemical process that the North perfected in the late 1980's after receiving considerable foreign help, had been completed on June 30. 
The North Koreans then said weapons production was beginning. "They didn't say how long it would take, and they didn't threaten to sell anything," a senior official said. 
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that "North Korea has made a variety of claims" in the past, some false.
"We've always said that we will look at all of the available information, not just what they happen to claim or say at any given moment," he said. 
Despite the effort to play down the news -- Mr. Bush's aides have refused to call the Korea situation a "crisis," fearing that would play into Mr. Kim's strategy -- there is a debate in the administration about North Korea's intentions.
Some see last week's declaration as a negotiating ploy. They believe that North Korea has been frustrated by Mr. Bush's refusal to engage in one-on-one negotiations, insisting instead that China, Japan and South Korea act as partners in finding a regional solution. Mr. Bush's real motivation for resisting bilateral talks, his aides say, is that he fears that Asian nations will press the United States to reach some kind of deal similar to the one the Clinton administration signed -- a "freeze"on nuclear activity in return for aid.
Other officials believe that Mr. Kim's government has simply decided that it can make both Washington and its Asian neighbors accept North Korea as a new nuclear power.
"There's a body of thought that they are just getting everybody accustomed to the idea," a senior administration official said. "So when they say one day, 'We've gone nuclear,' it's no shock."

China Sends Letter to Kim
SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, July 15 (Reuters) -- President Hu Jintao of China has sent a letter to Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, and South Korea said today that it hoped that the message would help persuade Pyongyang to agree to multilateral talks on its nuclear aims. 
KCNA, the North's official news agency, said China's deputy foreign minister, Dai Bingguo, met Mr. Kim on Monday. KCNA did not disclose the substance of the letter.

HEADLINE: Canada Drops Its Key Rate After Setbacks To Economy 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 15 

 BODY:
Citing a list of unexpected setbacks to the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada lowered its key interest rate today for the first time in almost two years.
 The drop in the overnight lending rate, to 3 percent from 3.25 percent, reverses a steady rise in interest rates from April 2002 to April 2003 at a time when Canada boasted the strongest economy among major industrial countries. 
 Today, however, the central bank cautioned that "in recent months, there have been a number of unanticipated developments that bear on the outlook for inflation and economic activity in Canada."
Two setbacks have been health-related. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has killed 40 people in the Toronto area since the end of March and has severely damaged the country's tourism industry. In addition, more than 30 countries, including the United States, have stopped importing Canadian beef since a case of mad cow disease was discovered in Alberta in late May. Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, said earlier this week that Canada's cattle industry would be "down the tubes" if the bans were not lifted by the end of August. 
Foreign demand for other Canadian exports has been dampened by a surge in the Canadian dollar, caused partly by a widening gap between Canadian and American interest rates in the last year.
Today's drop in rates sent the Canadian currency sharply lower; it fell to 72.81 United States cents in the late afternoon, down nearly a cent. The currency reached a peak of almost 75 cents in mid-June.
Craig Wright, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, estimated that, as a result of the setbacks, growth in the second quarter slowed to an annual rate of less than 1 percent, adjusted for inflation.
Canada's finance minister, John Manley, said in late June that, based on private sector forecasts, the government was cutting its growth forecast for the year to 2.2 percent, from the 3.2 percent projected in February. The outlook for 2004 has also been trimmed to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Still, most economists were surprised by the central bank's move today. Mr. Wright said that prospects for the second half of the year were buoyed by recent signs of recovery in the American economy, the decline in the Canadian dollar and encouraging domestic economic data. Statistics Canada reported on Friday that the unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent in May, from 7.8 percent in April.
Even the specter of SARS has receded. "We're past the deepest part of it," said Terri Lohnes, acting policy director of the Toronto Board of Trade. Toronto officials and businesses are hoping for a large influx of visitors for a hastily organized outdoor concert by the Rolling Stones later this month. 
In another move to encourage spending in Toronto, the government of Ontario has exempted hotels, restaurants and movie theaters from provincial sales tax until September.
The interest rate increases last year and early this year were fueled by growing concern about inflation. The consumer price index peaked at 4.3 percent for the year to February, well above the Bank of Canada's target of 1 percent to 3 percent.
However, falling energy prices and the high Canadian dollar, which gives an edge to imports, have dampened inflation in recent months. The price index was up 2.9 percent in the year to May. "Inflation pressures have eased and more economic slack is opening up in Canada than was previously projected," the central bank said in today's statement.
"Today's rate cut should be the last move from the Bank of Canada this year," Mr. Wright said. 
Ted Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Canada, took a different view in a note to clients today, cautioning that if the Canadian dollar were to resume its climb, two more rate cuts would be likely later this year.
The bank's next review of interest rates is scheduled for Sept. 3.

HEADLINE: Hopes Brighten as Concern Persists in Japan 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 15 

 BODY:
After a dozen years of start-and-stop recoveries, economists in Japan might be forgiven for urging caution when looking at the latest growth figures. The revival of Japan's stock market in the last three months has begged the question, though, with many investors asking whether optimism, not wariness, is in order.
 But apart from the brightening of stock prices and some improvement in manufacturing, Japan's economy remains shackled by structural problems that have been only partly confronted, economists say. 
 The case for betting on a turnaround in Japan has been, and remains, tenuous. As in past recoveries, the country's biggest manufacturers are leading the way, but they remain dependent on overseas markets for sales and profits. If the United States economy fails to gather steam, or China's juggernaut is derailed, exporters will quickly feel the pinch. 
Japan's consumers, whose spending makes up about 55 percent of the economy, have learned to live with what are high unemployment rates by Japan's standards and falling wages. But stoicism is not the same as enthusiasm. Purchases of big-ticket items like homes and cars are muted, and rock-bottom interest rates and falling land prices are chipping into household savings accounts.
Department store sales in Tokyo, for instance, fell 2.8 percent last month, compared with June 2002, according to figures released today.
The country's policy makers are still sending mixed signals about their intentions. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi continues to push for higher taxes and smaller budgets at a time when the economy could use an additional shot in the arm. In the first quarter, the economy expanded 0.6 percent at an annualized rate, the slowest growth in a year.
The Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has reopened the monetary spigot, but not far enough to rekindle some inflation. In a two-day meeting that ended today, the central bank again left its monetary policy unchanged, rebuffing calls for more purchases of government debt or greater expansion of the money supply. Short-term interest rates are already a hairbreadth above zero.
Crucially, too, the nation's banks still must unload trillions of yen in nonperforming loans and unwanted stocks over the next two years to meet stricter regulatory guidelines. Though their cost of borrowing is near zero, banks have cut new lending for the last five years, depriving companies of needed cash.
"This is another false recovery," said Akio Makabe, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. "In the long run, Japan still depends too heavily on the U.S. and the economy is still carrying the heavy burden of bad debts and nonperforming companies on its shoulders. I doubt Japan's economy can stand on its own."
Stock investors, of course, discount many of these obstacles and instead focus on the prospects for companies in the coming year. For many of them, the 28 percent rise in the Nikkei 225 is more about the upturn in semiconductor prices, the brighter outlook for America's economy and the government's recent bailout of Resona Bank, which has halted speculation that the financial system might implode.
Many also say that Japanese stocks are cheap compared with years past and other major markets. For them, the Nikkei 225's hitting a 20-year low was a signal to buy, especially global giants like NEC, Fujitsu and Toyota Motor, which still have leading technology.
With fears of a doomsday meltdown fading, analysts have grudgingly acknowledged the recent sprinkling of better-than-expected economic figures, including stronger capital spending and industrial production. Economists now forecast growth of 0.9 percent in Japan this year, about double what was expected in February, according to Lehman Brothers.
Yet having seen one recovery after another dry up, some analysts even see danger in a stronger economy. They fear that Japanese executives and lawmakers will once again scale back restructuring efforts and economic stimulus at the first signs of a turnaround. While the strategy allows them to avoid making thorny decisions like whether to close a factory or cobble together another spending package, it also sows the seeds of the next downturn.
"Since the policy response is reactive rather than proactive, there are likely to be sharp setbacks and reversals whenever confidence (i.e., complacency) returns," Peter Tasker, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, wrote in a recent letter to investors.
The crucial question is when, or whether, such a reversal might come. Many economists, while raising their forecasts for this year, say the recovery will remain shallow and run its course within a year. Japan's problems are so entrenched, they say, that the expansion could reverse itself if markets overseas slowed or a major bankruptcy at home triggered an exodus from the stock market, as happened in 1997 and 2000.
Persistent deflation also means that while corporate profits are improving, companies are still under pressure to cut costs. This means the trail of companies moving offshore will continue and those that remain will hire fewer workers and trim wages. Toyota Motor, for example, earned a record 945 billion yen ($7.9 billion) last year, but approved only a minimal pay raise this year for its employees.
With the government showing little will to boost spending, banks under pressure to get tough with deadbeat borrowers and companies struggling to remain competitive, most economists dismiss the latest stock rally as premature. Instead, they are setting their sights even further into the future.
"It will require another cycle for the recovery to really kick in," said Mikihiro Matsuoka, senior economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. "We won't see a full turnaround until all the restructuring is finished in 2005."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: REBUILDING; 
Europe Weighs Helping Out in Iraq, but Under Its Own Terms

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15 

 BODY:
Despite bruising disagreements with the United States over the war in Iraq, Europe is tentatively offering to help pay for reconstruction, provided that the money is administered by an international agency like the World Bank or the United Nations, a top European Union official said today. 
 Christopher Patten, the European Union commissioner for external relations, told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the union was willing to establish a trust fund for Iraq. But he said Europe would not support turning over the money or the planning to the American-led occupation authority. 
 In meetings last month with administration officials, the European Commission said it would begin by providing about $112 million for reconstruction, Mr. Patten said.
Mr. Patten, a veteran diplomat, acknowledged that there was lingering resentment over the administration's march to war, but he said that the allies' difficulties in stabilizing Iraq made the need for European aid all the more critical.
"Whatever the differences we had on the war itself, we all have a stake in a stable and prosperous and open Iraq," he said. Referring to the occupation of the country, he added, "Let me choose my words carefully. There is a perception that this has turned out to be a lot more difficult than some people had said."
Mr. Patten said he would need to persuade the various European parliaments and the public to provide reconstruction money after a war most of them opposed. That task would be possible, he said, if the money were administered by the World Bank or the United Nations Development Program and if there was no perception that European resources were being turned over to the occupation force and its American contractors.
"None of this should be a problem for the administration, because they presumably want to maximize international involvement," he said.
The Bush administration has called for a conference of international donors in October to raise billions of dollars to restore Iraq's economy. Last week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said military operations in Iraq were costing $3.9 billion a month, or double the administration's estimate in April.
Yet, even as the administration hopes to share the financial burden, American officials remain skeptical of the need to involve international agencies, which would require ceding some United States control. Washington clashed with France and Germany over their refusal to support a United Nations resolution authorizing the war, and American officials chided the two nations as representatives of "Old Europe."
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said United States officials "welcome everybody's involvement," including Europe's. "We're talking to the European Union about how they want to give money," he said. "We'll work out the appropriate structures with them."
Mr. Boucher declined to comment on whether the administration would like to see Europe's contribution managed by an international agency. He noted that an international fund, which is supervised by representatives from various nations, already exists and that it receives donations.
Most Europeans still hold the view that their resistance to the war was correct, Mr. Patten said, but he said anger toward Washington had subsided and that awareness of a common interest was rising. The trick now is to find a mechanism for cooperation that is acceptable to all sides.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Former Nylon Capital Seeks the Next Great Fit

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: SEAFORD, Del., July 14 

 BODY:
For 65 years, this city, once dependent on shipping and on seafood provided by the Chesapeake Bay, has spun an identity from the first of the 20th-century miracle fibers, nylon.
 After the E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company chose this quiet Delmarva Peninsula community in 1938 as the site of the world's first nylon mill, Seaford became so invested in the chemical industry's blockbuster product that there is now the Nylon Capital Shopping Center and Nylon Boulevard. Indeed, the banner on the city's seal reads: "The Nylon Capitol of the World." One of the symbols on the seal is a bobbin of nylon yarn. 
 But as nylon has become more of a commodity, DuPont, which is based in Wilmington, has been cutting back. Employment at Seaford's nylon plant, on 550 acres just outside the city's incorporated area, has fallen from a peak of 4,600 workers in the 1970's to 650 today. This has forced the city of 6,700 to work at reinventing itself, in part by developing a municipal industrial park and a nearby business complex. 
Both the Seaford Industrial Park and the Ross Business Park are flat and featureless tracts characteristic of rural real estate developments carved out of fields. Amid the usual big boxes in the industrial park stands a vacant building that, although tucked out of sight, is very much on the minds of the city.
The 60,000-square-foot building was constructed by the city and the state about three years ago in hopes of attracting a new employer to Delaware. But so far, the $1.3 million speculative building has failed to land a tenant. 
The city is making it a priority to get the building occupied within a year. The effort is all the more important now that DuPont plans to spin off or sell its textiles and interiors business, which includes nylon, by year's end.
Both the industrial and business parks are on the other side of the city from the nylon operation on the Nanticoke River, which flows into the lower Chesapeake Bay. The parks are on land that once was part of the 1,400-acre plantation of Gov. William H. Ross, the state's most prominent Southern sympathizer during the Civil War. 
Delaware, a border state, stayed loyal to the Union. Mr. Ross, the second-largest slave owner in Sussex County and governor before the war, worked behind the scenes to help the Confederacy. Fearful of being arrested and charged as a traitor, he fled to England in 1862, said Claudia Leister, director of the Ross Plantation, a museum.
When the industrial and business parks are fully occupied, the plantation's 1860 Italian villa-style mansion, with its former slave quarters, will be nearly surrounded by development.
In the nearly 20 years since the city acquired 128 acres of farmland for the industrial park, 11 companies have located there, including Johnson Polymer, which makes specialty polymers and additives for the printing, packaging, paint, coatings and plastics markets. 
The 170-acre Ross Business Park, in development for about three years, has attracted a residential mental health treatment center for children. Recently, an accounting firm signed a contract for two acres for a new office building.
"We all felt the hit from the downsizing of DuPont, but not to the extent we could have," said Shannon R. Sapna, Seaford's economic development director. But the total number of jobs in both parks is about 200, a far cry from the thousands DuPont once employed.
Then there is the failure to attract a tenant to the speculative industrial building. Mayor Daniel B. Short said the economy was one culprit. Restrictions the state has put on the choice of tenant are another.
The Delaware Economic Development Office provided a no-interest loan to the city to construct the building, on nine acres owned by the city.
The state has stipulated that the building be leased or sold to a company from outside Delaware, six counties on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and two counties on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. 
"What we're looking to do is create new jobs. If a company came from those counties, people could just drive to work," said Jennifer Boes, a spokeswoman for the state development office.
Charles J. White Jr., president of the Stoltz Realty Company in Greenville, said the stipulations cut the already slim industrial market even thinner. Most companies want to locate near major roads, like Interstate 95 or Interstate 295, he said. Seaford is off U.S. Route 13. 
Randall C. Handy Jr., owner of Handy Realty, a commercial real estate concern, said the building is "beginning to look like it's got a trunk and big ears."
"The large employers, with 100-plus employees, just are not there, and they haven't been for a while," Mr. Handy said. "The area is growing fast, but it's residential -- either at the beach or among retirees."
Designed to accommodate most types of light manufacturing, the building is priced at $1.3 million, while the land is available for $14,000 an acre. Because the building is a shell, the cost to finish it has been estimated at about $600,000.
A user could also lease the building for $2.97 a square foot annually through a 10-year lease-to-buy option. The tenant would bear the cost of the interior construction. By contrast, a privately constructed building in New Castle County, the state's most developed county, would have a base rate of $4.50 to $4.75 a square foot annually, Mr. White said.
Judy McKinney-Cherry, the state economic development director, said her office is prepared to offer a "creative and meaningful" incentive package to a potential user.
What's more, she is hoping DuPont will make an initial public offering of its textiles and interiors business rather than sell it to an outside company. "Because DuPont's textile business is such a major economic driver, both historically and presently," she said, "we want to keep them in Delaware."
Without the nylon plant, Seaford would resemble other quiet Sussex County towns located along estuaries that wind either to the Chesapeake Bay to the west or the Delaware Bay to the east. Seaford is at the head of navigation of the Nanticoke River, about 40 miles from its mouth on the Chesapeake.
Sussex County relied primarily on shipbuilding and agriculture in the 19th century. After the Civil War, shipbuilding all but disappeared except for the making of pleasure boats. 
The year DuPont picked Seaford for the $8.5 million nylon plant, the city's main industries were making baskets for fruits and vegetables and oyster shucking and packing. Even then, Seaford was making an economic development effort. Its letterhead in 1938 read: "A town of natural advantages offering golden opportunities to the manufacturer."
One advantage mentioned by the city was paved streets. Before the 1930's, many roads in Seaford were made of broken oyster shells, which "got kind of smelly in the summer," said W. Wright Robinson, 95, former publisher of The Leader, a weekly newspaper, and one of a group of Seaford residents who made a presentation to DuPont to win the nylon plant. It is still possible to find driveways made of crushed shells in Sussex County. 
"DuPont revolutionized the community, almost overnight," Mr. Robinson said. "Before DuPont, Seaford was a struggling country community. The nylon plant brought in technically trained and educated people who were looking for better things than a country town could offer. They had a desire for better schools and better houses." 
Many DuPont executives who moved into the senior executive ranks with the chemical company had stints at Seaford. "Anybody that spent time there, even as little as 12 months," Edward G. Jefferson, DuPont's chairman from 1981 to 1986, recalled a few days ago, "would have a great deal to put in their knapsack."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET-- Downtown Manhattan; 
Striking Back at Suburbs In the Battle for Business

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The suburbs have long been luring businesses awayfrom Manhattan, offering amenities like easier commutes, lower rents and financial incentives. 
 Now the Alliance for Downtown New York has counterattacked with a campaign to attract small and medium-size businesses from the suburbs, as well as other parts of Manhattan, offering various amenities, low rents and financial incentives of its own. 
 "This is the first time we have launched a concerted campaign," said Shirley Jaffe, the vice president for economic development at the Alliance, the business improvement district for the area south of Chambers Street. "We want to attract businesses and increase awareness about the area." 
The group has prepared a 14-page book detailing the advantages of doing business in Lower Manhattan, citing the 15 subway lines running through the area, the density of the telecommunications infrastructure (82 percent of buildings have two or more carriers) and a well-educated work force.
The mailings are going to companies that had previously expressed an interest in the downtown and each mailing will be followed up with telephone calls from a staff member. The campaign got under way last week with mailings to 326 companies in New Jersey, particularly in the areas along the Hudson River where developments have been attracting businesses formerly in Manhattan.
"That rivalry has been a big deal, so we included it in the areas to be targeted," Ms. Jaffe said, adding that Westchester and Rockland Counties and the Midtown and Midtown South areas of Manhattan would be included in appeals to 5,200 companies that have 10 to 100 employees.
The Alliance's effort to attract companies from New Jersey parallels what officials of New York's Economic Development Corporation say is a strong push by that agency to bring back some of the jobs that have crossed the river.
"New Jersey has been very aggressive about attracting jobs and now we are going to return the favor," said Andrew M. Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation. 
He said about 12 million square feet of office space had been built on the west side of the Hudson and about 50,000 jobs, many of them in back-office operations of financial services companies based in New York, had left the city.
Mr. Alper said many jobs were lost because there were few suitable buildings in lower-cost parts of the city, like downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City. Recent zoning changes in some areas, he said, have made these locations more attractive for development. 
"We have a big opportunity now in New Jersey to get some of these back-office jobs back, and we have intensified our efforts in the last six weeks," Mr. Alper said. "We are meeting with companies that are in New Jersey and explaining our value proposition to them."
Ms. Jaffe said the downtown is now very competitive with New Jersey because the slow economy has lowered rents for commercial office space. .
With the PATH trains between Jersey City and downtown scheduled to resume in November and with the economic disparity narrowed by declining rents and the availability of tax advantages and other incentives, Ms. Jaffee said some businesses might be tempted to move into Lower Manhattan. A lively social and cultural life in the downtown area would be an additional incentive, she said. 
"Companies do not make these decisions only on the bottom line," Ms. Jaffe said. "We don't expect them to jump immediately, but we want to make them aware of the assets that are here, so when their leases expire, we are on their minds. It's like a broker making cold calls."
With a vacancy rate of about 12 percent in the downtown area, rental rates in the Class B buildings that dominate the area have fallen into the mid-$20's a square foot annually, she said. Added to that are existing incentives tied to the number of employees a company brings to the city that can reduce rents by an additional $8 a square foot annually, she added.
To allow companies considering the move to compute what level of incentives they would receive, the Downtown Alliance has posted a calculator on its Internet site, www.DowntownNY.com.
Ms. Jaffe said staff members started calling companies in New Jersey last week and would continue to try to make contact for several more weeks. 
"We want them to know the Alliance exists," she said, "and that we are a nonprofit, not a broker."
Once the New Jersey effort is largely complete, another round of mailings and follow-up telephone calls will commence, with the next target being companies in certain ZIP codes in Midtown South, the area roughly between 34th Street and 20th Street. Of the 5,200 businesses to be contacted, Ms. Jaffe said, 3,200 are in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Loans Lift Profit at Wells Fargo 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose more than 7 percent as the lowest mortgage rates on record extended a refinancing boom that began in April 2002.

HEADLINE: Business Tax Shelters a Drain on States' Finances, Study Says 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Tax sheltering has cost states more than a third of their revenue from taxes on corporate profits, a new study showed yesterday, adding to the severe strain on state finances across the country.
 The states lost as much as $12.4 billion because of tax sheltering in the 2001 fiscal year, the Multistate Tax Commission, an organization of taxing authorities in 45 states, reported. Its low estimate was $8.3 billion. 
 In the 1980's, 9 percent of corporate profits were paid to states. This number had declined to less than 6 percent by 2001, the study showed. 
"Some large, sophisticated companies are using sheltering devices, aggressive restructurings and other steps to avoid paying taxes at the state level," R. Bruce Johnson, the Utah tax commissioner, said. "A third of these resources are dropping off the radar because aggressive companies are availing themselves of tax planning strategies that are not available to smaller companies or to individuals, and the result is unfair to the vast majority of taxpayers."
Corporate tax shelters, the study concluded, are reducing the ability of states to provide for education and other basic needs and are "undermining the equity and integrity of state tax systems." The report did not name any companies.
The study was released at a gathering in Sacramento to examine corporate tax shelters and their effect on state finances. California's financial problems have caused it to borrow billions of dollars to pay its expenses, one of the main issues in a drive by Republicans in California to recall Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat. The study indicates that corporate tax sheltering explains about 3 percent of the $38 billion budget deficit in California.
The Multistate Tax Commission said its study is the first effort to estimate the effect of corporate tax shelters on the states. The study began with Commerce Department data on corporate profits, which was broken down by state. The research departments of half the states then refined the data to account for differences in state tax laws.
Many companies have long based their headquarters in states with favorable tax policies, like Delaware and Florida. 
Just as some multinational companies hold patents and other intellectual property in offshore tax havens so that the profits earned on them escape taxation, they can do the same in lower-tax states to reduce their state-level taxes as well.
The study also examined the effect of using those techniques at the international level, which reduces federal tax revenues.
Martin A. Sullivan, a former Treasury Department economist, has written in the magazine Tax Notes that these same techniques on the international level are costing the federal government about $30 billion. The states collect a fifth as much in corporate taxes as the federal government; the study relied on Mr. Sullivan's work to estimate that the states lost $5.3 billion in 2001 because of international tax shelters. 
The study gave no estimate for how much domestic tax shelters cost New York State, but did include a $577 million revenue loss estimate from international tax shelters. If domestic tax shelters cost New York the national average then its total losses because of corporate tax sheltering would be $1.025 billion, or about $53 for every state resident.
Had a complete New York estimate been made it would have ranked second in losses, behind California at $1.34 billion, the study found.
Hardest hit was West Virginia, where sheltering losses were most likely 58 percent of corporate taxes actually collected. The most likely, or midrange, estimates showed that tax sheltering losses equaled 56.9 percent of tax collections in Ohio, 48.7 percent in Florida and 43.1 percent in Mississippi. 
Mr. Johnson, the Utah tax commissioner, noted that some corporations reject tax shelters offered to them by the major accounting firms, as well as by law firms and investment houses. Not moving to bar such activities by others, he said, is unfair to the companies that either cannot participate in sheltering or will not as a matter of policy.

HEADLINE: Bush Pension Proposals Get a Cold Reception From Congress 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Bush administration officials offered detailed plans yesterday for how America's pension system might be strengthened but received a cold reception from members of Congress, who said they feared the measures would hurt the companies that offer the pensions.
 In testimony given jointly to two House subcommittees, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, Peter R. Fisher, called the rules on pension contributions schizophrenic, saying they allow companies a lot of leeway, then suddenly require large cash infusions if a company crosses a certain threshold. A more gradual approach, he said, would be more sound. 
 Mr. Fisher suggested a number of other changes in the pension financing rules. He said the deductibility of pension contributions might be increased, the number of years in which benefit increases were accounted for might be shortened, and companies might be barred from reducing one year's pension contributions by carrying over credits from previous years' contributions.
These credits are "mere accounting entries," he said, and by carrying them forward in this way companies can "avoid making contributions, often for years."
Ann L. Combs, the assistant secretary of labor, testified that the administration wanted companies to disclose the solvency of their pension plans at least once a year, in a format that would help workers see whether their companies were making viable promises.
Virtually all pension data now disclosed by companies is either quite old or presented in a format that is hard for even securities analysts to grasp. Better information is collected by the government agency that insures pensions, but Congress made that data exempt from the Freedom of Information Act in 1994.
Ms. Combs urged members of Congress to revoke that exemption, and called on them to bar companies with insolvent plans from promising more benefits to their workers. 
"The administration believes we must stop the most financially challenged companies from making new promises that they cannot afford," she said. She said the administration had its eye on 57 companies that appeared to be making pension promises they could not keep, but said that she could not name them.
Mr. Fisher said that before embarking on any changes, Congress must replace the current method for calculating pension obligations. He repeated the Bush administration's view that the current method -- which bases key calculations on a single interest rate tied to the 30-year Treasury bond -- must be replaced by a method that uses a series of interest rates. The rates would be tied to corporate bonds of varying durations, according to the ages of each company's workers.
Representatives from both parties agreed that the method needed to be changed, but they repeatedly challenged Mr. Fisher's proposal, saying it might be too harsh and cause companies to stop offering pensions.
"Your protection is going to 'protect' workers right out of their pensions," said Representative Earl Pomeroy, a California Democrat.
Any new pension methodology must be approved by Congress. Early last year, Congress gave companies relief from some of their pension difficulties, but that relief is scheduled to expire at the end of December. If no change can be agreed upon by then, companies will have to revert to an older method. Companies said that would leave them with pension bills few could afford.

HEADLINE: The Deficit Floats Up and Away 

 BODY:
Having done its utmost to choke back the revenue flow into the Treasury, the Bush administration offered a running tab on this year's exploding budget deficit yesterday. To hear the casual patter of White House aides about the deficit, one would think it was pocket change. In fact, the shortfall has ballooned 50 percent in just five months, to $455 billion and counting. This historic high shows no sign of cresting, certainly not while the president's detaxation mania rolls forward.The White House firmly insists that the growing wad of government costs and debt being rolled across the years toward tomorrow's taxpayers is eminently "manageable." Actually, what was manageable was the $127 billion surplus the fledgling administration enjoyed just two years ago. 
 That surplus has disappeared into the Potomac mists, along with the Republicans' creaky posture as deficit hawks. A decade of deficit spending now awaits the nation, rooted in an anemic economy, pervasive joblessness, the rising costs of the American occupation of Iraq and Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the upper brackets. Independent estimates suggest that the deficit will grow to the half-trillion-dollar level next year and barrel on through the next decade at a cost in excess of $4 trillion once Congress's hypocritical commitment to "sunset" various tax cuts is quietly reversed. 
 The White House never fails to seize on optimistic predictions that the economy will tick back up zestfully next year in Mr. Bush's "jobs and growth" program, an agenda that has so far delivered far more tax cuts than recovery. A sobering estimate of the detax-and-spend policies of the president and the Republican-controlled Congress is offered by the Concord Coalition, the budget watchdog group, which warns of devastating long-range effects from "a schizophrenic pursuit of small-government tax policies and big-government spending initiatives." Politicians have broken vows not to tap Social Security funds, leaving costly entitlement promises to baby boomers looming at the shore of red ink that now pools forth into the nation. The White House hardly scans that shore, offering no details in its newly minted promise to cut the deficit in half "over the next few years."

HEADLINE: At Helm of Port Authority, Behind-the-Scenes Outsider 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
When the nomination of the developer and Democratic fund-raiser Charles Kushner to be chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey collapsed earlier this year, New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey turned to Plan B, a lawyer named Anthony R. Coscia.
 Mr. Coscia, 43, who had a reputation as more of a behind-the-scenes troubleshooter than a monied pillar of the party, is a departure for a board traditionally dominated by wealthy and well-known party loyalists from both states. 
 In Mr. Coscia, Mr. McGreevey had picked someone who was little known outside New Jersey. But he was known in the state as a skilled financial expert and lawyer who was knowledgeable about the ways of government from his decade as chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. In that job, he was reappointed under two Democratic and two Republican governors.
"Let's face it," said George Zoffinger, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, "these positions at the Port Authority are sought-after positions by those who have achieved financial success, and achieved it for a reason, as well as raised a lot of money for their political parties. They want those seats, but Tony doesn't exactly fit that profile."
Mr. Zoffinger, a banker and a state commerce commissioner under Gov. James J. Florio, worked with Mr. Coscia in the private sector and brought him into government in the mid-1980's. He said he was all for the break with tradition. It was, he said, "one of the rare instances in which qualifications superseded politics." He added: "He is is a quiet version of those who carry a big stick."
Similarly, State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the chairman of the state Republican Party, praised Mr. Coscia as "one of those rare people who can rise to the occasion and do a tremendous job for the chief executive no matter who the chief executive happens to be." It was "a star appointment," he added, by a governor who he said had "systematically miscast" his appointees.
For his part, Mr. Coscia is not bothered by the bipartisan praise. Noting that he has worked with the same law firm -- Windels Marx Lane & Mittendorf -- since graduating from Rutgers University Law School, he said, "I've got this loyalty problem. I sort of stick with people."
Mr. Kushner, whose Florham Park company has developed residential and commercial real estate projects throughout the region, was appointed to the board of the Port Authority in 2002 and was to take over as chairman this year. But when allegations were raised about campaign contributions and business practices -- and Mr. Kushner refused to appear before a legislative committee -- he was forced to withdraw his name. 
Mr. Coscia, who had served on Mr. McGreevey's transition committee and as his unofficial budget director in the first days of the administration, emerged as the replacement choice.
He had also been pressed into service on efforts to keep open automobile plants in the state and on a phase of the continuing negotiations for an arena in Newark for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils. And he continued to serve right up to April as chairman of the Economic Development Authority.
A native of Paterson and the son of a laborer, Mr. Coscia graduated from Georgetown University in 1981 and was headed for a career in the foreign service, he said in an interview, until he realized that American diplomats were being shot at. He took a detour into law school, and immediately upon graduation joined a Manhattan law firm that did considerable overseas business. He also began to volunteer his time on public policy issues.
He became chairman of the Economic Development Authority at a precocious 32 years old, after working for a year as its chief staff person. It was during this time, Mr. Coscia said, that he first got to know Mr. McGreevey. 
Mr. Coscia, a North Caldwell resident and the father of five, believes this is a critical period for the Port Authority, given the need to rebuild much of Lower Manhattan and restore PATH service after the attack on the World Trade Center. There is also the challenge of expanding the transportation infrastructure in a region that has about reached its capacity.
For Mr. Coscia, this amounts to "a comfortable level of challenge," he said.
Thomas K. Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit advocate for regional government, said Mr. Coscia was admired for his professionalism, but was not a "known quantity" on the New York side of the river and would have the challenge of building respect. "I believe he is capable of growing into it," he said.
James P. Fox, Gov. McGreevey's chief of staff, said that because Mr. Coscia had worked as a lawyer and financial adviser on "some very delicate and difficult negotiations" involving some of the region's more strong-willed business people, he would rise to the occasion.
"He has a way of telling you what you don't want to hear, but in a polite and honest way," said Mr. Fox. "Everyone usually walks away saying how smart he is, but there are those who also say don't cross him."

HEADLINE: Despite a Sluggish City Economy, Apartment Prices Up in Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
After two consecutive quarters of decline, the average sales price of apartments in Manhattan rose 11 percent, to $864,860, in the second three months of the year despite a sluggish economy, according to a report released yesterday.
 Although the increase is nowhere near the 29 percent rise in the average sales price that occurred in the first three months of 2000, it suggests that the Manhattan real estate market is being buoyed by low-interest mortgages and growing consumer confidence. 
 "I think it's partly attributable to a longer-term confidence and a light at the end of the tunnel about the economy," said Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. and the author of the report, the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview. "While economic conditions certainly aren't robust, they appear to be getting a little bit better." 
The median sales price, which increased to $575,000, almost 12 percent more than the median for the previous quarter and almost 13 percent more than the median for the period a year ago, was at its highest level since the first market overview report was issued in 1989. (The median price is midway between the highest and lowest prices.)
The average and the median sales prices of cooperative apartments were at record highs, with the average up almost 9 percent to $775,052 from the first quarter this year, and the median price at $479,000, also an increase of almost 9 percent.
Peter Kelleher, a director of sales at Douglas Elliman, said the increases belied a general perception about the market. "Everybody says it's such a strong buyers' market," Mr. Kelleher said. "They may have more choices, but I don't think they're getting reduced prices."
Indeed, Steven L. James, sales director in Elliman's East Side office, said he was seeing bidding wars again. "I'm amazed," Mr. James said, adding that his office recently sold a four-bedroom cooperative apartment in the East 70's off Park Avenue for $3.8 million after three people competing to buy it drove the price up from a listing price of $3.5 million.
The annual growth in the average price for all apartments was not as striking as the quarterly increase. The average sales price was up more than 4 percent over the average price for the same period last year.
Applying a different measure, the Corcoran Group, which gathers data about signed contracts rather than closed sales, the method used in the Elliman report, said the average sales price actually declined slightly to $840,554 this year, from $872,907 last year. "Last spring, buyers brought unabashed enthusiasm to the market, and overbidding was commonplace," said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of Corcoran. "This spring has been a healthier market. While there are still certainly plenty of hot deals and bidding wars, on the whole the market is much more rational."
Ms. Liebman said Corcoran's agents had recently noted a resurgence in the market for apartments priced at $10 million or more.
The Elliman report said sales for all apartments in the second quarter increased almost 11 percent, to 2,055, compared with sales in the first quarter, though that figure represented a decline of nearly 25 percent from the 2,726 apartments sold in the same quarter last year. Mr. Miller said the second quarter of 2002 was particularly strong, as buyers who held back after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks returned to the market.
Some markets did see strong annual growth. Stephen Kliegerman, executive director of sales for the downtown office of Halstead Property L.L.C., said sales downtown increased about 15 percent in the second quarter compared with sales in the same period last year.
The Elliman report said sales of two-bedroom apartments, about 45 percent of the total sold in the second quarter, were particularly strong, up more than 20 percent over sales in the first quarter. Though sales were down 24 percent from the period last year, Mr. Miller said, the market for two-bedroom apartments was much stronger than the market for studios.

HEADLINE: California Takes Aim At Dealer Bias In Car Loans 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis of California has signed into law a bill to curb outsize interest rates that car dealers sometimes charge minority customers.
 The new statute, say consumer groups that follow the issue, is the nation's first to take aim at discriminatory lending that can result from a practice known as the dealer markup. In a dealer markup, car dealers raise interest rates above the rates they are quoted by auto lending giants or other big financing companies. The dealers pocket the proceeds of the difference, or split them with the financing companies. 
 Large numbers of car buyers around the country pay thousands of dollars extra because of the dealer markup, which is invisible to typical buyers and little understood by them. Though the markup is often paid by car buyers of all ethnicities, it can be most pronounced for minorities, in which case it runs afoul of federal law that prohibits discriminatory lending practices. 
Most of the big lending companies operated by automakers have been sued for the practice, though they are not accused of directly discriminating themselves, because they typically do not know the race of the buyer; only the dealer does. In February, Nissan's finance unit, the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, reached a settlement with black and Hispanic car buyers who said the company was discriminating against them by charging unduly high interest rates.
"Many consumers are deceived into paying excessively high interest rates when purchasing a car, especially African-Americans and Latinos," Governor Davis, who signed the new statute on Monday night, said in a statement issued yesterday. 
"This bill," the governor added, "will allow the attorney general to end this unfair practice that tacks on thousands of dollars to the price of a car."
The new law requires auto dealers to keep sales records on file for seven years or the life of a loan, whichever is longer, and to retain information on how a person's creditworthiness was determined. Fines for noncompliance are $5,000 a violation.
The bill is meant to give the state attorney general's office a paper trail to detect the existence of any abusive practices, which could mean litigation under the federal anti-bias law.
A spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association did not return calls seeking comment. A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said he had not yet reviewed the bill. By the time the statement from Governor Davis's office about the bill's enactment was issued yesterday, it was late in the day on the East Coast, where those two groups are headquartered.
Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, said of car dealers and the markup practice, "Everyone they think they can do it to, they do."
"They mark up just about everybody who finances through the dealer, but the amount tends to be more if you're African-American or Latino," said Ms. Shahan, whose group took the matter to State Senator Martha M. Escutia, a Democrat from the Los Angeles area who became the bill's author.
As a result of litigation, many of the big auto lending arms, like the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Ford Motor Credit Company, have capped dealer markups at 3 percent.
And under terms of Nissan's settlement, the company agreed to offer preapproved loans to hundreds of thousands of minority customers and to limit markups. The company also donated $1 million to charity and paid $5,000 to $20,000 to each of the 10 plaintiffs. 
Linda White of Murrieta, Calif., was not involved in the suit against Nissan and its finance arm, but she learned as a result of it that the interest rate on her 1996 Nissan Altima had been marked up 1.5 percentage points by a dealer in Oceanside, Calif.
Ms. White, who is African-American, said she did not know whether her race had been a factor in the decision to tack the extra charge onto her auto loan. But she said she welcomed the new California law, which will allow the authorities to track transactions like hers to see whether auto dealers are discriminating against black and Latino buyers.
"I don't think it's right for them to be able to do that without the consumer's knowledge," Ms. White said. "I felt taken by that, regardless of my race. That they could mark up my interest rate and not tell me, I just think that's wrong."

HEADLINE: U.S. Eyes a Willing Romania As a New Comrade in Arms 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: CONSTANTA, Romania 

 BODY:
Kurt Sanger is only a captain and so he will leave to higher-ups the question of whether Romania would make a good ally as the United States sets about a historic reordering of its military, relying less on its old friends in Western Europe and more on new ones in the east. He does, however, have some thoughts about Romania as a place where American soldiers like him may find a new home, perhaps soon. 
 "Paradise isn't too strong a word," said Captain Sanger, 31, a Marine reservist on leave from his job as a lawyer in Manhattan. 
 It is cheap, he said, and the food is excellent. So are the beaches near this Romanian port on the Black Sea. But more important, he said, Romanians really like Americans, and his worries, as an officer in charge of protecting United States soldiers on an exercise here, are not the ones he might have elsewhere. 
"The biggest threat we face is the stray dogs," he said. "To be able to say that at this point in history and being the military, you've got to consider yourself lucky."
This is the first flush of a new American love affair with Romania, one of the poorest nations in Europe and, until the terror strikes on Sept. 11, 2001, not high on Washington's list as a close military partner. Now it is one of the crucial countries in Europe, along with Poland and Bulgaria, considered for new American bases, probably small installations with rotating troops capable of quickly striking targets in the Middle East or Central Asia, which are closer to here than is Western Europe.
The plans make much strategic sense, military experts say, and were envisioned before the war in Iraq estranged the United States from old allies in Western Europe like Germany and France. But with the bitterness over Iraq lingering, the plans have accelerated. 
This shift is giving more solid form to the stinging distinction drawn earlier this year by Donald H. Rumsfeld, the United States defense secretary, between the "old" Europe and the "new," the former Communist bloc states. Planning is under way for a reduction in the more than 60,000 American soldiers in Germany, the outdated cornerstone for Western security during the cold war to contain Russia. Poland, rather than France or Germany, will be heading a sector in Iraq, and Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Macedonia and Albania are likely to send troops there. 
But the eagerness for a stronger military alliance with the United States also carries risks for the countries involved. For example, their soldiers may die on behalf of an American military engagement.
"The support for intervention in Iraq in Poland is not, and was not, very high," said Jacek Cichocki, acting director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a government-financed research institution in Poland. "And Poles do not see Polish engagement as dying for the Americans. It is rather the engagement of country as the duty of being a member of the coalition."
These nations also hope to join the European Union. The fear, which their leaders rarely state in public, is that their deepening military friendship with the United States could jeopardize their economic integration in Europe. Already the war in Iraq and the International Criminal Court, which President Bush opposes joining, have been areas where the United States has pressed its new allies for support against a strong Western European position. 
Charles A. Kupchan, a security adviser on Europe in the Clinton administration, is among those arguing that the Eastern European nations are making a "shortsighted investment."
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he contends, is crumbling, as the United States views Europe not as a strategic theater but as a springboard to new threats in the Middle East or Central Asia. Ultimately, he said, the real gains for nations like Poland, Romania and Bulgaria will come from their union with a Europe he sees as more and more willing to check American power. 
"They are hoping to keep NATO strong and vital and witness the long-awaited arrival of American troops to Central Europe," said Mr. Kupchan, a professor at Georgetown University and a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. "But instead they will witness the demise of NATO."
Mircea Geoana, the foreign minister of Romania, is among those arguing that the projected role of his nation helps recreate NATO into a more global organization, prepared to send peacekeepers, for example, to Africa. But Europe cannot take part fully, he argues, without the much stronger American military.
"We know that without some military muscle, and without keeping trans-Atlantic ties strong, Europe will not be able to keep up with its ambitions," he said. 
Poland, with 40 million people, a record of reform and a long relationship with the United States, was no surprise as a new American ally. 
Not so Romania. Poor and rural, the nation of 23 million people was long regarded in the West as, at best, a hard case and long shot for NATO or the European Union. 
Then came Sept. 11, and Romania quickly declared its support -- it allowed United States planes to fly over and sent 400 infantry soldiers to Afghanistan. With Iraq as the next target, the United States military eyed Romanian air bases. In exchange, the United States supported Romania for entry into NATO, and the country is now expected to join formally next May.
But the relationship seemed cemented this spring when Turkey, a longtime NATO ally, decided against involvement in the Iraqi war. Almost overnight, the Mihail Kogalniceanu Airport just north of here became a major route for refueling and supply of United States troops in Iraq and neighboring countries. Officials say that up to 3,000 American soldiers could operate there at a time.
Next door in Bulgaria, American troops used a closed airport near Burgas, also on the Black Sea, for communications and logistics, as they also did during the Afghan operation. 
"Iraq did provide an opportunity for Romania to demonstrate its capabilities, more so its willingness, to cooperate," said Maj. Gen. Arnold Fields, deputy commander of the United States Marines in Europe. "And Romania stepped up to the plate."
The next step may be more permanent bases here. Nothing is official and military officials here and at the Pentagon stress that planning is in its earliest stages. But, in short, the plans envision a reduction in the forces in Germany in favor of smaller bases in eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Far East and Africa -- all filled with rotating troops poised to strike quickly. 
The model is quite different from the permanent communities in Germany; soldiers would likely arrive alone, living in spartan quarters. No matter, say Romanians, eager for any economic infusion the new bases would bring.
"The major concern is to speed up the Americans' coming here," said Gheorghe Martin, the prefect of the Constanta area. "We've been waiting for the Americans for 50 years. Now that they are here, can we really ask ourselves if they are welcome?"
In the last few weeks, joint training exercises in Romania have brought together southeast European countries allied with the United States. Technically, it is an exercise in cooperation; practically, it mended Romania's ailing infrastructure, with engineers building a new parking area at the airport capable of handling heavy refueling aircraft and widening runway aprons. 
Combat engineers also practiced urban warfare by setting off explosions in abandoned buildings at a military base here -- in Germany, American officials noted, many more permits would have been required. They also built a new school and refurbished an old one.
At the new school, in the village of Corbu, north of here, the mayor gave the Americans a warm welcome. Children, some waving American flags, sang, in nice English, "If You're Happy and You Know It," and swarmed around General Fields, the Marine commander, for his autograph. 
Lt. Col. David Budak, the Marine reservist in charge of building the school, allowed himself a little high-flown reflection on how much the world had changed since the cold war. "They will know democracy," he said. "They will know opportunity. They will be part of the free world."

HEADLINE: Sears to Sell Card Portfolio To Citigroup For $3 Billion 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company agreed yesterday to sell its huge credit card portfolio to Citigroup, abandoning a business that it started to help spur sales during the Depression and that ended up becoming larger than its core retail operation.
 Citigroup, the largest credit card issuer in the nation, agreed to pay about $3 billion in cash for the portfolio, which includes Sears private-label cards and co-branded MasterCards. 
 The sale is a strategic shift for Sears, the nation's original mass marketer, as it repositions itself as a stand-alone retailer without the buffer of the credit card operation that had provided a hedge against the unpredictability of the retail business for so many years.
The credit card business provided about 60 percent of Sears's annual profits, or about $1.5 billion -- far more than at any other retailer. 
The management of Sears decided to sell the card portfolio, the eighth-largest in the nation with 59 million total accounts and outstanding loan balances of $29 billion, in an effort to appease shareholders who have long had difficulty valuing the company because of its unusual hybrid nature as both a retailer and a credit issuer. 
The credit card operation had "become so disproportionate to the size of the company," Alan J. Lacy, chairman and chief executive of Sears, said in an interview. "We will now be a much simpler story to understand."
The deal pays immediate and far-reaching dividends for Sears, which will retain $3 billion of the capital it had invested in the portfolio, valuing the pact at $6 billion. In addition, Sears will receive $200 million a year for 10 years as part of the marketing and servicing alliance with Citigroup.
Also, Sears expects to reap savings of more than $200 million a year as Citigroup absorbs costs associated with the Sears zero-percent financing programs.
Citigroup, which will continue to operate the business under the Sears name much the way it operates the AT&T Universal credit cards it acquired from AT&T in 1999, is taking over a portfolio that is considered highly risky. Last October, Sears said its portfolio would need an additional $222 million to cover uncollectible charges for the third quarter. 
"It was their salvation for many years," Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, said of the Sears credit card operation. "But in this recession it has gotten nasty."
Private-label credit portfolios are widely considered the most risky, or "subprime," because of the type of customers that the cards attract. Sears expanded its private-label business by offering MasterCards just at the peak of the economic boom and like other card issuers, suffered as unemployment and personal bankruptcy filings rose.
Still, Citigroup said it was attracted to the portfolio because it can better manage the risk and was expecting the quality of credit to rise. "They are betting that as times go by and the economy gets better, it will be less risky," said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
"This acquisition provides us with an opportunity to take a leadership position in the private-label segment and solidify our current bank card leadership position," Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement yesterday. "We have demonstrated our capability at integrating new businesses over the last few years and to add to our bottom line. This acquisition should be no different."
The acquisition of the Sears portfolio will make Citigroup the largest private-label credit card issuer in the nation, doubling the size of its private-label outstanding balances, or receivables, to $33 billion. The deal raises Citigroup's total managed card receivables to nearly $169 billion; MBNA, the next largest, has a $107 billion portfolio.
Citigroup is also hoping to leverage its relationship with Sears customers to sell them other financial services products. Citigroup said it had about 20 percent overlap of customers with Sears.
Robert B. Willumstad, president of Citigroup and chairman and chief executive of the Global Consumer Group, said during a conference call that he was particularly interested in using the Sears portfolio to reach the Hispanic market. "Sears is a unique franchise," Mr. Willumstad said, "as 60 percent of U.S. households are Sears customers, including a significant Hispanic customer base a key focus of our consumer business marketing efforts."
As part of the deal, Citigroup will take over Sears's Financial Products business and credit card operations, which have about 8,300 employees.
Store credit departments are not the large operations they once were. Only about two dozen store chains, including Federated Department Stores, still run their own programs. Over the last decade, many others have either moved their credit card operations to financial companies like GE Capital, which issues cards on behalf of Wal-Mart and the Gap, or have begun issuing co-branded cards with Visa or MasterCard.
Sears, which owns Lands' End, said that after-tax proceeds of about $4.5 billion would be used to reduce debt, for general operations and to return cash to Sears shareholders.

HEADLINE: Officials Reach An Agreement On Rebuilding Downtown Site 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The architect with the winning design for the World Trade Center site and the developer who will rebuild the office space there agreed early this morning to collaborate on the design and construction of the 1,776-foot tower that will anchor the redeveloped site both on the ground and in the Lower Manhattan skyline.
 The agreement between the architect, Daniel Libeskind, and the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, came during an eight-hour negotiating session that stretched from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning. 
 The agreement was forged under firm pressure from officials at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which have been ordered by Gov. George E. Pataki to adhere to an aggressive time line for the redevelopment effort. 
David M. Childs, a consulting partner with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and the architect hired by Mr. Silverstein to work on designs for the trade center site's office space, will lead the collaboration, according to a statement issued jointly this morning by Mr. Childs, Mr. Silverstein and Mr. Libeskind.
Mr. Childs and Skidmore will serve as the design architect and project manager, leading a team that will design the tower, which Mr. Pataki has called the Freedom Tower and which will be the first commercial building to be constructed at the site.
The proposed building has been called the world's tallest, although the occupied office space is expected to be only about 70 stories, with much of the remainder of the height being accounted for by a telecommunications antenna.
Mr. Libeskind, whose master plan for the trade center site was selected in February over eight other designs in a competition of renowned architects, will serve as a collaborating architect during the concept- and schematic-design phases of the project and will act as a member of the project team, according to the statement. 
"This collaboration will facilitate the development of the Freedom Tower in a manner consistent with the Libeskind vision," it said. "We are confident that SOM and SDL will produce a world-class icon in the Lower Manhattan skyline and a powerful symbol of our nation's resilience in the aftermath of tragedy."
Development corporation officials said they believed that the agreement will end months of sometimes-heated battles between Mr. Silverstein, who has declared his intention to rebuild all of the office space that was destroyed in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and Mr. Libeskind, who has maintained that he has a public mandate to forge a new design for the site. 
"It is a historic development that two architects at this level are willing to work together in this way," Kevin Rampe, the president of the development corporation, said in an interview. 
Some matters remain to be settled between the parties, however. Among them is the location of the tower, which Mr. Libeskind had designated for the northwest corner of the site. Mr. Silverstein, however, wants the tower to be closer to the new transportation hub, which will lie on the eastern portion of the 16-acre site.
Officials who were present at the meeting, including representatives from the Port Authority, refused to characterize the negotiations or say what had impeded an earlier agreement. But two officials said that the agreement came after a lengthy period of direct talks between Mr. Libeskind and Mr. Childs, who had faced each other in the design competition.
Rebuilding officials want to begin construction of the tower next summer, in order to complete the erection of steel by the end of 2006, a deadline set by Mr. Pataki and which coincides with the end of his current term.
Officials from the development corporation brought Mr. Libeskind and representatives of Mr. Silverstein together to try to force an agreement over what role Mr. Libeskind will play in the design of commercial office space on the site.
The impasse centered on how much influence Mr. Libeskind would have on the design of the first office building to go up at the site, the 1,776-foot tower that will define the rebuilt trade center's presence on the Lower Manhattan skyline. It has generally been understood that Mr. Libeskind would not actively design all the office buildings, and Mr. Silverstein has been talking to many architects about their desire to fashion one or more of the towers.
But Mr. Libeskind has actively sought a role in the design of the largest tower. Mr. Silverstein, however, has pushed for the involvement of other architects, particularly David M. Childs, a partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, in part because Mr. Libeskind has never designed a high-rise office building.
Mr. Silverstein also wants changes to the location and other features of the office buildings in Mr. Libeskind's master plan for the site, agreements that Mr. Libeskind has so far been reluctant to embrace.
In an interview on Monday, Mr. Libeskind said he believed that moving buildings around the site could change its entire character. "It's not a matter of just moving a building here or there," he said. "It can change the views, the light and wind conditions, the composition of the entire site."
An agreement between the development corporation and the Port Authority dictates that Mr. Libeskind will help to "develop commercial design guidelines governing future commercial development on the site," guidelines that are consistent with his proposals for the heights and shapes of buildings. Those guidelines are to be completed by September, the agreement states.
But Mr. Silverstein undoubtedly has a large role in the review of those guidelines. He has made clear to several rebuilding officials that he believes that his lease gives him the right to rebuild as he sees fit, subject to the agreement of the Port Authority, perhaps, but not to the whims of any other agencies.
Although the commercial office buildings will not be completed for years, the planners must know where the office towers will be located in order to design the underground elements of the trade center.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: More Verizon Workers To Be Rehired 

BYLINE:  AP; Compiled by Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
 Verizon Communications is rehiring 1,100 laid-off workers in the Northeast who were not covered by last week's order by an arbitrator in New York to take back 2,300 employees in the state who had been improperly terminated in a cost-cutting effort. The reinstatement, possibly pre-empting similar rulings in labor grievances filed in other states, comes just weeks before the deadline on talks between Verizon and its unions for a new contract covering 75,000 of the telephone company's nearly 230,000 employees. 
On Friday, an arbitrator, Shyam Das, ruled that Verizon's justification for the December layoffs -- a weak economy and toughening competition from rivals and new technology -- was not permissible under the existing contract. "We disagree with that ruling, but nonetheless, Verizon was directed to rehire workers in New York," Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said Tuesday. "Now we have voluntarily decided to no longer contest union grievances over layoffs in the other states."

 The United States House of Representatives voted to strengthen economic penalties against Myanmar, the former Burma, after a similar move a month ago by the Senate in response to a violent crackdown on political opposition and the continuing imprisonment of the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The new penalties would ban the import of goods from Myanmar, expand a ban on visas for high-ranking officials, freeze government assets in the United States and effectively bar international loans or technical aid.

HEADLINE: As U.S. and North Korea Glower, China Pushes for Talks 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, July 15 

 BODY:
China has sent an envoy to the North Korean capital and proposed a formula for starting multiparty negotiations in a fresh effort to end the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, Chinese officials and Western diplomats said today.
 The overture from China came as North Korean officials told the United States that they had begun producing enough plutonium to make a half-dozen atomic bombs, raising the possibility that the reclusive Communist government in North Korea is accelerating its effort to become a nuclear power. 
 Though China has long insisted that the dispute over North Korea's weapons program is a matter for the United States and North Korea to resolve between themselves, its new proposal suggests that Beijing intends to increase pressure on both sides to find a diplomatic solution.
A Chinese deputy foreign minister, Dai Bingguo, returned today from a visit to Pyongyang, where he held discussions with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, and delivered a letter from President Hu Jintao outlining a formula for new talks, Chinese officials said. 
A Western diplomat briefed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the proposal said it called for a multilateral meeting in which American-North Korean talks would take place on the sidelines. 
That would potentially satisfy North Korea's demand for individual, face-to-face negotiations with Washington while accommodating the Bush administration's insistence that any new talks involve Japan, South Korea and China, the diplomat said.
There was no immediate response from North Korea or the United States. The last round of talks, held under Beijing's auspices in May, ended without even reaching an agreement to keep talking after North Korea boasted about its progress in creating a nuclear arsenal.
Beijing has grown uneasy about the lack of progress toward a peaceful settlement of the dispute and is viewed by some Western diplomats as increasingly willing to use its leverage to make North Korea negotiate.
"Right now it is critical to continue the process of the talks," Kong Quan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news briefing today. "It is of critical importance to the peace, stability and development of the East Asia and Asian region."
Mr. Kong said China felt strongly that the disagreement about how to arrange the talks should not remain an obstacle to resuming them.
"China has been very clear that it remains open and flexible on the participants and the formalities of the talks," he said.
The pressure to resume negotiations was heightened in recent days after American officials said North Korea had told them that it had begun reprocessing its store of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, a process that yields weapons-grade plutonium. 
North Korea is thought to possess one or two nuclear weapons already. It told the Bush administration that it could make a half-dozen such weapons soon, administration officials said.
The officials said they were unsure whether North Korea's claims were true. American intelligence agencies have reported that the country may have stepped up its nuclear program, but have not confirmed the large-scale reprocessing necessary to produce six or more bombs.
Pyongyang has often boasted about the damage its armed forces could inflict on the United States and its Asian allies. Bush administration officials say such bluster may be part of a plan to blackmail the United States, Japan and South Korea into offering large amounts of aid.
North Korea has acknowledged violating a 1994 agreement with the United States on dismantling its nuclear program. Bush administration officials say they will not offer new diplomatic or economic incentives unless it unilaterally ends its nuclear efforts, but last May they agreed to China's proposal to hold trilateral talks to discuss the impasse.
Chinese officials say they share Washington's determination to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. But they also firmly oppose taking military action, because they believe it could destabilize the region, create a flood of refugees and increase American influence.
China and North Korea joined forces against the United States in the Korean War more than a half-century ago. The Chinese-North Korean relationship turned frosty in recent years, but China is seen as critical to advancing a solution, because it remains North Korea's largest source of energy and food.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Greenspan Predicts Growth And Wall Street Retreats

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street retreated yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that the economy should post stronger growth by the end of the year but cautioned that the threat of deflation remains.
 Some analysts said some investors feared Mr. Greenspan's remarks might signal a return to higher interest rates, while others decided the best bet was to cash in profits after several months of stock gains. 
 "Even though Greenspan said he'll keep rates as low as he can, his comments were fairly bullish, suggesting an end" to rate cuts, said Russ Koesterich, United States equity strategist at the State Street Corporation. "There's a lot of sensitivity to higher rates."
"The market is also running into resistance at the 1,000-1,010 level" on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, he added. "It's been an obstacle for the market going back a month."
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 48.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,128.97. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,753.21, while the S.& P. 500 fell 3.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,000.42.
A pair of better-than-expected economic reports, meanwhile, failed to lift the market.
The Commerce Department reported that the nation's retail sales rose 0.5 percent in June, the best showing in three months. It beat the 0.4 percent gain expected by analysts.
The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State manufacturing survey fell to 22.6 in July compared with 27.6 the previous month; still, the reading was higher than Wall Street's estimates. Some analysts see the survey as an indication of national manufacturing performance.
After several months of rallies, investors are also scrutinizing the second-quarter earnings season for proof the economic recovery is firmly under way. Many analysts think the market can see additional gains based on the results.
"I think the expectation level for earnings is very reasonable," said Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities.
Decliners included Altria Group, a component of the Dow index, which fell $1.46, to $40.50, after an Illinois appellate court said a lower court lacked authority when it reduced the size of the bond that Altria's Philip Morris unit had to post to appeal a $10.1 billion tobacco verdict.
Boeing, another Dow component, fell $1.14, to $33.44, after the defense contractor said it would take a $1.1 billion charge in the second quarter on lowered demand for its satellite launch services.

Treasury Notes Plunge
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury 10-year notes had their biggest plunge since 1996 in New York trading after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said economic growth will accelerate without the central bank resorting to buying government securities, as some investors had anticipated.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2 2/32, to a price of 97 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.99 percent from 3.73 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 7/32, to 105 31/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.97 percent from 4.77 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Gives Bright Outlook; Cuts anOption 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE with JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is prepared to hold interest rates low "for as long as needed" to stimulate further growth, the chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today, even as he presented an unexpectedly upbeat economic forecast to a House committee.
 Leaving open the possibility of further rate cuts, Mr. Greenspan discounted speculation that the Fed could not lower its funds rate much lower than its current 1 percent -- already the lowest rate in 45 years. The central bank could easily bring the rate down further if conditions worsen, he said, even if that forces money-market funds to pay almost no interest. 
 That reassurance failed to sway the bond market, where Mr. Greenspan's sunny predictions ignited a sell-off. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 3.99 percent, from 3.73 percent on Monday, as more investors seemed to decide that the economy will pick up speed later this year, possibly spelling an end to the bond rally that has lasted three and a half years. 
The bond market was also jolted by Mr. Greenspan's comment that the Fed was unlikely to try to keep interest rates in check by buying large amounts of longer-term securities. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates, also fell on the Bush administration's acknowledgment today that the federal budget deficit would be much larger this year and next. That means the government will be issuing even more debt, increasing the supply of bonds in the market, which can be expected to depress bond prices while putting additional upward pressure on interest rates.
Stocks ended the day down slightly, which analysts attributed to the bond market's reversal and the possibility that mortgage refinancing may begin to slow.
Most of Mr. Greenspan's testimony to the House Financial Services Committee today was a bright collage of indicators showing a recovery ahead, and he even praised the Bush administration's tax cut for increasing household income and leading to higher consumer spending. But he went out of his way to assure lawmakers that the economy had not yet reached the point at which the Fed would contemplate bringing interest rates up.
"If the recovery is indeed fragile, I would suggest to you it is unlikely that we would be moving rates," he told committee members as part of his required twice-yearly economic report. "We would seek significant improvement in the performance from what we currently see, before that is even on the table."
Even though bond investors were rattled, the chairman's optimistic forecast was largely welcome news for the White House, which has struggled to defend the invasion of Iraq and was forced today to explain why the federal deficit had risen to new heights. In testimony that echoed the administration's own optimism, Mr. Greenspan presented several indicators that the economy's vigor might be returning.
Industrial production has finally stopped falling, he said, and the housing market remains strong. Investors are more willing to confront risk, he said, improving the credit market. Economic growth could be as high as 2.75 percent this year, according to a separate Fed report submitted to Congress today, and as high as 4.75 percent next year, which economists at Goldman, Sachs said was a surprisingly robust prediction.
And Mr. Greenspan sounded positively cheery about the rise in household wealth, which he said was aided by mortgage refinancing and President Bush's tax cuts.
"The recently passed tax legislation," he said, "will provide a considerable lift to disposable incomes of households in the second half of the year, even after accounting for some state and local offsets." The next few months, he said, will be an important test of the administration's theory that its tax cuts will fuel a recovery.
As he often does in Congressional appearances, Mr. Greenspan worked to balance his hopes for a recovery with the fear of investors that too much economic improvement will lead the Fed to raise interest rates to ward off inflation.
He acknowledged, in advance of highly critical comments from several committee Democrats, that unemployment keeps moving up and that the tax cuts have increased the federal budget deficit -- all arguments for keeping rates low. But he said that in many cases, unemployment has resulted from improved business productivity that has enabled work forces to be cut. And the deficit is not necessarily a problem, he said, unless it persists for many years, which he said could be prevented by government spending cuts that match the reductions in taxes.
Mr. Greenspan's relentless placidity seemed to infuriate many committee Democrats, who demanded that he reconcile his outlook with the reality of growing joblessness.
"Where is the momentum in this economy?" asked Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat who represents the borough of Queens in New York City. "For the past few sessions here, you have predicted job growth and wealth creation, and all we have seen, at least in my city, is more job loss and the loss of wealth."
The strongest criticism came from Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent and the only socialist member of the House, who accused Mr. Greenspan of serving the needs of the wealthy while ignoring the economic distress of working-class families.
"I think you just don't know what's going on in the real world," Mr. Sanders said. "And I would urge you, come with me to Vermont; meet real people. The country clubs and the cocktail parties are not real America. The millionaires and billionaires are the exception to the rule."
Republican members of the committee were for the most part delighted by Mr. Greenspan's praise for the stimulative effects of the tax cuts, and for his endorsement of the need for more spending cuts.
"I have nothing against cutting taxes," Mr. Greenspan said. "I would just like to be sure that a constituency arises eventually for cutting spending as well, and that has not been the case."
So in other words, asked Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, tax cuts are good if they are followed by spending cuts or limits on spending?
"Correct," Mr. Greenspan replied, eliciting a nod of satisfaction from several on the Republican side.
Democrats on the committee had hoped to make use of the White House report showing a budget deficit of $455 billion this year, the largest in history, but Mr. Greenspan refused to criticize the administration for helping create the gap. Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee, tried repeatedly to have Mr. Greenspan say how long such deficits could be sustained without damaging the economy. But the chairman would not bite.
"You're trying to avoid talking about it," Mr. Frank said. "I think you're not facing up to the implications of your own report."
Mr. Greenspan has a recent history, however, of predicting turnarounds that have failed to materialize on schedule. In May 2001, he said there was "ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations." But the pause has lasted more than two years. And in March of last year, he said that the job market seemed to be improving, a prediction that occurred before an additional 519,000 jobs were lost.
In today's report, he predicted that unemployment, now at 6.4 percent, would decline to 5.5 to 6 percent by the final quarter of 2004.

HEADLINE: As Satellite Orders Slump, Chapter 11 Filing by Loral And a Charge for Boeing 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Weakened by a long slump in new orders, two large companies that manufacture satellites, Loral Space and Communications and Boeing, released bitter financial news yesterday.
 Loral filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Boeing said it would take a $1.1 billion pretax charge against second-quarter earnings. 
 As part of the bankruptcy reorganization, Loral said it planned to sell its most profitable business, a fleet of six communications satellites orbiting over North America, to Intelsat Ltd. for as much as $1.1 billion in cash.
Intelsat, which is formally based in Bermuda and is strong in overseas markets, was exultant at the opportunity to gain a sizable share of the North American satellite broadcasting market. 
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Conny L. Kullman, Intelsat's chief executive. Intelsat will borrow a total of $2.1 billion from Morgan Stanley, J. P. Morgan Chase and BNP Paribas to finance the purchase and rearrange its debts in an effort to preserve an investment-grade rating.
Satellite launchings and services make up a roughly $10 billion industry. The industry expanded rapidly in the 1990's when the projected demand for satellite-based communications services soared along with the growth of the Internet. But since 2000, many satellite ventures have gone bankrupt and many others have struggled with steep drops in revenue.
Boeing, which is best known as a commercial aircraft maker, has been hurt in the satellite business both by a lack of new satellite orders and a decline in its rocket-launching operations. The company said that $835 million of the charge announced yesterday came from sharply reduced expectations for its rocket-launching business.
Boeing, of Chicago, said it expected no commercial launching orders over the next five years and would focus on government business.
Weak demand and higher-than-expected costs will lead Boeing Satellite Systems, the division that makes satellites, to take a $265 million write-off. The $1.1 billion total charge will reduce second-quarter earnings by 66 cents a share. Analysts said that was likely to result in a loss for the quarter when Boeing reports its financial results next week. In trading yesterday, its shares fell as low as $33 before rebounding somewhat to close at $33.44, down $1.14.
The situation at Loral, based in New York, was far more complicated. In addition to the industrywide slump in new orders, Loral has been burdened by debts and the loss of roughly $2 billion it invested in Globalstar, a satellite telecommunications company that filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2002.
"People believed they were going out of business and no one was willing to place an order with them," said Roger Rusch, the president of TelAstra, a consulting and market research firm in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.
Loral's bonds have been traded as high-risk investments, and the company was forced to execute a 10-for-1 reverse split of shares in May to raise their value above the $1 minimum required for continued listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading in Loral was halted yesterday; the shares closed on Monday at $3.01.
Bernard L. Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said talks with Intelsat began six months ago. The deal was concluded at 1 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Schwartz said, allowing Loral to avoid making a multimillion-dollar interest payment yesterday to bondholders. The price for the six communications satellites could drop to $1 billion, depending on market conditions when the deal closes.
A filing for bankruptcy protection was a condition of the deal with Intelsat, Mr. Schwartz said. Intelsat, formerly an international consortium of government satellite agencies, was privatized in 2001 and plans to sell stock in an initial public offering next year. Intelsat's lawyers had warned that if the company entered into a deal with Loral without protection from Loral's creditors, lawsuits could interfere with the public offering.
Intelsat may still face competition to buy the Loral satellites when they are auctioned off under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. "Others will have the opportunity to outbid them," Mr. Schwartz said. But the two leaders in the domestic satellite market, PanAmSat and SES Americom, could face antitrust hurdles in purchasing the Loral satellites, and other potential buyers may be too small to be competitive in the bidding, according to analysts. 
Loral said the deal with Intelsat would allow it to repay all $959 million in secured debt to its banks. Of the six satellites it plans to sell, four are in orbit and two are scheduled for launching in the next year.
Analysts estimated that Loral's satellites have close to 20 percent of the domestic market for satellite services, much of which is used for television broadcasting.
Loral plans to continue to operate five satellites serving Latin America, Asia and Europe, and to reinvigorate its satellite-manufacturing operations. 
Loral also said yesterday that Intelsat had ordered a new satellite from it and had agreed to make a $100 million down payment for the new satellite when the deal closes to buy the six others. That process will require regulatory approval and is expected to take at least four months.
The new order was the first Loral has had in 17 months.
"We hope it's an indication the market is beginning to turn," Mr. Schwartz said. 
Mr. Rusch of TelAstra said the market seemed to be stabilizing and could begin to grow in 2004, buoyed by high-definition television and high-speed communications that use satellite technology. Whether customers will feel confident enough to place orders with Loral is far less clear, he said. 
Mr. Schwartz said yesterday that he had not yet discussed the bankruptcy plan with the company's bondholders. Such creditors could present obstacles if they try to block the plan on the basis that it unfairly pays off Loral's banks while leaving them with a company that is not viable.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about troubles in the satellite business misidentified one of the banks that are financing Intelsat's purchase of six satellites from Loral Space and Communications. Along with Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas, they include Citigroup, not J. P. Morgan Chase.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: OUTLOOK; 
Iraqis Plan War-Crime Court; G.I.'s to Stay Until Elections

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 15 

 BODY:
Iraq's postwar government moved today to form a special war-crimes court to try members of President Saddam Hussein's government, and the top American civilian official in Iraq said American troops would leave as soon as the government ratified a new constitution and held valid national elections. He did not give a timetable for elections.
 "The timing of how long the coalition stays here is effectively now in the hands of the Iraqi people," L. Paul Bremer III, the American occupation administrator in Iraq, said at a news conference here. He also said American officials still had a daunting amount of work to "undo the enormous economic damage" done by Mr. Hussein. 
 Mr. Bremer said that within weeks, Iraq's electricity system would be producing as much power nationwide as it was before the war, though he emphasized that that would still leave the nation more than 30 percent short of demand, especially in the capital, where the power shortage is hurting efforts to provide power for basic services.
Mr. Bremer's comments followed fresh attacks on American troops west of Baghdad, where most of the strikes against American forces have happened in recent weeks. 
In one attack, at 1:30 a.m., soldiers in the Third Infantry Division in Falluja were hit in a "substantial rocket-propelled grenade ambush," said Staff Sgt. J. J. Johnson, a military spokesman. An unknown number of attackers were killed, he said; there were no American casualties.
In another attack, five Iraqis were killed and another was captured after insurgents ambushed American troops near an ammunition depot between Ramadi and Habbaniya, Reuters reported. No soldiers were killed or wounded. 
Thirty-three American troops have died in such attacks since May 1, when President Bush declared the end of major combat; 49 have died in other incidents, like traffic accidents and weapons discharges. Another 239 have been wounded, a coalition official said. 
A typical day brings about a dozen attacks on troops across the country, the official said, adding that troops are continuing to search for any evidence that they are coordinated regionally or nationally.
American officials are bracing for attacks Wednesday and Thursday, the anniversaries of July 16, 1979, the day Mr. Hussein took power, and July 17, 1968, the day of the coup that brought his Baath Party to power.
As security continued to dominate the concerns of Iraqis and the occupation authority, the 25-member Governing Council affirmed that it would establish a special court to try senior members of Mr. Hussein's government and security services for war crimes. Details of how to set up such a court, who would prosecute and who would represent defendants were left to a committee.
The session of the Council today, closed to reporters and ordinary Iraqis, was again dominated by a discussion of reclaiming Iraq's seat at the United Nations, Council members said. The Council summoned Sergio Vieira de Mello, the special representative of Secretary General Kofi Annan, and informed him of their plan to send a delegation to New York for a special United Nations session on Iraq on July 22. 
Mr. de Mello informed the group that because Spain, a strong American ally in Iraq, holds the presidency of the Security Council this month, he was certain a request for a special session could be arranged. But, he added, the question of where Iraqi sovereignty resides in the transition would be up to the credentials committee of the Security Council. 
The Security Council voted in May to recognize the American-British occupation of Iraq and called on the occupation powers to appoint an interim administration. The Governing Council has been recognized as that body, but Western diplomats and some Iraqis say a sovereign Iraqi government will not emerge until elections have been held. 
Ahmad Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress, said in an interview that he was pressing the issue of granting sovereignty for the interim body in part to defend it against statements from some Arab capitalsthat the new Council lacks international legitimacy.
Tonight the leaders of the former Iraqi opposition met in a Baghdad hotel to ventilate concerns that the Governing Council is already facing difficulties in projecting an image that is both independent of the occupation authority and representative of the Iraqi people. 
At his news conference, Mr. Bremer said the Governing Council would decide the process for writing a new constitution and submitting it to a referendum. 
Some members of the Governing Council say a functioning government could be established within 18 months, but the departing commander of the United States Central Command, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, has said troops could be in Iraq as long as four years. 
Another small step taken today was the first payment of wages to former Iraqi soldiers, Agence France-Presse reported. Soldiers had been increaingly unhappy over not being paid since the government collapsed.

HEADLINE: New Hope for the Missouri 

 BODY:
About the only place the environmental community has any real hope of victory in its continuing war with the Bush administration is in the courts. And so it proved last week when Federal District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to reduce water levels in the Missouri River to help save three endangered species: two bird species and one fish species, the pallid sturgeon.
 The decision, which is likely to be challenged, is a victory for American Rivers and other conservation groups. It is a defeat for the White House and for Midwestern commercial interests led by Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri, who insists that lower river levels will threaten municipal water supplies and hurt the barge industry. 
 Scientists have long known that manipulating river flows to mimic the seasonal heartbeat of a natural waterway -- in the Missouri's case, a periodic spring surge and an annual summer ebb -- can save threatened wildlife. That is why the Fish and Wildlife Service, confronted three years ago with clear threats to the three species, ordered the corps to alter seasonal flows. The corps itself concluded in a later study that modest changes of the sort just ordered by Judge Kessler could be made without appreciable damage to commercial interests. It also concluded that the barge industry was of small net economic significance to the region.
This infuriated Mr. Bond, who reminded President Bush of his campaign pledge to leave the river alone. The White House then pressured the service to reverse itself, despite objections from government biologists and the National Academy of Sciences -- elevating politics over science and drawing a sharp rebuke from Judge Kessler.
The lower Missouri can never be restored to its original grandeur. Committed to the barge industry's needs, the corps over the last 40 years has turned a 732-mile stretch of the river between Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Louis into a navigation channel. This will be hard to undo. But on the eve of the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark's historic journey, Americans can begin to hope for a better future for the river that carried the expedition westward.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SEES A $455 BILLION GAP IN THE '03 BUDGET 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15 

 BODY:
The White House today projected a $455 billion budget deficit in the current fiscal year, by far the government's largest deficit ever and $150 billion higher than what the administration predicted just five months ago. 
 Democratic lawmakers said the new calculations showed the folly of President Bush's tax cuts and demonstrated that he was mismanaging the economy. 
 But Joshua B. Bolten, Mr. Bush's new budget director, said a deficit of this magnitude was "manageable if we continue pro-growth economic policies and exercise serious spending discipline."
In dollar terms, the expected deficit would be substantially higher than the previous record, $290 billion in the fiscal year 1992, the last full year of the first Bush administration. 
Using what economists say is the most reliable measurement, the $455 billion represents 4.2 percent of the total economy, somewhat less than the 1983 deficit in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, which was 6 percent. 
But in only six years since 1946 has the deficit been larger than 4.2 percent of the gross domestic product. Not counting the current surplus in the Social Security fund, the deficit would be 5.7 percent of the total economy, the largest since World War II except for 1983, when there was no Social Security surplus. 
The projections released today by the White House's Office of Management and Budget in its midyear review showed the deficit rising to $475 billion in the 2004 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, then declining somewhat as a result of the stronger economy that the administration is forecasting. The deficit was also forecast to be $304 billion in 2005, $238 billion in 2006, $213 billion in 2007 and $226 billion in 2008. In all, that would be about $1.9 trillion in new debt through 2008, making for a total national debt of $8.6 trillion.
The spending side of the budget equation for next year and afterward are almost sure to be higher than those shown in the documents, since the budget office's calculations for the fiscal years after the current one do not include the cost of maintaining troops in Iraq and Afghanistan or rebuilding those nations. Mr. Bolten said those expenses were impossible to predict. The latest Pentagon estimate is that the military costs alone in those countries are running about $5 billion a month.
"You can be sure that the president will ask Congress to spend whatever is necessary to protect our troops," Mr. Bolten said.
So far, the military campaign in Iraq has cost $48 billion, Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller, told The Associated Press today.
The deficits in future years include the president's proposal to spend $400 billion during the next decade to provide prescription drug benefits under Medicare.
The budget was in surplus by $127 billion in fiscal year 2001, the last budget prepared by the Clinton administration and the fourth consecutive year with a surplus. In April 2001, shortly after taking office, the Bush administration forecast a surplus of $334 billion in 2003.
Since then, the economy has faltered, taxes have been cut, and government spending has risen, mostly for the military and domestic security in the aftermath of Sept. 11. As a result, the deficit picture has worsened by $789 billion, from a surplus of $334 billion to a deficit of $455 billion, in just two years.
The budget office calculated that 53 percent of the deterioration was caused by the weak economy and the resulting lower tax receipts, 23 percent by tax cuts and 24 percent by higher spending for the war, domestic security and other items.
As recently as February, the White House's deficit forecast for this fiscal year was limited to $304 billion. Since then, tax revenues have been $66 billion lower than expected, Congress approved $47 billion for war costs in Iraq, taxes were cut by $13 billion and other legislation raised spending by $26 billion.
Mr. Bush did not speak about the budget today. His spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the deficit posed no threat to the economy and would be dealt with as the economy improved and the threat of terrorism subsided. He noted that the deficits projected for after 2004 were half what they are expected to be this year and next.
"The president's highest priorities will always be winning the war on terrorism, protecting the American people and getting our economy growing stronger and faster, and that's where his focus is," Mr. McClellan said.
But Democrats focused on the tax cuts Mr. Bush has pushed through Congress the last three years. Representative John B. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, estimated that the total deficits projected through 2011 would amount to $3.6 trillion and that the total revenue expected to be lost to tax cuts would be $3.7 trillion.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said: "There is no excuse for a $450 billion record deficit this year. Sept. 11 didn't give us that deficit. The poor people didn't give us that deficit. The deficit is the result mainly of massive, irresponsible tax cuts for the richest Americans and the lack of any real plan to boost the economy and put people back to work."
If not for the tax cuts, the deficit this year would be $278 billion, according to the White House. 
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress this morning that to meet the challenge of the deficit, it was important for lawmakers to reinstate lapsed budget rules requiring tax cuts to be offset by spending reductions or other tax increases.
Democratic presidential candidates clearly hope to make the deficit a campaign issue. "The president's economic policies are like quicksand," Senator John Edwards of North Carolina declared. "They keep sucking the nation deeper and deeper into debt."
Republicans in Congress expressed concern about the high deficits but said they were determined to hold spending down. 
"The deficits forecast in today's report are uncomfortable," said Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, chairman of the Budget Committee. But he told reporters, "Tax cuts do not cause deficits. When you reduce taxes, taxes stay in the pocket of people that earn it. We do not have to borrow money in order to reduce taxes. You only borrow money in Washington for spending."
The political consequences of the large deficit are difficult to weigh. Running against the first President Bush in 1992, Bill Clinton managed to make the high deficit a proxy for a weak economy, and that was doubtless a factor in his election. 
Until then, no politician had found the budget deficit to be the kind of issue that got voters exercised.
In terms of the economy, deficits are important mostly to the extent they drive up interest rates. Mr. Bolten, who replaced Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. as budget director late last month, said today that with interest rates the lowest in decades, it was clear that so far the deficit had not been bad for the economy.
Mr. Bolten conceded that if steps were not taken, problems would arise early in the next decade when the boomer generation begins to retire and government spending must increase to pay for their Social Security and Medicare programs. But the budget projections he released today cover only five years, through 2008.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Two Distinct Views Of Workers Rising Up

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
The double bill of documentaries that opens today at the Anthology Film Archives bridges 35 years of leftist political filmmaking and suggests that just about everything has changed in the field but the basic Marxist message. 
 "Be Seeing You" is a 38-minute, black-and-white agitprop piece filmed in 1967 by a French radical collective that called itself SLON -- la Societe de Lancement des Oeuvres Nouvelles (the Company for Launching New Works). 
 SLON's founder and most famous member was Chris Marker, the now 81-year-old globe-trotting documentarist whose work, including "A Grin Without a Cat," has lately been enjoying a revival in New York City. The group's most widely seen film, "Far From Vietnam" (1967), brought together seven celebrated filmmakers, including Jean-Luc Godard, Alain Resnais and Agnes Varda, to offer their personal perspectives on America's war in the former French colony. 
But SLON soon decided that the auteur approach was antithetical to the collectivist message the group wanted to convey. By the time of "Be Seeing You," SLON was doing its best to strip out any traces of subjectivity and stylishness, both of which had come to be considered bourgeois vices. Though "Be Seeing You" bears no director's credit, it is generally attributed to Mr. Marker and the SLON member Mario Marret. And yet it strives for a stylistic neutrality -- a sense that no filmmaker was present to shape the material.
The action, in this case, is a strike movement at a textile factory in Besancon, a city in eastern France. The filmmakers follow a young agitator for the leftist labor union CGT as he tries to shape worker discontent with a new workweek, one alternating day and night shifts, into a walkout. Shot partly in 16-millimeter with synchronized sound and partly in silent 8-millimeter (with a camera borrowed from Mr. Godard), the film consists largely of static close-ups of workers and organizers, who recount the stories of their conversion to socialism in a rough, conversational manner.
There is no cutting away during the long monologues, a technique that would register as an intrusion by the filmmakers. But of course the refusal to cut away is in itself a stylistic choice, and one that can feel as manipulative -- in its somewhat puritanical insistence that the spectator pay grim, undivided attention -- as any amount of more overt directorial intervention. 
Flash forward 35 years, and here is "An Injury to One," a 53-minute film by Travis Wilkerson. Again, the subject is labor organizing, though the setting is now historical -- it is Butte, Mont., in 1917, where Frank Little, an agent of the Industrial Workers of the World, is trying to organize the city's miserably exploited copper miners into striking against the monopolistic Anaconda Mining Company. Little's efforts ended in his lynching, most likely at the hands of private detectives hired by Anaconda. Among those private detectives was the young Dashiell Hammett, who based his brilliant 1927 hard-boiled novel "Red Harvest" on the strike. According to the film, Hammett spoke of having been approached by the mining company to murder Little; he traced his own radicalization to that moment.
Where "Be Seeing You" struggles for self-effacement, "An Injury to One" revels in directorial assertiveness, including an omniscient narrator and an intrusive use of slick, magazine-style graphics to identify characters and spell out slogans. Though much of the movie is composed of historical black-and-white or sepia-tinted photographs, there are occasional explosions into highly saturated color, contemporary images of the devastated Butte area. These new shots are self-consciously composed and conspicuously beautiful in a way that largely serves to draw attention to the director's taste and skill. 
This, of course, would be a capital crime under the SLON aesthetic. Still, can Mr. Wilkerson really be blamed for wanting to find an audience for his work? It's hard to imagine any post-MTV public sitting still for the static camera and fuzzy sound of "Be Seeing You." If the aim of the political filmmaker is to create an urge to action, Mr. Wilkerson's marching-band approach is unquestionably more effective than SLON's somber string quartet. But here, the string quartet is unquestionably more artistically satisfying -- more economical, more refined and more respectful of human experience -- than the flash and filigree of "An Injury to One."

HEADLINE: We're Still the One 

BYLINE:  By Robert Lane Greene; Robert Lane Greene is an editor at Economist.com.

 BODY:
A quick read of the European Union's draft Constitution provides plenty of evidence of the creation of a world power. The draft, which will be formally presented to European leaders tomorrow, calls for a bill of rights, a foreign minister and a single trade policy. It even proposes a motto, "United in Diversity." But those who hope for the emergence of a Superpower Europe that can rival the United States -- and those who fear such an entity will be an anti-American menace -- will have their expectations disappointed. 
 True, the union next year will have 450 million citizens and an economy the size of America's, the consequence of expanding to 25 member states from 15. But the Constitution, which will be debated and then put in its final form by next summer, falls well short of creating a full, superpower-sized actor on the international stage. 
 The union will wield a great deal of influence through its status as a single trade bloc, but it has done so for decades -- nothing new here. As for a single "foreign and security policy," the draft represents a failure for those -- especially the French, but also notably the Belgians -- who want to see a unified Europe strong enough to stand up to the United States on the world stage. There may be a foreign minister, but foreign policy will remain subject to unanimity. This means that when members disagree, as they did over Iraq and will surely do over any controversial issue in the future, foreign policy will effectively remain with individual national governments.
National governments will also maintain control of the two biggest elements of state power: money and the military. The union has a large budget (nearly 100 billion euros, about $111 billion), which it spends on things like subsidies to poor areas, agriculture and foreign aid. But that spending is dwarfed by the size of the national budgets put together, and even under the new Constitution the union will gain no power to raise its own taxes -- it will remain dependent on the member states. And though the union plans a new rapid-reaction military force, which could see duty in places like Macedonia (where several union members now have troops under a union flag), the creation of a truly sizable "euro army" that could rival America's remains unthinkable, not least because it would require Europeans to spend money they do not have on upgrading military hardware. 
There are areas where the draft would significantly expand the union's powers, especially in the area of criminal law. This would be added to areas like trade, monetary policy and farming where the union already has a dominant role. And some worry that a provision requiring the European Union to promote economic "cohesion" among the member countries could be a Trojan horse for ever-increasing powers. However, other provisions, much like the 10th Amendment to America's own Constitution, declare that powers not given to the union should remain with the member states. This could lead to wrangling between those members that want to do more at the union level and the skeptics -- especially Britain and the Scandinavian countries -- that want to keep powers closer to home. 
All this is to say that the Constitution is not the radical leap forward to a United States of Europe. It is telling that this very name was considered and rejected. Most Europeans still feel their national identity more strongly than their European one. Cooperation at the union level makes sense on technical issues like agriculture, fisheries, the environment, trade and so forth. But until a truly European people is created, many of the union's citizens will rightly prefer that decisions closer to the heart and the wallet -- whether to go to war, or to raise taxes -- be made by the national governments they think they know well, not by the distant and bafflingly complex set of institutions of the European Union.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A look at wine sales over the Internet shows the price of some regulations in the name of consumer protection.

 BODY:
REMEMBER when getting a mortgage meant visiting a bank or a broker in person, when handcrafted jewelry was something you could buy only at a gallery, when finding out-of-print books meant combing used-book stores, when only New Yorkers could buy certain high-end cosmetics?
 Internet commerce changed all that, breaking down many local monopolies and giving people in small towns access to the product variety formerly found only in the largest metropolitan areas. Now, anyone anywhere can buy just about any book, any music CD, any electronic product, and all the varied merchandise on e-Bay. 
 But, there are exceptions. 
State regulations passed long before anyone conceived of electronic commerce block direct Internet sales in a number of industries, from contact lenses to automobiles. These laws were often passed in the name of consumer protection.
But do those benefits outweigh their negative effects on electronic commerce? The agency charged with protecting consumer welfare by ensuring competition -- the Federal Trade Commission -- wants to know.
In October 2002, the agency held a three-day workshop at which scholars and industry representatives looked at barriers to e-commerce in 12 varied fields, from pharmaceutical sales to legal services. (Transcripts are available at www.ftc.gov/opp/ecommerce/anticompetitive/index.htm.)
Now F.T.C. staff economists have taken a detailed look at a single industry: online wine sales.
Like books or music, wine is something you can buy online simply by knowing the name of the product; you don't have to try it on. And wine comes in more varieties than a local retailer can handle.
There are more than 2,000 wineries today, compared with 500 to 800 in 1975, the F.T.C. report said, and "many of these new wineries produce relatively small amounts of wine, often less than 2,000 cases annually, whereas large wineries can produce over 300,000 cases annually."
Titled "Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine," the report considers two questions: Are state shipping bans necessary to prevent sales to minors? And how do the bans affect the prices and variety available to consumers? (The report can be downloaded at www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/winereport2.pdf.)
Twenty-six states prohibit almost all direct shipping of out-of-state wines, including seven that make direct sales a felony. Consumers in these states can buy directly from winemakers only if they actually visit the winery.
Even states that allow direct shipping usually impose restrictions. Most limit the amount of wine a consumer can receive. Minnesota prohibits all Internet sales, while Montana requires consumers to get a $50 "connoisseur's permit" before they can receive out-of-state shipments.
These regulations, too, stifle online competition. "Some package delivery companies will not deliver wine to Montana, because they do not want to try to verify whether a Montana customer has a connoisseur's permit," the report said. "They will not deliver to Connecticut for the same reason. According to the Wine Institute, package delivery companies also will not deliver to Massachusetts, partially because Massachusetts requires each individual delivery truck to get a license to deliver alcohol, and will not give a license to an entire fleet of trucks."
Supporters argue that the bans are needed to block sales to minors. So F.T.C. researchers surveyed state enforcement agencies, asking whether they had complaints of online sales to minors. The answer was generally no.
Teenagers who want to drink rarely order cases of relatively expensive wine, paying by credit card. They have easier, cheaper, faster ways to obtain alcohol. States that do not ban direct shipping have found less restrictive ways to enforce drinking-age laws, like requiring an adult signature on delivery.
Bans on direct shipments do, however, hurt adult wine drinkers, raising prices and limiting choice -- even in highly competitive retail markets.
Jerry Ellig, an economist who is deputy director of the F.T.C.'s office of policy planning, and Alan E. Wiseman, a political scientist at Ohio State University, compared prices and variety in stores with the wine available online. (Their paper is included as an appendix to the F.T.C. report.)
Their methodology gave bans the benefit of the doubt. They did not consider obscure vintages, surveying only the wines listed as the most popular among restaurant patrons by Wine and Spirits magazine. For their bricks-and-mortar survey, they used stores within 10 miles of McLean, Va., an affluent Washington suburb where wine is widely available.
At the time Virginia had a ban on direct shipments of wine, but the state allowed retail sales some other states outlaw. In Northern Virginia, Mr. Ellig said, "we have specialty shops, we have beverage megastores, we have groceries that are allowed to sell wine." If the traditional system works for consumers anywhere, it should work in these suburbs.
Yet for wines that cost more than $20 a bottle, online buyers could save $4.40 to $7.19 a bottle, depending on the shipping method and quantity ordered. The more expensive the wine, the greater the savings.
More surprising was the difference in availability. Even among the 83 popular wines surveyed, 15 percent were not available at any local store. "I would have thought retail outlets would have stocked all popular wines," Asheesh Agarwal, an F.T.C. economist, said in an interview.
If state bans hurt consumers who want popular wines, they are even more damaging to "the consumer who very strongly wants some particular wine from some particular winery who can't find it locally," Mr. Ellig said.
Why, then, do the bans persist? The answer is interest-group politicking. Local businesses, whether they sell wine, cars or insurance, are keeping out the competition.
At the workshop last October, "everybody had a claim as to why they were different and e-commerce was fine for everybody else that we were looking at," Mr. Ellig said. "Nobody attempted to defend the regulations as a whole in all these industries. It was almost comical."

HEADLINE: Developer Wants 9/11 Bonds for Times's Project in Midtown 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The New York Times Company's development partner in building the newspaper's new headquarters on Eighth Avenue has asked city officials for $400 million in tax-exempt bonds that were designated for rebuilding New York after the attack on the World Trade Center.
 The developer, Forest City Ratner, has told city and state officials that it needs the special federal financing, known as Liberty Bonds, because it is nearly impossible in the current economic environment to obtain a conventional construction loan for its portion of the planned 52-story tower on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets. 
 A spokesman for the Times Company noted that the newspaper would not benefit directly from the bonds. But some critics questioned whether a project in Midtown, which embraces some of the most valuable real estate in the world, should receive another round of subsidies. 
The federal government provided up to $8 billion in Liberty Bonds in 2002 as part of an initiative to provide tax-exempt financing for major projects to revitalize Lower Manhattan in the wake of the September 2001 attack. The legislation for the bonds set aside up to $1.6 billion for residential projects downtown and up to $2 billion for commercial projects outside Lower Manhattan.
The Times and Forest City reached an agreement with city officials more than two years ago to build the Eighth Avenue skyscraper as part of a deal in which the newspapergot $26.1 million in sales tax breaks and other subsidies.
Under the terms of their partnership, The Times will own the 2nd through 27th floors of the tower, totaling about 875,000 square feet, while Forest City Ratner will own the upper floors, 725,000 square feet. With millions of square feet of vacant space in Midtown Manhattan today, Forest City has been unable to find a tenant for its space, making it difficult to secure financing. 
Bruce Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, declined to comment on the application yesterday. The partners are scheduled to take possession of the land for the project at the end of August and to begin demolition immediately. The tower should be completed in the third quarter of 2006, about a year behind schedule.
Michael Golden, vice chairman and senior vice president of the Times Company, said the Liberty Bonds would be a valuable investment for the city. The Times, he added, would not be involved in the bond financing. He said the original deal for the project was drawn up several years ago amid a real estate boom. "The real estate world has changed," he said. "There's a lot more space out there. I think anything the city and state can do to make the development of this office building happen is a legitimate expenditure. It's a good thing for the city to have this building go up."
Bettina Damiani, project director of Good Jobs New York, an advocacy group that evaluates economic projects, disagreed, saying the city had already struck a deal for the Times project that required The Times and the developer to proceed.
"It's disappointing," she said. "They're certainly taking advantage of everything that's out there. But the whole point of the Liberty Bonds was to rebuild downtown and create back-office space in Brooklyn and Queens so companies don't flee to Jersey. It wasn't about Midtown."
Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff confirmed yesterday that the city had received an application from Forest City Ratner. He declined to discuss the specifics of the proposal, but he did say that the city would employ two criteria in evaluating its merits: whether the project has boroughwide or citywide importance, and whether the project would not be built without Liberty Bond financing. 
Like Forest City, the developer Douglas Durst hopes to get tax-exempt financing for a Midtown project. He wants $700 million in Liberty Bonds to build a two-million-square-foot tower with Bank of America at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.
City and state officials have approved a number of residential projects, but there have been few commercial applicants because of corporate layoffs and an anemic economy. The developer Larry A. Silverstein has received tentative approval for $400 million in Liberty Bonds to rebuild the skyscraper at 7 World Trade Center, and Forest City Ratner received approval for $113 million in bonds to build an office building for Bank of New York at Atlantic Center in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Panel Suggests Postal Service Should Close Some Offices 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
A presidential commission is recommending that money-losing post offices, many in small towns, be closed and that the Postal Service be given more freedom to change rates.
 The President's Commission on the United States Postal Service, appointed by President Bush to make recommendations on the future of the postal services, began voting on proposals today. 
 While the commission rejects the idea of making the Postal Service a private company, several of its recommendations could have far-reaching impact on virtually all Americans if they are accepted by Congress and the president. The commission is to deliver its final report by the end of the month. 
One recommendation calls for creation of a panel to study the postal network and recommend closings and consolidations of post offices.
"You don't necessarily need post offices, you need postal services delivered in the most convenient way," said the commission's co-chairman, Henry J. Pearce, chairman of the Hughes Electronics Corporation.
Kiosks offering a wide variety of mail services are being opened in shopping malls, Mr. Pearce noted, and postal services can also be made available in grocery stores, banks and other places.
Today's recommendations did not address the Postal Service's work force of about 850,000, though that is expected to be in the final report. Mr. Pearce said after the meeting that the work force needs to be "right-sized" in the face of automation and consolidation.
In many communities, the post office owns valuable, centrally located real estate that could be sold to raise income, the commission noted. In other towns, where the post office has been a center of activity, the agency might donate the facility to the local government for use as a community center or town hall.
The commission wants to see maximum local participation in the final decision on each office, said its other co-chairman, James A. Johnson, vice chairman of the merchant banking firm Perseus, L.L.C.
The Postal Service, which has some 35,000 offices across the country, has long sought to close those it considers unnecessary. Those efforts have often been thwarted by Congress when communities complained that their post offices were vital even if they did lose money.
With that in mind, the commission recommended that when a set of national recommendations is prepared for closings and consolidations, it take effect unless rejected in its entirety by Congress within 45 days.
Neal Denton of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, a trade group, said he expected the report to get a warm reception in Congress.
A recommendation for more flexibility in setting rates is something the post office has sought for years, complaining often that the current process is too slow and cumbersome.
Under the commission's plan, an independent agency would establish rate ceilings, with postal management able to change rates below that level to meet market needs and compete with other delivery services.
"If any business in America had to operate under the constraints of the rate-setting process, it would be out of business," Mr. Pearce said.
Still, the commission said rates should be raised as seldom as possible.
And it said rates for services like first-class mail, where the Postal Service has a monopoly, should not be used to subsidize rates for items like overnight mail and parcel delivery, where the agency competes with other businesses.
The Postal Service suffered a loss of $676 million last year, but is hoping to end this year about $600 million in the black. The agency, which does not receive taxpayer money for operations, has seen a decline in mail volume two years in a row for the first time. Factors in that decline include a weak economy, anthrax deaths and increasing electronic commerce.
Elimination of the postal monopoly and privatization of the Postal Service have also been suggested. The commission rejected both ideas, though it said the agency should have a new, corporatelike board to govern it.
Richard J. Strasser, the Postal Service vice president and chief financial officer, did not comment directly on the recommendations, but lauded the commission, saying, "One has to be really impressed with the depth and quality of the recommendations they have put together."

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Chase Reports 78% Rise inProfit, to $1.83 Billion 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase & Company said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose 78 percent as bond trading climbed and losses from bad loans declined.
 Net income was $1.83 billion, or 89 cents a share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 50 cents, in the period a year earlier. It was the second consecutive quarter of growth for the bank, which is based in New York. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had forecast that the company would earn 63 cents. 
 J. P. Morgan's profit is rising amid a revival of earnings at investment banks, with Merrill Lynch & Company, Citigroup and the Bank of America Corporation all reporting this week that profit exceeded analysts' expectations. The consecutive gains are the first since Chase Manhattan bought J. P. Morgan & Company for $32 billion in 2000.
"These guys are leveraged to a lot of trends that have gone up -- the economy is better, the markets are better, banking is better," said David Nelson, who helps manage about $200 billion, including 12.9 million J. P. Morgan shares, at Legg Mason Funds Management in Baltimore. "We were ready to kick them in the shins" when profit was falling.
Net revenue increased 27 percent to $8.6 billion and trading revenue more than doubled to $1.48 billion. The company set aside $435 million for bad loans, down 47 percent from the period a year ago.
"What we are seeing is the beginning of the payoff," the chief financial officer, Dina Dublon, said. "You can see it very clearly in the market-share gains that we have had over the recent past."
J. P. Morgan stock is up 51 percent this year, the most in the Philadelphia/KBW index of 24 bank stocks, and is more than double its level in October, its lowest since 1995. The shares fell $1.04, or nearly 3 percent, to $36.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
J. P. Morgan is benefiting from $41 billion in acquisitions that transformed the company from a corporate lender to a Wall Street investment bank. With the repeal in 1999 of the 66-year-old Glass-Steagall Act that prevented commercial banks from underwriting certain securities, J. P. Morgan can now compete with firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by selling advice and underwriting to the companies it makes loans to.

HEADLINE: Executives More Optimistic but Still Expect Weak Growth 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Chief executives of big companies have become more optimistic about the economy, but they expect growth to remain weak enough for job cuts to continue through at least the end of the year, according to a survey released yesterday.
 The executives, who have been far better at forecasting the economy's turns over the last three years than either Wall Street or Federal Reserve officials, predicted that a new recession was extremely unlikely. But few of the 117 executives polled planned to increase their spending on new factories and equipment, and 42 percent said the size of their work force would shrink in the next six months while 16 percent said it would grow. 
 "This is an economy that can expand, but not dramatically or quickly," said Philip M. Condit, chief of the Boeing Company and chairman of the Business Roundtable, the lobbying group of top executives that conducted the survey. Executives, he added, "are expecting moderate but measurable improvement."
The economy entered a recession in March 2001, according to a committee of academic economists considered to be the arbiter of the business cycle. Growth resumed later that year, but it has been too weak to persuade companies to hire workers. More than 2.5 million jobs have disappeared since early 2001, making this hiring slump the worst in 20 years and the longest in more than 60 years.
All the confusing data has caused the committee of economists to avoid declaring an end to the recession. The members of the committee, which is run by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group, met yesterday and said that if they reached a decision they would announce it this morning.
Since the economy began weakening, chief executives have been correctly predicting that it would struggle to overcome the 1990's bubble in stock prices and corporate investment. But Wall Street economists and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, have repeatedly predicted a healthy recovery, only to be proven too optimistic.
"A year, a year and a half ago, a lot of C.E.O.'s were accused of being overly pessimistic," Mr. Condit said yesterday, in a conference call with reporters. "They turned out to be fairly accurate."
Now the two groups appear to moving toward each other. Like chief executives, Wall Street forecasters expect the economy to grow 2.3 percent this year, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter. Mr. Greenspan said this week that the economy seemed to be improving but that the Fed planned to keep interest rates low for "as long as needed" to assure a recovery.
Executives and economists alike cite the stock market's recent rise, the low level of interest rates and the recent tax cut as reasons for optimism. Compared with the previous survey conducted by the Business Roundtable, in April, more executives now expect their sales to increase this year and slightly fewer are planning job cuts.
Still, executives remain more circumspect than many economists. Only 14 percent plan to increase capital investment in their businesses, one of the economy's most important engines. Seventy-four percent will hold investment steady, and 12 percent will reduce it, according to the survey.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Requests Up 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The number of applications Americans filed for mortgages last week rose slightly on a pickup in demand for loans to buy homes and a modest decline in mortgage rates, according to an industry survey.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said yesterday that its seasonally adjusted gauge of overall mortgage requests rose to 1,358.2 for the week ended July 11, up 0.9 percent from the previous week's 1,346.3. 
 Interest rates, excluding fees, on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the home loan type held by most Americans, fell to 5.33 percent from the prior week's 5.37 percent.

HEADLINE: Upbeat Reports on Retail Prices and Factories 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose modestly in June and manufacturers increased production by the largest amount since the start of the year, separate reports indicated yesterday.
 The Consumer Price Index, the principal gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent, the Labor Department reported, the first increase since March. Prices decreased 0.3 percent in April and were flat in May. 
 A report from the Federal Reserve said factory output rose 0.4 percent in June, the second consecutive month that production was up and the best showing since January. Production rose for autos, home electronics and chemical products -- encouraging news for the nation's manufacturers, which have been hardest hit in the economy's troubles. 
Taken together, the reports "raised hopes that the economy is getting back on a healthy, noninflationary growth track," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. 
Stephen Cecchetti, an economics professor at Brandeis University, said the Consumer Price Index "really does validate the Fed's view that it can keep interest rates low for some time without worrying too much about inflation." 
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core index of consumer prices was unchanged in June, after rising 0.3 percent in May. 
The modest increase in prices over all reflected a 0.8 rise in the cost of energy, which fell 3.1 percent in May. Energy prices remain relatively high, in part from fears that oil-producing nations may reduce output. Natural gas prices are up on talk of shortages resulting from increased industrial demand. 
Overall industrial activity, which includes not only factories but also mines and utilities, rose 0.1 percent in June for the second consecutive month, the Fed said. Mining output went up 1 percent, while production at gas and electric utilities dropped 3.5 percent, reflecting last month's relatively cool weather.
In still another report, business inventories edged down 0.2 percent in May, while sales were flat, the Commerce Department said. Companies, still unsure of customer demand, have been cautious about their inventory levels.

HEADLINE: Ford Reports 27% Drop In 2nd-Quarter Earnings 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 16 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's earnings fell nearly 27 percent in the second quarter, and the company said today that it expected profits to be flat for the second half of the year. 
 The declining profits reflected sluggish vehicle sales in the critical North American market, where Ford's market share is also declining, and prices that continue to fall if one factors in the rising costs of incentives like rebates and interest-free financing. 
 "It is a tough world in terms of industry volume; it's a tough world in terms of overcapacity and the consequential effect on pricing, rebates and incentives," the company's vice chairman, Allan D. Gilmour, said. 
"There's not much strength at all in the U.S. economy," he said, adding that "we're not planning on any substantial upturn either this year or as we look into the early part of next year." 
Ford reported net income of $417 million in the second quarter, or 22 cents a share, down from $570 million, or 29 cents, in 2002.
The report came today as Big Three contract talks with the United Automobile Workers union opened at the headquarters of the Chrysler Group, a division of the German company DaimlerChrysler. 
Chrysler recently warned that next week it will report a $1.2 billion quarterly loss. At a news briefing, one reporter elicited a smile from Chrysler's top negotiator, John Franciosi, when he asked if Chrysler's losses would help its negotiating position. "It's a tough plus," Mr. Franciosi said. "You certainly don't want to ever have a quarter like we're going to announce next week."
Much of the Big Three's problems relate to foreign competitors like Toyota Motor and Honda Motor taking market share; the union's membership has also dwindled, in part, because it has failed to organize a single domestic assembly plant solely owned by a foreign automaker.
A top union negotiator said today that getting Chrysler's help in organizing American plants operated by its corporate cousin, Mercedes, would be an issue in the talks. 
Talks open at General Motors on Thursday and Ford on Friday. 
At Ford, results beat analysts' estimates, but executives said the company was essentially forecasting earnings of 3 cents a share for the rest of the year, having earned 67 cents already and holding to a goal of earning 70 cents for the full year. 
Mr. Gilmour said a loss of 15 cents a share was expected in the third quarter, as the company scales back production. 
Shares of Ford fell 65 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $10.99.
"We believe that deterioration in industry fundamentals will continue to more than offset Ford's operating performance," wrote John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a note released shortly after earnings were announced. 
Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said "you've got an automotive business that barely made money. All of it was made by the finance company," referring to Ford Motor Credit. 
He added that investors had hoped the company would have increased earnings expectations for the full year, having nearly met its full-year outlook already. 
Revenue at Ford fell to $40.7 billion in the second quarter from $42.2 billion in the period a year earlier. Worldwide vehicle sales fell by 137,000 units, to 1.7 million cars and trucks. 
The company's European operations were a particular trouble spot as industry sales declined along with prices. Ford sales also became more concentrated in less-profitable vehicles. Ford Europe reported a pretax loss of $525 million in the second quarter, compared with an $18 million loss a year earlier. 
The company showed improvement in cost-cutting and in the performance of the Premier Automotive Group, the luxury division that oversees Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin. The company has described both areas as important in turning itself around after losing $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002.
Premier Automotive had pretax earnings of $166 million in the second quarter in contrast to a $122 million loss a year earlier. The company said its cost-cutting efforts were ahead of plans, having trimmed $1.9 billion in overall costs compared with a $500 million goal for the year.

Just a Dribble Of Oil Exports As Iraq Struggles

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 16 

 BODY:
In a further indication of the troubles facing its once mighty oil industry, Iraq plans to export only eight million barrels of oil this month, industry officials here said, a small fraction of its prewar output.
 The unexpectedly slow revival of this pillar of the Iraqi economy, which has been plagued by looting and sabotage, has helped keep oil prices hovering around $30 a barrel on world markets for weeks. The industry's difficulties may also derail some of the plans of the allied authority here, whose budget for the year assumes sizable oil revenues. 
 "Certainly for this year and most of next year, the vast majority will come from oil," L. Paul Bremer III, the American occupation administrator in Iraq, said of budget revenues at a news conference last week. "That is a fact of life we cannot get away from." 
American officials said recently that Iraq's budget for the rest of 2003 would be $6 billion to $7 billion. Half or somewhat more -- about $3.5 billion -- would come from oil exports, they said. 
That is far below the $15 billion to $20 billion in annual Iraqi oil revenue that the Bush administration had projected before the war. 
At $20 a barrel -- the price that the allies are using, despite the much higher average price of oil this year -- Iraq would need to export about 800,000 barrels a day to deliver such revenues to the budget, said Raad Alkadiri, an expert on Iraqi oil and a director of PFC Energy, a Washington consulting group. 
The eight million barrels to be exported this month amounts to only 258,000 barrels a day. Before the war Iraq exported, legally and otherwise, about two million barrels a day.
For months, the Iraqi Oil Ministry, backed by the Americans, has predicted that oil production, and exports, would gradually improve. Late in June, Thamir Ghadhban, the ministry's interim chief executive, said that production would reach about 1.5 million barrels a day by mid-July. But Oil Ministry officials say that production now hovers between 900,000 and 950,000 barrels a day.
"Our superiors at the Oil Ministry said that we could export about 500,000 barrels a day in July," one oil industry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "But we're not sure now. People are surprised. We thought we could do better than this."
Oil traders said they certainly believed that Iraq's oil industry would rebound quickly; near the end of the war, the price of oil slid into the mid-$20-a-barrel range. But it has climbed back as traders have come to understand that in the near term, Iraq cannot sustain robust production.
"The market seems to have resigned itself to a long wait," Thomas P. Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in Manhattan, said. 
The uncertainty around Iraqi oil exports is sure to complicate any decision that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting States makes about oil output for the rest of the year when it meets in Vienna on July 31, said Walid Khadduri, editor of the Middle East Economic Survey.
"OPEC will be in the dark because the Iraqis are in the dark," Mr. Khadduri said.
At the last meeting of OPEC, in mid-June, members said they would monitor the market and rein in production that exceeds official quotas. They appear to be taking this step.
When a country has a regular flow of exports, it signs monthly contracts with buyers. The Iraqi oil is being sold through a tender instead, the industry official said, because Baghdad is unsure about its ability to maintain a steady flow. 
All the oil for export is from the Basra area in the south, which is producing 350,000 to 400,000 barrels a day, or about 20 percent of its prewar levels. Looting has stunted the output of the South Oil Company, and some major repairs may not be completed until the end of the year, American officials said in a recent issue of Platts, an oil industry journal.
About three million to four million barrels have been put in storage tanks in the south since the first tender for Iraqi oil was announced on June 12, said an official at the State Oil Marketing Organization, the ministry's export arm. The ministry is seeking to scrape together an equal amount this month, the official said. The oil will be shipped to foreign buyers from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf.
So far, there are no plans for exports from the Northern Oil Company, which manages production in the vast Kirkuk fields, although it is producing more than its counterpart in Basra. Adel Qazzaz, director general of Northern Oil, attributed the delay to leaks along the company's pipeline to an export terminal in Turkey.
But at least two explosions that were clearly sabotage damaged that pipeline last month. In Baghdad, Oil Ministry officials said that oil facilities in Iraq had been disrupted by more acts of sabotage, but they declined to elaborate.
"On the issue of sabotage, clearly that line of operation continues," said Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of land forces in Iraq, at a news conference last week.
"We as a coalition force have adapted some of our patrolling and some of our aerial reconnaissance and just our regular movements around the country to ensure that we are providing collateral protection to the critical infrastructure of the country."
The allies have begun to patrol pipelines and oil facilities by helicopter, an Oil Ministry spokesman said. The ministry and the Americans have also hired villagers and tribespeople who live near pipelines to keep an eye on them. But many Iraqi oil officials and engineers grumble that the response is too little, too late.
"The looting came as a surprise to the Americans," said Mr. Alkadiri, who recently traveled to Iraq. "And the Americans' inability to deal with it came as a surprise to the Iraqis."

HEADLINE: At Sea or on Safari, Satellite Phones Hook Users 

BYLINE:  By SAM LUBELL 

 BODY:
FOR years, Arctic explorers, oil field workers, globe-trotting businessmen and war correspondents have used satellite phones to harness a telephone signal in places where utility poles were scarce. The phones, now with smaller handsets with better reception and lower prices, are gaining wider appeal. 
 Satellite phones work by communicating with one or more satellites that orbit the earth. They can be used in the remote countryside, aboard seagoing vessels and in the developing world, where cellphone networks often do not exist. The phones, which just four years ago were as bulky as suitcases and cost thousands of dollars to buy and hundreds more to operate, are now not much larger than cellphones and can be purchased for a few hundred dollars or rented for less than $50 a week (plus $1 to $2 a minute for calls). The most frequent new users of the phones are leisure travelers, yachters and small-business people. 
 "We've been turning people away since we got them," said C.J. Webber, the manager of Atlantic Radio & Telephone in Miami, which began offering satellite phone rentals at its Web site, www.satphonestore.com, three years ago. The company now owns 150 of the phones, which it rents for $45 a week, plus $1.75 a minute. Every phone has been rented. "We've been in business for 28 years, and this year will be the best we've had," he said. 
 Many of the renters are people on cruises seeking to avoid shipboard rates, which can range from $8 to $14 a minute. Mr. Webber said other customers include boaters, schoolteachers (mostly for field trips), businessmen, hunters and missionaries.
 Rental phones are available at dozens of other sites, including www.satellitephonesource.com and www.worldcell.com. 
 Michelle Pierce, of Clarksville, Tenn., rented an Iridium satellite phone for her husband, Robert, a chief warrant officer with the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division, who is now in Iraq. Army regulations permit Chief Warrant Officer Pierce to use its phones for a call home only once a week, his wife said. By contrast, the satellite phone enables the family to speak every few days, Ms. Pierce said. Their 4-year-old son, Gunner, has been able to stay in touch with his father. "That really is the most important thing, him being able to hear his daddy's voice during this separation," Ms. Pierce said.
 Although the high price of satellite phones makes renting a better choice for most users, a small but growing number of people are buying them. The two biggest network providers are Globalstar and Iridium. Globalstar's phones start at about $500, and airtime costs about 17 cents a minute and up. Iridium's phones reach much farther, but they cost about $1,500, and airtime runs $1.50 a minute and up. 
 Darold Maxwell, an avid sailor and a busy lawyer in Bacliff, Tex., a Gulf Coast suburb of Houston, says he uses his Globalstar satellite phone every day he is on his boat, out of reach of a cellphone connection. The satellite phone lets him stay on the water much longer, avoiding trips back to shore to keep in touch with clients. "They don't have to know where I am," he said. "They could think I was back in Houston." 
 Mr. Maxwell used the phone when the water pump, a critical piece of equipment, failed while he was in the Bahamas. He ordered a replacement and had it delivered to a nearby island, saving a significant amount of time. He has also used the phone while ashore to guide his wife through boat repairs. 
 For Mr. Maxwell's friend Howard Hilborn, a satellite phone was more than a convenience. Late last month, he was in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico when Tropical Storm Bill brought huge waves and 50-mile-an-hour winds. Using the satellite phone, Mr. Hilborn was able to call Mr. Maxwell to learn the direction in which the storm was moving, then steer out of the worst of it. All the while, he said, he did not have the added worry about a radio signal, which can be less dependable than a satellite connection. 
 "If I had not gotten the information from them, I would have sailed this thing straight into the heart of the storm," Mr. Holborn said. "In those kind of conditions, you can make a mistake and it can get serious fast."
 The satellites used by the Globalstar and Iridium systems are in low-earth orbit (up to about 930 miles) to allow users to carry small phones instead of the cumbersome models that some reporters still carry. Smaller phones, with smaller antennas and less signal power, cannot pick up signals from satellites in higher orbits. 
 Another provider, Thuraya, uses low-earth orbit satellites to operate in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 
 The phones can be used for wireless Internet connections, although the low-earth satellites usually only have enough bandwidth for slow-speed data transmission. One provider of high-bandwidth satellite phone services is Inmarsat, but it uses larger phones. Another problem with both kinds of satellite phone service is that the phones' antennas must be pointed at a wide expanse of sky, which is rare in big cities. 
 Satellite phones equal or surpass most cellphones in reception and sound quality, and are far less prone to the static that plagued models a few years ago. Reception is also superior to that of radio transmitters, which were once the only alternative for people at sea and far from cities. 
 At Kesagami Lodge, a fishing lodge in northern Ontario, the nearest town, Moose Factory, is 40 miles away. The lodge now depends entirely on satellite phones to maintain contact with the outside world. A satellite connection was critical when an employee, Rheal Groux, had an attack of appendicitis and the lodge owners were unable to call for help by radio because there was no signal. They were able to use a satellite phone that belonged to a local resident. 
 "Rheal owes his life to the satellite telephone," said Bob Mattson, co-owner of the lodge, adding that he and his partner, Marsha Gibbs, "were hooked on the phones after that."
 "With a radio signal it had been hit or miss," Mr. Mattson said. Rain or snow could interfere with the signal or knock the radio antenna out of kilter. But with satellite phones, the service is always available. 
 For one group of out-of-the-way consumers, those in towns so remote that a conventional telephone network has not yet reached them, satellite phones are an economical alternative. The Kativik regional government, which administers a broad swath of northern Quebec, bought Globalstar satellite phones for its 14 Inuit communities, many of which had been without telephone service.
Several other communities in northern Canada use satellite phones, as do residents of Alaska, Montana and New Mexico, where phone service is often sparse. 
 Still, while sales and rentals of satellite phones have begun to pick up, the market has yet to take off. "As a consumer product, it may be a little ahead of its time," said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association, a manufacturers group. But the future may not be very far off.
 "I remember when the rental of cellphones was a big business," Mr. Barry said. "And now they've become ubiquitous, while rentals have become a very small market. It's likely you'll see that scenario play out with satellite phones."

Dial Tone
Making Calls From All Over
Satellite phones can be purchased or rented through network providers, at retail stores, over the telephone or on the Web.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Circuits on Thursday about the increased use of satellite phones misstated the reason small handsets cannot be used with satellites in high orbits. They do not have enough power to transmit signals to the satellites; there is no problem in receiving signals. The article also referred incorrectly to the satellites used by one service provider, Thuraya. They are in high orbits, about 22,000 miles above the earth, not in low orbits.
A picture caption misstated the given name of a lawyer who keeps in touch with clients by satellite phone. He is Darold Maxwell, not Donald.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Begins Cleanup at 10 Toxic Waste Sites and Says 10 Others Will Wait 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency said today that it was starting expensive, long-term cleanups at 10 Superfund toxic waste sites and putting 10 others aside for later, giving new weight to economic development potential as a factor in choosing sites.
 The agency said that all preliminary work had been done to begin cleanups at the other sites but that there was not enough money to get to them now. Environmentalists said that decision was evidence that the Bush administration was not putting enough emphasis on the cleanups. 
 The agency released to The Associated Press lists of the 10 sites sharing in the $49 million in startup money for new cleanups as well as the sites that were passed over. 
Among the sites chosen for cleanups were the DeRewal Chemical Company in Hunterdon County, N.J.; a Denver smelting area along Interstate 70 and a former wood treating facility in Conroe, Texas, where redevelopment has begun for commercial and residential uses.
Marianne L. Horinko, the agency's acting administrator, said the primary deciding factor was still the relative health risks posed by each site. Money for the cleanups comes from both Congress and what the agency can collect from polluters.
"There's not enough money to start everything we want this year," said Ms. Horinko, who before taking over as temporary head of the agency this week oversaw its Superfund program. 
But she said agency officials also looked at other factors, including development potential, prospects for reimbursing the government and the impact of environmental injustices.
"I've made revitalization one of my key themes in my tenure here," Ms. Horinko said. "Most of these sites, we get an added benefit when we clean them up, not only can we protect the community, but we also raise property values and bring jobs back to the community." 
She pointed to the Bunker Hill site in the Coeur d'Alene River basin in northern Idaho, where communities were built on mine wastes, saying it represents the opportunity to build "a world-class recreation area."
Ms. Horinko also cited a former Superfund site in Denver where high-grade radium ore was processed until the 1920's, but was cleaned up decades later and used for a Home Depot store that opened in 1996.
Besides the cleanups in Colorado, Idaho, New Jersey and Texas, the agency approved the following sites:
Central Wood Preserving Company, East Feliciana Parish, La.
Mallard Bay Landing Bulk Plant, Grand Chenier, La.
Newton County Wells, Missouri
The Fruit Avenue site, Albuquerque
Eureka Mills, Eureka, Utah.
The 10 sites for which the environmental agency declined to provide financing were these:
Jennison-Wright Corporation, Granite City, Ill.
Continental Steel Corporation, Kokomo, Ind.
Marion Pressure Treating Company, Marion, La.
Atlas Tack Corporation, Fairhaven, Mass.
New Hampshire Plating Company, Merrimack, N.H.
Mohawk Tannery, Nashua, N.H.
North Railroad Avenue, Espanola, N.M.
McCormick & Baxter Creosoting Company, Portland, Ore.
Hart Creosoting Company, Jasper, Tex.
Jasper Creosoting Company, Jasper.
There are 1,233 sites in the $3 billion annual Superfund program, which Congress began in 1980. The Bush administration added eight to the list this year, the fewest in a decade.
The Superfund law says polluters should pay to clean up environmental messes they made, and the environmental agency tries to get commitments from companies directly responsible for creating some of the nation's most hazardous waste sites.
Those commitments pay for about 70 percent of the Superfund sites each year. The other 30 percent are financed by money from a fast-diminishing trust fund and increasingly by general tax revenues appropriated by Congress.
Julie Wolk, an environmental health advocate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the number of new cleanups beginning this year was "pathetically low."

QUARTERLY EARNINGS RISE FOR COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest soft-drink bottler, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased 21 percent. Shares in the company, however, had their biggest decline in 18 months because higher prices and cool weather hurt sales in North America. 
The number of products sold was unchanged in the United States and Canada, which account for three-quarters of its sales, said the company, which is based in Atlanta. Analysts had forecast a gain of about 2 percent. Coca-Cola Enterprises lowered its forecast for sales volume growth to 1 percent this year from 3 percent in January. Some consumers have switched to cheaper PepsiCo soft drinks after Coca-Cola Enterprises raised prices by 2.5 percent amid a weak economy and wet, cool weather that has hurt demand in the Northeast. Net income rose to $260 million, or 56 cents a share, after the payment of preferred dividends, from $215 million, or 47 cents, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 9 percent, to $4.6 billion. Shares fell $1.60, to $18.

Attendance Continues Its Slow Slide

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
As Major League Baseball returns today from its All-Star Game break, most teams have shown a modest decline in attendance so far this season and there is concern that total ticket sales for the season might fall for the third consecutive year.
 But it could be worse. Rich Levin, a spokesman for the commissioner's office, said attendance had improved since early in the season. Attendance was down 8 percent, compared to last year, early in the schedule, but just past the midseason point, attendance was off by only 2.5 percent. That is less than the 6 percent decline in attendance from 2001 to 2002. 
 Commissioner Bud Selig said in Chicago this week that there were many reasons for the early-season slump. "You had horrendous weather," Selig said. "We had the war in Iraq that started for the first two or three weeks of the season. You've got the economy that's soft."
Although there are many ways to gauge the popularity of a professional sports business, attendance in baseball is a significant indicator because there are so many teams, so many games and so many seats available for walk-up sales.
After the strike of 1994-95, attendance plunged from an average of 31,612 per game in 1994, a record, to 25,260 per game in 1995, according to data provided by Major League Baseball. The average gradually increased in the late 1990's, reaching 30,099 in 2000. Attendance slipped a little in 2001 to an average of 30,012. Last season, it was 28,135. According to Levin, this year's average crowd is about 27,300.
The biggest gain this season is in Anaheim, where the Angels' attendance is up 43 percent after the team won the World Series last fall. The average crowd after 49 home games in Anaheim is 36,665, compared with 25,687 last season. The biggest decline has occurred in Cleveland, where the Indians have drawn an average of 21,614 people this season, a 35 percent decline from the average of 32,502 in 2002.
"We're hugely low," said Bob DiBiasio, a spokesman for the Indians. "We took a hit in our season-ticket base after our first losing season at Jacobs Field."
Some teams that are experiencing an increase in attendance are disappointed that they are not drawing even more fans. The Minnesota Twins, who reached the American League Championship Series last season, have drawn an average of 21,943 people, a 3 percent increase over last season's average of 21,360. David St. Peter, the Twins' president, said the team had hoped to raise its season-ticket base to 10,000 from 6,000 this season, but only 8,000 have been sold.
"That's a pretty good jump," St. Peter said, "but I was disappointed." In the current economy, he said, businesses may be finding ways other than corporate season seats to entertain clients and reward employees. In addition, he said, the stadium may be a factor. "We have convinced a whole generation of people that the Metrodome isn't a good place to watch baseball," St. Peter said.
Other teams have factors specific to their areas. In Toronto, the Blue Jays' attendance is up 19 percent, to 23,146 from 19,395, for a team that has improved significantly. Jim Bloom, director of consumer marketing for the Blue Jays, said the boost might have been higher had it not been for the negative effect of the SARS health crisis, which has discouraged tourism in Toronto.
"Last year, 20 percent of our tickets were sold to people outside of Canada," Bloom said. "This year, it's roughly 5 percent."
The Skydome, where the Jays play, provides a stunning example of how the attendance trajectory can change when the novelty of a winning team in a new stadium wears off. In 1993, the Jays won the World Series and drew an average of 50,098 per game. That average gradually decreased to 20,221 in 2002. Attendance has also declined in relatively new ballparks at Arizona, Colorado, Baltimore, Detroit, Milwaukee, Houston, Atlanta, Texas and Pittsburgh. Even Seattle has dipped 10 percent, to 38,754 from an average of 43,146.
Tim Hevly, a spokesman for the Mariners, said the comparison was "a little apples-to-oranges" because last season's attendance was a record. "People say, 'Gee, your attendance is down,"' Hevly said. "We're tracking to draw three million. We're pretty thrilled."
Crowds are up by 15 percent in Philadelphia, where the Phillies are winning and a new stadium is under construction. Larry Shenk, a spokesman for the Phillies, said the team had sold at least 3,000 more season tickets this season than last.
The Yankees, coming off seven consecutive sellouts and leading the majors at the gate, are nevertheless down in attendance by 3 percent, averaging 41,468, compared with 42,680 last season. Attendance for the Mets has diminished from 36,425 in 2002 to 30,220 this season.
Even so, when put into historical perspective, baseball's crowds are still relatively large. According to statistics provided by Major League Baseball, the average attendance was 3,291 in 1901, 14,105 in 1950, 16,109 in 1960, 15,150 in 1970, 21,443 in 1980 and 26,575 in 1990.
"You hear this negativism," Selig said. "Ten or 15 years ago, if you had these numbers, they would have been stunning."

HEADLINE: A Policy For the Neighbors 

BYLINE:  By Michael Shifter; Michael Shifter is a vice president at the Inter-American Dialogue, a center for policy analysis.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Relations between Latin America and the United States are increasingly marked by irritation and distrust. Yet this tension has passed almost unnoticed by the United States press and unaddressed by the United States government. Such indifference has grave consequences not only for diplomacy but also for human rights.
 A month ago at the annual meeting of the Organization of American States in Santiago, Chile, the United States candidate to serve on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was rejected. For the first time since it was created in 1959, the seven-member commission will be without a representative from the United States when it convenes in early 2004. 
 United States officials should not have been surprised by the rejection. The nominee, Rafael Martinez, is a Cuban-American lawyer from Orlando, Fla., known for his practice in health law. He lacks the credentials to serve on the most important and respected body dealing with human rights in the hemisphere.
The nomination was a departure from the United States' practice, and the standard now adhered to by most Latin American governments, to select distinguished jurists or human rights figures to serve on the commission. Mr. Martinez -- the brother of Mel Martinez, secretary of housing and urban development -- was also seen as a patronage appointee, a charge often leveled against political systems in Latin America.
Yet Mr. Martinez's questionable qualifications are only part of this story. Even a highly qualified United States nominee might have failed in the secret vote.
United States policy toward Latin America has long been characterized by neglect and some measure of insensitivity. Still, many Latin American officials at the meeting were upset, even surprised, by how indifferent Washington has become to Latin American affairs: its reluctance to intervene in the Argentine economic collapse of 2001, for example, or its initial failure to condemn the aborted coup in Venezuela in 2002.
The bold projection of United States power in Iraq didn't build a lot of goodwill, either. Furthermore, the United States persisted in pursuing a selective agenda at the meeting: the need for change in Cuba. In his speech Secretary of State Colin Powell appealed to other nations to "hasten the inevitable democratic transition in Cuba." To many at the meeting, that sounded like a call for "regime change" -- in this hemisphere.
Yet it was more than Washington's use of military power or focus on Cuba that irritated the Latin Americans. The United States has also failed to show appropriate interest in issues of concern to many Latin American nations, like poverty and social tensions.
In relations between the United States and Latin America, style can be nearly as important as substance. The United States has tended to be heavy-handed and patronizing toward Latin America. Provided an opportunity to tweak the United States -- by rejecting Mr. Martinez -- member states of the O.A.S. took it.
Of course, the commission is not above politics. But it is also one of the region's essential institutions. In the 1970's and early 1980's, when Latin America was pockmarked by regimes that routinely tortured and murdered opponents, the commission was indispensable in protecting human rights. Its work remains vital. After high hopes for progress in the 1990's, democracy in Latin America is now increasingly at risk, with growing volatility in Venezuela, continuing armed conflict in Colombia and political instability and institutional decay in Guatemala, Bolivia and Ecuador. 
It is hard to blame the O.A.S. for rejecting the United States' nominee to the commission. But the rebuke is not something to celebrate. The United States is important to the commission's operations, providing it with financial support as well as legitimacy. Without a member on the commission, the United States may be tempted to step away from human rights work in Latin America and become less engaged -- and particularly less responsive to the growing number of cases concerning the United States.
This temptation should be resisted, for it is self-defeating. To its credit, the United States will continue to help finance the commission. But the United States can no longer take it for granted that Latin American nations will support whatever candidate or policy it puts forward. That lesson has yet to be learned.

HEADLINE: Global AIDS Fund Finding Few Answers to Its Cash Shortage 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 16 

 BODY:
Representatives of countries contributing to a fund to support the global struggle against AIDS and other diseases that are ravaging the developing world met in Paris today but made little progress toward easing a cash crisis expected later this year.
 The United States secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, the chairman of the fund's board, said that approval of projects costing $1.6 billion were pending at the Geneva-based Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Roughly 40 percent of them, costing $750 million, would likely be approved when the fund's directors meet in October, he said, yet only $400 million has been pledged. 
 Addressing a one-day conference, which accompanied the International AIDS Society Conference in Paris this week, Mr. Thompson said the fund needed $3 billion by the end of 2004. "I hope we can negotiate this into real money by October," he said. 
At the same time, governments were upstaged by private donors, after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it would pay $100 million into the fund immediately. The foundation originally pledged $50 million as a first installment and a further $50 million over the next 10 years, making it a larger donor than Britain or Germany, which pledged between $40 million and $48 million.
Dr. Helene D. Gayle, the foundation's AIDS program director, said the decision to accelerate payment was to generate confidence in the fund and to stimulate public contributions, not replace it. Public money, she said, "will be more likely as confidence in the fund grows."
The idea for the fund was born at an Okinawa meeting three years ago of the industrialized nations in the Group of 8. Disbursements of about $3 billion began at the end of last year, about 60 percent for the fight against AIDS, because AIDS medications are more costly than those for tuberculosis or malaria.
Earlier this year, President Bush asked Congress to authorize up to $1 billion a year for five years to the fund, provided the amount not exceed one-third of the total contribution by its allies in the European Union and among the wealthy Group of 8 nations, notably Canada, Japan and Russia.
But now appropriations are bogged down both in Washington and at the European Union. European leaders discussed the issue at a summit meeting in Salonika, Greece, in June but failed to reach agreement on matching Mr. Bush's proposal. 
Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, said he was sure Europe would raise $1 billion. "Sometimes we are like the tortoise in the fable, advancing one step at a time," Mr. Prodi said. "But like the tortoise we get there in the end."
Representatives of nongovernmental organizations that promote access to affordable medicines in developing countries organized protest demonstrations and assailed the group for failing to produce concrete commitments. 
Mr. Thompson said he would travel to Africa in December at the head of a group of American corporate leaders to drum up private sector support for the fund. That approach was criticized by some nongovernmental organizations as an effort by the Bush administration to shift the burden from the public to the private sector.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the former diplomat and president of the Global Business Coalition on H.I.V./AIDS, who will accompany Mr. Thompson on the trip, denied this. "Businesses are not likely to be major sources of funds to the global fund," he said. "It is not realistic to expect that." He said some corporate sponsors, like hotel chains, might be induced to solicit clients for a donation to the fund on a voluntary basis.
Dr. Richard G. A. Feachem, the fund's executive director, said donor nations had pledged $4.7 billion through the end of 2007, which will help support 150 programs in 93 countries.

HEADLINE: New Budget Director Calls Deficit Manageable 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
In his first Congressional testimony since he became budget director last month, Joshua B. Bolten asserted today that the $455 billion budget deficit he projected on Tuesday was completely manageable and that President Bush's tax cuts were not the problem but "part of the solution."
 "The key to improving the budget outlook is healthy and sustained recovery with strong job creation," he told the House Budget Committee. 
 "Had Congress not enacted the president's three tax relief packages," Mr. Bolten added, "the economy would be substantially weaker than it is, and there would have been substantially greater job losses."
With statements like that, Mr. Bolten seemed to be saying that reducing taxes actually led to increased revenues for the government, a view prevalent in some conservative circles 20 years ago but basically discredited by economists since then.
But when Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked whether Mr. Bolten was saying that the tax cuts "will pay for themselves," the budget director said he was not.
Mr. Bolten went on to say, "I think the art and science of economics has not yet advanced to the stage where we can really properly capture all the positive effects the tax cuts do have on the economy."
On Tuesday, Mr. Bolten, who was deputy chief of staff in the White House before moving to the Office of Management and Budget to replace Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., announced record deficits for this fiscal year and the next and said they were the unavoidable consequence of a faltering economy and the essential response at home and abroad to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The White House projection that the budget deficit will reach $455 billion this year would seem to be just what the Democratic presidential contenders have been looking for: a vivid illustration, as two of them said today, of the failures of President Bush's economic policies.
 "It represents an economic dagger pointed at the backs of all Americans," Senator Bob Graham of Florida said as he prepared to fly to New Hampshire to offer an economic plan that he said would, among other things, erase the deficit within five years. 
 Across Washington, Democrats were quick to find parallels to the election of 1992, when Ross Perot, an independent, undercut Mr. Bush's father by attacking him on this very issue, setting the stage for Bill Clinton's victory in the fall. 
Yet even as Mr. Graham and other Democrats seized on the projection, it remained far from certain that the bad economic news would finally allow the president's prospective rivals to accomplish what has so stubbornly eluded the Democrats this campaign season: making the struggling economy a central issue in their drive to unseat Mr. Bush.
For one thing, there is little evidence that a subject as arid as the deficit would in itself send voters rushing to the polls. Rather than the deficit, several pollsters said today, voters looking to take a measure of the economy's health are more likely to look at inflation, unemployment and, to an extent, the stock market.
In fact, Mr. Perot's success at raising the issue in 1992 came as part of a larger indictment of what he portrayed as partisan disorder in Washington, as well as what he and then Mr. Clinton used to paint as a general collapse of the economy under Mr. Bush. 
In addition, the economic and political picture today is different from what it was in 1992.
Since the White House disclosed the deficit figure, Democrats have been quick to attribute the rapid turn from surplus under Mr. Clinton to deficit under Mr. Bush as a product of the president's tax cut plan.
"This is the most fiscally irresponsible president since Herbert Hoover," Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, said in an interview today. "Republicans don't balance budgets anymore. Democrats do."
But Mr. Bush's advisers, in a taste of the counterattack the White House is preparing for next year, said the president could convincingly argue that the deficit was caused by an economy that has been hobbled by the terrorist attacks of two years ago, followed by two wars. And they argued today that the president, unlike his father, is not viewed as disengaged from the economy, and thus would be able to withstand the attacks that submarined his father.
"The deficit becomes a concern for politicians when they have a leadership or an overall trust problem, so then it becomes sort of symbolic or indicative of something else," said Matthew Dowd, a senior adviser to Mr. Bush's re-election committee. "The deficit for his father was a problem not because of the deficit per se, but it had to do with leadership on the economy. The deficit became something for voters to hang their hat on, but they were already angry anyway."
That was a point that even some Democrats did not dispute.
"He's probably not facing the kind of long-term dismay and skepticism that his father had to deal with," said Gene Sperling, who was a senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton in the 1992 campaign.
Beyond the shielding that Mr. Bush seems to enjoy right now on the issue, no Democratic presidential candidate running today has displayed the skills and command of the economy that Mr. Clinton did in wielding it against Mr. Bush's father to such devastating effect in 1992. Mr. Clinton showed an ability to take arcane subjects and make them relevant -- for example, the way he linked budget deficits to the future of Social Security -- that none of these Democrats have matched.
Not that they have not tried. Mr. Graham, in unveiling his budget plan to reporters today, borrowed heavily from Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign in both style and substance. He called for rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy to finance tax cuts for the middle class. And while Mr. Clinton papered the state of New Hampshire with an economic plan called "Putting People First," Mr. Graham said he was publishing his own economic treatise, which he called: "Opportunity for All: A plan for America's Economic Survival."
And Mr. Bush's advisers argued that with so many of the presidential candidates being members of Congress, the White House would be able to slap back by pointing to what is the other side of the ledger: spending programs they supported. That, of course, was an avenue of attack that Republicans could not use against Mr. Clinton, who was an Arkansas governor, in 1992. It would also presumably not work on Dr. Dean, who took pains in an interview today to portray himself as "among the most fiscally conservative governors in the country."
What is more, the White House has shown no reluctance to turn any criticism of the budget deficit into an opportunity to portray Democrats as big taxers. In an example of that today, Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, responded to challenges from Democrats about the deficit by waving a piece of paper that he said was a sign-up sheet to sponsor a repeal of the Bush tax cuts. He asked if any of the members of the Budget Committee wished to sign it; none did.
Mark Penn, who was Mr. Clinton's pollster in 1996 and is this year advising Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said that for all that, the big headlines about deficits signaled trouble for Republicans and provided an opportunity for Democrats.
"This just opens up a whole new debate,' he said. "They have both houses of Congress and the presidency. I think their dog-ate-the-homework excuses have run out."
But Mr. Sperling, recalling his campaign of 1992, said it would not be as easy for Democrats this time.
"People are coming off what was a very positive economic decade," he said. "They are a little stronger and a little more optimistic and better prepared to weather a storm."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about the potential of the deficit to become a campaign issue for Democrats misidentified the participant in a House Budget Committee hearing who challenged members to sign a document in favor of repealing the tax cuts passed under President Bush. He was Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and the committee's chairman, not Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stand Is Headache for Ally in Colombia 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's determination to win blanket immunity for Americans from the International Criminal Court is causing political problems for President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, one of Washington's closest allies in Latin America and a rare voice of support for American military action in Iraq.
 The administration is currently withholding $5 million in military aid to Colombia and threatening to suspend $130 million more next year unless that country agrees to exempt all Americans there from being sent abroad for prosecution by the newly created court. 
 The administration has criticized the court, which is based in The Hague and which it fears may become a forum for politically motivated charges against American officials or members of the military.
Colombia says such an agreement is unnecessary because an existing accord already denies Colombia legal jurisdiction over Americans working there in official capacities. That accord was signed in 1962 and extended in 2000. 
The standoff has created an uncomfortable situation for President Uribe, who has aggressively advanced Washington's antidrug agenda in Colombia and has withstood severe criticism at home for his support for ousting Saddam Hussein. 
Although Mr. Uribe remains popular, he is under sharp pressure from political leaders of the left, who accuse him of currying the favor of the United States only to be snubbed.
Some analysts have begun to speak of him in terms of the Fox effect, a reference to the fallen star of Mexican president, Vicente Fox, who received President Bush's earliest embrace then faded from Washington's agenda as terrorism issues took over. 
Mr. Uribe has presided over a growing economy, widespread eradication of drug crops, diminishing violence and a recent deal to begin peace negotiations with a 10,000-member rightist paramilitary group.
Michael Shifter, a Colombia expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington, said administration officials' insistence on the immunity issue was jeopardizing relations with a nation that received more than $2 billion in United States aid over the last three years, becoming the third-largest recipient in the world.
"Once again Colombia has fallen victim to the single issue," Mr. Shifter said, asserting that Washington's typical obsession was drugs. "They're playing chicken on this issue."
Administration officials deny that. While some American diplomats have privately voiced remorse over the issue, others are insistent that Colombia must approve an agreement under the treaty that established the court will shield all Americans -- including those who are not representatives of the government -- from being extradited to The Hague.
Some in Congress applauded the administration's position.
Representative Cass Ballenger, who heads the House Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said 34 nations had signed such exemptions for the United States, and Colombia should not seek special treatment.
"I think it's strange they would expect us to issue a waiver when 34 nations have signed it," said Mr. Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, today denied that the American position was undercutting Mr. Uribe or the American-backed strategy known as Plan Colombia.
"You have to remember that the United States has been a very strong supporter of President Uribe and of Plan Colombia and the steps that he has taken to actually reduce coca production in the last year," he said. "The overwhelming portions of our assistance to Plan Colombia and to President Uribe's program is in the form of counternarcotics aid."
Mr. Boucher said talks with Colombian officials were continuing and the cutoff of the $130 million would not take place until Oct. 1.
Luis Alberto Moreno, Colombia's ambassador to Washington, said that his government was studying its legal options but that said officials had tentatively concluded that any new exemption would require action from a deeply skeptical Colombian Congress.
Mr. Moreno noted that under the American Service-Members Protection Act, President Bush could waive the exemption requirement, which has already been codified into law for all NATO countries, major non-NATO allies and Taiwan.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Bring Back 30-Year Bond? No Guide From Greenspan

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed inclined yesterday toward favoring the return of the 30-year bond, whose issuance was halted by the Treasury in October 2001.
 But divining what Mr. Greenspan means can be difficult because his language is carefully nuanced. 
 In fact, as he testified before Congress yesterday for a second day, the chairman sought to clarify what he said was a misinterpretation of a comment he made Tuesday about the likelihood of Fed policy makers using "special policy actions" in an effort to keep long-term interest rates in check. These measures could include the buying by the Fed of longer-term Treasuries in an effort to push the price up and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, down. 
While Mr. Greenspan said again yesterday that the use of such measures was unlikely, he insisted that he had not ruled it out. "I wasn't aware I took anything off the table at any time, but apparently that was the view that was taken at the time," he said at the start of questions and answers before the Senate Banking Committee.
Some analysts said one reason for the sharp sell-off in the bond market Tuesday, which sent the yield on the 10-year note up to 3.99 percent from 3.73 percent on Monday, was the belief that the Fed would not use such "special policy actions." That interpretation disappointed many investors who had hoped the Fed would buy longer-term Treasury securities directly, making their holdings more valuable.
Despite Mr. Greenspan's comment, some analysts said it was still very unlikely that the Fed would do such buying of Treasury securities. "I don't think he wanted to hold it out to the market as bait," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy, a research firm in Princeton, N.J.
In testimony Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan said this about resuming issuance of the 30-year bond: "There are pros and cons to bringing the 30-year back, but the serious question of whether it is desirable or not, frankly, I have not myself come to a conclusion on that."
Yesterday, he said it was "very reasonable" to have canceled the 30-year bond at the time because the government was still projecting surpluses in the future. But then he added, "Times have changed."
Mr. McCarthy, without being sure exactly what message Mr. Greenspan was sending, said, "I thought it was interesting that on both occasions when he could have chosen to say nothing, he chose not to."
Peter R. Fisher, the departing Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, who eliminated the 30-year bond in a surprise move in October 2001, is against the return of the 30-year bond. Officials remaining at the Treasury also oppose its return. One political reason for not bringing it back is that its return would be read by many to confirm that huge federal budget deficits -- which are now nearing $500 billion a year -- will be here to stay.
Treasury trading was volatile yesterday, with the yield on the 10-year note rising as high as 4.08 percent and then dropping below 4 percent as Mr. Greenspan began testifying. It rose again as he spoke and then fell in the afternoon after he concluded his testimony. In late trading, the price of the 10-year note was up 13/32, to 97 20/32. The yield fell to 3.92 percent from 3.99 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond rallied far more sharply, but it was not clear if this was because of what may be a nuanced change in Mr. Greenspan's comments about resuming the issuance of this once popular benchmark for the Treasury market. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 4.90 percent, from 4.97 percent on Tuesday, as the price rose 1 9/32, to 107 8/32.

Bloomberg Opens Up For Select Few

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
WANT to know what our mayor really thinks? Get invited to a moguls-only, off-the-record retreat out west and spend the early afternoon in a conference room in the Sun Valley Inn, listening to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg talk about the difference between being a chief of his own business and being chief of us.
 That's what Mr. Bloomberg did last Friday, at a meeting of business tycoons organized by Herbert Allen, the investment banker. The weeklong event, which attracted business and media titans like Warren E. Buffett, Bill Gates, Sumner M. Redstone and Michael D. Eisner, is an annual conference and strictly entre them. It is so shrouded in secrecy that the mayor went without an adviser and agreed to abide by the no-press rules. 
 This would be quite unusual for the average mayor of New York, for whom perpetual news media coverage is political oxygen. Unusual, too, would be consorting with business tycoons at an elegant resort, which might be considered poor public relations. Mayoral aides said it was a good opportunity to talk positively about New York to many business executives.
One suspects, though, that Mr. Bloomberg would have gone anyway. He has never had much in common with the average mayor of New York, as he proved once again in Sun Valley, Idaho, in an off-camera interview with Charlie Rose of PBS, also a conference guest.
Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Rose, master of the reveal-oneself interview, chatted for about an hour. Audience members who spoke later to David D. Kirkpatrick, a reporter with The New York Times, said that the mayor had shared both his fascination and frustration with his new profession. Yesterday, his press secretary, Edward Skyler, confirmed the subject matter of the interview after checking with the mayor.
Apparently more comfortable with sympathetic peers from his former business life than with peskily argumentative types from government and journalism, Mr. Bloomberg was said to be engaging and open, in contrast with the more private figure New Yorkers see back home. 
His reticence is clearly hurting his political standing in New York, along with the poor economy and his pursuit of higher taxes. Among friends and behind closed doors in Sun Valley, though, the mayor spoke amiably and openly, touching on subjects ranging from the difficulty of closing firehouses and dealing with labor leaders to the reluctance of his own advisers to contradict him, audience members said.
AT one point, Mr. Bloomberg spoke of how it felt to be the target of public rejection. Mr. Bloomberg has had his share of cheers, but at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade last month, he was booed block after block. He said he found it demoralizing to smile through the boos (though we can think of a few mayors who would have relished booing back).
Political humiliation has to be a new experience. New, too, has been dealing with union leaders. The mayor, who failed recently to wrest the budget concessions he wanted from the unions, said that negotiating can be difficult because union leaders, knowing they could be around longer than he will, can afford to wait for the next guy if they don't like his conditions.
This is basic to municipal labor relations. So is the politics of layoffs. It's a dirty word for union leaders, but it is also a truism that -- as Mr. Bloomberg said he had learned -- some union leaders were not very concerned about his threat of layoffs. Because former union members do not vote in union elections.
Of everything he said on Friday, perhaps the most unexpected concerned his own staff. In another contrast with the corporate life, where he contends that people speak up to promote their own careers, he said that too many of his advisers in government, who owe their jobs to him, won't contradict him. He wants to change that, he said. His current inclination might surprise some of his advisers, who have been telling friends and colleagues that he discourages dissent by rejecting advice in favor of following his own instincts.
Despite the problems and demonstrably steep learning curve, Mr. Bloomberg told the favorable Idaho crowd what he tells New Yorkers: that despite his low poll ratings, he is confident of re-election, assuming crime stays down and he can make good on his pledge to improve education. "I really think he likes the job," Mario J. Gabelli, a fund manager, said after hearing the Bloomberg-Rose interview. "We are delighted that somebody would take the time to give back. I hate to say it, but, why does he do it?"
Maybe because it's different.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE MOOD; 
In Ohio, Iraq Questions Shake Even Some of Bush's Faithful

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, July 16 

 BODY:
Jim Stock voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and says that if the election were held tomorrow, he'd vote for President Bush again. But he says he is troubled by indications that the White House used questionable intelligence about Iraqi efforts to buy uranium in Africa to push for war in Iraq. And he wants a fuller accounting.
 "I'd like to know whether there was any deliberate attempt to deceive," said Mr. Stock, 70, a retired public school administrator. "My feeling is there was not. But there was an eagerness in the administration to pursue the battle and to believe information that wasn't quite good." 
 "It's painful to say," he added, "but I don't like where this is coming down."
If there are dark political clouds for Mr. Bush in this largely socially conservative region, they are forming around voters like Mr. Stock. Though they supported the war in Iraq, they now say they are growing uncomfortable with reports that the White House might have used inaccurate intelligence to justify it. 
Many people interviewed here in the past two days said they did not question Mr. Bush's personal credibility. Still, they said, they wanted to know more about what happened and support Democratic calls for a Congressional inquiry into how suspect intelligence information got into the State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
"When you are taking lives, it should be nothing but the truth," Matt Zurkuhlen, 25, a business consultant, said outside a coffee shop in the Mount Lookout neighborhood here. "We rushed in there."
Americans are voicing increasing concerns about Iraq, national polls show. A CBS News survey conducted early last week before the political storm over unreliable intelligence intensified, showed that 56 percent of those polled believe the administration overestimated Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Less than a majority said the war would be worth its costs if such weapons were not found, down from 56 percent in May.
In conversations here with nearly three dozen voters, the vast majority said they generally like President Bush and believe he is doing a good job. Many people said they remained convinced that Iraq posed a threat, even though no chemical or biological weapons have been found. And there was a broad consensus that the result of the war -- the ousting of a brutal dictator -- was good for Iraq as well as the United States.
"Whether or not they find weapons of mass destruction is besides the point," Joyce Allen, 71, a retired bank teller, said as she ate lunch with a friend at Cincinnati's Museum Center. "The people there needed to be freed, and somebody had to do it."
What Cincinnati and its suburbs think of Mr. Bush is of vital importance to the White House because this is a swing region in a potential battleground state. The city of Cincinnati voted for Vice President Al Gore in 2000, but Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, gave 54 percent of its votes to Mr. Bush. Ohio went somewhat narrowly for Mr. Bush, 50 percent to 46 percent. 
The region's political significance was underscored in October when Mr. Bush came to Cincinnati to deliver a major speech pressing his case for attacking Iraq. In it, the president asserted that Saddam Hussein was building "an arsenal of terror," that he already possessed chemical and biological weapons, was "seeking" nuclear weapons and had "given shelter" to terrorists. 
But at the urging of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, a reference to the contentions that Iraq had sought to obtain uranium in Africa was removed from the speech. Three months later, Mr. Bush made the same declaration in his State of the Union address. 
Most people interviewed here said they did not pay much attention to either Mr. Bush's October appearance or State of the Union address. But for Bruce Kleeberger, a bank official, the two speeches wove together many loose threads and helped convince him of the need to attack Iraq.
Mr. Kleeberger, 44, said he remains convinced that the invasion was a good thing, whether or not the president was wrong about Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Eventually, he said, he believes prohibited weapons will be found in Iraq. 
"It would take many more mistakes for me to question the credibility and decision-making of the government," he said. "We'd like to think intelligence is 100 percent right 100 percent of the time. But it's a human system and there's human error."
Others said some exaggeration by the Bush administration to justify the war seemed acceptable. 
"What is the advertising term for pumping something up?" asked Gary Botkins, 55, who works for the Internal Revenue Service. "Hype. The intelligence community does it all the time. But I believe Saddam did have weapons. I just wish they had found some."
Still, not everyone was so sanguine. "Bush was leaning on the C.I.A. to come up with some dirt," said Charles Flanagan, 70, a Democrat and semi-retired truck driver. "They should have given inspectors more time."
"I think his popularity is falling," he said of Mr. Bush, "and once people find out the truth about this it's really going to drop."
Despite Democratic efforts to use the intelligence issue to undermine Mr. Bush's credibility, most people interviewed here, including Democratic voters, said they did not think Mr. Bush had knowingly used bad intelligence. Most said they believed the president had been motivated by a sincere desire to counter what he considered a real threat.
"There are always a lot of people involved in these things," said Jill Switzer, 27, a church music director who said she would almost certainly not vote for Mr. Bush in 2004. "I don't blame him."
She said she would like to see a "truth commission" investigate the dubious Iraq intelligence. "If we are a country that upholds freedom and freedom of speech, we should investigate so we can have confidence our system works."
Despite the growing casualties in Iraq, most people interviewed, including those who had doubts about the war, said Mr. Bush should keep American troops in Iraq to help stabilize the country.
"After all the death that occurred, what's the use in pulling out now?" asked Ms. Allen, the retired bank teller. "Pulling out now would mean those boys died in vain."
To the chagrin of staunch Democrats here, the Washington debate about intelligence has received scant coverage in Cincinnati. But they might feel heartened that most people questioned said they consider the economy, not foreign policy, to be the most important issue on their 2004 campaign list. And most said they consider it less than healthy.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Fallon Is Chosen For Subway Account

BYLINE:  By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
Subway Restaurants in Milford, Conn., named Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis yesterday to handle creative and strategic planning duties on its account. Those duties have been handled for three years by Euro RSCG MVBMS in New York. 
Although billings were not disclosed, Subway spent $218.6 million to advertise in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
 The decision came after a two-month review that had been narrowed to Fallon, part of the Publicis Groupe, and three other finalists: Deutsch in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group; and the New York and Portland, Ore., offices of Wieden & Kennedy. 
 Euro RSCG MVBMS withdrew from the review last month; the agency is the advertising unit of Euro RSCG MVBMS Partners, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas. Joanne Davis Consulting in New York helped manage the review, which was overseen by the Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust.
The first commercials created by Fallon are scheduled to appear this fall.

HEADLINE: Samsung Profit Falls on Lower Chip Prices 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 16 

 BODY:
The Samsung Electronics Company reported today that second-quarter profit had declined 41 percent from the period a year earlier. But the company also forecast improvement in the second half of the year, citing a recovering world economy.
 Attributing most of the profit drop to the falling price of semiconductors, Samsung reported a net profit of 1.13 trillion won ($955 million) in the quarter compared with a record 1.92 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in the quarter a year earlier. Samsung's operating profit on semiconductors was 570 billion won, down from 1.7 trillion won in the second quarter a year earlier. 
 Sales in the quarter dropped slightly, to 9.8 trillion won ($8.3 billion), compared with 9.9 trillion won in the second quarter of 2002. Semiconductors made up 38 percent of the company's sales in the quarter.
Samsung also said today that it expected profits on semiconductors to rise in the second half of the year as the price increased for the 256-megabit chip, which is considered a bellwether for the industry. The price was more than $2 a chip in the second quarter, but has now risen above $4.
Continuing to stake its future in semiconductors, Samsung announced this week that it would begin making the world's first one-gigabit memory chip. Its confidence in memory chips may come from its position as the only major manufacturer that has made money producing them. 
Micron Technology, which is based in Boise, Idaho, ranks a distant second to Samsung in memory chip production and has lost money in every quarter since the beginning of 2001. Germany's Infineon Technologies A.G., the fourth-largest memory chip manufacturer, has lost money for the last two years. Hynix Semiconductor, the No. 3 chip maker and Samsung's lone Korean rival, has more than $6 billion in debt and has survived on cash transfusions from Korean banks.
Samsung also had lower profits on its telephone handsets. Its operating profit on handset sales was 550 billion won compared with 610 billion won in the second quarter a year earlier as sales fell to 12 million units from 13.2 million in the first quarter. Nonetheless, the company predicted sales for 2003 of 52 million handsets, sticking to its forecast at the start of the year.
Despite the drop in profits, Samsung promised to continue investing in plants to make semiconductors as well as other products, anticipating 6.78 trillion won ($5.7 billion) in investment by the end of the year.
The vice president for investor relations, Cha Young Soo, said he was confident that profits would improve in the second half of the year. "Once the economy does recover," he said, "we believe that Samsung is in a clear position to benefit from future upswings."
Investors clearly thought that the outlook was brighter and sent Samsung's shares to 16-month highs. Shares rose 2.5 percent to close at 418,000 won. Samsung, whose shares make up about 20 percent of the equity traded on the Korea Stock Exchange, has been the single biggest factor propelling the exchange's index above the 700 level this month after it dipped into the 500's earlier this year.
A company spokesman, James Chang, said the drop in the quarterly profits was a result of several recent developments. "Business circumstances this year compared with last year are totally different," he said.
Mr. Chang said that the profit decline in Samsung's semiconductors reflected the slump in the information technology industry, especially in PC's and flat-panel display screens, a category in which Samsung leads. 
He also said the SARS outbreak in China had hurt sales of Samsung products in Asia. The disease apparently never reached Korea.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES; 
Tiny Treasures Leave Big Void In Looted Iraq

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Charle 

 BODY:
While there is still confusion about just how many objects were stolen from the Iraq Museum in Baghdad during the recent war, there is no doubt that one of its major collections is gone. In London last week, at an annual meeting of experts in archaeology, history and ancient languages of Mesopotamia, the museum's director, Dr. Nawala al-Mutawalli, said that 4,795 cylinder seals were missing. Col. Matthew Bogdanos of the Marines, leader of the American team investigating losses of antiquities in Iraq, confirmed the theft.
 "It is a major loss," said McGuire Gibson, professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, who worked at Iraqi sites from 1964 to 1990. "This is, or was, one of the world's really superb collections." 
 The seals are small, typically one and a half to four inches tall and usually less than two inches in diameter. Figures and inscriptions are carved or cut, so that when the cylinders are rolled on clay, miniature scenes scroll out: ceremonies at temples, feasts at palaces, battles between gods and beasts. Impressions were made on clay used to seal goods and official documents, even to secure rooms. Seals were worn and passed from one generation to the next. 
They are typically made of stone -- lapis lazuli, agate, hematite, white marble, rock crystal -- and date from the fifth millennium B.C. to the second century A.D. Revered by scholars for what they tell about life in Mesopotamia, the seals are also prized by collectors for their beauty and for the special skill required to make them. One seal sold at Christie's in New York in 2001 for $424,000.
An even greater loss, experts say, is cylinder seals and other antiquities being looted from Iraq's archaeological sites. "Every day thousands of the objects are being stolen," said Mr. Gibson, who was in Iraq in May working for Unesco as part of a team of specialists to assess the damage in Baghdad and for National Geographic as part of a team sent to examine damage to sites across Iraq. At five sites he visited, hundreds of people were digging, filling trucks.
"Looting has become an industry," Mr. Gibson said. "We'll never know exactly where the seals are from, and because they're not cataloged, forgeries are possible."
Before the 1991 Persian Gulf war there was little illegal digging in Iraq, Mr. Gibson said; the antiquities department had more than 1,000 employees, including guards, stationed at sites, and Iraqi law banned export of antiquities. Seals rarely appeared on the market. After the United Nations imposed an economic embargo against Iraq in 1990, the nation's economy collapsed, and the museum's employees were drastically cut. Regional museums alone lost a total of 2,000 to 4,000 objects. Concurrently, Mr. Gibson said, interest in cylinder seals jumped with the sale of the Erlenmeyer collection, assembled by a distinguished scholar, from the 1940's until his death in 1967.
John M. Russell, chairman of the critical studies department at Massachusetts College of Art, said thousands of seals have been bought since then, adding that he thought most had fake provenances.
Mr. Russell and Mr. Gibson said they expected the truly remarkable pieces to be withheld from the market until the authorities and the public lost interest. "It's just too hot now," Mr. Russell said. But they have little doubt that eventually many will end up for sale. 
Mr. Gibson said: "They are most desired; many are exquisitely beautiful. They're like jewelry, and they're treated like jewelry." 
Cylinder seals are ranked No. 3 on the International Council of Museums' Emergency Red List of Iraqi Antiquities at Risk, compiled in the spring. "In terms of real demand, they're most endangered," said Mr. Russell, who helped compile the list. 
One recent day, during a casual look on eBay, Mr. Russell found one seal that he said was counterfeit, and two others that could easily have been looted from Iraq. Only one dealer responded to a request for provenance, saying that as usual there was none.
"There's a huge black market, and pieces come up everywhere, from the top auction houses to eBay," Mr. Russell said. In times like these, he said, the only sure way to know that a cylinder seal has not been looted or stolen is to have the sales history, with a description of the seal and a picture in a catalog dated before 1990. An ethical collector would put that cutoff at 1970, the year a Unesco convention declaring all objects that entered the antiquities market since then to be stolen property.
There is some hope of recovering the museum seals. "Luckily, many of the seals that were stolen from the Iraq Museum came from excavations, and there are photos and even casts of them," Mr. Gibson said. "We are on the lookout for things, and occasionally something gets spotted, but under current legislation, there is such a long, arduous road to get any of them back that customs and other authorities can do little."
In June British authorities made it illegal to import, export, sell, own or handle cultural heritage property taken from Iraq since August 1990. Most important, the burden of proof of legal provenance is on the holder of the property.
In the United States, a leading market for antiquities, the government must prove that seals came from Iraq before they can be seized, a huge challenge. Legal experts and the Archaeological Institute of America say the adoption of the Iraq Cultural Heritage Protection Act, pending before the House, would extend indefinitely the temporary import restrictions on undocumented archaeological and cultural materials illegally removed from Iraq since August 1990. (The institute rejects the Senate version, which limits restrictions to a year.)
It is a bittersweet time for scholars at the University of Chicago: while they are helping their Iraqi colleagues, they are also anticipating the reopening on Oct. 18 of the Oriental Institute Museum's Mesopotamia gallery there, closed since 1997.
The institute's collection of more than 1,000 cylinder seals is based primarily on finds from university-sponsored excavations in Iraq. From the 1920's to 1969 about half the seals discovered in the digs went to the university; the rest went to the Iraq Museum, and now they are gone.
A main exhibition in the 5,400-square-foot hall will be 183 cylinder seals. "It might be the only installation that examines how the seals were used, how they were made and how they were worn," said Karen L. Wilson, the museum's director.
One star is the Bilalama seal, made of dark blue lapis lazuli from Afghanistan and topped with a gold cap. In a monograph, Clemens Reichel, a research associate at the Oriental Institute, notes that according to the cuneiform legend, the seal originally belonged to a ruler of Eshnunna, a powerful city-state in Mesopotamia, circa 2010 B.C. The seal was stolen from an excavation in 1931 but was soon recovered from an antiquities dealer in Baghdad. Its context and proof of authenticity could have been lost forever; luckily, the excavation yielded three clay lumps with impressions of the Bilalama seal. 
There are only four examples of both a seal and its original ancient impression. (Most seals are displayed with a new impression, the better to show the scene.) Only the Oriental Institute owns both a seal and its ancient impression.
"We were lucky with the Bilalama seal," Mr. Reichel said. "But think of all the precious stories we're losing every day."
