Tokyo Official Takes a New Tack to Bring Banks Into Line

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
With new statistics showing that Japan's short-lived recovery is stalling, the nation's economy minister introduced measures today to force banks to confront their long-running problems with bad loans.
 Borrowing an accounting method from the United States, the minister, Heizo Takenaka, said he would make banks announce results for their fiscal year, which ends in March, using a method called discounted cash-flow analysis, which requires banks to size up each borrower's ability to repay, instead of using the traditional method here, which relies on historical bankruptcy rates for the borrower's industry. The change will most likely force the banks to increase their reserves to cover loan losses. 
 In addition, banks will be subjected to another round of inspections for bad loans. The last round of inspections by the Financial Services Agency found that banks had underestimated their bad loans by 36 percent, Mr. Takenaka reported earlier this month. 
And taking an unorthodox step toward cleaning up bank books, the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, started a new program today of buying bad loans from commercial banks.
In his plan, Mr. Takenaka postponed action on two issues: the nationalization of banks and the practice of counting tax credits as capital. By the end of May, a committee is to report on the legalities of nationalizing banks here. The tax credit issue was seen as too controversial because tax credits at some banks here account for as much as half of their capital. Critics say this is an accounting sleight of hand because shaky banks have no hope of ever paying significant amounts of taxes.
The plan, which had been largely reported during the week, has provoked dueling essays by analysts.
"The impact will largely depend on how it is implemented," wrote Richard Jerram, chief economist for ING Barings Japan. "We doubt the plan implies serious problems for the banks."
A different view was taken by James Fiorillo, senior banking analyst for Commerz Securities Japan, who wrote: "The Takenaka financial plan represents major change. Mr. Takenaka is threatening no less than doing away with the old way of doing business in Japan."
Offering evidence that the plan has teeth and threatens the politically influential banking interests, senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have urged Mr. Takenaka to resign. On Thursday, Akihiko Kumashiro, head of the party's financial reconstruction committee, said to the applause of his faction members, "Mr. Takenaka must at least be replaced within December."
Today, Standard & Poor's took note of the Takenaka plan's "more stringent self-evaluation standards" for banks and warned that "nonperforming assets are likely to increase substantially" through March.
Tonight, Mr. Takenaka repeated an earlier pledge to bring the bad- loan problem under control by 2005, telling reporters, "At this point, we don't expect banks' health to deteriorate."
In contrast, Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading conservative newspaper, criticized the accounting rule change in an editorial earlier this week: "If this U.S.-style system is adopted, major banks will be forced to drastically increase their loan-loss reserves."
With the bad bank loans officially totaling $430 billion, Japan's shaky financial system is a significant contributor to the nation's long-running economic stagnation.
Figures released today point to the passing of an export-led boomlet that helped the economy, the world's second largest, to expand last spring and summer.
Compared with figures in the month a year earlier, Japan's industrial production fell 0.3 percent in October, disposable household income fell by 1.4 percent and consumer prices in Tokyo fell by 0.7 percent.
At the same time, unemployment returned to 5.5 percent, the highest level since the end of World War II. While service and part-time jobs increased, the number of full-time manufacturing workers in Japan was down 580,000 in October from a year ago.
The government also said today that nearly two million unemployed workers were not reflected in the national unemployment rate because they had stopped looking for work. If these discouraged workers were also counted, Japan's unemployment rate would be about 8.5 percent. 
By comparison, the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent in South Korea, 3.1 percent in Britain, 5.7 percent in the United States, 7.6 percent in Canada and 9.9 percent in Germany.
For the short term, public or private finances give little reason for optimism in Japan.
Looking to the second half of Japan's fiscal year, a Bloomberg News survey of Japan's 1,911 public companies found that companies have lowered their annual income forecasts by an average of 11 percent.
At the same time, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi recently abandoned a pledge to cap the issuing of government bonds. With bond sales rising and tax collections falling, only about half of this year's national budget is to be covered by tax revenue. After years of printing bonds to maintain public spending, Japan's public-sector debt, at 140 percent of gross domestic product, is now the highest in the industrial world.

PERSON: Jack Bigel 

HEADLINE: Jack Bigel, Labor Adviser And Negotiator, Dies at 89 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Jack Bigel, a top financial and bargaining adviser to many of New York City's most powerful labor unions for decades and a key player in resolving the city's financial crisis in the mid 1970's, died on Thursday in New York. He was 89.
 The key to Mr. Bigel's influence with the unions was the consulting firm he set up in the late 1950's. It was first called Professional Plan Associates. In 1966 it changed its name to Program Planners Inc. 
 With a staff of about 60 statisticians and economists, Program Planners, which Mr. Bigel owned, analyzed great amounts of data from New York and other cities to formulate negotiating strategies for each union on issues like pay and benefits.
In addition to advising the unions on what they should press for in bargaining with the city government, Mr. Bigel negotiated personally with city officials on behalf of many of his clients, drawing on his expertise in fields including labor law and municipal finances.
When New York City was threatened in 1976 with defaulting on its debts and perhaps with outright bankruptcy, Mr. Bigel used his knowledge, contacts and negotiating skills to persuade union leaders to commit billions of dollars from their pension funds to buy city bonds and help keep the city solvent.
The assets of the city's municipal union pension funds were $8 billion in 1976, and 22 percent, or $1.8 billion, was invested in city paper, Mr. Bigel noted in 1999. Two years later, the investments of the union pension funds in all city bonds reached almost $3.4 billion.
Mr. Bigel credited the trustees of the union plans with allowing the city to climb out of its financial abyss.
Jacob Bernard Bigel was born in Brooklyn on April 22, 1913. He was known as Jack. He went to Boys High School and worked his way through City College, graduating in 1934.
After going to work for New York City's Emergency Relief Bureau, Mr. Bigel first attained prominence as a labor leader when he organized the city's first strong union, the United Public Workers, with bases in the Sanitation Department, the city hospitals and the Welfare Department.
But the union ran into trouble in 1950, when it was expelled from the umbrella Congress of Industrial Organizations under the shadow of allegations that it was under Communist influence.
Mr. Bigel always denied that he had ever been a Communist.
In a 1976 interview with The New York Times, Mr Bigel said: "I am not an anti-Marxist. I am not a Marxist. If I am anything, I would say I'm a pragmatist -- as long as I've got to be an 'ist."
Mr. Bigel then formed an alliance with John J. DeLury, head of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, and helped the union win increases in pay and benefits for its members during the 1960's.
Over the years Mr. Bigel and Program Planners acted as consultants and negotiators for just about every important labor organization in New York City, earning millions of dollars in consultants fees. At the same time, Mr. Bigel was the confidante of successive mayors and New York governors.
He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Jonathan, of Woodstock, N.Y.; a daughter, Elizabeth Meyers of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Robert W. Straub, 82, Governor Of Oregon Who Cut Joblessness 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ore., Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Robert W. Straub, who was governor of Oregon from 1975 to 1979, died on Wednesday at a long-term care center. He was 82.
 Governor Straub had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for three years, his son Michael said on Thursday. 
 Mr. Straub, a Democrat, was elected governor in 1974. He is credited with reducing Oregon's unemployment rate and hiring more women and minority and disabled people for top government positions than any previous governor of the state. 
He also rechanneled freeway money into mass transit, jump-starting Portland's light-rail system.
Mr. Straub was born in San Francisco in 1920. He served in the Army during World War II and received undergraduate and graduate degrees in business from Dartmouth College in the 1940's.
He began his political career in Oregon as a member of the Lane County Board of Commissioners in 1954. From 1959 to 1963, he was a state senator.
Mr. Straub was elected state treasurer in 1964 and served two terms. In that post, he invested public retirement money in the stock market, a move that reaped billions of dollars in revenue and allowed hundreds of public employees to retire in considerable comfort.
He also became known for his support for the environment, backing conservation efforts and worrying about increases in air and water pollution. He supported a bill that defined Oregon beaches as public domain.
Mr. Straub retired from public service after an unsuccessful bid for a second term as governor.
"The death of Governor Straub is a great loss to the state," Gov. John A. Kitzhaber said. "He leaves behind a strong environmental record that will live on as his legacy."
Mr. Straub is survived by his wife, Pat; his five children, Jefferson, Michael, Jane Stanley, Patricia Thomas and Margaret Thomas; 15 grandchildren and 16 grandchildren.

How Immigrants Are Transforming the Politics of Europe

BYLINE:  By DAVID C. UNGER 

 BODY:
The Netherlands has long been known as a country of liberal, permissive views and dull coalition governments. All that seemed to change last spring with the sudden rise of Pim Fortuyn. Mr. Fortuyn, a gay former sociology professor and onetime Marxist, had transformed himself into a political pop star by taunting Muslim immigrants, accusing them of being a threat to law and order, Dutch national identity and the rights of women and gay people. 
 Mr. Fortuyn's acerbic rhetoric and flamboyant persona brought him improbably close to being elected prime minister. But he was murdered before that could happen, the Netherlands' biggest political assassination since that of Prince William the Silent in the 16th century. 
 Amsterdam was my first stop on a trip to several European countries where hostility to immigration, and in particular Muslim immigration, is redrawing the political map. Serious social tensions have developed that establishment political parties can no longer afford to ignore. Mr. Fortuyn was perhaps a singular figure, but the anxieties he mobilized are widespread. How to control and manage immigration is now Europe's most volatile issue, reconfiguring political loyalties from Oslo to Seville.
Americans have long lived, though not always comfortably, with large-scale immigration. In Europe, it dates only to the past few decades, the same period in which European societies have had to adjust to the loss of colonial empires and the gradual surrender of sovereignty to the European Union. In many countries, national identity has become an increasingly raw subject. 
Europe's new immigrants came in overlapping waves. Former colonial subjects from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean were joined by "guest workers" from countries like Turkey and Morocco. More recently war in the Balkans, Kurdish areas of Turkey and Afghanistan brought asylum seekers, while economic migrants flowed in from Eastern Europe and thousands of desperately poor people arrived from rural areas of North and sub-Saharan Africa.
While some immigrant populations have grown increasingly European in their outlook, others have perpetuated their isolation by importing brides and grooms from their rural villages back home. The mostly Muslim children and grandchildren of the postwar guest workers have experienced the most serious problems, with many trapped in poor housing, poor schools and chronic unemployment. High arrest rates for crimes like mugging and vandalism have made "law and order" code words for getting tough on immigrants. The discovery of "sleeper cells" of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups nestled in European cities like Hamburg has compounded the fears of non-Muslim neighbors.
With immigrants now close to 10 percent of the population in several European countries, it is slowly becoming necessary to redefine the meaning of being Swedish, Dutch or German. As Americans have learned, if done right this will not dilute but enrich the national identity. Governments need to develop more constructive policies than broad-brush crackdowns on asylum seekers. In any case, sealing borders will not solve the problems of existing immigrants and their European-born children and grandchildren. 
Some noteworthy efforts have already begun. France's Gaullist government is trying to work with Muslim and other immigrant community leaders. One potential interlocutor is Soheib Bencheikh, the grand mufti of Marseille, with whom I spent a fascinating couple of hours. Mr. Bencheikh notes that the experience of living as a minority is a new and potentially healthy one for Muslims from North Africa and the Middle East that could become a bridge to new ideas about tolerance and coexistence. He is also determined to prevent the quarrels of the Middle East from spilling into France, now home to some 600,000 Jews and around four million Muslims. 
Mr. Bencheikh believes that Marseille, with substantial Arab and Jewish communities, can offer a positive example of these two peoples living together peacefully, as they did in North Africa for centuries. He defined his goal as "active cohabitation, not just a juxtaposition of closed communities." 
That dream is a long way from present reality. The poorer suburbs of many French cities are now studded with tiny mosques where radical clerics preach intolerance and hatred of the West to young Algerians and Moroccans who feel no hope of gaining acceptance in France. 
In the Netherlands, the Fortuyn phenomenon has brought attention to more serious arguments about problems of multiculturalism and immigrant adjustment. Even before Mr. Fortuyn became a national figure, Paul Scheffer, a journalist and academic, called for efforts to break down barriers between communities and bring immigrants more fully into the mainstream of national life. I listened to Mr. Scheffer explain his view that the polite, politically correct silences of Dutch multiculturalism risk creating a new apartheid, condemning second- and third-generation immigrants to second-class schools and inferior employment opportunities. Unlike Mr. Fortuyn, who dreamed of severing contact with Muslim immigrants, Mr. Scheffer seeks more honest dialogue. 
For years, European intellectuals avoided discussing the problems of immigrant communities, for fear of stirring public anxieties. Now they talk about them, but well-meaning liberals are reluctant to do so openly. Their silence has helped open the door to the fear-mongers from whom the issue must now be reclaimed.

HEADLINE: China Facing Protests Over the Plight of North Korean Refugees 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Human rights advocates who have been trying to draw attention to the plight of tens of thousands of North Korean refugees in China are shifting their tactics, six leaders of the efforts have announced. Instead of helping groups invade foreign embassies in China to seek asylum, they will support protests at Chinese diplomatic missions and at United Nations offices around the world.
 One of the advocates, Norbert Vollertsen, a German doctor known for his provocative style, said that he plans to lead a protest rally to the Chinese Embassy in Washington next week. 
 A bill is progressing through the United States Congress that would earmark up to $80 million to help feed, clothe and move to safety people who escape the North Korean Communist dictatorship.
But increasingly, North Korea is in the public eye, not only for the nuclear weapons program to which it admitted recently, but also for its abuse of its own citizens. Human Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights group, recently released a report, "The Invisible Exodus: North Koreans in the People's Republic of China."
Saying that as many as 300,000 North Koreans made their way across the border to live clandestinely in northern China, the report called the situation "a human rights disaster." The group demanded that China immediately stop forcible repatriations, some of which end in death.
On Wednesday, the human rights advocates denounced the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, saying the agency had surrendered its protection mission in face of Chinese obstruction.
"The U.N.H.C.R. will be the target of our actions in the future," warned Willy Fautre, director of Human Rights Without Frontiers, a Brussels-based group. 
Over the last half century, China has signed several agreements with the United Nations pledging to refrain from repatriating migrants until it can be determined if they are economic or political refugees. In practice, China has closed the refugee areas to the United Nations.
China appears to fear an uncontrollable influx of North Koreans if it applies the Human Rights Watch prescription: an end to forcible repatriation, screening of refugees by the refugee agency and the awarding of "an indefinite humanitarian status" to "all North Koreans in China."
"The one agency with the authority to force a solution has chosen to sit on its hands," said Tarik M. Radwan, a lawyer for Jubilee Campaign, U.S.A., a religious-based human-rights group from Fairfax, Va. 
Such criticism was rejected at the Geneva headquarters of the 51-year-old refugee agency this week. 
"Picketing our offices does not solve the problem," Kris Janowski, the agency's spokesman, said by telephone. "We don't run China."
"We have a longstanding request with the Chinese to get access to the border," he continued. "Where we are hosted by a government, we have to operate with a government's consent."
Mr. Radwan, the American lawyer, said of China's actions: "An iron curtain has been brought down. No one is getting to the border areas."
Kim Guang Choel, a 27-year-old former railway worker in North Korea who arrived in South Korea last summer with his wife and daughter, contended in an interview that if refugees were guaranteed safe passage, "The cities will be empty. It will take only six months for there to be a flood."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Also a Drag On New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Little more than a year ago, New Jersey was gloating over its new status as the state with the highest median household income. But now, as the hole in its budget keeps growing, it is experiencing the flip side of that prosperity.
 New Jersey is one of the states most dependent on taxes from stock market money, and in the boom of the 1990's an increasing chunk of the state treasury came from capital gains revenue, a source that expanded along with the markets. 
 But the markets have plunged. Almost five months into the current fiscal year, the state budget is a tortured plan to stave off disaster. And officials are estimating a shortfall of about $4 billion that Gov. James E. McGreevey will have to erase in the budget he proposes in February. 
After income tax revenue dropped a startling 15 percent last year, the first decline since New Jersey adopted an income tax in 1976, it is expected to recover this year only to the level it reached in fiscal year 2000. The portion from capital gains dropped by half, and is still falling.
The newest numbers confirm that New Jersey, like New York, is only beginning to suffer for its reliance on Wall Street money. It will be years, budget officials and economists say, before the stock market yields big profits again.
"There's nothing left," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a national research firm. "But I say that half in jest because things could get worse. If the market continues to decline, then you get capital losses."
Of course, nearly all states are hurting. The collective shortfall in state budgets has reached $17.5 billion so far this year, the National Conference of State Legislatures reported last week. But the richest states, having had the sharpest drop in income tax revenue, are for now the ones least able to pay for staples like roads and schools.
New York's fiscal condition is certainly dire: state officials there, who administer an $89 billion budget this year, expect a shortfall of $5 billion to $10 billion next year. But New Jersey's projected gap -- $4 billion in a budget that is now $24 billion -- is even worse on a percentage basis.
Also, largely because of sharp spending increases in the late 1990's, New Jersey ran out of money earlier than New York. For the current budget, Governor McGreevey resorted to one-time fixes of the kind New York is now considering, like borrowing against future proceeds from the tobacco settlement, to close a gap of about $6 billion.
While Mr. McGreevey insists that he will resist broad-based tax increases, his administration is floating proposals to cut property tax rebates, to extend the sales tax to services and possibly to increase the tax rate for the very wealthiest residents.
While the overwhelming number of New Jersey taxpayers are working and earning at least as much as they made last year, receipts of estimated tax payments, reflecting capital gains paid primarily by the wealthy, are about 15 percent below projections, which had already assumed an anemic market.
"That's a significant concern," the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, said. "We are dependent on high-income taxpayers, more than any state in the country."
The extent of that dependency is hard to measure, since each state has its own mix of tax burdens. But Mr. Zandi, the economist, said that New Jersey "is on a par with New York itself, maybe not as bad as California and Massachusetts, but certainly in the top five."
To start, New Jersey residents simply have a lot of investment income. From 1990 to 2000, capital gains income rose to $18.8 billion from $3.3 billion. That income in 2000 generated more than $1 billion for the state treasury in 2001.
In other words, the state had a lot of revenue to lose, and it did. In 2001, New Jersey residents' income from capital gains plunged to $7.5 billion. The resulting loss in income tax receipts was $677 million -- more than the state collects from the lottery or gasoline tax.
Of course, capital gains income provides but a small portion of total income tax collections. But that share grew fast during the 1990's, from about 5 percent of income tax collections at the start of the decade to about 14 percent in the 2001 fiscal year, before dropping back to 6.6 percent this year.
New Jersey also benefits from other sources of income tied to Wall Street, including the bonuses to securities industry employees that have swollen personal income in recent years. Then by buying the things that bonuses buy, like million-dollar houses in Short Hills or Rumson, those big earners create capital gains for other people.
"We had this bubble attributable almost entirely to what happened on Wall Street," said David J. Rosen, the lead budget analyst in the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. "These folks were making their money from capital gains, commissions, stock options, bonuses. They may still have their jobs, but their income could have dropped from $1 million to $150,000."
Ever since Mr. McGreevey's election a year ago, he and fellow Democrats have attributed the budget crisis to his predecessors, Donald T. DiFrancesco and Christie Whitman, prompting a testy public response from Mrs. Whitman last week. The Republicans, Mr. McGreevey says, not only spent the windfalls of the late 90's but also committed the state to future spending at levels that could not be sustained.
Now -- and here is the ultimate political problem -- the state must adjust its tax structure to match the new reality. In the pie chart of revenue, if the slice from capital gains is smaller, the pie must be cut up differently.
When Mr. McGreevey responded last spring by planning the restructuring of the corporate business tax to double the receipts, the protests all but crippled Trenton for weeks. On the spending side, he froze state aid to municipalities and school districts, another highly unpopular move. This week, he told local officials to expect no more in the next budget either; the mayors say that decision will force punishing property tax increases for the second year in a row.
Some say the very richest can pay more. Jon Shure, the president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research group in Trenton, said that in the taxpayers' total burden -- income tax, sales tax and local property tax -- "the reality is that the lower your income the higher your burden."
"Income and wealth are becoming more and more concentrated in this country," Mr. Shure said. "There's some play here that could be looked at." He suggests raising the top state tax bracket, now 6.37 percent, for the very wealthiest. "You could argue that someone whose income is, say, $3 million could afford to pay 8 cents on the dollar on anything above $1 million."
But State Senator Leonard Lance, one of Mr. Shure's most reliable opponents on this issue, said the state already relies too much on high-income taxpayers. Mr. Lance said that more than three-quarters of state income tax revenue comes from those with incomes over $100,000, who are about 18 percent of taxpayers, and more than half is paid by the 3.75 percent who make more than $250,000.
Mr. Lance, a Republican who nonetheless opposed Mrs. Whitman's spending increases, maintains that the Democrats are still able, but not willing, to reduce school aid and pension costs, among other things.
"We have a fundamental structural deficit that was not in any way solved last year," he said. "And I predict it will not be addressed in the new budget either."

Wide Reach Of Terrorism

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Disrupting terrorist attacks, already a daunting job, has been made tougher still because extremist groups are increasingly willing to attack vulnerable, "soft" targets like the Israeli-owned resort gutted this week in Kenya.
 Counterterrorism officials in the United States and overseas have already been struggling to find ways of guarding traditional and somewhat predictable targets, like embassies, military installations, airports, landmarks and reactors. 
 But the suicide bombings at a hotel, coming just six weeks after suspected operatives or affiliates of Al Qaeda killed more than 190 people at a resort in Bali, presented intelligence officials with yet another set of vexing problems. The challenge comes in deciding where to focus security and intelligence resources if the enemy appears able to strike almost anywhere. 
"Because this was such a soft target, it's impossible to guard against something like this," said Vincent M. Cannistraro, a former counterterrorism official at the Central Intelligence Agency. "There are targets all over the world, and tourists are totally defenseless."
The Sept. 11 attacks demonstrated with shocking clarity Al Qaeda's ability to penetrate even those sites already considered likely targets. The World Trade Center was considered a possible target because of its symbolic and commercial value and because it had been hit before, in 1993, while the Pentagon's military value put it on the short list of possible domestic targets.
Intelligence officials around the world say they have become much more aggressive in collecting and distributing intelligence tips about possible threats, even those considered improbable.
Indeed, in Australia -- home to nearly half the victims of the Bali bombing -- intelligence officials said they received reports two weeks ago of a threat in Mombasa, leading them to urge citizens not to go there.
A senior Australian official said today that intelligence received by Australia is "automatically" passed to the United States. But American law enforcement and intelligence officials said they were unaware of any credible and specific information that could have predicted the Kenyan attacks.
The attacks on a remote Israeli target in Kenya would be particularly troubling if ultimately linked to Al Qaeda, because they would represent a broadened strategy. Although Al Qaeda has been linked to an April attack on a Tunisian synagogue, the group has aimed its strikes primarily at American targets in the past, rather than Israelis or Jews.
An American official said the rise in such targets "is something we've been concerned about for some time," adding, "Certainly Al Qaeda is going to aim where they have the best chance of success, and they're going to hit soft targets that they know are more vulnerable."
"We expect to see more of these kinds of attacks around the world," the official said, "and obviously it makes our job more difficult. We talk about Al Qaeda's global reach, and it is indeed global."
The police throughout Southeast Asia have been on edge for weeks for fear of another Bali-style attack, perhaps aimed at an international school or a church. Authorities in the region say they are convinced that the leaders of the loosely affiliated network that Osama bin Laden put in place in the last decade remain at large today and ready to reactivate sleeper cells. 
In Mombasa, three suicide bombers at the Israeli-owned hotel killed at least 13 people and injured dozens when they drove up to the doors of the hotel and detonated their explosives. Minutes earlier and some 20 miles away, terrorists fired shoulder-launched Russian-made missiles at an Israeli airliner but missed.
Officials say they are still uncertain who was behind the attack.
Immediate suspicion fell on Al Qaeda, in part because it struck the American Embassy in Kenya in 1998 and also because it is known to have used Russian missiles in the Middle East and elsewhere.
But the American official named two other possible suspects: a Somali terrorist group called Al Ittihad al Islami and the Mideast terror group Hezbollah. 
Mr. Cannistraro, the former C.I.A. official, said he found the Mombasa attack "much more reminiscent of a Hezbollah operation" because of the Israeli targets. 
If so, he said the operation would suggest that Hezbollah is broadening its aim beyond targets in Israel and Israeli-occupied territories, reverting to terror strategies of the early 1990's, when extremists struck a Jewish cultural center and the Israeli Embassy in Argentina.
"What you could have," Mr. Cannistraro said, "is a return to the days when these groups saw fewer opportunities for grandiose operations" and had to look for smaller-scale targets. "They're going after softer, more accessible targets, and we're likely to see more of that nowadays."
Such targets are tough to predict -- and even tougher to protect.
American officials said they were studying both the methods and targets in the Mombasa attacks, not only to determine who may have been responsible, but to ascertain what they suggest about future targets. 
This does not mean, officials caution, that Al Qaeda and its loose network of affiliates are no longer interested in the type of major attack like the one last year.
Indeed, interviews with captured Qaeda operatives and other sources have produced a steady stream of tips during the last 14 months -- many of them unverified -- about purported plots against the Brooklyn Bridge, the Seattle Space Needle and other well-known American targets. 
And an F.B.I. internal assessment just two weeks ago warned that in selecting its targets, "Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma. The highest-priority targets remain within the aviation, petroleum and nuclear sectors, as well as significant national landmarks."

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT)

 BODY:
 Canada's growth rate slowed in the third quarter, reversing the recent trend of outperforming the United States. 
Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent from July to September, down from 4.4 percent in the second quarter and 5.7 percent in the first. The United States economy expanded 4 percent in the third quarter. Most economists expect that the Bank of Canada will leave interest rates unchanged at its next policy review, on Tuesday.

Brazil's Government-Elect Softens Talk of Big Change

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
The new left-wing government that takes power in Brazil on Jan. 1 expects "a first year of extreme difficulty" in managing Latin America's largest economy and intends to pursue a cautious course, a senior official said, despite campaign promises of a sweeping social transformation.
 The president-elect, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former factory worker and labor leader who ran as the candidate of the Workers' Party, won the election held four weeks ago based largely on his promises to steer Brazil in a new direction. But as the date for the handover of power draws closer, the new government is beginning to sound more like the market-friendly administration it is about to replace. 
"Because Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, we cannot treat it like a small boat that can make a quick turn," Antonio Palocci, the head of Mr. da Silva's transition team, said in a meeting here Thursday night with a group of foreign reporters. "This is a big ship, and the turn toward a new policy has to be done carefully." 
Representatives of the new government have already met with an International Monetary Fund delegation that visited here earlier in the month to discuss a $30 billion package Brazil received in August. Mr. da Silva intends to honor that agreement, Mr. Palocci said, but even without such an accord, he recognizes the need for a large budget surplus to deal with Brazil's internal debt, which has mushroomed because of some of the world's highest interest rates.
"We intend to carry out an adjustment in the economic area that will be the most austere possible so that we can have good fiscal results and develop a policy of sustainable growth," Mr. Palocci said. Once that is done, he added, "we think that Brazil can return to growth rates of 7 or 8 percent a year," more than triple the average over the last decade.
The problems the new government faces are "situational, not structural," Mr. Palocci argued, and some signs are encouraging. Brazil will finish the year with an $11 billion trade surplus, he predicted, more than double what had been expected, and despite a recent surge in prices resulting largely from a strong dollar, the new government expects to be able to limit inflation to single digits next year.
Since Mr. da Silva's landslide victory, the Brazilian currency, the real, has recovered about 10 percent of its value against the American dollar, after falling by more than 30 percent earlier in the year. But in recent days, it has been slipping again, largely because of uncertainty about the composition of Mr. da Silva's cabinet and when he will name it.
Mr. da Silva plans to visit the United States in two weeks, after a trip next week to consult with Brazil's main partners in the South American common market, Argentina and Chile. He is scheduled to meet President Bush in Washington on Dec. 10, unusual for a leader who has not yet taken office, and Mr. Palocci said "it is possible but not certain" that the new cabinet will be named by then.
Mr. Palocci, a 42-year-old physician, has himself been frequently mentioned in Brazilian press reports as a possible candidate to become the minister of planning and budget or the minister of finance. He played down speculation about the finance post, using a medical analogy to argue that Mr. da Silva's economic team should be dominated by specialists known to the market.
"The director of a hospital can be an administrator, a lawyer or even a consultant," he said. "But those who actually operate on the patient have to be doctors, preferably surgeons, and with the economy it's the same. You need the people with the most experience."
Mr. da Silva's meeting with the man he has jokingly called "Comrade Bush" will be "a get-to-know each-other session" with little specific focus on bilateral issues like trade, Mr. Palocci said. Once in power, he added, the new government will seek a relationship with the Bush administration that is "not based on ideology" and that encompasses talks about a Free Trade Area of the Americas, which Mr. da Silva earlier dismissed as tantamount to annexation.
"We think it is necessary to negotiate an F.T.A.A. because we think the integration of the Americas is a positive and real project," Mr. Palocci said. "But we have to discuss with great clarity the conditions of this agreement." An advance toward a regional accord, he added, "doesn't depend on us; it depends on the disposition of everyone involved."
Mr. da Silva's agenda during his American trip does not call for him to travel to New York to meet with bankers or Wall Street investment houses. During the election campaign, he repeatedly criticized what he called the "economic terrorism" of "speculators" who he said were trying to reap immoral windfall profits at Brazil's expense, and other Workers' Party leaders specifically attacked investors like George Soros by name.

HEADLINE: Does Schroder Have Political Capital to Reform Economy? 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
For more than four years, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has promised to tackle the chronic ailments, like high labor costs, that have sapped the German economy. Now, with his popularity tanking and the economy tipping toward its second recession in a year, the question arises with new urgency: Can he reform Germany? 
 For Mr. Schroder, the troubles of Europe's largest economy have ended the honeymoon of his second election before it even began. Newspapers are comparing the country's political drift and economic malaise to Japan's. Some experts warn of a decade of stagnation. 
 Pressure to address the problems are coming not just from Germans, but also from the country's European Union partners, who worry that Mr. Schroder's troubles could quickly become theirs. 
If Germany falls sick, economists fear, it could infect the Continent, undermining its fledgling currency, the euro, and the grand task of European Union enlargement. It could even act as a drag on the global economy at a time when the United States is barely keeping its own economic footing.
"I haven't seen a situation this bad in my 25 years in political life," said Oswald Metzger, an expert on budget issues for the Greens, who left Parliament after the election and has become a harsh critic of Mr. Schroder. "The government is offering no long-term vision of how we are going to emerge from this period."
Many fear that Germany, like Japan, will muddle along for years before its leaders muster the courage, or the political wherewithal, to push through reforms. Foremost among them are proposals to make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers and for the government to scale back one of the world's coziest welfare states. 
While there is general agreement on the need for such steps, the government has been stymied by labor unions and other vested interests that form bases of support for Mr. Schroder's center-left Social Democratic Party. The chancellor has been reluctant to face them down. 
It also has not helped that Germany's political system, with its relatively weak national government and strong states, militates against strong reforms. So does the political calendar, with its crowded schedule of elections.
Having barely named his cabinet, Mr. Schroder in effect faces ballots in February in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony. The opposition has promised to turn the elections into plebiscites on Mr. Schroder's policies at time when he has suffered the swiftest decline in popularity of any postwar chancellor.
"Neither the government nor the opposition dares to present anything that is unpopular with special interests," said Fritz W. Scharpf, the director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, in Cologne. "They're waging a war of attrition against the cause of good policy."
In his first term, when the chancellor briefly held a majority in both houses of Parliament, he proposed cuts in taxes and pension-fund contributions that marked him as a Social Democrat of a different stripe. But he later diluted or abandoned many of those measures in the face of union opposition.
"The socialist government managed to sound leftist, but to do the right things," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. "Then it lost its momentum."
There were hopes that Mr. Schroder's close call at the polls in September would change that. The Social Democrats clung to power only because of the strong gains made by its coalition partner, the Greens.
The Greens advocate bolder economic policies than the Social Democrats, and many experts hoped that they would be able to write them into the agenda for the new government. But it did not happen.
"The Greens have become a mere echo of the S.P.D.," Mr. Metzger said, referring to the Social Democratic Party. 
Instead, faced with a wider than expected budget gap, Mr. Schroder announced a program that relies heavily on tax increases instead of spending cuts, reversing a campaign pledge. Germans, whose taxes are already among the highest in Europe, will soon pay even steeper levies on gas and heating oil, as well as on capital gains from sales of stock. 
Many voters were incensed. The mass-market tabloid Bild responded to the plan with a banner headline last week that read like both a plea and a pithy description of the national mood: "Chancellor, We've Had Enough!" 
The policies, which are dictated in part by European Union limits on government deficits, are sapping the confidence of consumers and businesses, as well as of many experts. 
"My forecast is that the government will not raise what it believes, and it will kill the economy," said Norbert Walter, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, who predicts a recession by the turn of the year.
Unemployment, which stands at a four-year high of about four million people, could rise to 4.5 million by February because of the seasonal job cycle. Corporate bankruptcies, already at historic levels, are expected to top 40,000 by next year, draining Germany's already fragile banks. 
The economic troubles have deep roots. Reunification imposed unique pressures on the eastern and western German economies. Their currencies were converted on a 1-to-1 ratio, a costly decision for the west that left the eastern Germans -- saddled with a decrepit infrastructure and a less skilled work force -- utterly unable to compete.
Since then, Berlin has spent well over $100 billion rebuilding the east, a fiscal burden that will be felt for decades. Germany's other problems are more common to industrial Western economies, notably high labor costs and expensive social security and health care systems.
But perhaps the keenest disappointment for Germans has been the government's inability to overhaul its hidebound labor market.
Mr. Schroder, declaring labor reform his No. 1 priority, formed a commission last year to suggest ways to cut the number of jobless in half within three years. Among other things, it proposed turning Germany's 181 labor offices into employment agencies, to find temporary work for jobless people.
It also proposed giving tax breaks to freelancers who now work in the so called underground economy, to encourage them to register in the labor force. Economists estimate that the shadow economy accounts for as much as 15 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, but the state collects no taxes on its activity.
Other proposals, like restricting benefits to the chronically unemployed, were watered down under pressure from the unions. The commission did not even consider more radical measures to create a more fluid labor market. 
Siemens, the electronics giant, has announced 35,000 job cuts since January 2001, less than half in its home market. The company says reducing its German payroll is a costly and cumbersome process that can often require setting up a separate new company filled with laid-off employees who spend a year looking for new jobs at their full salaries. "The main problem in Germany is that we have a lot of regulations which make it very difficult to cut employees," said Walter Huber, the company's vice president for corporate personnel.
A visit to the labor office in Frankfurt shows how the welfare state can take the edge off even a sharp downturn. Job seekers sit at well-equipped computer stations, scrolling through electronic listings. The mood is tranquil rather than tense. 
"We know our system is very, very comfortable," said Hans-Peter Griesheimer, the director of the office. "It has to change, of course, but it will change only when we no longer have the money to pay for it."

HEADLINE: Mandate For the Middle 

BYLINE:  By James M. Jeffords; James M. Jeffords, an independent, is the junior senator from Vermont.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I have listened to a lot of people discuss what went right and what went wrong in the 2002 midterm elections. In the final tally, there is no question that President Bush did a masterful job engineering victories for the Republican Party.
 But I worry that the list of issues that dominated the election season was woefully incomplete. As we respond daily to the latest threats of terror highlighted by the administration, I believe other issues that bear directly on the security of our homeland are being dangerously obscured. 
 Our slumping economy, our threatened environment, our underfunded schools, our corporate scandals -- these are not issues that you will hear discussed by the White House, but they are being talked about by people who don't have the power to define the nation's agenda.
In Congress we have just passed a law that will bring about the largest restructuring of our government since World War II. We are telling the American people that a new Department of Homeland Security will protect them. But Americans are losing their jobs and their ability to support their families. In less than two years, more than two million private sector jobs have been lost, while our economic growth is the weakest it has been in 50 years.
We should be addressing that homeland security issue.
Too many hard-working people are stuck in low-wage jobs, wondering how they will make the rent payment and cover child-care costs. The Census Bureau's recent income and poverty report stated that 1.3 million Americans slipped below the poverty line in the last year. This increase means that 11.7 percent of the United States population is living in poverty. The Census Bureau also reported that median household income decreased for the first time since 1991.
What's more, many workers who are fortunate enough not to have to worry about their jobs are now worrying about their savings. More than 50 percent of Americans have investments in the stock market, and they have seen the value of those investments decline by more than $4.5 trillion since last January.
We should be addressing that homeland security issue.
Coal plants in the Midwest continue to spew toxic pollutants into the air, yet the administration does not see the wisdom in regulating these emissions, preferring to rely on the good-faith efforts of plant owners to police themselves. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people are dying prematurely every year from such pollution.
I was proud to work with President George H. W. Bush on the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. He called our work "a new chapter in our environmental history, and a new era for clean air." Now, President George W. Bush insists on moving us backward, undoing his father's legacy and our nation's environmental policy. Last week the administration issued regulations to ease clean air rules to allow power plants to avoid having to install new antipollution equipment when they modernize their plants.
We should be addressing that homeland security issue.
The lack of funding for our schools is disgraceful. Of the major industrial nations, the United States ranks among the lowest in terms of financing education at the federal level, providing only 7 percent of the cost. The president's education plan is long on new federal mandates but short on the resources to make them work. The government promised more than 25 years ago to pay 40 percent of special education costs for children with disabilities; it now covers only 18 percent. 
There's no question that we are living in a dangerous time. Some of the threats we face are being met with judgment and careful deliberation. But others, namely the steady erosion of economic opportunity here at home, are being ignored. 
If the new, razor-thin Republican majority abuses its power and moves forward with an extreme agenda that overlooks the concerns of the many and benefits only the privileged few, there will be repercussions. 
Since the election, my decision to leave the Republican Party last year has been subject to new scrutiny. The attention on my personal decision, while understandable, is misplaced. If the Republicans read the recent election results as a rejection of moderation and a mandate to steamroll opposition from within the party, they will be making a grave mistake.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Smaller Raises For Federal Workers 

BYLINE:  By Richard W. Stevenson (NYT) 

 BODY:
 President Bush said he would set raises for federal workers next year at 3.1 percent, canceling a provision in the law that would have set off an average increase of 18.6 percent. Congress had considered a 4.1 percent increase, but did not pass it, while Mr. 
Bush had been seeking 2.6 percent. Consumer price inflation is currently 2.1 percent, the administration said. With no specific pay increase having been signed into law, the figures for next year are set under a two-part formula that gives the president the right to override one of the parts. White House officials said Mr. Bush would not object to the basic 3.1 percent increase under the formula. But they said he would use his power to cancel the other part of the raise because it would add about $10 billion to the federal payroll next year alone. Richard W. Stevenson (NYT)
