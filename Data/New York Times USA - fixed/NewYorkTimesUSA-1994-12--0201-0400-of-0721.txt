HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bills Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bills fell yesterday on continued concerns over the impact of the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
The market is concerned that some Wall Street firms may sell the government securities they hold as collateral for their loans to Orange County. 
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 5/32 , while the declines in intermediate maturities ranged from 1/16 to 5/32 , according to Telerate Inc. The price of the two-year note fell 1/8, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, to 7.49 percent, from 7.43 percent on Wednesday.
The long end of the market, however, was stronger. The price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32 , to a price of 9528/32 , for a yield of 7.86 percent, down from 7.89 percent on Wednesday.
Despite the worries over Orange County, the municipal market steadied after a sharp drop on Wednesday.
Analysts said there was very little selling of California issues, with traders choosing to wait for further developments. John C. Mooney, a portfolio manager on the municipal side at SunAmerica Asset Management, said, "What bidding there was on California paper was limited and cautious, with few takers." He said the bids on shorter-maturity paper improved yesterday to 70 cents on the dollar, compared with 60 cents the day before.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively trade municipal issues rose to 7.08 percent, from 7.06 percent on Wednesday.
The Treasury market initially extended its losses in early trading on persistent concern over the Orange County losses and Federal Reserve policy. On Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted strongly in testimony before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that the Fed would soon raise short-term interest rates again, saying that the economy was continuing to grow briskly.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said Mr. Greenspan's testimony left the impression that the Fed was likely to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time since Februrary on either Dec. 20 or Jan. 31, when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making committee, meets.
"It is my expectation that the central bank will raise the Federal funds target rate to 6 percent from its current 5.50 percent," Mr. Johnson said. "The assessment is short-term rates will be raised enough to slow the economy significantly and begin to ease concern of future inflation. At that point, we should begin to see indicators that lead inflation to abate."
In later trading yesterday, long bond prices drew some support from a firmer dollar in the currency markets. A stronger dollar means that dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities become more attractive to foreign investors.
The Treasury auctioned $17 billion of new one-year bills, with the average rate at auction 6.75 percent, up sharply from last month, when it was 6.09 percent. A year ago it was 3.47 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 49.79 Points, To 3,685.73

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market, after three sessions of shrugging off news about Orange County's bankruptcy and the prospect of another interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve, dropped sharply yesterday in unusually heavy trading, in part because of resurgent fears of a recession, some analysts said.
Other analysts attributed the fall to more technical factors, such as traders buying and selling stocks in their portfolios in advance of the expiration of quarterly options and the end of the year, when quarterly profits and losses are recognized. 
 Whatever the explanation, the Dow Jones industrial average fell throughout the day, but at 3:15 P.M. set off the so-called circuit-breaker rules designed to slow down high-speed computer-guided trading.
The Dow fell 49.79 points, to 3,685.73, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.78 points, to 445.45. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 15.15 points, to 719.12.
Volume was unusually heavy throughout the day on the New York Stock Exchange but peaked in the last hour of trading, accelerating the selloff. A total of 362.8 million shares changed hands, about 25 percent more than this year's daily average of 288 million shares.
It was a curious session in which bond prices rallied but stock prices fell, a break from this year's pattern in which the fate of stocks and bonds has run almost parallel.
But the Dow, and also the S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq, fell from the beginning of the session, while bond prices were flat until 1 P.M. when they rallied strongly. Gold, which traders buy as a hedge against inflation, fell yesterday after prices had been flat for three sessions.
"This is the classic recession scenario," said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company in Los Angeles. "Bonds rally, stocks drop, especially cyclical stocks, and nobody buys gold. The markets are saying that a recession could occur far sooner than anybody thinks."
Moreover, the yield curve of bonds is flattening, which means that short-term bonds pay almost as much as bonds with maturities of a decade or more. A wide variety of fixed-income securities are therefore attractive and could coax money into Treasury bills and notes and out of stocks.
For example, the one-year Treasury bond yesterday paid an interest rate of 7.17 percent, a five-year bond 7.75 percent and a 30-year bond 7.86 percent.
"The yield curve has had so many contractions that it's about to give birth," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C. H. Dean & Associates in Dayton, Ohio. "And the birth just might be recession. The Fed is walking close to that line when it says it will continue to raise interest rates."
Other analysts were less certain. "None of us in the market really knows where the trigger comes in," said Richard E. Meyer, managing director of institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann. "The market has been fighting negative news for three days. It was just a buildup and, like a thunderstorm, it just happens."
Some stocks rose. AT&T rallied strongly, after falling for nearly a month, to rise 1 3/8, to 48 5/8. Prudential Securities and other brokerage firms raised their assessments of the company. Seneca Foods gained 3 1/4, to 34 1/2, after Grand Metropolitan contracted the processing of its Green Giant vegetables to Seneca.
Most stocks were down. National Semiconductor fell 1 3/4, to 17 3/8, after reporting second-quarter earnings that only matched Wall Street expectations.
And Hewlett-Packard, like a variety of other high-technology stocks that have been consistent winners throughout the year, fell 3 1/4, to 92 5/8.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Up

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories increased for a fourth straight month in October, the Commerce Department said today, and sales increased moderately.
The steady rise in stocks of goods on hand during the fall indicates that wholesalers expected strong holiday sales prospects. 
 In a separate report that also showed a continuing strong economy, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits for the week ended last Saturday came in below Wall Street economists' expectations of 325,000. Initial claims climbed by 6,000, to 322,000, from a revised 316,000 the week before, which included the Thanksgiving holiday. New claims for jobless benefits typically go down in a holiday week.
In the inventory report, the Commerce Department said inventories held by merchant wholesalers grew six-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $230.13 billion, following a revised five-tenths of 1 percent rise in September.
During October, wholesalers' sales increased three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $174.93 billion, after falling in September by a revised five-tenths of 1 percent.
The additions to inventory in October were entirely at the durable goods level, as stocks of products like automobiles and furniture increased 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $148.15 billion.
In the jobless report, the Labor Department said that the number of people filing continued claims for the week ended Nov. 26, the latest week for which the figures were available, edged back up from a five-year low the prior week.
The closely watched four-week moving average, which irons out weekly fluctuations and is considered a more accurate indicator of jobless trends than the weekly totals, dipped in the week ended last Saturday.
The average fell by 2,750, to 323,000, from a revised 325,750 a week earlier.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Speculation Fed Will Raise Rates Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other leading currencies yesterday as dealers speculated that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates again.
Expectations that United States interest rates would rise intensified after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday that the economy was still growing briskly, even though the Fed has raised rates six times since February. Higher rates make dollar deposits more attractive. 
 "Greenspan opened the door for another rate increase, and that's helping the dollar," said Jerry Egan, managing director of foreign exchange at MTB Bank.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose back above 100 Japanese yen, to 100.55 yen, from 99.95 yen on Wednesday. The dollar rose to 1.5773 German marks from 1.5677 marks,
The Fed last raised the two short-term interest rates it directly controls on Nov. 15, by a bigger-than-expected three-quarters of a percentage point each. The Fed's discount rate on direct loans to banks, which sets the floor for other rates, is 4.75 percent, compared with 4.5 percent in Germany and 1.75 percent in Japan. The difference means that traders give up interest payments when they sell dollars for marks and yen. More rate increases would make dollar purchases even more attractive.
"People would rather be long of dollars than short," given the outlook for United States rates, Gary Sakamoto, vice president at National Westminster Bank, said. "The question now is whether the Fed raises rates before the end of the year."
Concerns about the impact of the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., abated in the currency market, dealers said.
In other currency trading, the Australian dollar rallied to a three-year high against the United States dollar as copper and other commodity prices rose. The Australian currency often strengthens when commodity prices rise because the country is the world's sixth-largest copper producer and one of the world's largest exporters of raw materials.
The Australian dollar rose as high as 77.40 United States cents, its highest level since December 1991. In New York, it was last quoted at 77.35 United States cents, up from 76.99 cents on Wednesday.
The dollar was stronger against most European currencies, rising to 1.3366 Swiss francs, from 1.3255 francs on Wednesday. The British pound slipped to $1.5651 from $1.5632.

Examining Women's Studies Programs

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

PROFESSING FEMINISM
 Cautionary Tales From Inside the Strange World of Women's Studies
 By Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge
 235 pages. A New Republic Book/Basic Books. $24.
Toward the end of their chilling new book, Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge draw some rather unflattering analogies between contemporary feminism (or at least feminism as they say it's being taught in many women's studies programs today) and religious cults, experimental communes and creationist science. 
 Like many religious sects, they argue, women's studies programs have grown increasingly dogmatic, increasingly obsessed with conformity and increasingly intolerant of deviant beliefs. Like many experimental communes, they say, these programs tend to evince a "bunker mentality" that regards the outside world with a mixture of hostility and disdain. And like creationists, they assert, many teachers in these programs dismiss traditional science and intellectual inquiry as biased, while trying to replace these methods with alternative systems of their own.
In fact, as Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge see it, the brand of feminism promulgated by many university programs today is not simply about equal rights for women or the study of gender and sex. "Feminism aspires to be much more than this," they write. "It bids to be a totalizing scheme resting on a grand theory, one that is as all-inclusive as Marxism, as assured of its ability to unmask hidden meanings as Freudian psychology, and as fervent in its condemnation of apostates as evangelical fundamentalism. Feminist theory provides a doctrine of original sin: the world's evils originate in male supremacy. It regards the male's (usually: the white male's) insistence on maintaining his own power as the passkey that unlocks the mysteries of individual actions and institutional behavior. And it offers a prescription for radical change that is as simple as it is drastic: reject whatever is tainted with patriarchy and replace it with something embodying gynecentric values."
Ms. Patai, a professor of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and Ms. Koertge, a professor of the history and philosophy of science at Indiana University, are both longtime veterans of women's studies programs, and they identify themselves as feminists who have become disillusioned with the direction that feminism has taken in recent years. Many of the arguments they set forth in this volume will be familiar to readers of such recent books as "Who Stole Feminism?," by Christina Hoff Sommers, "The Morning After," by Katie Roiphe, and "Illiberal Education," by Dinesh D'Souza.
Once again, we are treated to laments about feminism's insistence on depicting women as victims in need of self-esteem. Once again, we are shown some absurdities resulting from feminism's efforts to police the English language. Once again, we are given a litany of horror stories meant to illustrate the dangers of political correctness.
In "Professing Feminism," Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge cite cases in which students are chastised for failing to toe the party line and are charged with "resistance." They recount the story of a woman who is accused by her colleagues of exhibiting "masculinist categories of thought" because she happens to be an economist and another story about an "art project" exhibited on a University of Maryland campus that "listed as 'potential rapists' male names pulled randomly from a student directory."
Such examples are indeed disturbing, but because of the highly arbitrary nature of this book, they are not entirely persuasive: Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge note in a prologue that they have based "Professing Feminism" on interviews with 30 women from around the country (many of whom did not even want their real names or affiliations mentioned), supplemented with material culled from letters, memos, journal entries and computer forums. Given this improvisatory method on the part of the authors, the reader is inclined to take their examples with a grain of salt and disinclined to accept them as representative of the state of women's studies as a whole.
When it comes to analyzing the basic tenets of radical feminism and their practical consequences in academia, however, Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge are decidedly more convincing. "It is ironic, and tragic as well," they write, "that feminism, which originally denounced traditional education for its failures to act in accordance with its self-proclaimed precepts of justice, fairness, equality and dispassionate evaluation, has so enthusiastically trashed the very principles on which its early (and, on the whole, warranted) denunciations rested."
Indeed Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge repeatedly illustrate in these pages the unfortunate tendency of radical feminism to replicate some of the very unfairnesses and stereotypes feminism once decried. They point out that women's studies programs tend to reinforce the simplistic theory that associated intellect and logic with men, and sentiment and emotion with women.
The new feminists, they say, have simply reversed the traditional hierarchy of values associated with these identifications: subjective, "female" impressions are now supposed to be more valid than logically constructed, "male" arguments. Stereotypes of women as weak, infantilized creatures, Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge suggest, are similarly ratified by radical feminists, who not only insist on blaming men for all of humanity's ills, but who also promulgate a view of the world as a threatening, male-dominated realm.
Ms. Patai and Ms. Koertge argue that because these views are promoted by teachers of women's studies with such fervor, because many of these teachers use "their classrooms as sites for the recruiting and training of students to be feminist activists," a clash with the traditional values of liberal education becomes inevitable. In fact, they suggest that there will always be an inherent contradiction in the dual agenda of women's studies: educational (the study of women and gender) and political (the correction of social injustice); academic (implying freedom of inquiry) and ideological (implying indoctrination).

HEADLINE: AT THE MET WITH: Hans Haacke;
Peering at a Wide World Beyond Works on a Wall

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
HANS HAACKE first achieved a measure of fame in 1971 when he did not have a show at the Guggenheim Museum. One had been planned. Then the museum's director, Thomas Messer, discovered that Mr. Haacke wanted the show to include documentation of the real-estate holdings of New York City slumlords. The Guggenheim wasn't the place for "active engagement toward social and political ends," Mr. Messer proclaimed. He canceled the exhibition, and its curator, Edward Fry, was dismissed.
Seen today in the lobby of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Haacke doesn't look fearsome. He's friendly, if a little cautious. He has only one stipulation about touring the museum: no photographs of him. "I don't want to push myself as a person into the foreground," he says. "The foreground should be my work. And also the image can be a fetish, a fetishization of the artist, which I don't want." For the record, the 58-year-old German-born Mr. Haacke is balding, bearded and of medium height, and on this day he is dressed casually in a black leather jacket. 
 His desire is to visit one corner of the Met: its galleries of 19th-century art and a nearby exhibition, "Origins of Impressionism," which examines painting in France in the 1860's. As you might expect, Mr. Haacke doesn't go through the museum as other people tend to do. He's almost as interested in the labels, the architecture, the lists of donors and exhibition sponsors -- the infrastructure and apparatus of the museum -- as he is in the art. But he's unpredictable: he stops to admire something on the wall for its sheer beauty. When he says, before starting out, that he has just a couple of ideas in mind, you know he's underplaying his hand. But though he chooses the works he wants to talk about, not to mention his words, very carefully, he's also a close listener, willing to acknowledge that his idea about something isn't the only, or the best-formed, one.
He sets out toward the 19th-century galleries. On the way, he makes a stop to look at photographs. One of them is a 1928 work by August Sander, "Unemployed Man, Cologne." The man's pose is demure, touching, and Mr. Haacke notes how, unlike many of Sander's models, he looks modestly away from the camera.
Mr. Haacke once based a painting, of the German chocolate manufacturer Peter Ludwig, on a Sander photograph of a pastry maker. Sander extensively photographed Cologne before and after World War II, when Mr. Haacke was a child there. Sander also saw his art as having a social, not just esthetic, purpose, which is another obvious explanation for Mr. Haacke's interest in him.
Mr. Haacke settled in New York City in the 1960's. At a time of Minimalism and Process and environmental art, his early works involved biological references: one, "Ant Co-op," consisted of an ant farm. Mr. Haacke's aim was to explore socialization among the ants.
In a sense, it wasn't all that big a leap from the ant work to the political works he began to do by the late 60's: these explored the dynamics of human relations, in particular the relations between corporations and individuals, governments and citizens, museums and museumgoers. Mr. Haacke's metier became a territory more familiar to investigative reporters than artists: one project he planned for a museum in Cologne involved tracing the backgrounds of the donors of a Manet, including one who turned out to have been a high official at the Deutsche Bank in the days of Hitler (that museum, like the Guggenheim, declined to show Mr. Haacke's work).
Over the years, Mr. Haacke has become the dean of political artists, and scores of followers have tried to imitate his blend of reportage, visual bite and wit. In turn, he is heir to figures like Bertolt Brecht, George Grosz, Hannah Hoch and John Heartfield. He has constructed sculptures and installations and done photographic pieces and paintings aimed at companies like the Swiss arms manufacturer Oerlikon-Buhrle, American Cyanamid, Mobil Oil and the advertising firm of Saatchi & Saatchi, and also at individuals like Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Often his goal is to document how art and art institutions are tied up with politics.
Sander had an interest in documentation, too: he undertook to photograph people from all parts of German society, dividing them into peasants, businessmen, the insane and so on. His accomplishment was to suggest the coherence of such categories while maintaining the individuality of each of his subjects. An initial selection of pictures in this vast, encyclopedic enterprise, which Sander called "Citizens of the 20th Century," was published in 1929, but the Nazis suppressed the book and no further parts of the project were published until after Sander's death in 1964.
What does Mr. Haacke make of the idea of cataloguing human types? "Cataloguing has dangerous overtones," he says. "But the Nazis tried to present specimens. There were the ideal types that they wanted to promote, and we all know the consequence of that. And then they had rogues' galleries. Sander was cataloguing as a sociologist might do."
 
Courbet and Cabanel
 The Met's recently redesigned galleries for its 19th-century European painting and sculpture collection are decorated in a Beaux-Arts fashion. From the entrance to them, at the end of a long columniated vista, is Courbet's "Young Ladies From the Village," a painting of the artist's sisters gathered in a valley near his native Ornans. "I am always struck by the sense of light, as if there is a spotlight on the women," Mr. Haacke says.
Then he turns to the Met's architecture. "Disneyland," he says. "The claim that this recreates the environment in which these paintings were first shown is not credible."
"The Paris Salons didn't look like this," he continues, referring to the giant annual state-sponsored exhibitions in Paris. It was in part by breaking with the traditions of the salon that avant-gardists defined themselves. "Paintings in the salons, as we know from photographs, were stacked from floor to ceiling. So this is fake. We can visit here on Sundays. But it's like slumming in the past.
"It would be great if one could arrive at a presentation that convicts, so to speak, the salon paintings, the official paintings, on their own terms. But it's not easy. And I admit I cannot offer a scheme."
Mr. Haacke's opinions aren't pat. About much of the so-called political art today, he says, "I am often impatient with all the well-intentioned stuff that doesn't turn me on visually." He volunteers that while he sympathized with the idea behind the last Whitney Biennial, with all its political art, the show depressed him. And the preachy, humorless tone of museum wall labels that try to link art with politics gives him "stomachaches -- not the principle behind them but their execution."
Still, Mr. Haacke looks especially closely at the wall labels accompanying the works on view, which typically give the title, name the artist and donor, and sometimes include an explanatory comment. He mostly finds them lacking.
He notes a label for the academician Alexandre Cabanel's "Birth of Venus," the famous image of a glassy female nude reclining on the crest of a wave. It lists the work's donor as John Wolfe. He was the cousin and art adviser of Catherine Lorillard Wolfe, one of the Met's first major patrons. "The picture was part of the bedrock of the Met's early collection," Mr. Haacke says, "which tells you something of the outlook of the founders of the museum. The salon was their model, in every sense of the word salon."
The label doesn't say enough about what the scene depicts, Mr. Haacke says: "The label should put us in the context of Cabanel's period. Also, a naked woman appears in the painting. I would talk about this somehow in the label: what it meant in Cabanel's time, what implications it has, how this subject is still our subject today."
Mr. Haacke expands: "When works of art are presented like rare butterflies on the walls, they're decontextualized. We admire their beauty, and I have nothing against that, per se. But there is more to art than that.
"Museums are managers of consciousness. They give us an interpretation of history, of how to view the world and locate ourselves in it. They are, if you want to put it in positive terms, great educational institutions. If you want to put it in negative terms, they are propaganda machines. They're both. This is something usually not acknowledged and there's probably a good reason why: because if this were in one's consciousness, then one would be a bit more immune to brainwashing, assuming brainwashing is the intent. Although I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is. That would be a little paranoid."
 
Paint and Passion
 "Origins" is around the corner. Within it, Mr. Haacke settles on Cezanne's "Madeleine," a big, grossly painted image, in the overheated manner of that artist's early work.
"This is a god-awful painting," Mr. Haacke says. "But it is one of the most interesting in the show. Not only is the imagery something we see later with Expressionism, but also the application of paint is so outrageous for its time. Paint is applied, to put it in fancy terms, to be a signifier for distress."
"Compared to the late, mature Cezannes -- they are great paintings, no question -- this one has energy behind it," he says. "It is painted with passion. The later ones are more staid."
Renoir's "Young Boy With a Cat" is a few feet away. It depicts a naked adolescent from the rear, standing, his legs crossed, his head turned back toward the viewer. The cat he leans over to cuddle sits on a tall piece of furniture covered in white silk. "Look at the way the cloth is pleated, soft, and how it contrasts with the figure next to it," Mr. Haacke says. "The folds, of course, are full of sexual connotations. I don't know of another painting off the top of my head of a young boy seen naked from the back. Obviously there's affection on the part of Renoir toward the boy. It's a homoerotic image. The boy is looking out at us in a very strange way -- as if there's some unspoken drama going on."
The Renoir is in a part of the show devoted to nudes. The centerpiece of it is Courbet's "Woman With a Parrot." Mr. Haacke sees a connection not only between its image of a reclining nude and Cabanel's "Birth of Venus" -- an obvious link -- but also, less obviously, with Marcel Duchamp. "The Courbet reminds me of that late Duchamp in the Philadelphia Museum of Art," he says, referring to "Etant Donnes," the famous work involving a peephole through which one sees a naked woman splayed on the ground. "The hair, the posture, the raised arm that in this case holds the bird and in the Duchamp, a gas lamp. The fuzzy background: a waterfall in Duchamp, here a vague landscape. And of course, they're both erotic images."
Courbet painted "Woman With a Parrot" around the same time that he did "Origin of the World," a close-up shot of a woman's genitals. Mr. Haacke sees those two paintings and the Duchamp as forming "a triad."
"It's important when we see something on exhibition that we think not only in terms of where it comes from, but also where it leads to," he says.
 
Manet the Reporter
 Around the corner, in a room of marine pictures, hangs Manet's "Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama." Mr. Haacke positions himself in front of it. The picture depicts a scene from the Civil War that occurred in French waters: the Confederate steam-driven corvette Alabama lost to the Union steam sloop Kearsarge outside Cherbourg harbor on June 15, 1864. The painting shows the Alabama sinking under a cloud of smoke into a dark green sea, the Kearsarge in the distance on the horizon and, in the foreground, a small French sailboat occupied by spectators. As the label says, the picture is "not simply a marine but also a reportage of a significant contemporary event."
Mr. Haacke points out how "carefully constructed it is, with this long diagonal from the sailboat in the lower left to the Kearsarge in the upper right, and the way the tips of the sails of the small boat line up with the Alabama."
"But it's also a curious composition," he continues, "because in the foreground, there's this huge expanse of mostly nothing, just water, of relatively uniform color and little detail. While at the back you have the opposite: very minute details, with all the ships and flags."
"A standard line, promoted by people like Clement Greenberg," Mr. Haacke goes on, referring to the late American art critic, "is that politics contaminates art, and Manet is often cited as an example of art for art's sake." Mr. Haacke overlooks the last quarter-century of Manet scholarship when he says this. Still, he has a point to make: "But here Manet is acting like a reporter and commentator. Aside from the fact that it's a beautiful painting, the reason I'm excited about it is because it's a precedent for making current political events a subject matter of art."
Manet was a trenchant social commentator, Courbet a revolutionary. Mr. Haacke next wants to look at a Courbet in the following room, "Oak Tree in Flagey, Called the Oak of Vercingetorix." Again, the politics behind the image intrigue him. In Courbet's day, the people of Burgundy and of the artist's native Franche-Comte region were in heated dispute over the site of Alesia, the ancient capital of Gallic resistance to Julius Caesar. Particularly in the 1860's, when Napoleon III ruled France, Alesia became a symbol of anti-imperialism. The giant oak, Courbet said, represented the Alesian site in Franche-Comte where Vercingetorix, the Gallic general, battled the Romans. The oak was a kind of surrogate portrait of the general by Courbet. It was also, maybe, a reference to the trees planted during the French Revolution as emblems of liberty.
"The tree is very strong," Mr. Haacke says. "The whole thing's painted with a palette knife, so there is a thick texture to the pigment. No trompe l'oeil." It reminds him of Brecht: "Brecht wanted his actors to present themselves to the audience as actors, in contrast to pretending that they are the people they portray."
He also sees a connection between the Courbet and a well-known work by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich, "Sea of Ice," in Hamburg. Friedrich is more of a political artist than people think, Mr. Haacke contends. "Sea of Ice" is an image of a shipwreck in frozen waters. Wood fragments protrude from the ice. Most people interpret them as shards of the ship's broken mast. Mr. Haacke says they are tree trunks, their branches cut off, representing trees of liberty like Courbet's oak. "Trees for Friedrich represented Germany," he says, "and that image expressed his disappointment at the failure of the democratic movement there."
The Friedrich, in any case, has a direct connection to Mr. Haacke's art: his installation at the German pavilion of the 1993 Venice Biennale, which consisted of a shattered stone floor, mimicked the broken ice in the Friedrich. "I'm a Romantic in many ways, like Friedrich," Mr. Haacke says, "though many people may not believe that."
 
Rediscovering Degas
 In the show's last room is Degas's enigmatic painting called "Interior (The Rape)." The image is of a woman seated in a room with her back to a man leaning against a closed door. On the small table between them is an open valise and a lamp that lights the scene. "Walking around the Met recently I rediscovered Degas, whom I didn't particularly care for," Mr. Haacke says. "I couldn't get excited about all those women in tutus. But I've come to believe his relationship to women was much more complicated and sympathetic than I had thought."
He wants to find a room of Degas sculptures back in the 19th-century galleries. On the way there he can't avoid the objects in the show's gift shop, like a locket modeled after one in a Manet. "I don't mind catalogues, books, postcards," he says. "I don't even mind calendars. But when the images are extracted and turned into merchandise, that's an insult to the artist."
Mr. Haacke also notes a sign that says the sponsor of "Origins" is Philip Morris. This leads him on a tangent: he says he isn't surprised that Philip Morris has recently tried to get cultural institutions to which it has given money to campaign on its behalf against anti-smoking legislation. The company asked them to get in touch with the New York City Council to stress how important the company is to the arts here.
In 1990, Mr. Haacke recalls, he created a giant cigarette package, modeled after Philip Morris's Marlboro brand, with "Helmsboro" where the word Marlboro would be. A picture of Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, was placed within the Philip Morris insignia. And the words "Philip Morris funds Jesse Helms" were printed on each of the cigarettes, a reference to contributions by the company to the Senator's re-election campaign at a time when Mr. Helms was vigorously campaigning against the National Endowment for the Arts.
Mr. Haacke's SoHo gallery, John Weber, got a letter from a Philip Morris lawyer who had seen an announcement card for the show. The lawyer objected to the use of the Marlboro design, and Mr. Haacke had reason to believe from the letter that the gallery would be sued if the show went on as planned. (The lawyer insists he was only trying to stop the gallery from using the design on the card.)
"We ignored it," says Mr. Haacke. "But in most cases, the gallery would have said to the artist, 'We love you, but we don't have the money to fight this.' "
 
Women and Work
 Mr. Haacke is still looking for Degas. He arrives on the way at a Rodin of a headless nude woman with her legs spread. "Here's something that Jesse Helms would object to and also his complement, Catharine Mac Kinnon," he says, referring to the feminist lawyer and writer. "I don't think the truncation was intended as amputation. It's not pornographic. Rodin's references are probably to the venerated fragments of classical sculptures."
Degas's sculptures are crowded together in a small gallery nearby. They're difficult to see behind glass in bulky cabinets. "I want to show you this one of a pregnant woman," Mr. Haacke says. He points to a sculpture almost hidden in a corner. "This is the reason why my ideas about Degas and women have changed: it seems to me rather sympathetic and caring."
Mr. Haacke says his recent work designing sets for a ballet in Berlin has given him a new outlook on Degas's sculptures of dancers, too. "They're not nudes presenting themselves to a voyeur," he says. "They are working women, dancers. I've gone to rehearsals and watched the dancers, and their physical strength and control, and the use of their bodies as a means of expression, is unbelievable. You see that in Degas."
He is struck in particular by Degas's famous bronze of a 14-year-old ballerina wearing an actual muslin tutu and a silk ribbon around her hair. "The bronze figure pretends to be a real human while the tutu and ribbon are, in fact, the real stuff," Mr. Haacke says. "I don't know how to express it perfectly, but the relationship between reality and representation becomes complicated. The real world and the fictive world mingle. It's the precursor to the collages of Picasso and to the Dadaist ready-made."
The mingling of art and the real world has an obvious relevance to Mr. Haacke's work. "There is a tendency to sequester, to ghettoize art, to separate it from the world that we actually inhabit," he says. "But Degas, here, is breaking down the barriers."

Another Day in Battle Of the Blazing Faxes

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Day 69 of the National Hockey League lockout passed without further negotiations, but the two sides kept busy by firing up their fax machines for another bout of battling memos.
Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, sent a letter to Commissioner Gary Bettman yesterday, reiterating the union's opposition to a payroll tax of any kind and its belief that sufficient concessions had been made on other issues to make the tax unnecessary. 
 The league, meanwhile, circulated communication among its teams indicating that the union either misunderstood or was misrepresenting its latest proposal.
The league formally canceled the All-Star Game, which was supposed to be held on Saturday, Jan. 21, in San Jose, Calif. So far, it has canceled 24 games of each team's 84-game schedule. To salvage at least a 40 or 50-game season, they need an agreement around the end of December.
No further negotiations are expected before the league's Board of Governors meets on Monday in New York. Until then, everyone can keep busy by reading from the blizzard of literature that is gushing from N.H.L.P.A. headquarters in Toronto and from league headquarters in Manhattan.
Although the union missive was sent by Goodenow to Bettman yesterday, it is likely to find its way to the desks of owners, either through Bettman or through union representatives on the respective teams who also were sent copies.
There are some on the union side who feel Bettman hasn't kept owners fully informed on union concessions because they feel Bettman is too committed to a luxury tax that would function as a salary cap. There also are some on management side who feel Goodenow has kept his membership less informed than it needs to be about management needs and demands.
In five pages, the union letter restates what the union calls concessions it made regarding free agency, arbitration and a rookie salary cap during recent weeks of bargaining. It repeats the union's opposition to a salary cap in any form, including a luxury tax on payrolls or a "contribution," as Bettman called it when he presented it to the union on Tuesday in Chicago. That presentation led to the latest recess in the talks.
"I am writing to express our concern over your decision to derail the progress we have made," Goodenow said in the letter. He said the other concessions were made to create a "drag" on salary inflation as an alternative to a "tax/cap system" Bettman seeks.
Yesterday's management letter, sent by the senior vice president Jeffrey Pash to all teams, said the union "is either misrepresenting the proposal or does not understand it, neither of which is encouraging," according to people who have seen the letter.
Referring to a Wednesday union memo, which was widely circulated in hockey circles, Pash wrote, "The exaggerated attack on the new proposal contained in the union memorandum ignores key elements of our proposal and appears to be a scare tactic to prevent a reasoned analysis of the plan."
Pash said that the impact of the tax is less than that claimed by the union.

Player Proposal to Seek Partnership

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The emphasis in the new proposal the players will present to the owners on Saturday is on cooperation between the two sides, people familiar with the plan said today.
"We certainly can use that," one management official said. 
 But with the owners less than a week away from the new date for setting into motion their impasse/ implementation strategy, the No. 1 question about the players' proposal is will the owners abandon their hard stance on player salaries and opt for cooperation over instant economics.
"This proposal addresses the owners' stated concerns," Craig Fenech, an agent from New Jersey, said after the union's meeting with agents. "It should provide a basis for satisfying them. But I think they have an agenda. A number of owners want to try replacement players. I expect they're going to implement. I think we're headed to a last-man-standing scenario."
Union officials again declined to disclose details of the proposal they will unveil to the owners Saturday in Rye Brook, N.Y. Others have said the proposal contains a tax on club payrolls. One agent emerged from the four-and-a-half-hour meeting and said the agents were told the tax would be a scale of 4 percent to 6 percent. Two other agents said they were not given specifics. They also said union officials told them not to disclose what they were told.
At that level of tax, the players moved well off the approximately 1.5 percent tax they had proposed in September that the owners quickly rejected. The owners didn't bother finding out, but the union at the time did not seem prepared to go beyond 2 percent.
But their new rate is still worlds away from the owners' tax proposal, the alternative they presented to the salary cap they really want, that calls for a limitless tax and this year, had it been in full effect, would have cost the Detroit Tigers 77 percent of their top-rated payroll, or nearly $44 million.
The players, however, prefer to emphasize the value of a cooperative effort between them and the owners. They believe such a venture would generate enough revenue for the clubs to make them forget about restraining salaries.
Approximately $70 million of the money generated by the players' proposal would be distributed among the lower-revenue clubs the owners want to help financially. That's the amount the owners targeted in the revenue-sharing plan they adopted last January. To reach that $70 million figure, the union would determine what tax rate would be necessary to apply to the clubs' payrolls.
Other money, an agent said, would be used to finance the cooperative venture in such areas as licensing and marketing, international enterprises and local promotion.
"There are aspects of cooperative endeavors," Donald Fehr, the union head, acknowledged after the meeting.
The plan would not necessarily mean the players would join in the selection of a commissioner or serve on committees negotiating such matters as a national television contract. But they would have some input into some decision-making.
Tony Attanasio, a California agent, applauded the "partnership attitude" reflected in the proposal.
"For those who have a preconceived notion of implementation, I don't think it will do anything," said Attanasio, who earlier in the talks was one of the agents talking behind the scenes with owners. "But it shows the degree of imagination and intelligence needed to run this game as a business. It clearly and absolutely satisfies the suggestion that the players don't want to work with the owners for the betterment of the game."
Alluding to the three-fourths vote the owners need to ratify an agreement, he added: "If there are among the owners 21 people who have enough intelligence to see the philosophical modifications, to the extent they will see them, there should be a deal struck. If there are not 21 people, it would shock me that there are 21 dumb owners."
But again, Attanasio was talking philosophy and the owners have been talking economics. Would the players' proposal put a "drag" on salaries?
"I can assure you," the agent said, "the players' proposal will serve to satisfy, to a degree, what the owners have asked for and talked about for months."
Besides hearing about the proposal, in however specific or vague the terms, the agents discussed with union officials contract-signing both before and after implementation.
Attanasio said the union's view on having players sign before implementation is to consider each deal on its merits. Attanasio and Fehr said that post-implementation has to be discussed further by the union and the agents. "It was not resolved," Fehr said.
Unless negotiations are proceeding toward a settlement, the owners are scheduled to meet in Chicago next Thursday to act on declaring an impasse in the talks and implement their salary-cap proposal.

HEADLINE: Mostly Mozart And Its Players Reach Accord

 BODY:
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and a committee of musicians from the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra agreed on a three-year contract on Wednesday evening. The contract lays to rest the musicians' fears that Lincoln Center planned to kill Mostly Mozart, although the festival has been reduced to four weeks from seven. The contract must still be ratified by the orchestra.
The contract gives the musicians increased wages, benefits and seniority pay, as well as health and pension benefits. Neither the union nor Lincoln Center would discuss the details of the increases, but under the last contract the musicians' minimum weekly pay was $1,165 for a total of nine rehearsals and concerts per week. The contract also provides for the orchestra to continue post-season concerts in Tokyo and for special concerts during the year. 
 Mary Landolfi, the vice president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents the orchestra, said that although the new contract guaranteed the musicians less work than the previous contract, the union considered the new guarantees firmer, since in the past Lincoln Center was obligated to pay only supplementary unemployment benefits if the festival was shorter than six weeks.
The 1995 festival -- the 29th season of Mostly Mozart -- is scheduled to run from July 24 through Aug. 19.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Nobody's At Home

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In the month since the election we have been waiting to see whether Bill Clinton could recover from the defeat and emerge a stronger person and President. As of now, the answer looks to be no.
Weakness and vacuity are what we see in the Clinton Administration. It moves from day to day, empty of vision, a Government without a design. Mr. Clinton himself seems more and more like Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, a dwindling, haunting presence in the White House. 
 There was a telling example of the way things are in the Administration's change of policy last week on Bosnia. It gave up the effort to have NATO press the Serbian aggressors by serious attacks, giving way to British and French objections.
The New York Times published a detailed report on how the decision came about. It was proposed in a memorandum by the President's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, the story reported, and "formally embraced at a meeting of the President's top advisers that neither Mr. Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore attended."
Mr. Clinton had approved the Lake memo, the report said, but he "was at his Camp David retreat and had been involved only sporadically in the Bosnian issue." So he hardly participated in the discussion of a decision that has fateful implications for resistance to aggression and genocide in Europe and for the future of the Western alliance.
And then Secretary of State Christopher, at a NATO meeting in Brussels, proclaimed that the alliance was in wonderful shape. "NATO is going to make itself relevant to the future," he said. It had stronger structures that would "help deal with crises like Bosnia at an earlier stage." Sure.
The truth is that the Clinton Administration has no meaningful policy now on Bosnia, or on the other religious-ethnic-nationalist conflicts that menace Europe. And its policy on Russia, once its proudest boast, has been undone by President Yeltsin's increasingly nationalist stance.
All this is not just a bad patch for Bill Clinton in foreign policy. It is a frightening absence of American strategy and American will: the two factors that kept the peace in Europe for nearly 50 years.
On the domestic side there is a similar sense of emptiness. Does anyone count on President Clinton to lead the fight against mean-spirited actions by the Republican leadership in Congress? Can anyone detect in him commitment to a set of political values? There are values to defend at this time, Lord knows: values just as traditionally American as the ones the Republicans talk about. A commitment to civil liberties, for one. A concern for the underdog, for the stranger at the gates.
Immigration is a crucial example. A growing nativism is using legal and illegal immigrants as scapegoats for economic troubles. Many Republicans in Congress are talking about a Federal version of California's Proposition 187.
Last week The Washington Post carried a powerful article decrying the anti-immigrant movement. Was it by a Clinton Administration official or some other leading Democrat? No, it was by William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican. During the week another important voice opposed Proposition 187 on the Federal level: Senator Alan Simpson, the conservative Republican from Wyoming.
Since the election Mr. Clinton has made no effort to counter the radical Republican line that government is evil -- no effort to remind Americans how much they need government. To the contrary, he has mimicked Republican ideas on budget-cutting and spending more on defense.
To write critically about the President is not easy for me. He has done many good things, from Haiti to GATT, and has not had the credit he deserves. He has been savaged by a brutal opposition and by a press that even Newt Gingrich says has been "very tough on the President and on Mrs. Clinton."
But Bill Clinton faces a fundamental test now, and he is not meeting it. After the election commentators said he might rally to smite the enemy like Harry Truman; how unlikely that prospect seems today. If he is going to be President, he has to pull himself together and make some major changes in his Administration. I think he has no more than a month or two to convince us that he can govern.

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif.

 BODY:
Like the rest of the state, Monterey County favored Proposition 187, which denies education and health services to undocumented workers and their families. The clear message of the vote statewide, pundits say, is that we need to do something about illegal immigration.
But as seen from Salinas, the only thing clear is that political leaders like Gov. Pete Wilson, who offered Proposition 187 as a solution, are hypocritical at worst and wrongheaded at best. They actually send a different message, one that puts food on the table: "Hay trabajo en Salinas" -- there's work in Salinas. Keep trekking across the border and up through the Central Valley; at the end of the journey, si, hay trabajo. 
 Everybody knows that the fields of lettuce, broccoli, mustard greens and grapes are filled with illegal laborers. Farm workers put the number at 40 percent, the growers at 33 percent.
Voters would think Governor Wilson wanted to get rid of some of these Mexican workers, but in an appearance at the Heritage Foundation in Washington on Nov. 18 he supported the idea of inviting even more into the country as part of a guest worker program. "It makes sense -- it has in the past, it may well continue to do so in the future," he said, explaining that only workers but not their families would be allowed in.
Instead of penalizing a multibillion-dollar industry that hires undocumented workers, he supports it and picks on schoolchildren instead. Now, Newt Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, and others say they will support similar legislation in the G.O.P.-controlled Congress.
Proposition 187 doesn't matter to the illegal workers picking lettuce in Fresno and oranges near San Diego. They come north not for health care or the schools but for jobs, and Proposition 187 does nothing to prevent employers from hiring them. As long as there's work, they'll stay; family and friends will follow, even if they are denied services.
Growers say with a straight face that they hire illegal workers unwittingly, that they are easily fooled by fake Social Security cards. But no one is likely to discover the fraud: only one Immigration and Naturalization Service official in San Jose is in charge of checking up on employers in a four-county area.
Never any problems in Salinas, said Ed Angstadt, president of the Grower-Shipping Vegetable Association of Central California. Everyone turns a blind eye. The immigrants keep coming. Why not? Hay trabajo.
Mr. Wilson blames the Feds for failing to enforce the law -- an easy out. If he was serious about controlling immigration, Proposition 187 would have focused on the employers.
"We need all those people," said Mr. Angstadt, explaining that the growers' association kept silent on Proposition 187. "You can't take a position against people you rely on to work for you. On the other hand, you don't want to offend the Governor."
It's easy to see why. As a Senator, Pete Wilson made sure the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it easy for foreign workers to become citizens. Now he proposes adding to their numbers.
"All those people" Mr. Angstadt cites keep wages down. A field worker gets $1.23 for picking 24 heads of lettuce -- some 15 percent less than the piece rate 10 years ago. Growers sell that box of lettuce for $8 to $10. Imagine how profit margins will widen even further if we invite more Mexicans into the fields.
"All those people" make it impossible for unions to organize for better wages and working conditions. Too many field workers fear that supporting a union will get them deported, and union contracts are nearly as scarce as immigration agents.
Mexican-Americans must compete for jobs with "all those people" who are their desperate brothers from the south. As a result, unemployment here has increased; to no one's surprise, crime has followed.
Last year, the voters in Salinas and elsewhere started looking around for someone to blame for crime and unemployment. There are too many people here, a beleaguered Mr. Wilson told them, and his ratings jumped. But instead of trying to cut off the lure of jobs, he chose to throw children out of school and turn the sick away from doctors.
Proposition 187 provides no answer to real concerns about immigration, but it did provide a banner under which politicians like Pete Wilson can advance their careers. While they play on the fears of frustrated Americans, Mexicans will choose reality: hay trabajo en Salinas.

HEADLINE: Plans to Trim Government Reach Deep Into Benefits

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Leaders of a Federal panel studying the cost of Government benefit programs have suggested far-reaching changes, including an increase in the age at which people qualify for Social Security and Medicare, reductions in Social Security payments to affluent people and new limits on tax deductions for the wealthy.
 These and other options are to be discussed at a meeting of the panel on Friday. The panel, created by President Clinton in November 1993, is headed by Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri. 
The proposals are not intended to balance the Federal budget, but seek to hold the budget deficit to its current share of the nation's economic output, 2.3 percent, through the year 2030.
 Mr. Kerrey, the chairman of the commission, and Mr. Danforth, the vice chairman, are trying to muster support for their ideas among the other 30 members of the panel. The proposed changes are so broad and so politically explosive that the Senators appear unlikely to win support from a majority of the commission for the entire package, but they are finding support for many elements.
 Clinton Administration officials have been briefed on the proposals. Without endorsing any specific option, Mr. Clinton's budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, said today: "The Kerrey commission is playing an extremely useful role. It's focusing attention on the big problems of the next century."
 The panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, will submit its final report to the President and Congress by the end of this month, just in time to influence deliberations in the next Congress, which convenes on Jan. 4.
 Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders of Congress have said they will not touch Social Security next year, though many experts say some changes are needed to shore up the finances of the program over the next 35 years. Robert E. Denham, the chairman of Salomon Inc., who is a member of the commission, said the necessary changes would be far more painful if Congress deferred action.
 Ninety percent of the proposed reductions in the Federal budget deficit would be achieved through cuts in the growth of Federal spending. The remainder would come from higher taxes.
 To make the plan politically palatable, Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Danforth propose cutting the pensions for members of Congress by 40 percent. But the commission includes five people who are retiring from Congress, so this proposal may encounter opposition.
 The plan also includes these options, for which Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Danforth are seeking support:
 *Gradually increase the age at which workers may qualify for Medicare and may retire with full Social Security benefits.
 *Reduce Social Security benefit payments to more affluent retirees by changing the formula used to calculate benefits. The commission says this would make the formula "more progressive."
 *Establish a test of financial need for all Government benefit programs except Social Security and Medicare. This could reduce farm subsidies, unemployment compensation and some veterans' benefits for recipients with high incomes.
 *Impose new limits on the value of itemized tax deductions that may be taken by people in the higher income brackets. This would raise taxes for couples with incomes exceeding $92,000 a year.
 Another proposal would let workers take part of their current payroll taxes and invest it in a private retirement plan. These people, presumably those with average and above-average incomes, would receive lower Social Security benefits in the future, reducing outlays from the Social Security trust fund.
 The panel said that Government benefits like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps now accounted for 47 percent of all Federal spending and would account for 58 percent in the year 2003. These figures do not include interest on the Federal debt, an irrevocable commitment that accounts for 14 percent of all Federal spending.
 Commission members generally praised Mr. Kerrey for his efforts. One, Thomas J. Downey, a former Democratic Representative from Long Island, said, "Kerrey should be given credit for reaching out and offering some bold initiatives."
 Another member of the panel, Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an expert on antipoverty programs, said, "The package as a whole includes so many controversial elements that I doubt you could get a majority for it on the commission."
 But many of the proposals are worthwhile, Mr. Greenstein said, adding, "It's not an all-or-nothing proposition."
 Mr. Kerrey's recommendations on Social Security are similar to those made in April by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, lost his bid for re-election last month, but is still a member of the commission.
 Workers may now retire with full Social Security benefits at the age of 65. This "normal retirement age" will rise gradually under current law, reaching 67 for people born in 1960 or later. The commission is considering proposals to accelerate this increase and perhaps to raise the retirement age even further, to 68 or 70.

Corporate Foe of Apartheid Finds Reward Elusive

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Dec. 8

 BODY:
After a decade of corporate homage to the anti-apartheid movement, Pepsi-Cola expected to enter South Africa in political and commmercial triumph -- the liberation soft drink.
 Unlike its arch-competitor Coca-Cola, which kept its brand in the South African market during years of trade sanctions against white domination, Pepsi pulled out in 1985 and stayed away until this year, when the black majority won the right to elect its own Government. 
When Pepsi returned, it came as a paragon of black economic power.
 The majority shareholders in the franchise are African-American celebrities like Whitney Houston, Danny Glover and Shaquille O'Neal, who plan to transfer ownership to black South Africans gradually. The company, called New Age Beverages, is managed by South African blacks. The work force is predominantly black, and the delivery men are all black drivers who have set themselves up as independent contractors with loans from Pepsi.
 But rather than being lionized as a hero of the struggle, Pepsi has become its latest target. Every day since September, hundreds of protesters have assembled outside the new bottling plant in Germiston, a Johannesburg suburb, demanding jobs that Pepsi says are already filled.
 The protesters have blocked delivery trucks and clashed with the police. They have stormed the property, on one occasion stampeding into a barbed-wire fence. Several protesters were injured in that incident, and the demonstrators say one woman died of her wounds.
 The job-seekers have been unbudged by the entreaties of local officials, who fear the attacks on Pepsi will alarm other companies contemplating a return to South Africa.
 Besides the obvious causes of the protest -- that South Africa has a black unemployment rate of about 50 percent, that a culture of protest has flourished in the absence of normal democracy -- the managers of the company draw another, bitter lesson: that a social conscience confers no immunity.
 In fact, said Monwabisi P. Fondeso, president of New Age Beverages, the company may be a victim of its own political correctness. By trying to identify so closely with the cause of South Africa's blacks, he says, Pepsi may have created an impression that it sees itself as a social program rather than a business.
 The job-seekers say they initially gathered because they heard -- through Pepsi's own saturation promotion campaign -- that a big, well-paying international company was opening shop.
 At first, Pepsi played along, meeting with representatives from the factory gate and even allowing the protesters to fill four of its $2.65-an-hour jobs by plucking identity cards, lottery style, from a cardboard box.
 But the swarm of job-seekers grew, and the demands became more insistent. The company said the job-seekers at the gate could submit applications like anyone else.
 The protesters' angriest indictment of Pepsi is that the company has been "poaching" experienced workers from Coca-Cola and other beverage companies, rather than hiring unskilled workers and training them.
 "The company was not creating jobs for the unemployed," said Norman Nxasano, chairman of an impromptu job-seekers' committee. "It was a relocation of workers from one place to another place."
 The company replies that it needs skilled bottlers to regain a foothold in a $1 billion market that is virtually a Coke monopoly. While Pepsi disappeared from South Africa, Coca-Cola licensed a South African company to continue selling its brand, and opened a plant in neighboring Swaziland to supply the market.
 Mr. Fondeso said that Pepsi, as a black-owned company, is supposed to be "more humane, understanding. We're supposed to be perhaps more empathetic."
"I think we are all these things," he added, "but we are also, first and foremost, a business."
 Mr. Nxasano said the jobless know of Pepsi's efforts to promote black control, but they expect more.
 "To prove that they are a good company, they must prove that here in South Africa," he said. "As we are here, the company must employ us."
 To job-seekers like Colbert Mkhabele, out of work for more than two years, the months-long vigil outside the Pepsi gates makes perfect sense. Prior to Pepsi's return, he said, he spent his days drifting from factory gate to factory gate without hope. Pepsi seems like a better gamble.
 For one thing, he said, the job-seekers do not believe that Pepsi has no more jobs. But even if it is true at the moment, the company will probably expand. Pepsi, after all, had a third of the cola market when it pulled out nine years ago. And by the protesters' logic of fair play, those who showed up first at the gate are entitled to preference.
 "We must stay here until we get a good result," Mr. Mkhabele said.
 William Rankwe, another supplicant at the Pepsi gate, added, "If they don't compromise, well, there are many ways to kill a cat."
 As for other companies considering investments in South Africa, the protesters say, they are welcome -- as long as they play by the new rules. The job-seekers, who are trying to link up with other organizations of the unemployed, say they want a Government code of conduct that would include a mandate to hire the neediest people and train them.
 "If other companies from the West come and they don't do what Pepsi has done, then no problem," said Alfred Maruapula, another of the job-seeking throng. "As long as they can hire people from the gate, there won't be any problem."

HEADLINE: Link Sought In Sicknesses At 2 Colleges

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Hundreds of college students have fallen ill with nausea, diarrhea and vomiting at Dartmouth College and Harvard University, and Federal epidemiologists are trying to discover if there is any connection between the two outbreaks.
 The first illnesses were reported last weekend at Dartmouth, in Hanover, N.H., when more than 100 students were afflicted. It came at the worst possible time for many of them, during last weekend before final examinations. 
A similar sickness struck many freshmen here at Harvard on Tuesday night. Since then more than 200 students have complained of vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and dehydration.
 Two doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta came to Harvard Yard to investigate possible causes of the outbreak.
 Doctors and health officials at both colleges are trying to learn whether the symptoms were brought on by a common source, like food poisoning or contaminated water, or by a highly contagious virus.
 They are also trying to determine if there has been any recent contact between Harvard and Dartmouth, like intramural sports.
 So far, said Joe Wrinn, a spokesman for Harvard, "We haven't been able to establish any link."
 Harvard sent written surveys to its students. At Dartmouth, where every student must have a computer, the medical surveys were sent out via electronic mail.
 No common origin of illness has been found at either college. Investigating the possibility that the illness was caused by food poisoning, Harvard temporarily closed the Freshman Union, where many freshman eat, and sent samples of 40 different kinds of food to laboratories for testing.
 Michael Luo, 18, a freshman at Harvard, went to the Freshman Union on Tuesday night and ate pork chops, fusilli, a grilled cheese sandwich and some milk. Later that night he woke up sick.
 "It was really violent," Mr. Luo said. "It wasn't a pleasant experience."
 Many of Mr. Luo's classmates missed their economics test the next day.
 Doctors and nurses worked through the night at Harvard's Stillman Infirmary, which treated more than 150 students.
 When Shirin Sinnar, a 17-year-old freshman, arrived at the infirmary on Wednesday morning, there were no beds left. She spent the day on a cot in a nearby library. Ms. Sinnar said that many sick students did not eat at the Freshman Union.
 "We had all eaten at different places," she said. "One of us ate at the Union, one of us ate at Hillel, and one of us skipped dinner."

HEADLINE: Western Europeans Cast A Cautious Line Eastward

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ESSEN, Germany, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Smarting from their setbacks in Bosnia and Russia's criticism of overtures to the east, leaders of the 12 nations in the European Union will offer Eastern European countries a tentative road map to membership at a two-day summit meeting that begins here on Friday, diplomats say.
 With their meeting overshadowed by recent discord with the United States over the failed United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the European leaders are expected to try to avoid open disputes. 
There are differences among them nonetheless.
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who sought $8.5 billion in grants and loans over the next five years to help central and eastern European countries prepare for membership, had to settle for $6.6 billion, officials said.
 France, supported by Spain, Portugal and Italy, was unwilling to accept the higher sum unless the group also increased aid to North African and Mediterranean countries to $6.6 billion, more than the Germans and other northern Europeans wanted to provide.
 The split reflects growing anxiety in France that the European Union, which will expand to 15 members next month when Finland, Sweden, and Austria join, has been dancing too much to Germany's tune.
 Germans view instability in Eastern Europe as the greatest threat to security; France and other southern European countries are more anxious to prevent the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa.
 The president of the European Union's executive commission, Jacques Delors, called NATO's decision last week to spell out terms for prospective members by the end of next year premature.
 NATO allies agreed that it would be years before any Eastern European countries could qualify for membership, and reaffirmed their desire to develop relations with Russia to avoid "new lines of partition." But the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, and President Boris N. Yeltsin denounced the overture nevertheless as a threat to Russian interests.
 Mr. Delors said the European Union would be more cautious, but impatient Eastern Europeans view it as too slow.
 Only at the last minute was Mr. Kohl able to obtain French approval to invite leaders of six Eastern European countries here on Saturday. The six countries, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, have "association" agreements with the European Union.
 These six countries will be offered a "structured dialogue" as the union spells out guidelines for transforming their formerly Communist economies to become part of the free market. The six will be free to trade with Western Europe in the meantime, though there will be limits on how much steel, coal, textiles and clothing -- their most competitive products -- they can sell.
 Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London, said he would be "very surprised" if any eastern countries were admitted before "several years" after 2000.
 "Platitudinous statements about how we love them all very much and want them in very much" will be more common at the summit talks than concrete proposals to get them ready, he said.
 Mr. Portes and five other leading European economists proposed a European Union secretariat for the six associate members, a suggestion rejected by officials of the group as a needless layer of bureaucracy.
 France and then Spain will hold the rotating six-month presidency of the union next year, and they are not expected to push the issue of membership for the Eastern Europeans.
 Mr. Delors said he also wanted the leaders to adopt a five-point plan here to combat unemployment; more than 17 million people in the 12 countries are out of work.
 His proposals to allow the group to issue bonds to finance vast road and rail projects were rejected by finance ministers last week.
 Most members agree in principle that the best way to reduce unemployment is to cut back on the social benefits that make it highly expensive for employers to hire workers in Western Europe. But all have found it difficult to get labor unions and legislatures to agree on cuts.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Miami Summit Talks, U.S. Comes Under Fire

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 8

 BODY:
As they began arriving here today for a huge summit meeting, President Clinton and other Latin American leaders were no doubt relieved that negotiators had resolved a series of sharp disagreements over how quickly to establish a vast liberalized trade zone in the Western Hemisphere.
 But despite general agreement about the desirability of lowering barriers to trade, which is to be the centerpiece of the first Western Hemisphere summit meeting since 1967, there were plenty of signs already that Latin American officials remain skeptical of United States intentions on trade. 
Only after heavy Latin pressure, for example, did the United States agree to set a date for concluding talks for a free trade pact for the Americas -- and the date was 2005, well into the future. In addition, the target date was for finishing the talks, not for actually lowering the trade barriers themselves.
 For years, Washington has beseeched Latin American countries to open their markets to American products, and in the last few years they have. In the last decade, Latin American nations have slashed trade barriers and made the region the fastest growing United States export market in the world.
 It used to be that Latin American leaders were wary of Yankee free traders. Today they suspect that it is the United States that is losing its historical free trade zeal and is more interested in protecting its own markets from such imports as Costa Rican garments, Colombian flowers, Argentine steel and Brazilian orange juice and shoes.
 "Instead of signing a declaration of generalities, we should be setting a date to start the hemispheric free trade zone," said Bolivia's American-educated President, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.
 American trade policy is crucial to Latin America because the United States is the largest trading partner for every nation in the area except Cuba.
 American companies have doubled sales in a decade, making Latin America the only region where the United States enjoys a trade surplus. By the end of the 1990's, the United States expects to export more to Mexico than to Japan, and more to Latin America than to Western Europe.
 But the opening has exacted a price. In two years, Latin America's global trade deficit has doubled to $20 billion. Latin leaders complain that the Clinton Administration is dragging its feet in opening United States markets in keeping with its pronouncements in favor of free trade zones.
 "The Latin leaders feel in a way that they have been double-crossed," said Sebastian Edwards, a Chilean who is the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America. "The trade liberalization has been the most traumatic in history. But these guys opened up in exchange for nothing."
 Clinton Administration officials retort that few issues have drawn the President's attention as free trade. In the last year, he has won Congressional approval of the vast global trade pact known as GATT and of the North America Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, and has set a goal of a free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020.
 Before arriving here this evening, Mr. Clinton signed legislation to approve GATT. "Some say the answer is to try to just hunker down within our borders," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Washington. "That is clearly not an option. No country can escape the global economy."
 This weekend, Mr. Clinton and 33 leaders of the region are to issue a declaration resolving "to begin immediately to construct 'the Free Trade Area of the Americas' in which barriers to trade and investment will be progressively eliminated." Looking at the open-ended timetable, some Latin Americans joke, "Engaged -- without a date for the wedding."
 This week, economists reported the impact of Latin America's largely unilateral tariff cuts, amounting to 80 percent over the last decade. In November, Brazil recorded a trade deficit of imports over exports of $600 million, its first monthly trade deficit since 1987. In the first nine months of 1994, Argentina's trade deficit hit $4.3 billion, more than double last year's level.
 On the defensive, Administration officials say they have not lost the free trade faith. "From the U.S. side, we feel that we opened unilaterally a long time ago," Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said in an interview. "The U.S. is by far the most open economy in the hemisphere."
 Without waiting for the United States, Latin America's free traders have been so zealous that some say that New Year's Day could be renamed Latin America Free Trade Day.
 Starting Jan. 1, trade is to be duty free for 90 percent of commerce among Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Known as Mercosur in Spanish, this "market of the south" covers two-thirds of South America's economic activity. For most of the other third -- Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia --Jan. 1 marks the start of common external tariffs, ranging from 5 to 20 percent.
 Inside Mercosur, trade is already largely duty free.
 Jan. 1 also marks the start of a third free trade group -- Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. Known as the Group of Three, this group will erase all tariffs and quotas over the next decade.
 By next June, Latin diplomats plan to wind up talks for fusing the Southern Cone and Andean groups, creating a South America trade zone. By the end of the next year, Mercosur and the European Union are to start formal talks on a trade liberalization pact.
 "Converts often have more passion in any religion," said Elliott Abrams, who served as the top State Department official for Latin America in the Reagan years. "The Latin Americans are going gangbusters on free trade. There has not been one step back."
 Last year, Vice President Al Gore announced the Miami summit meeting in the heady days following Senate ratification of the free trade treaty with Mexico. But, critics charge, a year has seen the Administration retreat into generalities.
 No rules have been drawn up on joining the Nafta club. Sensing protectionist winds in Congress, the Administration withdrew legislation to give the President fast-track authority to negotiate free trade agreements and legislation to extend Nafta trade benefits to 15 Caribbean countries.
 "It's up to the United States to set the rules of Nafta accession," said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy forum on hemispheric relations. "Without a date, it's flat."
 This Sunday, Mr. Clinton is expected to invite Chile to start negotiations about joining Nafta.
 So far, for the Latins, the primary benefits of their trade openings have been more efficient economies and a boom in intra-regional trade. Growing twice as fast as Latin exports to the United States, intra-Latin trade has tripled, growing from 10 percent of regional trade a decade ago to 25 percent today.
 In an odd convergence of interests, American protectionists play into the hands of Brazilian manufacturers.
 With Latin America's largest manufacturing base, Brazil wants to emerge as a kind of queen bee of a South American free trade zone. This year, for the first time, Brazil is exporting more to Latin America than to the United States. Eighty percent of Brazil's exports to Latin America are manufactured.
 Profiting from shorter shipping distances and shorter letters of credit, Brazilian manufacturers believe that delays in expanding Nafta will give them more time to establish supply lines, credit lines and consumer loyalties throughout South America.

HEADLINE: A Message to Bosnians;
Allied Talk of a U.N. Withdrawal Warns The Combatants They Risk All-Out War

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The highly publicized plans for a big NATO operation to withdraw United Nations troops from Bosnia carry a blunt message to the belligerents: Stop fighting a buffered, low-level war or risk an all-out war.
But any withdrawal of the more than 24,000 United Nations troops in Bosnia is almost certainly several months away. "The watershed will be next spring," Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the Balkans, said today. 
 Thus, rather than an announcement of an imminent withdrawal, the short-term goal of American and French statements this week about having tens of thousands of boys in green tanks ready to rescue the boys in white tanks has been to focus the minds of the nationalist politicians who destroyed Yugoslavia and took their people to war.
The presence of the United Nations force has almost certainly contributed to extending the Bosnian war. It has done so by keeping movements of front lines to a minimum, providing basic sustenance and offering Balkan politicians an instrument to maneuver beneath the avid gaze of the world's networks and newspapers.
The United Nations force account for 6 percent of the Croatian economy and most of the virtually nonexistent Bosnian economy. Remove the more than 35,000 United Nations personnel in Bosnia and Croatia, and the area's politicians may have a different agenda. To begin with, they will have to feed people.
The question now is: What calculations will these politicians bring to bear on the virtual ultimatum that has been presented?
The Serbs do not want NATO to come into Bosnia to help the evacuation of the peacekeepers. They fear that to get United Nations troops out of the protected eastern Muslim enclaves of Zepa, Srebrenica and Gorazde, the NATO forces would have to carve out corridors, possibly with assistance from United States troops. Those corridors would come from Serb-held land. NATO might not be in hurry to give them back.
"If NATO or the United States want to assist the United Nations, then they should not approach Serbian territory," Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said today in an interview with Reuters. "We would not attack them, but if they approach Serb territory and are hostile to us, there would be a big war between us. There will be another Vietnam."
The Serbs are also concerned that they would also be more exposed to a NATO attack if they could no longer use peacekeepers as a shield.
To stop NATO from coming, the Serbs would therefore seem more likely to seek a minimum understanding with the United Nations forces. United Nations hostages are likely to be released; many have been already, and 67 more were freed today. The Serbs also allowed an aid convoy to reach Bihac for the first time in nine weeks.
At the same time, the Serbs may well maneuver to secure a permanent cease-fire and reopen talks on carving up Bosnia. They have 70 percent now and are said to be prepared to settle for about 50 percent, provided the map offered by the five-nation "contact group" is redrawn.
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government has mixed feelings about the departure of United Nations forces. On the one hand, they fear that a withdrawal would expose them to Serb attack. On the other, they would welcome NATO troops, provided they come to stay for a while and not merely to evacuate the United Nations troops.
Despite Bosnian hopes, Defense Secretary William J. Perry stressed today that the United States remained determined to avoid entanglement in the war. The Bosnian Government is aware of this. It also knows, as Mr. Perry said, that without the peacekeepers on the ground, "there would be more flexibility in the future for applying military leverage."
But the Bosnian Government would also pay a heavy price for a United Nations departure.
The eastern enclaves and Sarajevo would be acutely vulnerable. The Government has scant resources to feed its people. The army would put up a strong fight but would still face, at least initially, a huge Serbian superiority in tanks and artillery.
That is why the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said this week, "We asked the United Nations force to come, and we want them to stay." The statement was a victory of analysis over anger: the reluctance of United Nations commanders to call in NATO air power has repeatedly enraged the Bosnian Government.
But with NATO waiting in the wings, and the politics of the Republican Congressional leaders Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich offering not-too-distant hope, is the Bosnian Government worried enough about a United Nations departure to compromise?
Mr. Akashi hopes the answer is yes. But the compromises would be formidable.
The Government would have to accept the reopening of negotiations on the "contact group" map, the virtual independence of a Serbian entity within Bosnia, and the abandonment of its desire to inflict a battlefield defeat on Mr. Karadzic, who sent his militias to kill and evict several hundred thousand Muslims.
It is widely expected that there will now be great pressure on the Government from the United States to accept such compromises: financial incentives, promises of military support for the peace, and so on. Croatia, Bosnia's conduit for arms but its ally only up to a point in fighting the Serbs, is also seen as likely to push for a settlement.
Such pressure may carry the day. But it appears just as likely that the Muslim-led Bosnian forces will want to fight on. If so, the time will come when the United Nations threats, and the NATO plans, will have to be executed.
What then? "If we leave," Mr. Akashi said, "the suffering of civilians, particularly in the Muslim enclaves and in Sarajevo, may be of such tragic proportions that there would be a cry for a reintroduction of an international force, whether dressed in green or white."
He continued: "The conflict would sharpen and may spill out of Bosnia. Cleavages between the United States and Russia would be exacerbated. There would be a major destabilization of Europe."
A grim warning. But the slow agony of Bosnian over the last 32 months has also been grim and has suggested, increasingly, that if the United Nations stays, a half-hearted war may drag on for decades.

HEADLINE: For Guantanamo Refugees, Hope Fades as Time Passes

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL STATION, Cuba, Dec. 8

 BODY:
About once a week, one or two Cubans housed in refugee camps here attempt an escape back to the Cuban side, either by diving into a cove and swimming to the border or by sprinting for it.
Having risked their lives to leave their country in August by taking to the sea on flimsy rafts and boats, at least three refugees have already died trying to return. 
 Two drowned; the third detonated a land mine.
"I'm destroyed," said Ruben Martinez, 29, who has tried to escape twice to get back to his wife and 5-year-old daughter in Havana but was caught by American troops both times. "I've had time to think about my family and to realize there is nothing more important."
Although this American naval base has not experienced a disturbance as big or as violent as the one that injured more than 200 American soldiers in refugee detention camps in Panama today, it still houses large numbers of refugees desperate to return to normal lives after months in limbo, even if that means giving up dreams of going to the United States.
The Cuban refugees fled their country in boats and rafts last summer, many escaping worsening economic conditions; many Haitians who are also being housed here fled the relentless violence in their homeland. As Christmas approaches, many have become increasingly anxious as they realize, despite some encouraging signs, that they may remain in the camps indefinitely.
Five Cubans made their way into the base this week, asking for asylum, but more than 350 have sneaked out in recent months.
There are now 22,574 Cubans and 5,712 Haitians in Guantanamo but thousands have already left.
More than 15,400 Haitians, most of whom fled their country in July, returned to Haiti after the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in October. About 300 of them went back as "public safety volunteers" after receiving three weeks of training in crowd control and other police functions from the Justice Department.
"It's time for me to go," said Lucianor Phanord, 22, who is in another group of 250 Haitian trainees who are to leave on a Coast Guard cutter this month. "I want to go back and help my country."
Among the Cubans, about 8,000 people, including 2,700 to 3,000 children, are being interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization officials for possible release.
The screening began this week after Justice Department officials announced in a policy change that families with children would be individually reviewed to determine whether they should leave the camps on humanitarian grounds.
The first two families were released on Thursday and taken to Florida. Since October, more than 430 young, elderly or seriously ill Cubans have been admitted to the United States on humanitarian grounds. A small number of Haitians have been allowed to enter on similar grounds.
During a two-day visit to the camps by reporters this week, parents expressed frustration with the pace of the immigration process; only about 30 families had been interviewed by Thursday. Priority is being given to sick children, infants and pregnant women, said Maj. Rick Thomas of the Army, a spokesman at the base.
But many families recognized that their patience has paid off. Ania Rodriguez, 25, said she never lost hope: not when she boarded a boat to leave home with her two-month-old baby girl and 43 others, not when the Americans said absolutely no one held at Guantanamo would be allowed into the United States, not while waiting since Aug. 22 for some breakthrough.
While her situation is better than that of other refugees -- she has an air-conditioned room with a sink in a cinder-block house for pregnant women and mothers with infant children -- she still must bathe outdoors, dry baby clothes on concertina wire and live separated from her husband and her parents, who stay in tents and can only visit.
"Even if I'm the last one of the 14 mothers in the house to leave, I am relieved that something is happening," said Mrs. Rodriguez, who broke into tears while relating the story of her exile. "We could never return to Cuba. We left our home. We would have even less than we had before."
The policy changes in Washington have given hopes to others, making them stay put and wait for the United States, where most have relatives, or any other country to take them. Conditions in the camps have slowly improved, and in many of them there is a sense of permanence.
At three camps for single Cuban men, a recreation area with volleyball courts, a bowling alley and a theater stage has sprung up from the dust. A central tent shelters an exhibition of drawings and paintings, and a boisterous game of bingo, with cigarettes as the winnings.
There and elsewhere refugees spend their days listening to transistor radios, talking on the telephone with relatives in the United States (collect) and working. Jobs include handling refugees' mail, teaching in makeshift schools or seeing patients in health clinics.
Javier Martinez, 22, a car mechanic who starts his days jogging with the Marines, says he will stick it out for as long as it takes.
In the meantime, he works out and takes English classes. He sleeps in a tent with 15 other men, next to a night table made of cardboard and decorated with photographs from a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog.
"There are fewer and fewer of us left," he said. "The Cubans in Miami think our situation will be resolved soon."
In the two remaining camps for Haitians, the population has dwindled but continues to defy expectations that President Aristide would draw all of the refugees back to Haiti.
Conditions at these camps are starker than in some of the Cuban camps -- women with infants sleep on cots under tents and recreational services are few -- and more than 200 unaccompanied minors have not been allowed to enter the United States.
But many of those left say they are willing to endure the camps indefinitely. Some say they feel Mr. Aristide's term is too short and fear worse when he is gone. Most doubt assurances that it is safe to return.
While the Haitians are being encouraged -- some of them say forced -- to go home, there are long-range plans that assume a long stay for the Cubans.
Brig. Gen. Raymond P. Ayres Jr., who oversees the camps, said there are plans for centralizing schools, installing a sewage system and replacing tents with sturdier structures made partly of plywood and with electricity.
It currently costs the United States Government about $15 million a month to run the camps, he said.
Despite improvements, the camps are tough on many of the refugees. There have been 14 suicide attempts among the Cubans. Parents say their children have become aggressive and undisciplined, fighting with others and disobeying orders.
At Camp November, where about 260 men and 3 women who want to return to Cuba wait, there are threats of a mass escape if their pleas to leave are ignored. Of 1,000 Cubans who asked to be repatriated, only 203 have been allowed to go.
The American officials say the Cuban Government has been slow in processing the refugees. But Cuban officials in Washington said they need to check their identities.
The refugees say they never thought the United States would not welcome them, having accepted so many refugees in the past. Many say they feel deceived and want nothing to do with Americans.
"This has been a huge blow," said Ruben Martinez as he plotted his third attempt to escape through minefields. "I'm only 29 years old, and I will never believe anything anyone ever says again."

HEADLINE: Hemisphere Trade Talks Open; U.S. Hedges Its Hopes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight opened the first summit meeting of Western Hemisphere nations in nearly three decades, asking leaders of 33 nations to become "true partners for prosperity" with the United States.
But even as he and other leaders dined at the historic Biltmore Hotel here, Administration officials conceded that the United States was unable to get many other nations to agree to take far stronger collective action against money laundering, drug trafficking and threats against democratic governments. 
 American officials said that when the final communique is issued on Sunday by the 22 presidents and 12 prime ministers, it would not include language that Washington had sought committing the nations to "act as one" to "preserve and if necessary restore democratic rule." Many of the largest countries in Latin America declined to join the United Nations-authorized force sent to Haiti two months ago to oversee the transfer of power from military rulers to the country's elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The final communique also will not include a call to require financial institutions to report large transactions, which would help investigators spot drug traffickers. Instead, Washington settled for language saying governments will encourage banks to cooperate with investigators.
But despite these setbacks, Mr. Clinton and his huge delegation, which includes roughly half the Cabinet, argued today that the meeting marks a watershed in both economic and political cooperation.
In a speech today to Miami's business and political leaders, Mr. Clinton declared that "the so-called lost decade of Latin America is a fading memory" and that the region, with the exception of Cuba, had "freed itself from dictatorship and debt, and embraced democracy and development."
President Fidel Castro was the only leader not invited to the meeting, and Mr. Clinton got his longest applause today -- from an audience that included many Cubans -- when he said he hoped that at the next summit meeting, "a leader of a democratic Cuba will take its place at the table of nations."
But Mr. Clinton's aides were less forthcoming when they were asked why Cuba was the exception to the Administration's policy of "commercial engagement," under which it has pressed for broadened economic ties with countries like China and Indonesia that have also repressed dissent.
Michael D. McCurry, the State Department spokesman, told reporters that "Castro has put himself out of the summit" by refusing to make "permanent and lasting change," and said the Cuban leader had to "get with the program."
Most of Mr. Clinton's speech today, however, was a defense of his trade programs even as many Democrats are warning that the President is losing a key political constituency in blue-collar workers, who, polls show, feel that free trade is costing them jobs. Mr. Clinton argued that his strategy is the only one that will ultimately raise wages for American workers, saying those who produce export goods earn 17 percent higher wages than others.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that past efforts to link the hemisphere economically had failed, most recently after the 1967 talks in Uruguay, when President Johnson and a score of other leaders talked about a less ambitious customs union. It never happened, but Mr. Clinton argued that with the arrival of democracy, attitudes had changed.
"People have talked about free trade in this hemisphere for years," Mr. Clinton said. "It's been talked about and talked about. The difference is, here in Miami we have a chance to act, and we're going to take it."
Administration officials tried today to play down the muting of the communique, saying that the 34 nations had gone further than ever before in agreeing to cooperate on a number of issues -- from terrorism to the environment. "The true meaning of this is that the countries have agreed to make what used to be domestic issues a legitimate subject of international concern," a senior Administration official said tonight.
Nonetheless, the most recent draft of the communique restores the language used by the members of the Organization of American States, calling for "due respect to the principle of non-intervention."
Mr. Aristide, however, is one of the stars here. The Haitian President stopped today at an elementary school in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami and quickly attracted a crowd of 300 people, who came to cheer him and hear his message of reconciliation in Haiti.
When the working sessions begin on Saturday, members of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet will discuss more specific issues with their counterparts. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said earlier this week that he would use his talks to strengthen joint efforts against money laundering.
On economic issues, Mr. Clinton comes to Miami with far more leverage than he enjoyed last month, when he met Asian leaders in Indonesia for talks intended to set up a free trade area around the Pacific: For each of the major countries in Latin America, the United States is the No. 1 trading partner.
"The fact of the matter is that three-quarters of the countries here would join Nafta tomorrow morning if they could," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides said today, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement signed last year with Mexico and Canada. "But we do not think they are ready."
Mr. Clinton said today that the talks here could not have happened without Nafta, and on Sunday he is expected to announce that talks will begin next year to admit Chile to the accord.
Argentina is also eager to join, but a senior Administration official said "we're telling them that they have a ways to go" before the Argentines open their markets and improve labor and environmental laws sufficiently to gain the same preferential access to the United States market that Mexico and Canada now have.

Viacom Drops Plan for Florida Sports Park

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Viacom Inc. canceled plans today to build Blockbuster Park, a $1 billion entertainment and sports complex on the eastern edge of the Everglades.
The park would have become the home of two professional sports teams owned by the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation's founder, H. Wayne Huizenga. Its economic potential had been praised by civic leaders but environmentalists said it would hurt the nearby wetlands. 
 The decision came nearly two and a half months after Blockbuster was acquired by Viacom, which said the 2,500-acre entertainment complex did not fit its corporate strategy as a media company.
The company cited the project's high financial and management costs and a complex regulatory process involving Dade and Broward Counties and the City of Miramar.
"Personally, I'm disappointed the project will not be developed," Mr. Huizenga said. "I believed this was good for Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation and good for South Florida, but I appreciate the broader strategic context for this decision."
There has been speculation for weeks that Viacom would not proceed with the park. Viacom has about $10 billion in debt after buying Blockbuster and Paramount Communications this year. To pare that debt, the company is selling Madison Square Garden in New York and some cable television systems.
The plans for Blockbuster Park included sports arenas, a theme park, film and music studios, a virtual-reality amusement center, theaters, restaurants and retail stores.
The Florida Panthers hockey team and the Florida Marlins baseball team -- both owned by Mr. Huizenga -- would have played their home games at the park.
Viacom announced the cancellation of the project after the stock market closed. Its class A shares ended trading unchanged at $39.
The Blockbuster Park management team will now seek another use for about 1,000 acres already purchased for the park. "Hopefully, something could be salvaged from this project," Mr. Huizenga said.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Suggests Privatizing of Airports

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Having broken off negotiations with the Port Authority over renewing its leases at Kennedy International and La Guardia airports, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would explore turning the operation of the airports or the land under them to private hands.
 Mr. Giuliani, who as a candidate often raised the idea last year, said a decision to privatize the city's two airports had become more likely after months of negotiations to rewrite the leases to increase the city's revenues from the airports proved fruitless. 
 The Mayor's proposal won an important ally yesterday when Governor-elect George E. Pataki expressed support for selling the airports out from under the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Mr. Pataki said the leases contributed far too few revenues to the city.
 Mr. Giuliani's threat to privatize could be partly an attempt to pressure the authority to renegotiate its leases with the city on more favorable terms. Even as the Mayor raised the issue during an impromptu news conference in the hallway at City Hall, the authority's executive director, Stanley Brezenoff, called Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers to schedule a meeting next week to restart the stalled lease negotiations.
 So far, neither the Mayor nor the Governor-elect, who since the election has often been at odds with his fellow Republican, have formed detailed proposals on how to privatize the city's airports. Such proposals could take the form of selling the land now owned by the city outright or turning over the operations to a private company once the Port Authority's leases expire in 2015.
 As Governor, Mr. Pataki will appoint 6 of the authority's 12 commissioners -- with the other six named by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey -- and will thus have considerable influence over the authority's leases with the city.
 "My personal view is the Port Authority has been shortchanging the taxpayers of the City of New York for years," Mr. Pataki said in an interview. "I think the Mayor is 100 percent right."
 Negotiations between the city and the Port Authority collapsed two weeks ago with the Port Authority, a quasi-public interstate agency, refusing to agree to a number of proposals to increase the amount it pays the city for the use of the land under the airports in Queens.
 Under the terms of the lease, in effect since 1965, the payments vary according to the authority's profits, which derive from terminal rentals, parking revenue and flight fees. Over the last decade, the authority has paid the city nearly $600 million, but since last year the payment has dropped to the minimum amount specified in the lease, $3.1 million a year. With the authority undertaking sweeping renovations at the airports, however, the payment is not expected to increase much until the lease expires in 20 years.
 Mr. Giuliani called the $3 million "scandalously low" for the right to use two of the nation's busiest airports. In the city's budget, Mr. Giuliani proposed increasing the payment to $75 million a year.
Before the talks broke off, officials familiar with the negotiations said, the authority offered to accept a 50-year extension that would increase the payment to an average $55 million for each of the next five years, though the figure would drop significantly after that. The city, the officials said, insisted on larger payments in a shorter lease.
 The idea of selling the land under Kennedy and La Guardia has arisen before. In 1992, the City Council commissioned a study that suggested the city could raise $1.2 billion by selling the property outright.
 Barry Weintrob, the authority's chief financial officer, disputed the Mayor's remarks. He said the authority's payments had dropped because of the vast improvements now under way. He also said the benefits of privatization were overrated.
 "We've concluded it doesn't make economic sense," he said.
 Once the authority's lease expires, the buildings on the land -- and all the improvements to them over the years -- revert to the city's ownership. The threat of losing its lease could pose serious difficulties for the authority's long-term bonds, which are supported by the revenues from the airports.
 Echoing the Mayor and his aides, Mr. Pataki said he favored privatizing the airports even over renegotiating the leases with the Port Authority. He said a private owner would give the city a sizable purchase price, contribute to property taxes the authority does not now pay, and pour private resources into maintaining the terminals.
 Mr. Pataki said he and Mr. Giuliani had discussed the possibility at their breakfast meeting last week and would discuss it further. He said he also raised the issue of privatizing the authority's other airport, Newark International, with Governor Whitman.
 A spokesman, Carl Golden, said that Governor Whitman had not taken a position on a sale, but that a committee formed to study privatization in myriad areas would issue a report as soon as next week.

HEADLINE: South America's Big Trade Strides

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Spurred by free trade pacts at home, South American businesses are making giant strides toward transforming their continent into a single seamless market by the end of this decade.
Business ventures are growing across borders, as Latin American executives design regional strategies for banking, manufacturing, transportation and generating electricity that could present opportunities as well as obstacles for competitors from the United States. 
 As President Clinton meets with 33 Latin American leaders in Miami to discuss a timetable for liberalizing trade from Alaska to Argentina, free trade within South America is fast becoming a reality, shaking up more than the region's long-protected companies. South America's own emerging free trade zones have given Brazilian manufacturers a head start over North American exporters in the race to sell to one of the world's fastest-growing regions.
Consider Brahma, a Brazilian brewery that already sells half the beer drunk in Brazil. "The Brahma brand is too strong to remain bottled up inside Brazil," Marcel Herrmann Telles, Brahma's director general, said last week when he inaugurated a $100 million brewery in Argentina. In the last two years, the company has bought other breweries in Chile and in Venezuela.
"Our idea is to concentrate on Latin America," Mr. Telles said.
In the old, Balkanized South America, markets stopped at the frontier because government red tape, high tariffs, nationalism, bad roads and lack of communications prevented companies from expanding. While border delays endure, both governments and businesses increasingly are thinking regionally.
Starting Jan. 1, 90 percent of trade will be duty free within the four southern countries, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. This Common Market of the South -- Mercosul in Portuguese and Mercosur in Spanish -- accounts for two-thirds of South America's economic activity.
Most trade is already duty free among the Andean Pact nations of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. On Jan. 1, the five are forming a customs union by adopting common external tariffs, averaging about 14 percent. Negotiations on merging the two pacts into one, tentatively called the South American Free Trade Association, could be completed within six months.
Some North American businessmen say the transformation offers them an opportunity to focus on the broader Latin American market, rather than expend time and money on a single country.
"American companies down here are all developing Mercosul strategies," said Dolph Johnson, senior vice president for the Sao Paulo office of Spencer Stuart, a Chicago-based executive search firm. His own company set up in Argentina two years ago and plans to expand to Chile next year.
In September, General Motors inaugurated a $100 million plant in Argentina to build 25,000 Chevrolet pickup trucks for the broader Mercosul region. Regional manufacturing of Toyota, Mazda and Mercedes- Benz trucks is also to be concentrated in Argentina.
Within the four member countries of Mercosul, trade has already tripled since 1990 to $10 billion this year. Other South American nations are riding the free trade boom. Since 1988, Colombia has quintupled its trade with its two Andean Pact neighbors, Ecuador and Venezuela.
The most dynamic activity has been conducted between the two largest economies in South America, Brazil and Argentina, thanks to their common market. Last year, Brazil displaced the United States as Argentina's largest trading partner.
In the last four years, 320 Brazilian companies have set up offices in Argentina, investing a total of $1.5 billion. A Brazilian construction company, Encol, is building apartment buildings in Buenos Aires. A Brazilian paint company, Tintas Renner, is making paint in Argentina and in Uruguay.
In turn, Brazil, which used to rely on grain from the United States and Canada, will buy 70 percent of Argentina's wheat crop this year.
Bankers have been following businessmen across the borders. Last week, Banco Itau, one of Brazil's largest private banks, won permission from the Argentine Government to set up a banking affiliate called Banco Itau Argentina. In Brazil's first major foray into overseas retail banking, Itau plans to open in July with 35 agencies and 10 electronic banking centers, mostly in Buenos Aires.
"The Argentine market opened to foreigners at a time of extraordinary economic expansion," Roberto Egydio Setubal, Itau's president, recently told Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading business newspaper.
Three Chilean banks have also announced plans to buy Argentine banks. Chile's largest private pension fund, AFP Provida S.A., is investing in pension funds in Argentina, Colombia and Peru.
In a region of crackling phone lines and garbled faxes, some South American nations are also starting a multibillion-dollar fiber optic network. Last month, telephone company officials inaugurated the first leg, Unisur, which connects Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Capable of handling 25,000 simultaneous conversations and data transmissions, the 1,068-mile cable was furnished by a consortium formed by AT&T, Alcatel and Pirelli.
South American nations are also integrating their road, rail and energy networks.
In October, Brazilian authorities opened a $58 million energy conversion plant that will reconcile different electrical systems in Brazil and Argentina, allowing the two countries to swap power according to seasonal demand. Uruguay plans a similar $30 million plant next year to swap its own power with Brazil. And Chilean companies recently bought 30 percent of the electrical distribution network in Buenos Aires.
"Twenty years ago, when Chile and Argentina almost went to war, the Argentines were afraid that the Chilean Air Force would bomb El Chocon," Mr. Johnson recalled, referring to an Argentine hydroelectric project. "Now, the Chileans won't bomb it, because they own it."

HEADLINE: Mixed Day For Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities were generally mixed yesterday, with the longest maturities unchanged.
Despite the uncertainty still surrounding the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., Treasury prices firmed as the market looked ahead to next week and a new supply of inflation data. Prices of notes and bills fell sharply on Thursday as traders feared that some Wall Street firms might sell the government securities they hold as collateral for their loans to Orange County. 
 The municipal market was quiet yesterday in thin volume, with traders noting some firming of prices that had been soft for days.
Michael S. Appelbaum, a senior vice president and municipal bond specialist at Paine Webber Inc., said, "The tone was better as prices moved up slightly, with much emphasis still on year-end tax planning, as some investors engage in swapping on maturities, taking loss in the transaction to later realize a profit at maturity."
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues fell to 7.04 percent yesterday from 7.08 percent on Thursday. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
Although some analysts and traders have said there has been little trading of California issues since Orange County filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, Skeets Dunn, managing partner of J. C. Bradford & Company in Del Mar, Calif., said there had been many bids since the county's announcement. "For instance, general triple-A rated debt was bid at a price to yield 6.85 percent on Tuesday," he said. "On Wednesday, it was bid back to 7.15-20 percent and today we've seen trades, some of which were through 7 percent."
Mr. Dunn said there had also been activity from institutional investors in the buying of insured triple-A debt at the depressed prices.
The prices of some rated issues tied to Orange County, like the Irvine Ranch Water District, have risen in the last few days. For example, Mr. Dunn said, an 8 1/4 percent water district debenture due 2023 was at 99 3/4 yesterday, up from the high 80's on Wednesday and low 90's on Thursday.
In the Treasury market, the 30-year bond was unchanged yesterday at 9529/32 for a yield of 7.86 percent. A week ago the yield on the long bond was 7.91 percent.
Much of the bond market's early advances yesterday were generated by losses coming from the stock market and the strength of the dollar overseas.
But prices retreated later in the day as the market focused on familiar concerns about a pickup in inflation ahead of new inflation data next week. The Labor Department reports on producer prices in November on Tuesday and on consumer prices on Wednesday.
Worries about inflation were revived yesterday after a report from the University of Michigan showed consumers feeling more optimistic about the economy than at any time in nearly six years. In a preliminary report, the university's consumer confidence index, traders said, surged to 97.7 in December from 91.6 in November -- the highest reading since January 1989.
Although some economists say consumer confidence has only a weak correlation to consumption spending, combined with strength in the labor market and income growth, yesterday's data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise soon raise short-term interest rates for a seventh time since February.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Generally Steady, Slips Against Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady in subdued trading yesterday, slipping slightly against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
The dollar rose on Thursday, and some traders took profits yesterday. 
 In New York late yesterday, the dollar eased to 100.11 yen from 100.55 yen on Thursday. It was quoted at 1.5770 marks from 1.5773 marks.
"It is a Friday during December, and the market is very thin," said Richard Vullo, vice president at Hypobank. "We had some long dollar positions from yesterday. People took some profits today."
 The dollar climbed on Thursday as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve would soon raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time since February. Higher rates tend to attract dollar buyers by offering a better return on securities denominated in the currency.
 "There is an overall optimism in the U.S.," Mr. Vullo said."There is a sense of confidence in the Fed, and that is helping the currency because people are moving into U.S. assets again."
 Some currency dealers predict that the Fed will increase short-term interest rates by at least 50 basis points -- equal to a half percentage point -- at the Dec. 20 meeting of its policy-making committee.
 Traders said those hopes helped keep the dollar from slipping through the psychologically significant levels of 100 yen and steady above 1.5750 marks yesterday.
In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar weakened despite efforts by the Bank of Canada to prop it up by purchasing the Canadian currency for United States dollars.
The Canadian dollar has been weighed down this year by the heavy debt load of the country and the relative value of its securities to investments in the United States. Yesterday, there were rumors that major rating agencies would lower their ratings on the Province of Quebec.
 "Any time attention is drawn to debt, the Canadian dollar comes under pressure," said Amy Smith, an analyst for the consulting firm IDEA. "The Canadian dollar would get hurt because you would see a lot of selling of Quebec's debt."
The Canadian dollar slipped to 72.27 United States cents, from 72.38 cents on Thursday.
The British pound fell to $1.5595, from $1.5651 on Thursday. The dollar edged up to 1.3370 Swiss francs from 1.3366 Swiss francs.

Financial Survival in Tokyo

 BODY:
John Harlow (pictured right), a senior vice president with Korn Ferry, an international recruiting firm, recently returned to San Francisco after a four-year stint in his company's Tokyo office. Before he went, he had to consider the financial impact as well as the changes in quality of life for his wife, Carole, and his sons, John Junji, 11, and Ben, 10.
 Tokyo is an extremely expensive city. When he moved there is 1990, the cost of living was 79 percent higher than in the San Francisco area. To compensate, his company gave him a raise and agreed to pay many of the family's expenses. 
 Still, unpredictable exchange rates proved to be a problem. The value of the dollar fell by nearly a third during his stay in Tokyo. Substantial performace bonuses helped make up the difference, but if he had stayed any longer, he said, he would have sought an increase in pay.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Bargains Now Abound In Closed Equity Funds

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
EXXON is trading just above $61. Would you jump to buy it at $51? Or what if Merck, now about $37, could be had for $32?
Sorry, these deals are just pipe dreams. But closed-end funds offer the nearest thing. The funds, whose shares trade on exchanges like any stock, offer the diversification and management of regular mutual funds. But while the latter issue an unlimited number of shares priced at the portfolio's net asset value, closed funds issue finite shares that often trade at premiums or discounts to that value. 
 And, thanks to rising interest rates and year-end selling for tax purposes, discounts in the 535 closed funds are as common as Christmas trees. Not just in popular municipal-bond and single-country funds, either; many stock funds, foreign and domestic, look cheap. Yesterday, domestic stock funds had an average discount of 10.38 percent; in January, it was 4.5 percent.
"We recommend buying with both hands," said Peter Madlem, a money manager in Santa Barbara, Calif., and the editor of Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest (monthly, $200, 805 565-5651). Domestically, he likes Bergstrom Capital, a general equity fund selling for $84 a share -- an 11.16 percent discount to its $94.55 portfolio value. Internationally, he favors Templeton Dragon, a new Asia fund with a 15 percent discount.
But, he and others warn, do not just grab bargains. Be selective.
"Buy only if the discount is about 5 points more than its average" in past months, said Thomas Herzfeld, editor of Investor's Guide to Closed-End Funds (monthly, $325, 800 854-3863). Blue Chip Value's 12 percent discount exceeds its 1994 average of 5 percent, for example; it also surpasses similar funds' current average discount of 10.38 percent.
And view discounts through the lens of fund expenses, said Albert J. Fredman of California State University. Adams Express, a domestic equity fund, keeps expenses very low at 0.32 percent of assets. The fund's 12.7 percent discount, divided by the expenses, produces a "discount life" of 39.69. In a fund with the same discount and 1.5 percent in expenses, that value is 8.47.
Other things being equal, annual expenses would not eat up the discount on the first fund for nearly 40 years, compared with fewer than 9 years for the second. Mr. Fredman's rule: "More than 10 is good."
Most important, realize that investors can get burned by fire-sale prices. "If you buy a mediocre fund with a great discount and it stays mediocre, you're stuck," said Catherine Gillis, editor of Morningstar Closed-End Funds (twice a month, $195, 800 876-5005). Worldwide Value, a foreign equity fund, sells at a 19.6 percent discount for good reason, she said. Its net asset value has gained just 0.01 percent a year for five years.
The lesson? "Put the discount to the side, and ask first if it's a good fund," said Maria Scott of the American Association of Individual Investors. "If you're in for 10 or 20 years, even big discounts won't mean that much. And remember you may have to sell at a discount, too."
Mr. Madlem has fused the two variables of closed funds -- share price and net asset value -- into one rule. "If the current discount is high compared to the average discount, and the N.A.V. is improving, buy."
Ms. Gillis added that a discount's importance depended on one's aims. The discount on the Growth Fund of Spain, now 18 percent, has held fairly steady. But -- despite Spain's recent woes -- the well-managed fund has gained an average 4.7 percent in net asset value for three years. "Even if the discount stays constant, you'll do well long term if the N.A.V. keeps rising," she said.
For short-term profits, though, funds with volatile prices make more sense -- however their net asset values may behave.
No matter the goal, closed funds have their merits. They are the sole way to invest in some countries, Mr. Herzfeld said. His recent buys include Korea Equity (34.7 percent premium in February, 11 percent discount now) and the Austria Fund (13 percent premium in February, 11 percent discount now).
And some closed funds mirror open-end mutual funds -- except for the discounts. Templeton Developing Markets and Templeton Dragon are both run by the noted manager J. Mark Mobius -- but Dragon sports a 15 percent discount. Charles Royce, Barton Biggs and other open-fund managers also tend closed funds.
But closed funds can be dangerous. Never buy a fund's initial offering; it is usually overpriced. Avoid steep premiums. Be wary of thinly traded funds; prices can be volatile. To skirt taxes, do not buy this year until after fund distributions.
And realize that closed funds have two ways to win -- and two ways to lose. They are also hard to track. While share prices are listed daily with other equities, current discounts appear just weekly in a few papers. Only specialty sources list average discounts. And while closed funds issue quarterly and annual reports like companies, they issue prospectuses only for new shares.

HEADLINE: Pardon Me, Do You Have A Place to Buy a Rolls?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
This may be more than some stuck-in-the-tunnel motorists can take: soon there will be no one to borrow mustard from. The only Rolls-Royce dealer in New York City is closing.
 The dealer, Michael Schudroff, says that he is shutting down his showroom on East 61st Street near First Avenue after 25 years, a victim of the recession, "the pricing of these cars" -- in the $150,000 to $315,000 range -- and what he calls astronomical overhead. 
 "Rent, over a million a year," he said. Plus $60,000 a year for employee parking across the street, unquestionably a Rolls-sized dent in the budget. Plus the difficulty of taking customers out on test drives. "These cab drivers, they don't care if it's a truck or a beautiful piece of art like a Rolls," he said. "No respect. And the doors on a Rolls dent easily because they're aluminum."
 Also, demand for Rolls-Royces isn't what it used to be. In 1990, some 1,200 Rollses were sold in North America. But the worldwide market for Rollses and Bentleys declined precipitously in 1991 and 1992. In 1993, 355 cars were sold in North America; according to Robert Wharen, the managing director for Rolls-Royce for North and South America, this year's total should be slightly up at 375 cars.
 Mr. Schudroff expects to sell 35 cars this year in Manhattan. "Last year, I was No. 1 in America with 65," he said. "I used to sell close to 200. The business is just not there anymore."
 Mr. Wharen said, however, that he intends to find another franchisee for Manhattan.
 Mr. Schudroff's first step in leaving Manhattan was to hire Sotheby's to sell his 45-car private collection of Rollses, Bentleys, Mercedeses, Jaguars and one Chevrolet -- a 40-year-old red Corvette that the auction house predicts will go for between $20,000 and $30,000 when the bidding begins at 2 P.M. today. That is modest compared with the six-figure estimates for five of Mr. Schudroff's Rollses and a 1956 Bentley S1 whose original owner was the actor David Niven.
 "Smell this car," Mr. Schudroff declared one morning recently, easing the long-nosed coupe into traffic on First Avenue. "Smell it." He was right: even though it is 38 years old and has a dinosaur of a radio -- AM only and vacuum tubes that seem to take forever to warm up -- it has that new-car smell.
 So does a 1961 Rolls Silver Cloud II, a coupe with 27,825 miles. "I remember this car in the showroom in 1961," he said. "I was 16 years old. Now I own it."
 But not after today. Sotheby's expects the Bentley to go for $100,000 to $125,000, the Silver Cloud for $125,000 to $150,000 and a 1966 Rolls Phantom V State Landaulette for $250,000 to $350,000. The '66 is one of only five such Rollses in the world and one of three with the steering wheel on the right -- the other two are left-side-drive cars. "Rolls-Royce would only build you one if you were a head of state," Mr. Schudroff said. This one rolled off the assembly line with the Emir of Bahrain's coat of arms on it.
 "It's like a house inside," Mr. Schudroff said, but it has options not found in most houses, let alone most cars. There is a grip rail on the partition behind the driver's head, "so you could stand up and wave to the people," he said.
 There is also a backseat that can be raised at least 12 inches, so a passenger can sit down, wave to the people and still be seen. And there is a cocktail cabinet with Waterford glasses and decanters that will suffer no damage should the car be overturned in a protest. And it would take a strong people to do that: the car weighs more than 6,000 pounds, Mr. Schudroff said.
 To talk about Rolls-Royces, whether an emir's or a mere heiress's, is to talk about cars with debonair charm and mannerly flourishes -- and to learn the British name for automotive anatomy. The hood is the bonnet, the fenders are the wings, the trunk is the boot.
 But somehow, Mr. Schudroff has never lost his New York accent. He was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and started restoring cars at 14: Triumphs and Austin Healeys, mostly, until he saw the advertisement he says changed his life, two or three lines of type in the classifieds for a Rolls-Royce that needed restoration -- "$4,400 or trade for sailboat."
 "I had neither," he said. "I scraped together the $4,400 from friends and relatives. I remember selling it later for $8,900."
 Less than 10 years later, he had his dealership at 407 East 61st Street, and customers who had showrooms of their own. Mr. Schudroff said one buyer kept his Rolls in a room with plate-glass walls, right next to his living room.
 Mr. Schudroff insists that he is not giving up the Ghost, Silver or otherwise. When he closes early next year, he intends to sell Rollses in Greenwich, Conn., where he already has a showroom and where he used to have a Rolls franchise. Mr. Wharen said the company has not yet decided to let him have it back.
 Despite a few close scrapes, only once in Mr. Schudroff's 25 years in Manhattan did he suffer every car dealer's ultimate nightmare, an accident on a test drive.
 "A cab hit us broadside," Mr. Schudroff said. "If you ever had to be in an accident, you'd want to be in one of these cars. The man felt so bad he bought it anyway."

HEADLINE: House Democrats Face Painful Choices

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
House Republicans scaled back their plans to reduce committee sizes today to accommodate Democrats, but still left the minority party with a serious problem: deciding whom to kick off major committees.
 Women, blacks and Hispanic lawmakers would suffer disproportionately if Democrats followed seniority and dropped the members who were last to join the panels. 
 But any effort to bypass seniority to maintain diversity in the committees would anger members whose positions would be sacrificed, and would be likely to upset the already restive conservatives in the party.
 Democrats, far from being soothed by Republican gestures, complained that no member should have to leave a committee, even if that required committees to be expanded, not shrunk. Reducing committee sizes has long been advocated by outside students of Congress, who contend that smaller committees would be more efficient.
 Democrats complained bitterly that the ratios Republicans had imposed were unfair and were "smothering the voice of the American voters," as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who will be minority leader in January, put it.
 Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the No. 2 House Democrat in the new Congress, said, "We don't want to start off the session in a negative way, but if our caucus decides that these ratios are piggish on their part, then we may have to go to the mat."
 In fact, majority parties always give themselves an edge, though the Republicans went a little further beyond their 53 percent share of the incoming House than the Democrats did in exceeding their 59 percent share of the old House.
 On Appropriations, which controls spending, Republicans are taking 57 percent of the positions, while Democrats had 62 percent. On Ways and Means, which handles taxes, Republicans are taking 58 percent; Democrats had taken 63.
 Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Bonior spent the day on the telephone, talking to dozens of representatives whose committee positions were threatened. They planned to hold a series of meetings next week to decide how to propose handling the problem when the full Democratic caucus meets later in the week.
 The Republican decision on committee sizes was announced today by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the incoming Republican majority leader. Along with abolition of the committees on the District of Columbia, Merchant Marine and Fisheries and Post Office and Civil Service, with a total of 82 positions, the Republican plan would take 35 slots away from the remaining 20 committees.
 The original Republican plan would have cut those committees by 81 positions. Of those that were restored, 33 will go to Democrats. Mr. Armey said the numbers had been revised "out of consideration for the minority's need to be able to fill committee slots." He said the Republicans did so because, as a former member of the minority, he had "seen the kind of tension that is created when the needs of the minority are not given consideration."
 He also boasted that in making their committee assignments, Republicans had shown special consideration for freshmen. He said newly elected Republicans got 7 out of 11 open Republican seats on Appropriations, 3 of 10 on Ways and Means and 9 of 10 on Commerce.
 Freshmen are at the heart of the Democratic problem, too, but they are the freshmen from the outgoing Congress. The class elected in 1992 included 21 women, 16 blacks and 6 Hispanic lawmakers. Democrats used the diversity of that class and its immediate predecessor to change the makeup of several major committees.
 On Ways and Means, Democrats have 24 members. Five left through retirement or defeat, but another four must leave to get down to the 15 slots in the next Congress. The four junior members include two of the committee's five blacks.
 On Appropriations, Democrats have 36 members. Five will not be back, because of defeat or retirement, and the allocations announced today will give them 24 positions in the next Congress, requiring seven Democrats to surrender that plum assignment.
 The lowest seven in seniority include two of the committee's three Hispanic Democrats, two of its five Democratic women and one of its three blacks. The committee's most junior member, Representative Carrie Meek of Florida, who is black, has urged that diversity be made a consideration in deciding how to handle the reductions.
 While plans for handling the issue will be earnestly discussed when Democrats meet to organize next week, it is likely that the only concession junior members will get from the caucus is the assurance that they will be first in line to get back on the choice committees if Democrats regain control of the House or other members are defeated.
 Mr. Bonior said that no decisions had been made and that he hoped Republicans would reconsider. During his tenure in the House, he said, Democrats had always adjusted committee ratios and made committees bigger so that no member would have to get off. But none of those shifts were as big a change as occurred when Republicans won control of the House.
 Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution said Mr. Bonior's idea of expanding committees so that no one would be forced out was "good for the individuals and bad for the institution."
 "Over the last couple of decades," Mr. Mann said "there has been a real inflation in committee size. Large committees are harder to operate as units, by and large. Over time it leads to a ballooning of the total number of assignments and the total number of conflicts and the frenetic pace of the institution."
 The other major problem the Democrats confront is how to deal with members of the three committees Republicans are abolishing. Republicans allowed their members to transfer to whatever committee picked up the jurisdiction of the extinct committee, and to take their seniority with them. But Democrats are divided on that question.

HEADLINE: Pentagon to Cut $7.7 Billion in New Weapons Programs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Pentagon announced today that it would cut $7.7 billion in new weapons programs over the next six years to help combat readiness by paying for increased salaries and improved living conditions for American troops.
Coupled with President Clinton's decision last week to add $25 billion to the military's budget through 2001, the announcement today reflects a concerted effort by the Administration to increase combat readiness and to support military personnel. 
 The decision to shift money from hardware to readiness, at least in the next few years, also underscores the efforts by the White House to blunt criticisms from Republican lawmakers that American forces are stretched too thin. The Pentagon conceded last month that 3 of 12 Army divisions were below peak readiness levels.
"We believe that these adjustments are acceptable, they protect our technology base, and they allow important force-modernization programs to continue at a rate that we can afford, and they do provide the necessary savings which help us increase funding for readiness," Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters today.
But Republicans countered that the Administration's financing decisions underscored a lack of vision. "It's an ad-hoc defense policy," said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "It's becoming bizarre as they lurch from one idea to another."
In a widely publicized memorandum in August, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch ordered the Army, Navy and Air Force to prepare plans to cancel or delay as much as $20 billion in new weapons systems in development. The President's decision to pour more money into the Pentagon coffers reduced the size of the necessary cuts.
The plan announced today includes the following:
*Canceling a radar-evading missile system developed by the Northrop Grumman Corporation, called the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile. Ending the program will save $2.1 billion in the next six years, but cost 1,700 Northrop Grumman jobs in Southern California.
*Revamping the Army's Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter program, developed by the Boeing Company and the Sikorsky division of the United Technologies Corporation, to build only two prototypes. The savings will be $2.1 billion over six years.
*Reducing the number of new Navy Aegis destroyers, built at the Bath Iron Works in Maine and the Litton Industries shipyard in Mississippi, to 16 from 18. The savings will be $1.5 billion over six years.
Military contractors said they still needed to see details of the plan before they could judge its consequences. Some even held out hope that future Administrations or Congresses could change today's decision. "These issues have a way of changing year to year," said Jack Satterfield, a spokesman for Boeing. "Obviously, this is the first step in a very long and detailed review process."
Before the White House came up with the extra money, the armed services had been bracing for even deeper cuts. Some Air Force officials feared that the purchase of 422 F-22 fighters, the service's most-prized new weapons system, could be delayed for up to four years. Instead, the Pentagon shaved only $200 million in research and development from the program's overall $70 billion program.
In addition, the Pentagon opted to leave largely untouched the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, and is being developed by Boeing and the Bell helicopter unit of Textron Inc.
"These cuts, we believe, are prudent," Mr. Perry said, "and they will not interfere with our efforts to develop the new wave of weaponry needed for the 21st century."
The Administration has concluded that the end of the cold war offers an opportunity to cancel or significantly delay several costly weapons that were designed to fight the Soviets, and shift that money into readiness accounts. Mr. Perry plans eventually to replace older equipment using savings from base closings and streamlined Pentagon purchasing practices.
Moreover, about $15 billion of the $25 billion the White House added to the Pentagon budget is earmarked for weapons modernization in the fiscal years 2000 and 2001.
Senior Pentagon officials insisted that the decisions of the past week made up virtually all of a $49 billion shortfall the Defense Department faced over the next six years. Lower-than-expected inflation costs had dropped the shortfall to $37 billion. The extra $25 billion from the White House pared it to $12 billion.
Today's announcement brought the shortfall to about $4 billion, pocket change in the Pentagon's $1.5 trillion long-term budget that Mr. Deutch said would be eliminated through budgetary nips and tucks.

HEADLINE: Attacks Begin on Plan to Cut Social Programs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In a taste of battles likely to dominate American politics for the next decade, labor unions and spokesmen for the elderly today attacked proposals from a panel advising President Clinton on how to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare and other Government benefit programs.
 After three hours of debate, the chairman of the panel, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, admitted that he had only four or five votes of the 20 needed to win an official endorsement of his recommendations. The 32-member panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, is scheduled to hold its final meeting on Wednesday, with no consensus in sight. 
 As part of a comprehensive plan to control the cost of Federal benefit programs, Mr. Kerrey and the vice chairman of the commission, Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare and the normal retirement age, at which full Social Security benefits become available, to 70, from the current 65. They would also reduce Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and certain veterans' benefits for people with high incomes.
 Critics immediately denounced the proposals, just as Mr. Kerrey had predicted. Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "These measures would destroy the retirement income and health system that Americans have enjoyed for 60 years." He asserted that "there is no crisis in the Social Security retirement program."
 Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security, said that Mr. Kerrey's proposals, taken together, would mean a 44 percent reduction in benefits for workers who have earned average wages over the course of their lives. "Raising the normal retirement age to 70 would reduce benefits not only for early retirees, but also for those who wait until age 70 to retire," Mr. Ball said.
 It is unclear whether Senator Kerrey, who expressed impatience with his critics, will engage in the lengthy discussions and negotiations that will be needed to forge agreement within his panel. It is also unclear whether his proposals will improve or worsen the political climate for members of Congress who want to curb the growth of Social Security and Medicare.
 Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said he was stunned by Mr. Kerrey's proposals because they would require older people to "bear, not share, the burden of deficit reduction." The proposals, he said, are not balanced; two-thirds of the proposed savings would come from Social Security and Medicare.
 Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the association, said: "Only a small proportion of workers retire at 65. The average retirement age is now 61 1/2, though some retirees return to the labor force for part-time or seasonal work."
 Workers can now collect Social Security retirement benefits at ages as low as 62, but the benefits for early retirees are reduced, and the reduction is larger for people who retire earlier.
 Thomas R. Margenau, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said: "Fifty-one percent of the people who apply for Social Security retirement benefits do so at the age of 62. Only 25 percent wait till age 65."
 Richard L. Trumka, a commission member who is also president of the United Mine Workers of America, said Mr. Kerrey seemed to be operating on the premise that "we must destroy these programs in order to save them."
 "The means-testing of Medicare would, in effect, redefine it as welfare," Mr. Trumka said. "And we all know the level of public support for welfare programs."
 Mr. Kerrey said such hostile reactions suggested that Americans could not deal with serious problems until they turned into a crisis.
 Several commission members expressed support for Mr. Kerrey's approach. Among them were Robert E. Denham, the chairman of Salomon Inc.; Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank, and two Republican Representatives, C. Christopher Cox of California and J. Alex McMillan of North Carolina.
 Some members of the commission said they needed more time to analyze and discuss Mr. Kerrey's proposals, so they would understand how the changes affected people at different income levels.
 One commission member, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said the critics of Mr. Kerrey's plan were trying to whip up "raw political fear" by using inflammatory words like "cut, slash, chop, destroy and dismantle." In fact, he said, people over the age of 50 will not be much affected.
 Wade J. Henderson, director of the Washington office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the proposals would have disproportionate effects on blacks and "could exacerbate racial divisions." For black males born in 1992, he said, the life expectancy is 65 years, so many of them will not live long enough to receive Social Security benefits if the retirement age is increased to 70.
 One of Mr. Kerrey's proposals would reduce the Social Security payroll tax for employees. Workers would have to invest the extra money they received in private savings plans or individual retirement accounts.
 Asked whether this was a first step toward "privatizing Social Security," Mr. Kerrey said: "Yes. But private retirement benefits are not destructive of Social Security."
 Under Mr. Kerrey's proposal, elderly people could stay in Medicare, but they could also get Government vouchers to enroll in private health plans. In addition, he would limit the tax deductions that employers may take for the cost of employee health benefits. Under current law, there is no such limit.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The G.O.P. Contract Is Too Timid" (Op-Ed, Dec. 3): Paul Craig Roberts's diatribe against a United States "welfare state grown soft and fat" suffers from flawed logic, inaccurate insinuations and fatuous conclusions about America and its place in the global economy. 
 Rather than the stumbling giant hobbled by an undisciplined population and crushing taxes that Mr. Roberts portrays, recent studies indicate that the United States has a work force that is among the most productive and competitive in the world, and an overall tax burden lower than that in most of its economic rivals.
The insinuation that China's economy will surpass that of the United States because of the Chinese leadership's truer commitment to capitalist principles ignores the fact that, given the size of the Chinese population, even modest increases in per capita income will produce enormous growth in China's gross domestic product.
Mr. Roberts's denunciation of the American legal system conveniently ignores that until very recently a system where people had "different rights based on their status" already existed -- except women and minorities were the victims of inequality.
The claim that United States law "now demands advancement by race and gender quota" is insupportable by the evidence. To condemn changes that will bring into the economy a pool of talent and energy so long prevented from full participation is curious, given Mr. Roberts's concerns.
Advocacy of a "return to the small-government era" of the 19th century, whose implications Dickens described so well, is more romanticism for an idealized past than a clear-eyed vision of the future.
Reforms in health care, welfare and the role of government are desirable for a number of reasons, but to pose the issue in such an apocalyptic fashion neither clarifies the available choices nor provides feasible alternatives.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hasn't Become Stumbling Economic Giant;
Post-Welfare Vacuum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Craig Roberts bemoans that "The G.O.P. Contract Is Too Timid" (Op-Ed, Dec. 3). But his discourse is equally vague and mischievous. 
 Mr. Roberts holds the view that Social Security and health care should be privatized. He would abolish welfare and end "taxation of human and physical capital."
Can welfare be abolished with social peace assured and intact? Will private charity fill the void? What of the effect on innocent children? Will they be required to pay for the "sins" of their parents?
Will tasks be shifted to states and localities? How will the taxation of human and physical capital be discontinued without detriment to the indispensable flow of government revenues? Will Social Security and health care accounts owned by individuals be free from raiding? If not, shall stern and harsh riposte declare that the sick, infirm and needy be left to their own devices?
Mr. Roberts urges a "return to equality before the law" in the United States, as if all Americans have been subjected to social and economic circumstances that are a constant on a level playing field. However, it is his rugged individualism that invites regression to "feudal times." While a freer world marketplace does vouchsafe greater equality of status than did feudalism, when the issues of civil rights and discrimination in America are raised, Mr. Roberts would be wise to avert attempts at comparisons.
Neither the Republicans' "Contract With America" nor Mr. Roberts's unfettered libertarianism are serious platforms for a domestic political undertaking or a national program for competitiveness in the 21st-century global economic contest.

HEADLINE: Finger-Pointing in Orange County Fiasco

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The search for people to blame for the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy fiasco reached beyond county officials today to include some of the Wall Street firms that sold Orange County bonds to investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, widening its investigation of the county's loss-plagued investment fund, subpoenaed at least two brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Company. Meanwhile, owners of bonds issued by the county sued county officials and Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney, contending that the brokerage firms concealed "reckless investment practices" of the investment pool. 
 The county, in turn, followed through on its threat to sue Wall Street firms that sold securities after its filing on Tuesday for bankruptcy. The securities were used as collateral to support borrowing by the investment fund, which disclosed last week that its $20 billion value had fallen by at least $1.5 billion because of ill-fated bets on interest rates.
The circle of local governments affected by the bankruptcy widened as well, with the small city of Montebello in Los Angeles County disclosing that it might have to file for bankruptcy because it has more than 60 percent of its $77.2 million investment portfolio frozen in the Orange County pool.
But so far, the county's financial crisis has not interrupted payments to employees of local governments, school districts and county agencies in Orange County. Nor have payments to pensioners been affected by the county's failure on Thursday to pay holders of a $110 million pension bond that was backed by the liquidity of the Orange County investment pool.
Merrill Lynch, which underwrote $600 million in bonds last summer for the investment pool, confirmed that it was subpoenaed yesterday by the S.E.C. "We plan to cooperate fully with the S.E.C. investigation," said Richard Silverman, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch in New York. He did not disclose any details about the Federal agency's request.
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., a small Dallas firm, was also subpoenaed. Rauscher Pierce has advised Orange County in the past and had been retained to sell a coming bond issue for the county.
The S.E.C. would not comment on the investigation, but lawyers close to the case said the regulators were looking at whether the firms that sold bonds to investors during the summer knew the risks faced by the Orange County investment pool. The bond offering statements did not disclose any losses in the investment pool, whose value began falling in February after interest rates started to rise.
The S.E.C. is also expected to look at what are known as reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, used by Orange County to turn $7.8 billion in money from 187 county agencies, school districts and cities into a portfolio worth $20 billion. Under these agreements, nearly a dozen Wall Street firms lent the county about $13 billion and took as collateral fixed-income government securities worth about $13.5 billion.
When Orange County defaulted on one of those loans, for $2 billion, with CS First Boston on Tuesday, the county was forced into bankruptcy. Since then, all but two of the firms with repurchase agreements with the county have liquidated $11.5 billion in collateral, according to David Kiff, a spokesman for the county. Those two are Merrill Lynch, which has $2 billion in collateral against loans, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, with $100 million.
Repairing the damage at the troubled Orange County investment fund will take at least a year, according to Thomas W. Hayes, the former California state treasurer who was named Thursday to manage the fund after Robert L. Citron, the former county treasurer, resigned.
A protege of Gov. Pete Wilson of California, Mr. Hayes is expected to have wide power to clean up the mess in the fund, whose collapse is putting political pressure on Thomas F. Riley, the chairman of the five-member board of supervisors. Mr. Hayes and Mr. Riley are Republicans, while Mr. Citron is a Democrat.
Orange County, a largely suburban county just south of Los Angeles, has a population of 2.3 million and is one of the wealthiest counties in the nation.
 Today, the county filed a lawsuit against Nomura Securities charging that the firm violated the county's bankruptcy protection by liquidating $900 million in bonds that it held as collateral.
In a statement today, Nomura called the lawsuit "baseless and without merit" and said, "We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."
Other firms that sold collateral, including Prudential, Smith Barney, First Boston and Morgan Stanley, are expected to be sued by the county.
The lawsuit, filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., asks the judge to void the sale or require Nomura to replace the bonds or give the county the proceeds from the sale. But many bankruptcy lawyers say repurchase agreements are exempt from the law that freezes all assets in a bankruptcy.
The Wall Street investment houses that helped the county sell bonds and lent it money are being seen by some investors as the deep pockets in the case.
Investors in those bonds, it was disclosed today, have filed a class action suit in Federal District Court in Santa Ana against Orange County officials who managed the fund, as well as Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney. The suit -- filed by Leetate Smith, trustee for the Smith Family Trust, which purchased $15,000 worth of county bonds, -- contended that investors were not informed that the county's investment pool was at risk of collapse.
The suit, the Merrill Lynch spokesman said, is without merit. "It's unfortunate, but predictable," he said. " We will contest the lawsuit vigorously."
A spokesman for Smith Barney also dismissed the suit, saying such suits are "filed all the time" in such situations.
Meanwhile, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 1,000 bus drivers and mechanics who work for the county, said it was also considering legal action. "The fingers are pointed at Merrill Lynch," said Bart Naylor, a spokesman for the union. "They sold the derivatives to Orange County, they shaped the risky strategy that got them into trouble, they underwrote the bonds to meet collateral calls."
In a recent case involving a huge loss in a municipal investment pool, Wall Street firms paid heavily.
After the investment fund of San Jose, Calif., lost $60 million as a result of the same kind of borrowing and interest-rate plays that got Orange County into trouble, San Jose sued 13 brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney, Paine Webber, E. F. Hutton and Prudential- Bache. Eleven of them settled the case for a total of $12 million; Hutton and Paine Webber were ordered to pay the city $13 million after a six-month trial that ended in June 1990.
"For this to happen again so close to the last time is a horror," said Melvyn I. Weiss, a partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach in New York, who represented San Jose. He said he had been consulted by investors in the Orange County pool, but he declined to name them. "The brokers know these problems and have lived through them once before," he said.
In addition, the teamsters' union, in a letter to Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., asked the agency to investigate political contributions made by three Merrill Lynch employees to Mr. Citron's re-election campaign for county treasurer.
Merrill Lynch said today that the contributions were legal.
The teamsters contend that the $1,000 given by each of the three brokers, including Michael Stamenson, the San Francisco salesman who made millions of dollars in commissions on Orange County business, was in violation of rules recently approved by the S.E.C. that bar securities firms and their employees from seeking underwriting contracts from politicians whose election they helped finance.

HEADLINE: The Echoes Of Piaf In Paris

BYLINE: By FREDERICK TURNER; FREDERICK TURNER has frequently written about Paris for The Times.

 BODY:
AMONG the enduring icons of Paris is Edith Piaf, the tiny singer who burned herself out more than 30 years ago but who remains for Parisians, and for the French generally, the embodiment of some cherished values: a gritty romanticism, a profligate willingness to give everything for love and art, and a love of Paris that embraces equally its squalor and splendor. "My heart," she sang, "is at the corner of a street/And often rolls into the gutter."
And it was almost in the gutter of the 20th arrondissement, legend inaccurately claimed, that Edith Gassion was born in 1915 when her father failed to get a doctor in time and Edith's mother gave birth on a policeman's cape on the steps of 72 Rue de Belleville. Fifteen years later, and long since abandoned by her mother, Edith left her father to begin a career as a street singer in the district's Belleville-Menil montant neighborhood. 
 Later she would describe the years 1930 to 1935 as an "endless walk." This was the depths of the Depression, and Edith and her companion Simone Berteaut were just two of a hungry, shifting crowd of singers, jugglers, beggars and mimes who worked the city's streets, courtyards and squares, hoping to hear the ring of coins on the cobblestones. When a passing cabaret owner heard Piaf in 1935, he was astonished by a voice that seemed to fill every inch of her body and by an almost alarming intensity of delivery. He dubbed her "Mome Piaf" -- the Little Sparrow -- took her off the streets and put her on the road to stardom.
And yet in important ways Piaf remained to the end a person of the streets, closely identified with the working-class neighborhood of Belleville-Menilmontant. Speaking of her impoverished beginnings there, of that endless walk that would begin again each morning with the thin and dirty teen-ager gargling coffee to loosen her vocal cords, she said, "I wouldn't be Piaf if I hadn't gone through all that."
Seeking to help an American writer understand the roots of Piaf's genius, Simone Berteaut told him to go to the 20th arrondissement and poke about its old streets, alleys and cul-de-sacs. There, she told him, "You'll understand what it was like for us." Even though the area has undergone a piecemeal and esthetically unhappy urban renewal, you can still act on Berteaut's advice, for there is plenty of the old neighborhood left. And when you do go up to the 20th, you'll encounter a sector of a city that never ceases to surprise, constantly repaying a traveler's spirit of inquiry.
The best days to wander the 20th are Tuesdays and Fridays, when a huge, vibrant open-air market is in session along the Boulevard de Menilmontant and the Boulevard de Belleville. You can get there from the Menilmontant or Belleville Metro stop, although I prefer the former because emerging from the latter, you're confronted with a McDonald's.
At either stop, a double row of canvas-covered stalls stretches as far as you can see. Between them, a dense throng slowly pulses. Here's a tray of wristwatches; there are bins and bags of bulk spices, many of them used in the cuisines of the Levant and North Africa. Glistening cutlery is displayed next to a blind beggar with his bowl. At the corner sits a turbaned man selling dates and grains. Farther along are meats, fish, poultry strung up by the feet, great feathery mounds of untrimmed garlic, jagged pyramids of green beans and mangoes from the Ivory Coast.
Step aside from this brilliant display to the street edges, where knots of men sit in the cafes and gesture at each other in animated conversation. Stop at one -- say, Chez Jeannot, which advertises Tunisian snacks -- and have a bite or a cup of coffee, in order to simply sit and watch. "This is a Jewish-Tunisian restaurant," said a young man behind Chez Jeannot's counter who gave his name as Yossi. He was putting together what he said were "fricassees," a sandwich of tuna in a bun, garnished with potato slices, capers, olives and pickled peppers. "You have a lot of Jews up here in the 20th," Yossi told me. "Before, they were in Algeria." He insisted I try a fricassee and made one up that I took out to the tables on the sidewalk. Across the broad boulevard and above the awnings, laundry hung from the windows of the scabrous old apartment buildings and women leaned on sills looking down at the shoppers. A great many things have changed since Paris sprawled eastward in the last century, engulfing the villages of Belleville and Menilmontant and transforming them into working-class neighborhoods, but this section is still working class, though its ethnic composition has changed since Piaf walked its streets.
She was part Algerian herself, and as Yossi had pointed out, Algerians are still a force here. But now there are other North African nationalities here as well as brilliantly robed people from farther south in the continent and an increasingly large populace of Asians -- Thais, Malaysians and Chinese.
As the clock creeps toward the market's closing at 1 P.M., the vendors' cries rise to a keening chant. Time to turn off the market street onto the Rue Crespin-du-Gast and the Musee Edith Piaf, having beforehand made a telephone appointment with its proprietor, Bernard Marchois. Mr. Marchois speaks no English, but he understands perfectly the nature of your mission and obligingly shows you through the two rooms that are cluttered with Piaf artifacts.
While recordings flood you with the singer's tight vibrato, you inspect the photographs, letters, shoes, one of the black dresses Piaf always wore on stage, even the huge teddy bear that was a constant companion to a star who, like so many others, was always lonely except when performing. A life-size cutout of Piaf against a wall allows you to appreciate the phenomenon of so small a body housing so large a voice.
Up the steep slope of the Rue de Belleville, once the village's main street, past the bars, tabacs, Laundromats and Chinese groceries and restaurants, is number 72, the legendary birthplace. Three years after her death in 1963, when Maurice Chevalier unveiled the plaque that adorns this very ordinary doorway, a crowd choked the street all the way back to the Boulevard de Belleville. But few of the assembled knew that in fact Piaf had been born a few blocks away at the Hopital Tenon (it's still there). By then the legend had become far more important than the facts.
Coming back down the Rue de Belleville, a left turn on a street called the Rue Piat and on to the top of the hill will give a panoramic view of the city, including the partial renewal of Belleville-Menilmontant.
If you've bought picnic supplies at the market, you might want to put them to use in the sparkling little Parc de Belleville. If not, there are two good restaurants right here on the Rue des Envierges, both operated by the same family. I like the cozier feel of Bistrot-Cave des Envierges, but in good weather you can't beat the view from the terrace of A La Courtille with a breeze flapping its long awning and the smudged Impressionist clouds flowing overhead.
Part of what you see here has the bleak sterility associated with Georges Pompidou's makeover of Paris in the 1970's, but this neighborhood was originally built up without undue concern for the health or comfort of its residents and the "improvements" that might strike the American traveler as impoverished in character are probably experienced by the current inhabitants in quite another way.
AND in any case, there is still evidence of the neighborhood of Piaf's youth. Inside A La Courtille are some wonderful Willy Ronis photographs that show Belleville-Menilmontant as it was before renewal. A few blocks away, at 87 Rue de Menilmontant, a Century 21 real-estate office has a storefront display of the area as it was during World War II. And you can get an immediate sense of it by walking down the cobbled slope of the Rue du Transvaal just behind the restaurants. Here you find those narrow, beguiling alleys that Simone Berteaut recommended to the American writer, such as Villa Castel and Passage Plantin.
On the electrical boxes of the latter I saw scrawled messages that might have been written by Piaf herself: "L'amour est amer" (love is bitter) one of them read. At the bottom of the Rue du Transvaal you come to a knot of little streets in an area utterly unretouched. It's a good place to get creatively lost; wandering about, you see the truth of the architectural historian Francois Loyer's observation that the old architecture of this neighborhood is chaotic and unplanned but also intensely alive.
The Rue des Cascades, one short street off the eastern end of the Rue du Transvaal, embodies the divided nature of the 20th: on one side anonymous high rises, on the other a huddle of old buildings, some of which were photographed by the great Atget. Next to the Club Niagara, which advertises Friday-night jazz, is the studio of Raul Velasco, president of the local artists' association. There are more than a hundred artists' studios clustered in the neighborhood, he told me, and every May they hold an open-studio celebration to promote their work.
"When I came here from Mexico in the early 80's," Velasco said, "there were still a few people around who had known Piaf, and it was easy to have a conversation about her. There were two old women who used to speak of her, but both are dead. This area is changing very much, as you see, and the younger people moving into the flats, they don't have that memory of her."
Wind your way south, down through the Passage des Soupirs (Lane of Sighs), to the Rue Orfila, where Cafe de l'Esperance (Hope Cafe) offers a look at the sort of place fast disappearing in Paris: a tiny zinc bar, billiard table and coffee machine. The blonde woman behind the bar said with some asperity that when Piaf had lived hereabouts she had been entirely unknown. "Now everybody knows her name." Farther along, at 105 Rue Orfila is the building where Piaf and Berteaut lived for some months; then it was called the Hotel of the Future. You couldn't make up these heartbreaking names.
It isn't far along the Rue Pelleport to Place Edith Piaf on the Rue Belgrand, and to get there you pass Hopital Tenon. At the square is a small monument to Piaf unveiled in 1981 by Mayor Jacques Chirac. Behind the square is a jewelry store, La Vie en Roses, a takeoff on Piaf's signature song.
From there to Piaf's portion of Pere-Lachaise Cemetery is but a few steps farther, emphasizing how closely Piaf remained tied to her old neighborhood. There, surrounded by others who gave much for art -- Gertrude Stein, Modigliani -- is Piaf's black marble tomb. The first time I visited, it was covered with sprays of white flowers, and I thought it must have been some sort of anniversary. It wasn't. The tomb has been similarly bedecked on every visit since.
It will be when you visit, too: If the newcomers to the 20th lack the memory of the Little Sparrow and her rise from these streets, there are a great many others who do remember, who continue to make the pilgrimage, bearing their bouquets of devotion.
 
 
 
WALKING IN PIAF'S FOOTSTEPS, WITH NO REGRETS
 The Musee Edith Piaf is at 5 and 7 Rue Crespin-du-Gast and is open Monday to Thursday from 1 to 6 P.M., by appointment only. Bernard Marchois, the proprietor, is also the secretary general of the Friends of Edith Piaf, which runs the museum.
Visitors must call Mr. Marchois to get instructions on how to enter the building. He does not speak English, so you might want to ask your hotel concierge to speak with him at 43.55.52.72. There is no admission fee.
Ateliers d'Artistes de Belleville, the artists' cooperative of the 20th Arrondissement, is at 48 Rue Ramponneau, 46.36.44.09.
For a tour of Pere-Lachaise, one of the best guidebooks is "Permanent Parisians: An Illustrated Guide to the Cemeteries of Paris," by Judi Culbertson and Tom Randall (Chelsea Green, paperback, $15.95). Piaf's tomb is in Section 97.
 
Where to Eat
Prices are in dollars, at 5.25 francs to $1, and are for one person with wine.
The Bistrot-Cave des Envierges is at 11 Rue des Envierges, 46.36.47.84; open Wednesday to Saturday, noon to 2 A.M., and Sunday noon to 8 P.M. It is a wine bar serving traditional French cooking. Lunch is about $13 and dinner about $27.
A La Courtille is at 1 Rue des Envierges, 46.36.51.59. It offers complete meals featuring the cuisine and wine of particular regions of France. A full meal is about $34. Open noon to 2 P.M. and 8 to 10:45 P.M.
Two other convenient restaurants are next to Pere-Lachaise. Le St.-Amour backs up to one of the cemetery's walls at 2 Avenue Gambetta and 32 Boulevard de Menilmontant, at Place Auguste Metivier, but is nonetheless a cheerful spot for a good lunch.
The restaurant specializes in the cuisine of the Auvergne region. The sandwiches are fresh, the prices are moderate and the service is brisk and friendly. A dinner menu, including appetizer, entree, cheese and dessert is $23. Also recommended is their St.-Amour wine. Open 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday; call 47.97.20.15.
Across the square at 44 Boulevard de Menilmontant is Aux Becs Fins, a seafood restaurant with Perigord and Breton specialties, such as bouillabaisse and white-bean stew with goose. A full meal with wine, dessert and coffee is about $45. Unlike Le St.-Amour, which caters to tourists, this is a neighborhood restaurant, and while casual enough, it offers more serious meals. Call 47.97.51.52. Open noon to 2:30 P.M. and 7:30 to 9:30 P.M.

HEADLINE: Commuting at the Edge of the Exurb Belt

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

DATELINE: MILFORD, PA.

 BODY:
THE sky is coal-black, dawn still a time zone to the east, when Mona Clausen boards the 5:35 bus to Manhattan in front of the Old Tyme Pharmacy in this quaint village in the hilly northeastern reaches of the Poconos not far from the point where the borders of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania fit like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
Mrs. Clausen's trip to her office at a midtown Manhattan bank takes two hours door-to-door; she won't see daybreak this time of year until the bus nears Newark. She commutes this way four or five times a week. 
 "You get used to it," she said. "I guess I'm just a morning person."
About 60 miles due south, Rick Goodwin makes a similar run each morning from Buckingham, Pa., in the heart of Bucks County's bosky countryside, to his Manhattan office, also in midtown.
Mr. Goodwin's trip takes, on a good day, two hours and 15 minutes by car and, from Trenton, Amtrak train. (On a bad day, he could fly to the Caribbean in the same amount of time.) He has been traveling to and from work this way each weekday for two years. He hasn't gotten used to it; he's not a morning person.
"I figured out I'm spending 54 days a year commuting," he said.
Eastern Pennsylvania has long been a second-home haven for people who are residents of the New York City region. Some are well-to-do owners of weekend homes and hobby farms in Bucks County. Others are the proud possessors of inexpensive cabins and cottages in the Poconos.
In recent years, though, the five counties north of Philadelphia along the western bank of the Delaware River appear to have become a permanent home for an increasing number of ex-New Yorkers and commuters who, lured in large part by comparatively cheap housing prices, work in Manhattan or northern and central New Jersey, particularly the Princeton area.
"A lot of people live over there and commute across the bridge into Jersey," said Ellen Hodges, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Princeton Area. "In the last 10 years, it has really developed as the Princeton area has developed."
This slow in-migration of full-time residents -- along with a local economy that wasn't damaged as much by the recent recession as other parts of the Northeast -- has helped cushion real-estate prices and sales volume from the steep declines suffered in many parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut since 1988.
"We are becoming the fourth state in what has always been known as the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region," said Davis R. Chant, the chairman of a real estate brokerage in Milford that bears his name.
"We're the next frontier," he added. "We're the only place in the region that is still growing significantly -- the only place around New York where there are many more people moving in than moving out. Why? We're clean, safe, affordable; we have good schools. Need I go on?"
Statistics precisely gauging the growth of eastern Pennsylvania as home for New York and New Jersey commuters or New Yorkers with second homes do not exist. There are, however, several measures that seem to show a rise in recent years, at least for permanent residents who either work in New York and New Jersey or take new jobs in Pennsylvania. In a 1988 study, for example, 10 percent of all home sales in Northampton and Lehigh Counties were to people who previously lived in ZIP codes in New Jersey and New York. Most of those buyers bought homes in the Easton area.
Kamran Afshar, an economist who conducted the study, said that the migration was spurred in large part by the completion of Interstate 78, which made travel to New York much faster.
BUS and train ridership to and from Pennsylvania has also increased over the years. About 51 people each weekday morning use Metro-North's Port Jervis, N.Y., station, about 10 miles north of Milford, for a two-hour ride into the PATH station in Hoboken, N.J., about twice as many as 10 years ago.
"If you look at the license plates in the parking lot, you'll see that about a third to half of them are from Pennsylvania," said Daniel Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. "They come from the Poconos and Pike County."
To the south, Bieber Bus Company in Allentown has expanded to 12 daily runs from the Allentown-Reading area to New York since it started business in 1971, when it had only three runs. "We're growing all the time," said Carl Bieber, president of the company. "Some are going to shop, but some are going for work."
Mrs. Clausen noted that there were several Milford-to-New York commuters who rode with her each day; she uses the Mahwah-based Short Line, which is faster but more expensive than taking Metro North from Port Jervis; it also goes directly to mid-town Manhattan rather than Hoboken.
"I'd say that there are five of us, altogether," she said. "Most of us came from New York and Long Island. I came from Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn."
Mrs. Clausen said that the main reason she endured the daily commute so well was because she loved the home she bought in downtown Milford for $200,000 in October 1993: a Greek Revival village house that was built in 1810. She had been living in a co-op apartment with her husband, Robert, a retired computer-systems manager.
"We had driven through the area, and thought it was very charming," she said. "We looked in Long Island and Connecticut, and didn't care for it too much -- it was overbuilt. Besides, we couldn't duplicate there what we have here. Our house in Westfield, N.J., for instance, would cost $400,000."
She also said she doesn't find the commute to New York, where she works as an executive assistant, daunting. "On weekends, it's only an hour and a half from the Lincoln Tunnel," she said.
But Mr. Goodwin described his commute as a "real shock, especially when you are used to getting to work in 15 or 20 minutes." "I have been doing a lot more reading than I had been," he said. There are also problems like treacherous roads in the winter.
Mr. Goodwin's 85-mile trip starts with a 40-minute drive to the train station. "A lot of people commute into the city from Yardsley, which is only about 10 minutes from the Trenton station," he said.
The additional transportation costs can be considerable, too. For example, an Amtrak pass from Trenton to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan costs $265 a month. Parking at the station costs Mr. Goodwin $125 a month, though less expensive spaces are available.
As with Mrs. Clausen, who pays about $320 a month for her bus passes, what has made the commute bearable for Mr. Goodwin is his home: a 1,200-square-foot, 190-year-old two-bedroom with barn and stream on4.5 acres that he and his companion, Kirk McKend, a graphic designer and artist, bought two years ago for $305,000.
The small size of the building didn't faze Mr. Goodwin; he had been had been living in a 400-square-foot, rent-stabilized -- the rent was $475 a month -- one-bedroom apartment in a brownstone on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Goodwin, the editor-in-chief of Unique Homes magazine, and Mr. McKend also intend to make about $175,000 in renovations to the house.
"WE first went to look at the Hamptons to see what we could get near the water," he said. "We spent weekends looking in the Sag Harbor area and decided that we didn't like it too much -- the traffic was unbearable -- and the kind of home we wanted was in the $350,000 to $400,000 range."
He was already acquainted with Pennsylvania because he and a group of others had bought a 10-room Victorian house on 14 acres in Honesdale, near Milford, in 1982 for $47,000. "It was a lot more house than you could get in the Catskills," he said. "Taxes on the house were something like $300 a year. The area also wasn't full of New Yorkers on weekends, which meant that you really got away."
He heard about Bucks County from friends; the Honesdale house was sold this past summer for $170,000.
"It was attractive, the land had nice rolling hills, I became enchanted with it," he said of his new house. "I also love old architecture -- I love the feel and history of it. So, I thought why not commute. You look at the train schedule and the map, and you say to yourself, 'It's not that bad.' For a while, at least."
Though buyers like Mr. Goodwin and Mrs. Clausen have helped stimulate the housing market in eastern Pennsylvania, the growth shouldn't be overstated, particularly for 1994. In Monroe County, in the heart of the Poconos, for example, the average home sale price fell by 3.7 percent to $93,581 this year from $97,188 a year ago. In Pike and Wayne Counties the estimated average price of a home has declined this year by 3.4 percent to $103,180 from $106,836 in 1993.
These prices may seem low, but there are numerous upscale and luxury properties on the market, too.
Seven years ago, Ron Parker, a Manhattan art dealer, bought a 640-acre spread outside Milford, in Pike County; he uses as a sort of hunting preserve. "I wanted my son to grow up with nature, like I did," he said.
He also bought a Mediterranean villa, an oddity in downtown Milford, which is dominated by Victorian architecture. "I had a home in the Hamptons, and I gave it to my ex-wife in a divorce," he said. "I came out here because I wanted peace and quiet and tranquility. I wanted to be as far away as possible from everything New York and the Hamptons stand for."
Because of inclement weather early in the year and rising interest rates, sales volume as well as sales prices also slid this year in most of northeastern Pennsylvania. In Wayne County, the number of homes sold fell by 18.8 percent, to 812 as of Nov. 30 from 1,001 for all of last year. In Pike County, the number fell 23.6 percent over the same period to 860 from 1,127. In Monroe, however, the number increased, by 14.8 percent to 1,061 from 924.
In Northampton County, where the data are less reliable, sales prices have been relatively flat over the last few years with a slight increase this year, according to local real estate brokers. The number of sales for 1994 is expected to fall slightly short of 1993's levels.
The ongoing job reductions by the Bethlehem Steel Co., however, have not had a significant impact on the local real estate market. "We are in an active market, and we are pretty optimistic," said Janet Rispoli, a broker with Patt, White Company, Better Homes and Gardens in Bethlehem. "We have so much other industry coming in here."
The strongest current market may be in Bucks County, where both home sales and volume and average prices have been relatively flat for several years after declining slightly in 1989 and 1990.
That may not sound like much to cheer about, but the area was also been spared the 30 percent declines in prices and the sharp drop in sales that struck many parts of Connecticut and New York in the late 80's and early 90's.
"We didn't have the steep climbs or as steep a fall," said George H. Wells, a broker with Elizabeth James Country in Doylestown, Pa. "In the past few years, prices have stopped falling, but they are not really starting to climb, either."
Home construction has been flat or slightly declining in most of the five counties, with the exception of Bucks County, where home starts are expected to increase by 3 percent this year following similar increases the previous two years. In some parts of the county, new developments are being built, a sight not seen in many parts of the New York region since the 1980's.
"The location has charm and natural beauty, and it is also convenient to corporate centers in New Jersey, Montgomery County, Philadelphia and Lower Bucks," said Perry DeSiato, vice president for sales and marketing for DeLuca Enterprises of Newtown, Pa., which is building the Peddler's View development in Solebury Township, just outside of New Hope in Bucks County.
The development is projected to include 215 homes, priced from $194,000 to $242,900. Forty-five homes have been completed and sold so far; another 15 are under construction. "Buyers like the setting and are impressed by the value offered in these homes," Mr. DeSiato said. "In an area of estate homes, single-family homes priced below $200,000 are very appealing."
TO be sure, the five Pennsylvania counties are different culturally; Monroe County probably has more of the schmaltzy heart-shaped-bathtub honeymoon ambiance for which if Poconos is beloved by some and and ridiculed by others.
More rural Pike and Wayne Counties distance themselves from this image and bill themselves as northeastern Pennsylvania rather than the Poconos. "We don't run away from the label, but we don't use it either," Mr. Chant said.
Northampton County is a largely working-class region dominated by Easton and Bethlehem. Bucks County is a bucolic upper middle class suburb of Philadelphia that emphasizes its relative sophistication and artsiness.
"I didn't want to live in the immediate suburbs," Mr. Goodwin said. "I like the sense of country, even though it's getting less and less like country with all the construction going on."
Mr. Goodwin's move to Buckingham has worked out so well that he has recently given notice to his employer, and is going to stay in Pennsylvania, where intends to free-lance. He partly blamed the commute for decision.
"It got to the point where I didn't feel like I was living where I was sleeping," he said.
"I've been told there are some people who have been doing this for years," he said. "But really, this is a bit much."

HEADLINE: Hartford Business Misses Its Hockey

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
ABOUT 100 people were lined up outside Coach's Bar and Grille, waiting to get in before a recent Friday night basketball game between the University of Connecticut and Yale at the Hartford Civic Center. After the game, business was even brisker at the establishment on Allyn Street near the Civic Center.
Two nights later, business was considerably lighter at the restaurant and bar of which Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut men's basketball coach, is a part owner. Had the Hartford Whalers scheduled game against the Boston Bruins been played on that Sunday night a week ago, "we would have been packed," said Mike Moreau, another of the four owners of the establishment that opened last March. 
 Coach's Bar and Grille, along with many other restaurants, bars and other businesses in and around the Civic Center, have been severely affected by the suspension of the 1994-95 National Hockey League season. As the prime tenant -- and only major league franchise in the state -- the Hartford Whalers are counted on to draw customers on game nights.
But this season the Whalers have yet to play a regular season game at their home arena and, with negotiations at a virtual standstill, the outlook for a settlement of the labor dispute that has wrecked the season is bleak. So much so that three Whaler players have gone to play hockey in Europe, while most of the others have returned to their homes, mainly in Canada.
Through yesterday, 17 of the 41 Whalers games scheduled for the Civic Center had been postponed. And even if the dispute is settled, it is unlikely that any of those games would be made up.
The Whalers averaged 10,492 spectators at their home games last season, and their absence weighs heavily on local businesses. It also has deprived approximately 225 part-time employes of income derived as ushers, concession workers and other jobs at the Civic Center Coliseum, where the Whalers play.
"It's like night and day," said John France, the assistant manager at Margaritas, a restaurant and bar inside the Civic Center. "We do at least 50 percent more business on a Whalers game night," he said. "And when they play the Boston Bruins or the New York Rangers, we do even better."
At Gaetano's Ristorante in the Civic Center Plaza the impact has been even more severe, said Carl Carbone, one of the owners. "We're packed on game nights; we'll serve about 200 dinners," he said. "But when the Whalers are playing, we'll serve as many as 500. And there are spinoffs since some of the money my waiters make on tips will be spent at shops in the Civic Center."
The impact is felt often. "The Whalers were scheduled to play three games last week, and our business would have doubled each of those nights," said Jay Rule, the manager of Challenges Sports Cafe on Ann Street, near the Civic Center.
Mike Seaver, the owner of both Chuck's Steak House and Margaritas in the Civic Center, said, "Where the lack of hockey hurts us is in the bar scene."
Mr. Seaver said that the absence of Whalers games had been felt more during the week than on weekends. "On weekends," he explained, "the loss of Whaler fan business is made up by people who come in from out of town for dinner. A lot of them wouldn't come in on game nights because they don't want to buck the traffic. But they'll come in when there isn't a game."
That's good news for parking lot operators who have also been affected by the hockey lockout. "The loss of business is significant," said Mike Kuziak, one of the owners of Laz Parking, which operates 25 lots and garages in Hartford, many of which serve the Civic Center. "We figure that on a Whalers game night about 5,600 vehicles park in lots and garages, so the total loss on a game night is about $255,000, which is substantial."
"But in a warped way the loss of business on game nights is probably healthy for Hartford because it shows what life would be like without the Whalers," Mr. Kubiak said.
In recent years there have been rumors that the Whalers might leave Hartford, largely because of declining attendance, which many attribute to the team's poor performance. But under an agreement reached in late last summer, the Whalers are assured of remaining in Hartford for at least 20 years.
Under the arrangement the state has agreed to spend $30 million in bond money and Connecticut Development Authority money to eliminate the team's debt. Further, it agreed to spend $10 million for improvements to the Civic Center, which is regarded as the cornerstone of downtown Hartford. As part of the arrangement, the Whalers no longer pay rent to use the Civic Center, although the team does have to pay operating costs. Since the agreement was reached, the Whalers principal owner, Richard Gordon, sold the club to three Michigan businessmen.
Without the Whalers, the main tenant in the Civic Center Arena is the basketball team the Hartford Hellcats, who are in their second season in the Continental Basketball Association. But the Hellcats, who play 28 home games this season, only average about 4,000 fans a game. And many, if indeed not most, of their spectators consist of families who come solely to see the Hellcats play. "They're not a major draw like the Whalers," Mr. Carbone of Gaetano's Ristorante said.
Far and away the biggest per-game attraction in the arena is the nationally ranked UConn basketball team, which usually plays before capacity crowds. This season, the Huskies, currently ranked 10th by the Associated Press, are scheduled to play 10 home games at the Civic Center. "We do better with UConn games than with the Whalers, particularly bar-wise," said Mr. France of Margaritas. "Business more than doubles."
Not only restaurants, bars and parking garages benefit from Whalers and UConn games.
Barbara Lerner, the owner of the Honore Gallery, a jewelry store inside the Civic Center, said "People will stop in the store on the way to a game or look in the window, see something they like and come back. On a night when UConn is playing, we can be packed before the game starts."
But 10 home games is not a lot, so the Civic Center depends on other attractions. This winter and spring there will be two Boston Celtic basketball games (the Celtics have been playing some of their games at the Civic Center for years), several ice shows, the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus and a World Wrestling Federation Fan Festival, plus Wrestle Mania XI, from March 31 through April 2.
But overall business at the Civic Center Coliseum is a far cry from what it was in the late 1970's and the early 1980's when musical concerts featuring internationally known performers were held there. As of now, not a single concert is scheduled for this winter or next spring.
"This is the leanest fall in years for concerts," said Ron Ewing, the executive director of Ogden Entertainment, a Stamford-based company that manages the Civic Center for the Connecticut Development Authority. "There aren't a lot of groups out there that fill halls any more."
Mr. Ewing and his marketing director, Lynn Carlotto, have come up with a plan that at least fills the Civic Center ice rink, which is usually being used by the Hartford Whalers at this time of the year.
On Saturday and Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, they opened the rink to the public for ice skating without admission charge. Around 2,500 people turned out.
"It gives us a chance to give something back to the city of Hartford and the surrounding communities," Mr. Ewing said. "And it helps bring people downtown."
The rink was opened to the public again on Friday and yesterday "Tentatively, we plan to do it again in January," Mr. Ewing said.
That is, of course, unless the Hartford Whalers are playing hockey again.

Relocation of Ciba Takes Big Step Forward

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
THE relocation of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation to the Tarrytown Corporate Park has moved a significant step forward with the Town of Greenburgh's completion of the park's rezoning. The move would keep the company, which is the American subsidiary of the big Swiss chemical enterprise, in Greenburgh.
Acting at what could be considered warp speed by usual county standards, the town and its planning and zoning boards last month capped a five-month review process by granting a myriad of exemptions and variances from property setback rules and other requirements. 
 The attention and speed given the matter is an indication of how significantly the town views Ciba's continued presence in Greenburgh. Now on its own 60-acre corporate campus near Ardsley, the company considered sites in Connecticut and Putnam County before deciding on the Tarrytown park.
"There was absolutely no controversy about any of the changes at the park," said Supervisor Paul J. Feiner of Greenburgh. "The whole town worked incredibly hard to make this happen because everyone realizes that Ciba is worth keeping. If we didn't show good faith, the company would have gone elsewhere."
The rezoning includes a reconfiguration of the property, adding parking spaces and letting Ciba build a 160,000-square-foot laboratory. "The addition of a new building required a new site plan," said Stephen Lopez, the Town Planning Commissioner.
The town also adopted a new zoning law for the parking lots, where the lines are drawn to accommodate smaller compact cars. "A lot of municipalities already have this," Mr. Lopez said. While it didn't create any additional spaces, he said, "it allows for more green space and will be useful to us in our future planning." An empty parcel was rezoned to provide 200 additional parking spaces for a total of 3,500.
In September, Ciba signed a letter of intent to move to the Tarrytown park after receiving $13.25 million in economic incentives, including tax abatements and lower-cost electricity from the New York State Power Authority.
With the boards' actions, the way is now cleared for Ciba to begin moving its operations and 1,000 employees. The move will take place in stages, said Eric Jackson, the company's spokesman, beginning "in the middle of next year."
The Tarrytown Corporate Park, on Route 119 near Tarrytown, is a four-building park with 1.9 million square feet. "Ciba will be occupying approximately 450,000 square feet," said Jon L. Halpern, chief executive of Halpern Enterprises, which owns the park and has its offices there.
Ciba will lease the building known as 520 White Plains Road in its entirety for its United States corporate headquarters, and plans to buy a second building, 540 White Plains Road, for its additives division. Both buildings, which were vacated by I.B.M. late last year, will be gutted and renovated for Ciba's needs.
The impetus behind Ciba's desire to relocate at this time, Mr. Jackson said, is its need for a modern laboratory building for its additives division. "Our labs in Ardsley were built 30 years ago and designed very generally," he said. "This gives us an opportunity to specialize the space and install more sophisticated equipment."
THE office building at 540 White Plains Road will be linked to the laboratory by a walkway. "The division's offices are now located in Hawthorne, seven and a half miles from the lab," Mr. Jackson said. "This will be the first time in the organization's history that the division's offices and lab will be in the same location. It should be a huge boon for us."
The laboratory will serve as the focal point of Ciba's portion of the park, said John P. Gering, a partner with HLW, an architectural firm in Manhattan that is designing it and the office-building renovations.
"The lab is being designed to tie into the other buildings, but not to look like them." Mr. Gering said. "It will be a four-story structure, but with 16-foot ceilings, it will actually be five to six stories in height. We took extra care to break up the exterior so it didn't look massive. The facade will be pre-cast concrete that's meant to emulate stone, and there'll be a lot of windows."
Construction of the laboratory will begin next year and take two years to complete, Mr. Jackson said. In the meantime, the company will use its lab in Ardsley.
Ciba has already signed a lease for 520 White Plains Road, but the purchase of 540 White Plains Road is still being negotiated, Mr. Halpern said. "With this deal," he said "the park is now 97 percent leased."
As a result of the firming of Ciba's plans, Mr. Halpern said several companies had approached him about constructing an office building on a 16-acre vacant parcel at the center of the park. "Several companies have confidentially gotten in touch with me about building there," he said. "They're looking for space in the 100,000- to 300,000-square-foot range."
As part of the complicated relocation deal with Ciba, Mr. Halpern has agreed to buy the company's Ardsley campus, which has 550,000 square feet of office, warehouse and laboratory space. He is asking the town to designate the property an enterprise development zone, which would allow a mix of uses. "It's now zoned for its own use," Mr. Halpern said "I don't want to be stuck with one permitted use if the market changes."
He already has an agreement from ShopRite to open a supermarket there, he said. "The rest of it might remain a biomedical campus," he added. "I've heard from several firms who are interested in the labs and facilities already there."
HE had originally envisioned a total redevelopment of the site. That was "basically because I didn't have any experience in the biomedical area," he said. "But it seems there's interest, and good-quality lab space is at a premium."
The town has already balked at two of Mr. Halpern's suggestions for the property, including a warehouse retailer and a 10-screen movie theater.
"We don't want to overdevelop that area," Supervisor Feiner said. "It's one of the last big parcels available in the county. We've stated emphatically that we don't want a warehouse and a movie theater would create too much traffic. This is a great opportunity for the town to keep an open space and use it for something we can be proud of. But I expect that the rezoning of the Ardsley site will be a lot tougher fight than we had at Tarrytown."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Bonds for the Strong of Stomach

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

 BODY:
IT is hardly for widows and orphans. But some traders think that the former Soviet Union's $26 billion worth of commercial bank debt, which is trading on secondary markets for around 32 cents on the dollar, could prove a good bet for those investors with the stomach to hold it for the long term.
The loans, one of several classes of Russian debt that are traded in Europe and the United States, have been a volatile investment for several years, and the coming months could bring more of the same. 
 But if Russia, which has taken responsibility for the Soviet Union's debts, can finalize an agreement with its 600 commercial bank lenders to stretch out repayment, traders said the value of the debt, which is mainly bought and sold by sophisticated institutional investors, could surge.
The value of the bank debt has swung in the last 12 months from a high of around 50 cents on the dollar down to half that, and then back up above 40 cents in early October. That was just before the Russian government announced an outline agreement with the bank consortium, led by Deutsche Bank, for a rescheduling package that included a $500 million interest payment by Russia for past due interest to be made by the end of this year.
But when the ruble crashed in October and the Russian government's economic policy threatened to run off course, the price of the debt began sinking again, a process that was accelerated when President Boris N. Yeltsin named Oleg Davydov as his new chief debt negotiator .
In his previous job as trade minister, Mr. Davydov horrified the debt holders by suggesting earlier this year that Russia should seek to have some or all of its loans forgiven. Such a position is at odds with Moscow's long-held policy that as a superpower nation it will honor all its financial commitments.
The rescheduling negotiations have more or less stalled since then. Mr. Davydov has backtracked on his idea of cancelling some of the debts, but in the markets the damage was already done. The bank loans sank to around 28 cents on the dollar last month before rebounding slightly.
The price of the dollar-denominated loans went to 33 cents on the dollar last week, driven by reports that Deutsche Bank would resume negotiations with a Russian delegation this month.
The price then dropped to around 32, but traders said it had remained firm at those levels on reports that there has been buying from Russia. Traders interpreted the Russian buying to mean that Government insiders think that finalization of the deal is within reach and are taking positions in the expectation that the price will rise.
"At these levels we have tended to find that there are some players who will step in and buy as a long-term play," said Bob McCarthy, the head of Eastern Europe trading at Morgan Grenfell in London. "They feel that eventually there will be a deal."
Few investors are taking anything for granted. The $500 million interest payment agreed to in October now is unlikely to be made by the end of the year. Mr. Davydov, although apparently eager to ease the fears of the world's bankers, has not yet revealed much about his negotiating position or how it might differ from that of his predecessor, Alexander Shokhin, who resigned.
Most bankers expect Mr. Davydov to seek to have repayment stretched out further beyond the 15 years agreed to in October, a strategy that his deputy, Sergei Storchak, confirmed in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.
"The longer we can reschedule it for, the more we consider we have done for our taxpayers," Mr. Storchak said. "Our main tasks this year and next year are to calm down creditors and to service debts so they are not too much of a burden on the budget."
Traders said, however, that they expect Mr. Davydov to move relatively quickly to complete the bank agreement.
"I believe the Russians recognize that they need to get this behind them because they are starving for capital," said Nicholas Jordan, a trader at Chemical Bank in London. "They recognize that there's a limit to how much capital will come into their country until they get some of the foreign debt problems out of the way. I think it will be sooner rather than later, but there are still some substantial issues to be dealt with."
Alexander Kirzhnev, senior vice president at the New Alliance Group, an investment firm in Stamford, Conn., that was founded by a group including former Soviet bankers, said there could be more volatility ahead, especially if the $500 million back interest payment is not made soon. But he said there was little doubt that a deal could move forward quickly.
"I personally feel it's a good bargain at these levels," Mr. Kirzhnev said. "There is a willingness on both sides to do a deal, and it would pave the way for Russia to enter the world bond markets."
But given that every month brings an unexpected and usually unpleasant development in Russia's transformation, it remains unclear whether there are enough bulls on Russian debt to drive the price up.
"At 31, it's clearly undervalued in the long term," said Igor Sitnin, a trader at Bank of America in London. "The problem is that, when you have to report your results every quarter or month, can you really afford to take the two-year view?"

THE ECONOMY
 
No, Orange County Is Not Exactly an Island
So, is the nation weeping for Orange County, or for itself? Or put it this way: if you don't live there, or somehow invest in the county, do you care that it just declared bankruptcy and defaulted on a bond issue after its treasurer, now departed, lost $1.5 billion betting at the derivatives track? Well, yes, you do -- to a certain extent. For one thing, even if there's no logical impact on financial markets, investors thought there was -- and those jitters became real losses. But there's concrete damage on one front: the $1 trillion municipal bond market had a safe, squeaky-clean image, but that's gotten quite a blow. So even if your county stayed clear of derivatives, it might now find it costlier to borrow -- and that cost may somehow get passed right along to you. The moral: treasurers, being human, may sometimes try to get something for nothing. 

All That and Bentsen, Too
Bill Clinton is heading into the Age of Gingrich with an even cleaner slate than he expected. Not only did he lose the House and Senate, but now he'll have to do without one of his team's true grown-ups: Lloyd Bentsen. Last week Mr. Bentsen resigned as Treasury Secretary, saying he'd planned all along to leave when his Senate term would have ended -- and managing to step deftly out of the way of the Republican stampede. Replacing him will be Robert Rubin, who has headed the National Economic Council. Like Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Rubin will be tough on cutting the deficit -- which might be a problem if, as '96 nears, Mr. Clinton is inclined to share the spoils of a mighty economy.
 
Poverty? It's a State Problem
It's a Republican mantra: Shrink Big Government. And a key element, it now appears, is to abolish numerous programs aimed at the poor and ship the money to the states, few questions asked. In other words, the New Deal has had its day; let's try something else. Now the New Deal clearly needs a hell of a tune-up -- Washington is littered with welfare-reform recipes -- but the latest idea goes far beyond even "the Contract." For one thing, the money could shrink by 20 percent as it made this historic shift. But the broader impact could well be that the programs would no longer be "entitlements" -- when the money runs out, that's it.
 
Mr. Pataki's Latest Math
Bet you thought politicians, after that blowout, had stopped raising money for a while. Wrong. Last week, after taking in $14.5 million to get elected, George Pataki raised more than $1 million at a little get-together at the Sheraton -- for his transition and inauguration. Al D'Amato was there ("at this point in time a cheerleader," he insisted; the ship "has one quarterback"), and so were a fair number of Democrats, their professed distaste for the Governor-to-be having miraculously evaporated. The campaign pledges were intact; but what was Mr. Pataki's formula for reconciling a $4 billion deficit with a promised $1 billion tax cut? Simple. Just "cut $5 billion out of the budget."
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Again, Global Thinking
Morgan Stanley is a powerhouse in American investment banking, just as S.G. Warburg is in Britain. But that, apparently, was not enough: Investment bankers are thinking big, thinking global. So last week Morgan said it might buy Warburg, creating a powerhouse that would be right up there with Goldman, Sachs among the world's leading advisers for mergers and acquisitions -- and could challenge Merrill Lynch in underwriting. Warburg, in spite of its fast growth in the 80's, has never been able to get a very big foot in the door in America, which after all is where a lot of the money is.
 
'Dallas,' With a Spot of Tea
It's that age-old American dream (right up there with winning the lottery) -- striking oil right in your back yard. This time, though, it's a rather exceptional, and very British, back yard: Queen Elizabeth has just given permission to a Canadian-run company called Canuk Exploration to drill near Windsor Castle to see if oil lurks there. So is this just another disillusioning sign that the royal family is, alas, all too human -- first marital spats, then fuzzy fantasies of oil riches? No, studies show that the castle is likely to sit on a huge oil pool -- perhaps worth $1.5 billion. And no, any proceeds would go to the Treasury, not to the family. The royal family will have to subsist on tabloid headlines.
 
Move Aside, Wheelbarrows
In the annals of hyperinflation, the most vivid image has long been of Germans in the 20's with wheelbarrows full of cash that would buy, perhaps, a loaf of bread. Clearly, in the new world order, it's time for a new symbol -- and a good one may just have turned up. Last week Ukraine's central bank released a new 500,000-karbovanets banknote. Smaller bills have been left nearly worthless by inflation -- when this currency was introduced three years ago, the exchange rate was 200 to the dollar, but that's soared to more than 100,000, making those new bills worth about $4. So what's the fate of the 35 tons of old, worthless bills? They're being recycled into toilet paper.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Big Slip of Fidelity's Pencil
There are ordinary mutual funds -- and then there's Fidelity Magellan, which for years had such dazzling returns that it became the nation's largest fund. So it came as an especially nasty jolt to the fund universe last week when Fidelity, after promising a $4.32-a-share payment, said: Sorry, slip of the pencil; make that, uh, zero. And how did it manage to make this $2.4 billion error? Fidelity wasn't talking. But suddenly all eyes were on the once-invincible fund -- and it could be plainly seen that it was not doing well: no capital gains, for the first time since 1988. For investors, a lower tax bill will hardly soothe the pain.
 
Boardwalk? Try Baltic This Year
Discussing Wall Street pay is always a bit like playing Monopoly -- the funny money just comes and goes, not a drop of blood spilled. How can mere mortals, with real-world paychecks, ever comprehend "bonuses" -- once meaning a few twenties in an envelope -- that would buy a mansion or two? Well, the mansions may be fixer-uppers this year. With profits expected to plunge 80 percent from a record '93, salaries -- and bonuses -- will shrink, possibly by 40 percent. So will this set off a frenzy of job-hopping? That's less likely. Many past bonuses have been partly stock -- sometimes forfeited if the employee jumps ship.
 
Trendy Gets More Costly
Ford wants to cash in some chips. Auto sales remain hot, with light trucks the hottest. Last week, the industry reported November sales up 5.4 percent, with all three Detroit auto makers setting records for pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. And Ford's Explorer, of course, is the sales leader in that last pack. So it seemed only natural when, later in the week, Ford raised the base price steeply on the '95 Explorer -- to $20,870, up $2,740, or 15 percent. Ford is stepping up production of the Explorer, apparently convinced that buyers won't defect at the higher price.
 
Ranger Shortage, Year 2
Children, of course, usually leave adults in the pinstriped dust when it comes to independent thinking. But when the herd instinct is unleashed, watch out! If a toy's hot, kids have to have it -- NOW! -- and woe be to the parent who fails to provide. Which brings us (this year) to . . . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. First, some facts: 11 new factories are churning them out; shipments are running 10 times last year's levels; Rangers' share of the "action figure" market has soared from 4 percent to 40; the year's sales are nearing $1 billion. But guess what: there are still shortages -- leading, in fact, to a black market that can inflate a $13 Ranger to $50. Whew! Maybe, instead, a nice book under the tree . . . ?
 
Oh, That Silly Computer . . .
Two years ago, news broke that a Long Island car dealer had swindled General Motors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by borrowing on nonexistent vans -- but it was a mystery how he managed such a huge scam. Well, it was easy, he said last week, testifying in a separate bribery trial. People rely on computers, but they are also quick to suspect the machines of messing up, and the dealer, John McNamara, simply capitalized on such skepticism. When G.M. officials questioned the vehicle serial numbers he'd invented, he said, they readily offered to simply override the computer. That, said Mr. McNamara -- no doubt grinning wide -- would do just fine.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
In Britain, a Stiff-Upper-Lip Market

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IT was a most unsettling week for investors in Britain.
Prime Minister John Major suffered a humiliating defeat in Parliament on a proposed tax increase, leaving him politically wounded, casting doubt on his Conservative Government's ability to serve out its five-year term and forcing a hasty revamping of his budget for next year. 
 Then the Bank of England pushed its benchmark base interest rate up a half point, to 6.25 percent, a move that had been widely expected, but not so soon.
For all the upheaval, the markets -- particularly the bond market -- responded surprisingly calmly. The bond market, in fact, took heart that despite the Government's weakening grip on power, it did not waver from its policy of fighting inflation and striving to bring down the budget deficit.
Helped by the interest rate increases, prices of government bonds, or gilts, firmed. Moreover, an important benchmark of investor sentiment -- the spread between yields on British and German government bonds -- showed growing confidence in Britain's economic management.
Because Germany's Bundesbank is considered the premier inflation fighter, German bonds tend to carry lower interest rates than their counterparts from other nations. But this week the spread between German and British government bonds narrowed from 150 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to around 130.
On Friday, bond prices surged, pushing the yield on the benchmark 15-year gilt down to 8.42 percent from 8.49 percent.
"One of the surprising things is how well gilts have held up in a rough week of economic news," said David Miles, an economist at Merrill Lynch in London.
Some analysts are bullish on gilts, especially if the shift by investors from stocks into bonds that appears to have taken hold in the United States transfers in earnest to Britain and the rest of Europe.
But Mr. Miles said the market's upbeat reaction may not be a good long-term indicator. He said the market may not fully appreciate the extent of political instability likely to afflict Britain in the next year.
The markets would be particularly concerned about Mr. Major's Conservative Government being replaced by the Labor Party. Labor has traditionally put concern with full employment ahead of fighting inflation on its list of economic priorities, although under its new leader, Tony Blair, it has sought to assure the markets of its willingness to retain a tight monetary policy.
"Our view is that as people perceive more clearly that the Government is effectively a minority government and is going to have difficulty passing any contentious legislation, there will be built into the market a larger political risk premium," Mr. Miles said. "We had been expecting gilts to outperform other markets, but we've now changed our view."
The outlook is already murky for British stocks. Many companies are posting strong results and the economic recovery remains steady. Corporate executives have been heartened by the British Government's determined effort to bring down the budget deficit and stamp out inflation, creating the kind of stable business environment they have long clamored for.
Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, said last week that interest rates should "reach a plateau fairly soon," a remark that analysts took to mean another rate increase early next year, followed by monetary stability.
"This reiterates the point that the earlier- than-expected increases in base rates are all about preventing the need for later dramatic rises as the authorities struggle to keep growth and inflation under control," said a report by Natwest Markets in London. "While we should not see the superficially beneficial effects of the boom, neither will we see the usual dramatic bust."
But far more than the domestic situation, investors have been taking their cues from markets in the United States. With Wall Street unsettled by the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., share prices here dipped sharply on Friday after having ridden out the political uncertainty at home with barely a blip earlier in the week.
The Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 36.5 points on Friday to close at 2977.3. The index peaked in February at 3520.3, just before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in the United States, sending financial markets tumbling worldwide.
"The U.K. is but a small cog in the global markets, and the key behind the weakness we have seen is in the U.S.," said Robert Buckland, an equity strategist at Natwest Markets. "We can sail through the problems with the U.K. budget, but the Orange County budget has more effect on us."
The London equity market has traditionally rallied in December and January, but analysts said hopes of Christmas cheer this year are dim, especially if investors continue to pour into bonds, as they have shown signs of doing.

He's Back! The Amazing Human Selling Machine!

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Patrick McGeehan is a freelance business writer in Hoboken, N.J.

 BODY:
STROLL through the housewares department at Bloomingdale's this holiday season and you'll find all the top brands: Kitchenaid, Cuisinart, Popeil.
Popeil? As in Pocket Fisherman? 
 The one and only. Ron Popeil, the glib gadgeteer who mastered the art of direct selling on late-night TV in the 1970's, is back in the big leagues of telemarketing. Now 59, he is again slicing and dicing and filling the airwaves with his spiels for plastic gizmos. But he's also seeking retail redemption.
The founder of Ronco Inc. has slapped his surname, long synonymous with overhyped schlock, on an electric pasta maker that sells for as much as $170 at Bloomingdale's and Macy's. And now that he has prevailed in a patent-infringement suit involving the pasta machine, he's planning to introduce more high-end items that can be sold in department stores.
"I've got enough new product for the future to last another five years," says Mr. Popeil (pronounced poh-PEEL), whose smooth baritone, cool blue eyes and wide, magnetic mouth should be familiar to most people who owned a television set in the 1970's. "I can't wait to bring out my next product. Will it be accepted by the American public? Is it going to be bigger than the pasta machine or the food dehydrator."
Or the Veg-O-Matic. Or the Rhinestone and Studsetter. Or Mr. Microphone. Or GLH, his spray to cover bald spots. Or any of dozens of innovations that Mr. Popeil sold using a simple formula: buy lots of TV time and demonstrate the product until people are convinced they need it.
"I ask myself, What can I give people that they don't already have?" said Mr. Popeil, who insists that he has moved more than $1 billion worth of merchandise in his lifetime. "Who wants to make a toaster? Not me."
Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, which owns the Mirage and Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas who added Mr. Popeil to his company's board in its early days, said: "Ron's great at what he does because he believes. He has the ability to make people want things they didn't know they wanted."
Need proof that Mr. Popeil, who owns luxurious homes in Las Vegas and Beverly Hills and places his net worth in the "double-digit millions," has his finger on the purchasing pulse of Middle America? Look no further than the Ronco 5-Tray Food Dehydrator.
This simple, brown contraption has served as Mr. Popeil's ticket back. He has sold more than 1.3 million, through 30-minute infomercials and appearances on QVC Network, the home-shopping channel.
What is it good for? Mr. Popeil has thought of hundreds of uses: Think of the money you'll save by making your own banana chips, soup mix and potpourri. Stop impulsively overpaying for beef jerky and make your own. Or, if you don't eat beef, how about fish jerky or even turkey jerky?
And that's not all. Order now and he'll throw in a Food Glamorizer -- a handy little tool that carves baskets out of gourds -- absolutely free. As Mr. Popeil has exclaimed in ads and infomercials for decades, "Isn't that amazing?"
There's nothing new about the food-drying machine. It was sold more than a decade ago by Ronco Teleproducts Inc., which Mr. Popeil founded and took public in 1969 and is now on its second life. He pocketed more than $5 million in the offering -- enough, he says, "to take care of my family and my family's family for the rest of our lives."
Family, though, is not one of Mr. Popeil's favorite subjects. What he will say sounds bleak. Born in the Bronx, he remembers as a child "baking a potato on a curb because I was hungry." His parents divorced when he was young, and he lived with his paternal grandparents in Chicago, and he felt he missed having a true childhood. "I never had a birthday party," he says.
In his teens, out on his own, he went to work selling his father's inventions in a Walgreen's store in downtown Chicago. His father, Samuel Popeil, was the true innovator in the family. He devised several labor-saving kitchen devices, including the Chop-O-Matic and the Veg-O-Matic, as well as the Pocket Fisherman, a full rod and reel that fold into a small carrying case.
Ron Popeil got his start as a television pitchman hawking his father's products, but the relationship was all business. He doesn't discuss the strangest chapter in the family's history: In 1974, Sam Popeil's second wife, Eloise, was convicted of seeking to have him killed. After she served her sentence, the couple remarried.
FOR a while, father and son ran separate public companies that sold similar merchandise. Ron Popeil's Illinois-based Ronco prospered for over a decade. Traded on the American Stock Exchange, its stock peaked at more than $23 in 1970, making Mr. Popeil worth almost $13 million on paper. But after the recession of 1982-83, sales never really recovered. Cash became tight, and in 1984 the company's creditors, led by the makers of the dehydrator, forced a liquidation of Ronco.
Who would want to buy the detritus of an enterprise built around the telemarketing talents of one man? Why, Mr. Popeil, of course. When Ronco's trademarks and inventory were auctioned off a few years later, he bought them back for about $2 million.
After a hiatus of more than three years, Mr. Popeil decided to make his mark in the burgeoning infomercial business. He had sold millions of dollars' worth of products through 60-second commercials. Imagine what he could do in a half-hour demonstration. He said he spent $33,000 to make the first infomercial for the dehydrator and nearly $60 million over the years to broadcast it on local stations and cable channels across the country -- an investment that resulted in more than $90 million in sales.
He may have come late to the infomercial party, but that hasn't stopped him from laying down rules. "There's only two times in an infomercial when you ask for money," he says. The first comes at the halfway point, after viewers have seen the product in action; the second comes about five minutes later, after a testimonial or two.
Infomercials, hatched in the mid-80's after the Federal Communications Commission relaxed limits on the length of ads, are now studded with celebrities like Cher selling everything from hair colorings to psychic premonitions. But Mr. Popeil allows himself to be upstaged only by his products. "None of the people in my infomercials are given a piece of the action," he said.
He does seed audiences with proud owners from whom he can solicit unscripted testimonials. Like many infomercial producers, he hires people to fill seats at tapings, paying the going rate of $35 plus lunch. As an added bonus, this time around there's another sales medium that seems tailor-made for Ron Popeil: home-shopping channels. He has an exclusive arrangement with QVC, which buys his products in bulk, then puts him on the air to sell them.
If he weren't so good at it, the folks at QVC probably wouldn't put up with him. Backstage in QVC's suburban Philadelphia studio on a late-November morning, Mr. Popeil showed how difficult a self-proclaimed perfectionist can be. After about 10 minutes live in front of the cameras with his dehydrators and his Food Glamorizer, he blamed the producer for cutting him short and not taking the all-important calls from satisfied customers. He had spent three hours the previous night slicing and dicing meat, fruit and vegetables, and he demanded a chance at a payoff.
Before going on again, Mr. Popeil worked over the QVC host, Steve Bryant, pressing for more time to "go to the phones." Lucky for him, Mr. Bryant is a big fan.
"Ron literally invented the business of direct-response TV sales," says Mr. Bryant, who recalls being persuaded to buy a Veg-O-Matic as a young man. "Ron paints in very definable brushstrokes, and every doubt in the customer's mind is wiped away."
Mr. Popeil is in the record books at QVC for selling $1.25 million worth of pasta machines in 12 minutes, Mr. Bryant says -- which works out to about 10 a second. That's why he was disappointed about selling fewer than 23,000 dehydrators ($29.86, plus $6.22 for shipping and handling) before 9 A.M.
THE pasta maker represents a breakthrough for Mr. Popeil. It is the first of his products to be sold in stores that takes a sizable bite of a shopper's paycheck. Most marketers would be pleased to get the broad distribution the Popeil Pasta Maker enjoys. Not Ron Popeil. He describes dealing with retailers as more trouble than it's worth.
Barbara Alonge, a vice president of Macy's in New York, had to persuade Mr. Popeil to supply his product to Macy's, and he agreed to do so only through a middleman, the small-appliance distributor Salton/Maxim Housewares.
"I personally hadn't heard of Ron Popeil," says Leon Dreimann, the Australian-born chief executive of Salton/Maxim, whose first exposure to Mr. Popeil was through an infomercial. "When I saw him making chocolate pasta on TV, that was it. My mouth started watering. I wanted that machine there and then."
On the other hand, when Richard Helfman, president of Creative Technologies in Brooklyn, saw the Popeil machine, he wanted to sue then and there. He soon did, asserting that Mr. Popeil was infringing his company's patents. Unlike some electric pasta makers recently rushed onto the market, Mr. Helfman says, his machines and Mr. Popeil's mix dough and shape it into pasta in the same compartment, allowing users to monitor and change the texture of the noodles while they're making them.
In September, a California judge ruled in Mr. Popeil's favor. Mr. Helfman promises to appeal but doesn't sound too unhappy about Mr. Popeil's televised invasion of what had been a small market. Two years ago, Creative Technologies' pasta-machine sales amounted to less than $7 million; in 1994, he said, they should reach $30 million.
"What Popeil did was really create some consumer awareness so that the category really grew," Mr. Helfman says. "He also hurt the category. He created what I call a herd mentality where lots of manufacturers said, Hey, the pasta machine is hot, and soon we had a dozen-plus brands."
Although Mr. Popeil is not complaining about having one of the hottest kitchen products in department stores this year, the patent episode reinforced his preference for his favorite method of selling: direct to the customer over the small screen.
When QVC put him back on the air at 11 that November morning, Mr. Bryant let him go to the phones. A woman named Pat called in from Lawton, Okla., to profess her love for her Ronco Food Dehydrator.
"Is there one thing you really like to do with it?" Mr. Popeil inquired.
The caller shot back: "Deer jerky."
Ron Popeil grinned like a man who has found his calling.

HEADLINE: The View From Far-Left Field

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Fond Farewell to Big Government" (At Work, Nov. 13) is as disturbing as it is intriguing. Barbara Presley Noble argues that the many beneficiaries of the welfare state have finally turned their back on it, potentially denying similar benefits to the needy and disenfranchised today. I do not see any statistical underpinning for this thesis but encourage her to share any such data with her readers.
Some other reminders: 
 * The Great Depression was itself a direct result of government action -- the Smoot Hawley Tariff -- compounded by an inept response by the Federal Reserve.
* The great redistribution of wealth since the Depression wouldn't have been possible without the steady growth of the United States economy during the last 55 years. If the wealth creators hadn't stayed active, there would have been nothing to redistribute.
* The majority of Americans who stayed away from the polls on Nov. 8 have been drugged into apathy and indifference by a system that sees them as dependents and victims who are unable to improve their own lot.
* Those who don't feel that way turned out in force, tired of the inefficiency and arrogance of that same system, and voted to overhaul it.
This is not necessarily a hardening of the heart but a recognition that any system that denies choice and resists accountability will eventually deliver inferior results.
Ms. Presley's last line is borrowed from Churchill, who said "democracy is the worst system there is -- except for all the others." Well, democracy has spoken; we all had best be sure we understand the message.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Charitable Giving Lags In Chill Mood of the 90's

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Even after he was evicted from his Upper West Side apartment, Glenn A. refused to believe he was a few steps from homelessness. He had lost his job in January, but he could not bring himself to apply for public assistance. The shame, he said, immobilized him.
Later, as he slept in church shelters and asked for food on the street, he met with constant suspicion and contempt. "If you're homeless, the assumption is that you're a drug abuser, an alcoholic, someone who's not motivated to work," said Mr. A., 55. "You get a lot of hostility and not much trust." 
 Mr. A. hopes he will not be homeless for long -- early next year he should start receiving pension payments, and he will be able to live with dignity. But for many other New Yorkers who suddenly find themselves destitute, the humiliation goes on for years. As poverty in this city becomes more painfully visible, charity officials say, public sympathy is turning into resentment.
Organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund say that an era of government budget-tightening and economic insecurity is fostering an "us versus them" mentality that furthers social divisions. They point to the Republican Congressional leaders' "Contract With America," which calls for sweeping welfare cuts.In New York City, they say, crackdowns on subway panhandlers and plans to slash spending for social service agencies send an alarming message: the poor are not to be pitied.
"The current administration has not expressed any interest in doing anything for poor people," said Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the charities supported by Neediest Cases. "It's inconceivable that these people who claim to be so cost-conscious are so unconscious."
The budget cuts and proposals to cut social services come at a time when charitable giving is down. A recent study suggested that the decline, though a national trend, is most pronounced in the Northeast. The study, conducted by Independent Sector, a Washington-based coalition of charities, foundations and corporations, found that people in Northeastern states gave only 1.5 percent of their annual income to charities in 1993. That compares with 2.4 percent in the West and 2.3 percent in the South.
The study found that the drop was primarily due to the recession. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said they worried about having enough money. In 1992, 67 percent expressed that concern.
"My parents always gave a few hundred dollars to charity at Christmastime," said Kathy Maloney, 46, who works for a Manhattan advertising agency. "I would do the same if I could afford it, but this year I don't think it's going to happen."
Some New Yorkers admit their reluctance to give also has to do with mistrust. Peter Duncan, a 23-year-old film maker, said he was tired of watching beggars count out their change for bottles of liquor.
"I really think most of the people you're seeing on the streets have problems with drugs and alcohol," Mr. Duncan said. "They've made a choice, and I don't need to support their habit, either through taxes or giving them money on the subway."
David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, said the category of "undeserving poor" was expanding in many New Yorkers' eyes. In recent years, he said, the category has come to include people on welfare and the children of drug addicts.
"If people can distance themselves even from children, if we believe that there is no common humanity, then we will have all sorts of awful effects," Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Jones also said that government cuts to social service agencies encourage the perception that poor people take advantage of the system. But according to the Community Service Society's 1993 poverty study, only 54.5 percent of New Yorkers who qualify for public assistance actually receive it, down from 61.7 percent in 1992.
Terry J. Rosenberg, who conducted the study, attributes the drop to tightened regulations on government aid and a growing reluctance to ask for help.
"They make it so bad that even if you need to ask for help, you'd rather die," Ms. McLaughlin said. "We generate that shame and we feed on that shame, even when these people desperately need help."
Mr. A. finally overcame his shame at a soup kitchen run by the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. The organization is supported by UJA-Federation of New York, one of the charities supported by Neediest Cases, which is conducting its 83d appeal. Someone there introduced him to a social worker, Karen Norden, who helped him find temporary housing and apply for public assistance. If Mr. A. had asked for help before he was evicted, Ms. Norden said, he probably would not have become homeless.
"The people who have worked all their lives and aren't used to being poor are very ashamed," Ms. Norden said. "They blame themselves, and they don't want anyone to know."
Ms. McLaughlin said she thought the perceived hostility toward the poor was mostly political spin and did not necessarily represent the public mood. "I am not ready to believe the American people are heartless," she said. "Poor people aren't the only ones who need services. It could be any of us, God forbid."
If New Yorkers are resentful about anything, Ms. McLaughlin said, it is that various programs to help the poor have not made homelessness and hunger disappear.
"I think people are frustrated because these problems seem intractable," she said. "In a sense we're embarrassed about it, because we've made some good-faith efforts to do something about it. Why are we still plagued by these troubles?"

 BODY:
Your Nov. 27 article was right on the mark except for Jack Shannahan's usual modesty over his role in preserving Milford's original high school.
I have been involved in its preservation efforts for many years and can firmly state that Jack's efforts saved the building within days of its demolition. 
 Preserving Connecticut's past is not a romantic notion of keeping alive the past, but it is a way of economically using buildings that are irreplaceable either because of their construction or their distinctive architecture. The "square glass boxes" of today cannot compare with the style and practicality of older buildings with solid walls, sturdy construction and air flow systems that allow you to open a window for fresh air and not wait for a computer sensor to monitor air quality.
The renovation work by our nonprofit corporation at River Park Apartments was completed in March 1993 and we have always been fully occupied. Our waiting list is longer than we can accommodate and the building, located downtown along the river, is convenient for local services and it has been restored to its former dignity as a local landmark.
This would not have happened without Jack Shannahan. After reading the article, we should all walk through our cities and towns and ask ourselves how we want to leave them for our children and grandchildren.

Hardy Perenials In U.S. Farm Policy

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
POLICY buffs who enjoyed this year's impassioned debate over health care will love the battles next year over farm policy. Congress has to agree by next fall on how to replace the expiring 1990 farm rules. For the new Republican majority, it will be a stark test of how deeply it really believes that the Federal Government does more harm than good by interfering with market forces.
 In the end, the battle is bound to illustrate just how tough it will be for Republicans to deliver on their promise to trim the role of Government in the average citizen's life.

 
 
Bewildering Barriers
 Current farm policy looks at first glance to be an easy target for radical reformers. No one is denying it is made up of a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting programs, many of them dating from the Great Depression of the 1930's, when both farming and rural life in general were vastly different. Most of the billions of dollars spent these days on subsidies goes to big corporations or farmers who are wealthier than the average taxpayer.
 Farm programs are intended to boost incomes for producers of dairy products and crops through a bewildering array of barriers to the free flow of goods and prices. There are import quotas protecting the dairy industry and crops like sugar and peanuts. The Agriculture Department sets price floors for the dairy industry by region. And it enforces marketing programs, developed by the growers themselves, of more than 40 different fruits and crops.
 The Government also provides bargain loans and subsidized insurance. And, in a program subject to unpredictable multi-billion dollar swings in cost to taxpayers, Washington makes direct payments to corn, wheat, rice and cotton growers when market prices for those crops fall below Federally designated targets.
 Critics say those policies contribute to ills ranging from the loss of Indonesian rain forests to the decline of the small American family farm. Farmers for their part have deep misgivings about whether the benefits they get are worth all the restrictions they must also accept on how they farm. A recent survey by the University of Illinois and Purdue University of 10,000 farmers found that 37 percent wanted the entire system scrapped, almost as many as the 41 percent who supported it.
 For all its faults, though, American farm policy has a long track record of winning bipartisan support, and some who have followed it over the years wonder why there is so much griping. Americans spend about 12 percent of their disposable income on food, among the lowest percentage in the world.
 The nation's farmers set new production records this year in corn, soybeans, cotton and rice and, with cooperative weather, clearly have the tools to break those records for these and other crops in years to come. Farm goods make up one of the brightest spots in the trade picture -- American farmers are the world's most productive -- and with exports invariably top imports by a wide margin.
 Moreover, farm incomes have been rising in recent years and farm debt has fallen. To be sure, small farms continue to disappear by the thousands, but the rate is down sharply from 30 years ago. Soil is being more carefully preserved. And the newer pesticides are more benign environmentally and used more carefully.
 "I think the programs are working reasonably well," said Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who lost his seat last month and now is said to be the leading candidate to replace Mike Espy as Agriculture Secretary in January.
 The trend in recent times has been to renew the concept of Federal income support for farmers every fifth year, but each time at a lower level and with new environmental, production and accounting strings attached. Payments have already fallen to less than half the record $25.8 billion in direct assistance farmers received in 1986 as the result of reforms in farm legislation passed in 1985 and 1990.
 This year's bumper crops drove prices down to levels that are expected to send the payments soaring by several billion dollars next year, creating new fodder for critics who see the programs as budget dynamite. But Republicans who will lead the debate for their party are already warning off those inclined to push for sweeping reform. "There's something to be said for stability," said Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who will head the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Roberts' constituents include wheat farmers who have been among the biggest beneficiaries of subsidies.
 The problem for those who would settle for tinkering with the existing structure to save money -- say, by decreasing the percentage of land on which a farmer can get support payments or lowering the price targets at which the subsidies kick in -- is that many farmers may simply drop out. That would make a shambles of related "voluntary" programs like those requiring farmers to accept soil conservation rules in order to remain eligible for subsidies.

 
 
'Close to the Bottom'
 "We are pretty close to the bottom of the barrel on what you can cut and still get voluntary compliance in other areas," said Abner Womack, an agricultural economist at the University of Missouri who has studied various possible packages of farm policy for the Food and Agricultural Policy Institute, a research organization sponsored by six universities.
 With the trend toward a slimmed-down Agriculture Department already under way, most notably in plans announced last week to shut down hundreds of field offices, the department looks more dependent than ever on farmers' willingness to observe both the letter and spirit of regulations.
 Congress may get a shock when it adds up the cost of replacing the most popular pieces of the current policies. If the Government does not subsidize exports, American farmers will be playing on an uneven field in world markets and lose market share to subsidized foreign producers.
 If it does not pay to protect rural environments -- through incentives to farmers or bigger budgets for enforcers -- environmental problems will mount. And if Congress does not want to risk much more volatility in food prices, the Government will have to play a role in supply management.
 Indeed, when it comes to getting the Government out of agriculture, it looks like you cannot get there from here.

HEADLINE: U.S. and 33 Hemisphere Nations Agree to Create Free-Trade Zone

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Determined to sweep aside trade barriers from Alaska to Argentina, President Clinton and 33 other leaders of Western Hemisphere countries agreed today to create a free-trade zone in the Americas. Talks are to start next month, and the leaders agreed to have a treaty in place and start carrying it out by 2005.
"There will be real progress by the end of the century," vowed Mr. Clinton, the host for the first regional summit meeting in 27 years. 
 "When our work is done, the free trade area of the Americas will stretch from Alaska to Argentina" he said. "In less than a decade, if current trends continue, this hemisphere will be the world's largest market."
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said "there was absolutely no dissent" from Latin and Caribbean leaders on creating the free-trade zone. The question mark is the United States.
Mark B. Rosenberg, a Latin America specialist at Florida International University, said: "The real pitfalls are the U.S. Congress and the U.S. public. They are not ready to accept open markets in the hemisphere. This was a carrot to the Latins."
Signaling qualified support for free trade, five Republican Congressmen, led by Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the next Speaker of the House, wrote a letter to Mr. Clinton offering their support for "fast track" negotiating authority on a trade treaty in exchange for withdrawal of environmental and labor conditions from trade bills. Such authority enables the Administration to submit a treaty to Congress for a yes-or-no vote without changes.
Some Latin American leaders have criticized the 2005 date, saying it will allow free trade talks to drag on for a decade. In contrast, the Pacific Basin countries set a date -- 2020 -- for abolishing all regional trade barriers.
The Bolivian President, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, urged the group today to hold summit meetings every two years to follow through on the goals set here.
"It would be a tragic mistake to engage in a prolonged process where struggling nations with fragile democracies must wait 10, 15, maybe 20 years in an economic purgatory," he said. "The cost could be nothing less than the democratic foundations of our countries."
But others note that the plan that is being approved here this weekend sets a concrete timetable for ministerial meetings to negotiate specific moves toward a free-trade hemisphere.
"It's not a matter of waiting," said Ron Brown, the United States Secretary of Commerce. He said the Admnistration had scheduled over the next six months regional meetings of trade ministers, transport ministers and telecommunications ministers.
This follow-up process differentiates the Americas summit from the Pacific summit, said Ambler H. Moss Jr., director of the North-South Center at the University of Miami.
"The Miami process is more credible," he said. "The Pacific meeting set the date without the process. This summit sets the process without the date."
While the gathering here is billed as a trade summit, the leaders are approving measures for cooperation in other areas: reducing corruption, confiscating drug trafficking fortunes, freeing foreign investment and improving education.
To reduce corruption, the leaders are to agree to adopt conflict-of-interest standards for government workers and to adopt "stiff penalties" for illicit enrichment. In a region where a common response to a corruption charge is to flee the country, the regional leaders are to develop an agreement to allow extradition and prosecution of people charged with corruption.
"The corruption and democracy talk is a little patronizing," complained a diplomat from Brazil, which in the last two years has purged its Congress and toppled a President because of corruption charges. "The Americans don't bring up corruption with the Europeans because it might embarrass the Italians and the French. Democracy is a taboo with the Pacific Basin, because it might offend Deng Xiaoping."
On drug trafficking, the leaders agreed to push for legislation to freeze and confiscate the proceeds of money laundering. To follow up on this weekend's promises, a regional meeting of justice ministers on the issue is scheduled for next year.
With each Latin leader eagerly competing for foreign investment, a vote was also expected on forming a hemispheric group that would draw up guidelines to liberalize and integrate capital markets.
"After trade, liberalization of capital markets could be the most important part of the summit," Mr. Moss said. "With business input, the countries are going to prepare an inventory of investment obstacles. The next step would be a hemispheric investment code."
Some financial analysts say they believe that after Latin America's current privatization and stock market booms run their course, the region will have to take new steps to maintain a high level of new foreign investment.
"There are still significant amounts of flight capital outside of Latin America," William R. Rhodes, the vice chairman of Citibank, said in an interview Friday. "To attract that back, plus new foreign investment, there is no doubt that they have to continue to open up their financial markets."
In line with the new free-market language spoken by Latin leaders today, the 28-page "Action Plan" also encourages governments to harness private investment to build highways, electricity and telecommunications projects.
According to the World Bank, Latin America has the world's most uneven distribution of wealth. The richest 20 percent of Brazilians earn 26 times what the poorest 20 percent make. In the United States, the ratio is 9 to 1; in India, 5 to 1.
Recognizing that markets are slow in solving urgent social problems, the plan says "nearly one half of the hemisphere's population still lives in poverty," and it sets ambitious goals for education and health.
Calling for universal access to education, the document sets the year 2010 as the target for all the hemisphere's children to be completing primary school, and for 75 percent to be completing high school.
"If this goal is achieved, it will help eradicate child labor and give children a greater hope of acquiring the skills and knowledge needed in a modern global economy," Hillary Rodham Clinton said here today at a symposium on children.
Turning to health, the heads of government set the year 2000 as the goal for cutting child mortality rates by one third from 1990 levels and maternal mortality by one half from 1990 levels. The leaders also agreed to phase out leaded gasoline from the hemisphere by the end of this decade.
"Here in the United States, for example, we are not doing enough to insure that women receive adequate pre- and post-natal health care, particularly poor women and teen-agers," Mrs. Clinton said. "In 1992, 22 percent of pregnant women in this country received no pre-natal care."

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS READY TO BATTLE G.O.P. OVER NEW BUDGET

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Democrats, both in the White House and on Capitol Hill, are keenly aware that the first great defining battle of the 1996 election cycle may center on the Federal budget, and they are struggling to find a way to turn it to their advantage.
The stakes are apparent to every Democrat, particularly the Congressional leaders who met with White House officials this week in a room at a Capitol they no longer control, near a portrait of the late Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. that struck some as a particularly poignant backdrop. 
 The plea from many Democrats, there and in other somber meetings in recent days, has been simple enough: The party must reclaim the allegiance of the middle class if it has any hope of reversing the Republican electoral victories of last month. The President's budget may be dead on arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress, as many predict, but it will be an important political statement in what one Democratic pollster, Geoffrey Garin, called the start of "a two-year war for the political mainstream."
The White House has been bombarded with advice in recent weeks, much of it contradictory. It has been urged to be bold, with big new cuts in Federal programs, and it has been urged to simply lie back and let the Republicans do the hard work of finding the money to pay for their promises. (Some Democrats describe this as the "give them enough rope and they'll hang themselves" strategy.) It has been urged to stay the course of the 1993 budget agreement and push for even more deficit reduction, and it has been admonished to concentrate on tax relief for middle-income families.
President Clinton will begin to make some choices at a series of meetings in the coming week, but one broad thematic direction is already increasingly clear: Despite its cost, some form of middle-class tax cut is widely expected to be a part of the Administration's budget proposal.
The House Republicans included a $500-a-child tax credit in the "Contract With America," their blueprint for the midterm election. For his part, Mr. Clinton promised a tax cut for the middle class during the 1992 Presidential campaign, and the idea has strong support among Democrats in the House.
"We need to make a clear statement to those workers who have been the most hard-pressed and have fallen the furthest behind in the past 15 years," Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the new House minority leader, said in an interview on Friday.
"People earning between $15,000 and $30,000 split their vote in '94," Mr. Gephardt added. "We got 58 percent of those people in '92. If we had gotten 58 percent of them in '94, we'd have held the House."
Similarly the White House is trying to respond to another message from last month's elections by moving toward deep cuts at an array of Federal agencies. The President's advisers contend that all these moves are simply Clinton being Clinton, not an attempt to "me too" the Republicans.
"What the Republicans succeeded in doing was stealing huge chunks of the Clinton agenda, which is reform," said Paul Begala, a longtime political adviser to the President. "Congressional reform, budget reform, line item veto, welfare reform and a middle-income tax cut. The difference is, Clinton is serious about it, while the Republicans are just posturing."
But Bill McInturff, a prominent Republican pollster and strategist, asserted, "My guess is what the President is doing is readily transparent to the American people."
"When Democrats say, 'Maybe we should cut this Cabinet agency or that one,' " he added, "we should just say over and over again: 'Hey, he had two years to do this. He's just trying to get re-elected.' "
Indeed, many Democrats fear that no matter how artful their positioning, the Republicans will have not only their first legislative control over taxing and spending in 40 years but political control of the coming battle as well.
The Democrats worry that getting into a fiscally dangerous tax-cut bidding war with Republicans, like the one that occurred in 1981, would erode last year's hard-won progress on the budget deficit.
"We could accept everything the Republicans suggested and everything the Democrats suggested, and the only people who lose are the future generations," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Democrats also worry about the possibility of deep cuts in social spending programs, or being blamed for cuts in popular programs while the Republicans get credit for the tax breaks. They are also uncertain about the course of the budget process under the new Republican majority; some are already saying the Republicans will lean more toward accounting gimmicks than genuine spending cuts to make their promises add up.
"Part of our budget strategy will be making sure they make those hard choices, because historically they have not," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland.
The Democrats are still seething at having received so little credit for what they saw as hard choices on taxes and spending cuts in the 1993 budget agreement. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democratic member of the House Budget Committee from Rochester, N.Y., said, "We did a wonderful job on that budget, and nobody knew."
These anxieties are roiling Democratic lawmakers, who are still, by and large, in a state of shock and grief over the elections and still wary of putting too much of their political fate in the hands of Mr. Clinton. One prominent Democrat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "I think there's a feeling in the caucus that one of the reasons they're in the minority now is because they followed his lead."
There is, in fact, some talk that House Democrats will push forward with a budget of their own. "We're going to do what we see as the right thing for our voters and our constituents," said Mr. Gephardt. "We'd hope that would coincide with what the President is doing. But if it doesn't, we'll do what we need to do."
Still, there is a recognition that like it or not, "whatever the President does will be perceived as the budget of the Democratic Party," as one House Democratic strategist put it.
While much of the planning between Congress and the White House has just begun, some themes are emerging. Congressional Democrats hope to present their party's middle-class tax cut as one that is fairly and truly aimed at benefiting middle-income Americans. Mr. Gephardt and others suggest tying it to income -- rather than to the number of a family's children as in the "Contract With America" -- and imposing a cutoff at around $75,000. (The proposal in the Republicans' "contract" would benefit people with annual incomes of up to $200,000.)
The Administration is also trying to present itself as the guardian of fiscal responsibility, unwilling to give ground on the deficit, a stance that poses the knotty problem of finding a credible way to pay for a tax cut.
Administration officials are well aware of uncertainty in the weeks ahead. "What this really is, is the first move in a chess game," one of them said. "And sometimes after three moves, you can see the whole rest of the game, and sometimes you can't."
Some analysts suggest that no matter how strategic the White House tries to be, the underlying dynamics of this process are simply out of its control. Others say the President cannot afford to cede this ground -- the very economic issues that drove his campaign for the White House -- to the Republicans.
Mr. McInturff, the Republican pollster, outlined one very chilling set of options for Mr. Clinton: "We should try to make sure the President has two choices. One, he could govern from a center-right coalition, and face Jesse Jackson as a potential third-party candidate or virulent primaries. And two, he can veto what we do and lose in '96 because he's been pushed out of the center and to the left."

HEADLINE: China's Hidden Army of Workers Strives to Adapt

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIANYANG, China

 BODY:
Fearing nuclear attack from either the United States or the Soviet Union, China in the mid-1960's undertook what was perhaps the largest industrial relocation in history to protect its strategic factories.
Now, more than 20 years after World War III failed to occur as Mao Zedong had predicted, some of the country's top scientists and engineers are still trickling down from production lines in remote mountains and caves to gleaming cities like this one in south-central China. 
 They are designing television sets, fax machines, satellite receivers and, perhaps, the battery system for the next electric car. Here, they are setting up new factories and sending delegations to New York seeking investment capital for high-technology ventures, They hope to find a market for the talent and the skills they mortgaged for so long to Mao's apocalyptic vision under a policy that relocated hundreds of important industries in the 1960's and 1970's to remote canyons and caves in northwestern and southwestern China.
"You know, there are many things in common with the manufacture of bombs and in the manufacture of automobiles," said Zhu Senyuan, 48, a computer automation specialist at a military institute now helping 600 factories across China convert armaments lines to commercial production.
But many of the strategic factories are old or redundant and, despite their relocation to cities on the plains, they are far from potential markets at a time when China is trying to reform its economy.
The cost of the top-secret program was staggering. Barry Naughton, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, has estimated that during the peak years China was spending 40 to 50 percent of its national investment resources under the so-called Third Line policy, and that it had sent hundreds of thousands of workers to the mountains where they functioned as "human wave" construction brigades to chisel caverns, tunnel for railroads, transport machinery and build assembly lines in remote and forbidding landscapes.
"It very substantially slowed down China's economic growth and on some levels contributed to the collapse of central planning," said Mr. Naughton, a specialist on China's economy who has conducted one of the few studies on the Third Line and its impact.
Beijing's central planners "got so tangled up in directing resources to these remote sites that they never could complete these projects or make them economically viable," he said during a recent visit to China.
By the time the Third Line was completed, Mao had died and it stood as another monument to his willpower over the Chinese.
"The decision by Mao to build the Third Line was a big mistake," said Hua Di, a rocket scientist who spent months living in Third Line bases testing China's first strategic nuclear missiles and who now lives in California. "We have wasted a lot of money by building this Third Line," which, he added, gave China little additional security.
"If you have a rocket program and a bomb or missile falls on just one of the many component factories, then you have no program," Mr. Hua said. "But the leaders were ignorant of this aspect of modern technology."
In its heyday, planners of the Third Line ordered steel mills, nuclear weapons plants and huge truck assembly lines, first built in coastal provinces or near borders with the Soviet Union, disassembled and transported over treacherous mountain roads or paths to what Mao thought would be an impregnable "rear base," or "third line of defense" to sustain a Chinese war effort. The "first" line was China's coastal defenses and the "second" line was a fall-back position on the central China plain.
To build the Third Line, railways were ripped up in some populous provinces to build new links through unpopulated hinterlands.
The consequences of the program are still radiating into the present because the construction was so large in scale and took so long, 15 years in some cases, leaving China with an uneconomical and inefficient industrial architecture. Today, the plants are still being dismantled, abandoned or turned to other uses.
"There is a major investment in this region," said Chen Zhixiang, deputy director of the Mianyang economic and planning commission, "but the problem is that the investment is spread out through canyons some distance from the city. Our production and research bases are located in the mountains and accessible only over very difficult roads."
Even Mianyang is difficult to reach. It can take four hours to travel the 60 miles of winding two-lane road from Chengdu, the provincial capital.
Somewhere amid the peaks and crags that are visible from these clean streets is China's largest wind tunnel. It is too big to relocate, so aerodynamic engineers from all over the country must come here with their aircraft or rocket models to carry out large-scale tests.
One canyon holds a nuclear reactor for making plutonium for nuclear weapons, another an electron accelerator for high-energy physics experiments and yet another a large radar works. To the east is a rocket body factory and the entire spectrum of electronics industries, many of which have transferred part of their production here.
Today, much of the burden of finding employment for the Third Line work force has fallen on the governments of inland provinces, whose economies are not as strong as those in China's coastal belt. There have been some successes, especially in the electronics industry, but these may not be assured over the long term if China lowers its trade barriers as a member of the World Trade Organization.
"They have moved hundreds of factories down to the nearest cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu," Mr. Naughton said, "and they also gave to these factories the privilege to move into new and lucrative product areas."
But as China's market has developed, Mr. Naughton said, most of these privileged military enterprises are facing competition that in the long run threatens to undermine them.
One example is the Long Rainbow radar factory, which first leaped into the television business two decades ago. Its parent factory is still in the mountains, making aviation radars for the Chinese Air Force.
"It can be said that the radar factory is also engaged in civilian production," said Li Yalian, whose title is chief of propaganda, "because they are making the remote controls for the television sets."
Long Rainbow's 60 to 70 percent market share for domestic television sales has begun to slip as Chinese consumers show a preference for foreign brands. Wang Junmai, the assistant general manager of the Mianyang plant, said top managers had been scouring Tokyo, New York and Los Angeles for investors willing to finance a broader range of products with an updated production line to keep the giant enterprise and its 6,000 employees viable. But so far foreign investors have been reluctant to put their money into a military enterprise.
"We want to expand into cellular phones, audiovisual and telecommunications," Mr. Wang said, imploring a visitor to "please tell the world about our potential and our advantages."
Governor Xiao Yang of Sichuan Province said that while the prospects for the best of the Third Line factories were good, nothing seemed certain about the bulk of the rest.
"The state of the Third Line industries is that one-third of them are doing very well," he said in an interview, "but another third are just breaking even and the last third are in very bad shape."
With two-thirds of these industries at break-even levels or worse, their future very much depends on sustained high growth in China's economy.
Local governments throughout inland China will be saddled with Third Line problems for many years to come, Mr. Xiao said. For the workers, it means adapting without a system that provided job security and social programs regardless of productivity.
"It's really hard," he said. "The workers have been living out of the so-called iron rice bowl for so long."

An Epidemic Averted: Foot-in-Mouth Disease

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 10

 BODY:
After the narrow victory in Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement last year, the Clinton Administration's trade strategy was clear: drop the "N" in NAFTA and create an American free-trade zone that stretches from the cold tundra of northern Canada to the frigid southern tip of Tierra del Fuego.
Every draft agreement faxed around the hemisphere until a few days ago referred almost absent-mindedly to AFTA. Until the Brazilians spoke up. AFTA might roll off the tongue, they pointed out, but in Portuguese it means an open sore in the mouth, a less-than-auspicious acronym for what could become the world's largest free trade zone. 
 "It is caused by foot-and-mouth disease, I think," said Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, the Brazilian Ambassador to the United States. "It would be a shame to make people think of a disease that is nearly eradicated every time they heard about free trade."
In Washington, the negotiators at the United States trade representative's office scrambled. And in the communique to be issued on Sunday, the newest pact to link the hemisphere will be known, less felicitously, as the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Mickey Kantor, the chief American negotiator, politely stepped around the issue today. The new F.T.A.A. "may not be as clever, but it is quite appropriate," he said.
Such nomenclature is a big deal in foreign policy these days. One can almost see the confusion on the faces of diplomats trying to clear their minds of the buzzwords of the cold war -- MIRVed missiles dismantled by START agreements -- so that they can get accustomed to the new and somewhat less weighty lingo of commercial accords, a subject that used to be relegated to the musty corners of the State Department's economic section.
No more. The White House, fresh from the APEC conference (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation, but there is fierce disagreement over whether the last word should be "area," "zone" or "caucus"), even published a guide to the subregional trade agreements of Latin America: Mercosur, the Group of Three, Caricom, the Andean Pact, the Central American Common Market and Aladi.
"We're hoping a few will merge," one of Mr. Kantor's aides said the other day.
But just as past Administrations tried to manage the cold war by playing Soviet bloc nations against each other, this one is hoping for a battle among acronomic trade groups.
The idea is to create what Fred Bergsten, a Washington economist with close ties to the White House, calls "a competitive liberalization process." In other words, as Latin Americans lower barriers, the Asians will feel the pressure not to be left behind, and the Europeans will jump in as well. In short, the essence of modern American foreign policy is to create leapfrogging trade pacts.
 
One More Snub for Castro
 If Fidel Castro was miffed to be the only leader in the Western Hemisphere not invited to the Summit of the Americas, the insult was compounded on Friday as the 34-nation meeting opened. One of the few Cubans who did show up, Carlos Santana Ojeda, the anchor of an economics program on a Government-run station, announced that he was taking advantage of the moment to defect.
He told reporters in Florida that he was tired of trying to find ways to portray Cuba's crippling economic problems in a positive light, as his bosses at the station required. Escaping during the summit meeting, he said, was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get out."
The defection was a welcome distraction for the White House, which was trying to play down the sharp differences in Cuba policy among the nations attending the meeting. Virtually all of the South American countries represented here have trade links with the Castro Government and argue that the United States should end its trade embargo against Cuba.
Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, described America's snub to Mr. Castro as a missed opportunity. "We believe the more you do trade and business with a country like that, democracy will come faster," Mr. Chretien told reporters.
Mr. Chretien sounded much like Commerce Secretary Ron Brown defending the Administration's policy of "commercial engagement," which keeps questions of human rights out of decisions about trade links. But the Administration saw no contradiction in its policy.
"It would have been thoroughly inconsistent with the idea of the summit to have the one non-democracy in the hemisphere present," said Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser.
 
The Old Hand in the Wings
 The last time most Americans heard of Roger C. Altman he was resigning as Deputy Treasury Secretary and seemed headed back to Wall Street, where he was an accomplished investment banker. Mr. Altman, a rising star in the Administration, was forced out after some in Congress accused him of misleading them over the nature of contacts between the Treasury and the White House about Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which is at the center of the Whitewater affair.
But Mr. Altman, who if history had swept in a different direction last summer might now be the Treasury Secretary-designate succeeding Lloyd Bentsen, moved only two blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue, to the Old Executive Office Building. From there, very quietly, he has been in charge of the White House effort to organize this vast gathering. It was Mr. Altman who spent last week briefing the President. It is Mr. Altman who can be found just out of camera view at each major announcement, standing on the sidelines, a big loose-leaf binder of trade notes, stamped "Secret," tucked under one arm.
Mr. Altman says that he decided to stay in Washington through the end of the school year to create less disruption for his family. "I'm done," he said the other day, "unless there is another special project."
 
 
Learning the Value of Trade
 There is only so much trade that anyone can stomach in a weekend, so the hosts of the meeting made sure there were distractions.
The biggest party off all, the "Concert of the Americas" was staged tonight by the Kennedy Center. The United States contribution to the music included performances by Liza Minelli, Patti LaBelle and Paul Anka.
Then President Clinton took the leaders to Fishers Island for dinner at a 200-acre estate built by a family that really understood the value of trade -- the Vanderbilts.

HEADLINE: Miami's Cuban-Americans Rally for Solidarity Against Castro

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Thousands of Cuban-Americans marched through the streets of Little Havana to the Orange Bowl today for a rally against Fidel Castro. But while President Clinton and 33 Latin American leaders were here for a regional summit meeting, Mr. Castro wasn't -- he wasn't invited.
The demonstration, one of the largest staged by Miami's Cubans, was intended to draw the attention of leaders who are sympathetic to Mr. Castro and who favor lifting the United States' economic embargo of Cuba. Organizers said it was the first time that they could address the hemisphere's leaders directly to ask for support. 
 "Cuba should be free and it should be free soon," said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Miami. "What's lacking is solidarity in the hemisphere. There should be a total blockade like there was of Haiti."
Although Cuba was not on the meeting's agenda, President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina said he would bring it up as the leaders met today. President Clinton sent a letter on Friday to Unidad Cubana, the coalition of groups behind today's protest, to reiterate his desire to see "peaceful, democratic change in Cuba," a White House official said.
Cuban-American groups that take a milder stance toward Cuba also tried to reach the leaders this week, staging a demonstration Thursday in Miami to protest Cuba's exclusion from the meeting and to chant their opposition to the embargo.
Today, eight travel agencies licensed to provide charter flights between the United States and Cuba took out a full-page ad in El Nuevo Herald to criticize the Administration's decision a few months ago to further restrict travel to the island.
"We feel that no government should deny the right for people to visit their families," they said. And referring to the sometimes violent acrimony that exists between the different sides of the Cuba issue, the agency owners wrote, "Unfortunately we cannot march through the streets in Miami, since wanting a peaceful transition in Cuba has earned us the title of Communist sympathizers and we would have to fear for our lives."
But the march today was by far the largest public expression from the Cuban-American community, although it fell short of the more than 100,000 people the organizers said they expected. The emergency operations center in Dade County estimated the crowd at 60,000; the manager of the Orange Bowl, Max Cruz, put the number at 90,000 by the end of the event. Larger demonstrations were held in 1989 and 1991 in support of the embargo.
Despite some angry signs about the continued detention of more than 20,000 Cuban refugees at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station and in Panama, the mood was festive and the event peaceful.
The march began at noon, led by a group of students who carried a burning torch and Cuban flags. By early afternoon the 80,000-seat stadium was half full with thousands outside waiting to get in.
Rafael Dausa, spokesman for the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, said the numbers "neither intimidate nor worry us because in our country we have 11 million people supporting the revolution." He said most countries at the summit meeting voted in the United Nations to condemn the American embargo last October, and the rest abstained.
"That vote showed that there is total disagreement between Latin American and Caribbean countries and the United States over Cuban policy," he said.

HEADLINE: Acknowledging Mistakes, Con Ed Takes Steps to Mend Its Ways

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Nine Consolidated Edison workers stood a bit awkwardly around a dented 55-gallon drum with a gash on its side that had spilled a puddle of what looked a lot like maple syrup.
In fact, it was maple syrup, but today it represented PCB's. The barrel had supposedly fallen from a truck in Queens, and the drill was to train the workers in how to handle the environmental challenge, the kind of test that the utility has faced often in the last few years, and which, according to Federal prosecutors and state environmental officials, it has often failed. 
 Con Ed -- New York State's biggest and strongest utility -- is seeking to clean up its image, and more importantly, its record. "Each and every person in our company has got to get religion as concerns the environment," the chairman, Eugene R. McGrath, said in a recent speech to employees. It is a goal that could play a powerful role in its survival.
It would not quite be a jailhouse conversion, but it would be close. The company is scheduled to be sentenced next month after pleading guilty to a felony for the way it handled asbestos in the 1989 steam explosion in Gramercy Park. It also recently settled 319 state environmental charges for actions over several years by agreeing to pay $14 million. Further, the state's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation says the company's pattern of violations is evidence of serious problems from top to bottom.
What lies ahead for the company is more scrutiny and, quite probably, more public criticism of the corporate culture that produced its recent problems, and perhaps the discovery of a few more skeletons. Under its $14 million settlement with the state, Con Edison has agreed to bring in outside auditors to thoroughly investigate its practices and its property, including contaminated sites that state regulators say they did not know existed until Con Ed voluntered the information. The company also has large volumes of hazardous materials at various sites in the city, which it must dispose of.
Con Edison has chosen to try to mend its ways at a moment of great upheaval in the utility industry, when new Federal rules that are meant to encourage competition are threatening nearly every electric utility's monopoly status. The company may be especially vulnerable to competition from lower-cost producers because its electricity prices are among the highest in the country. To continue to prosper, it needs the good will of regulators and elected officials, experts say.
"It doesn't look good to have a pattern of environmental problems occur," said Barry M. Abramson, a utility analyst at Prudential Securities. He said such problems can sway elected officials, who often have wide powers over regulated utilities.
Many of the company's 17,000 employees will undergo drills, like the one with the maple syrup, to familiarize themselves with the rules governing environmental contamination. Employees who are more likely to face accidents will get more extensive training.
The new training guidelines stress that protecting people is of utmost importance, followed by the environment and company equipment. Previously, the environment ranked third behind the equipment.
But the company still has a long way to go in improving its handling of emergencies, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and others.
A study of 24 other major electric utilities earlier this year by the Council on Economic Priorities found that from 1987 to 1992, Con Ed's OSHA record was the worst of the group. That record has made some skeptical of the utility's current safety efforts, and they see the company's problems as more deeply rooted.
"You can write all the policies you want on asbestos and PCB's, but if you don't enforce it with middle management, you might as well not even write it," said Michael D. Ivancich, the safety director of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America, which represents about 12,000 Con Ed employees. For instance, he said the company has adopted a system of paying middle managers bonuses for getting jobs done with fewer resources, and that has encouraged them to cut corners.
Mr. Ivancich is not alone in his suspicions. Richard Brodsky, the chairman of the New York State Assembly's Environment Committee, says he will hold hearings on whether management bonuses went to individuals who supervised operations with environmental violations.
Mr. McGrath, the company's chairman, said that the problems like oil leaking from its pipelines or contaminants being dumped into the sewer system were not a product of the utility's corporate culture, but rather are predictable legacies of operating an old system in a densely populated urban environment.
"We've made some mistakes here," Mr. McGrath acknowledged. Environmental problems will continue, he said, although there are some steps the company can take to reduce the frequency and severity of illegal releases to the environment.
Should the company have taken those steps sooner?
"It's easier when you look back and say, 'You should have known,' " he said. "But it's a reasonable question."
A day later, Mr. McGrath called back to stress that the company is embarrassed by its record.
"It's not the kind of company we want to be, or our public wants us to be," he said. And he said there was, in fact, a problem with the corporate culture, at least at the time that the events in question occurred, ending in 1991; he had taken the question to be about the corporate attitude and practice today, he said.
And more violations are likely to turn up as part of Con Ed's settlement with the Environmental Conservation Department. In addition to agreeing to pay a state penalty of $9 million, and another $5 million into an environmental fund, Con Ed has agreed to a remedial program that is the most extensive his department has ever won, said Langdon Marsh, the commissioner of environmental conservation.
After the company pleaded guilty on Oct. 31 to failing to disclose that a steam pipe explosion in Gramercy Park in 1989 had spread asbestos -- more than 200 pounds, as it later turned out -- it promised to bring in an outside firm to perform an "environmental audit," a process in which teams of experts spend months interviewing employees, examining procedures, and sometimes even sampling the dirt and water.
To assure that the audit is done correctly, Con Edison hired two prominent environmental lawyers, both of whom have successfully sued the company in the past: Ross Sandler, a former transportation commissioner in New York City, and Angus Macbeth, a former environmental prosecutor in the Justice Department. Both were formerly at the Natural Resources Defense Council, where they represented fishermen against the utility.
Those commitments could eventually produce a bigger bill than the $14 million the company agreed to pay to settle the environmental charges.
"Depending on what your findings are, it could run into multimillions," said Jerrold D. Atlas, president of Corporation for Land Environmental Audits and Remediation, an auditing firm in Hastings-on-Hudson. Audits that find superfund sites can cost companies hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.
And the costs go beyond the out-of-pocket cash, which thus far is not a major concern, at least in the financial sense.
"We don't think the incremental cost is going to be important to them, because they're such a large company," said Mr. Abramson of Prudential Securities. The $14 million that Con Ed agreed to pay is two-tenths of one percent of its revenues.
"Where we would worry, from an investor's point of view, is how is this going to affect the attitude of the regulators who are going to be deciding on the company's rate cases?" Mr. Abramson said. "Sometimes these intangibles can affect the way a particular commissioner or two might vote, particularly if that commissioner has a strong interest in environmental matters."
Con Ed's recent problems come after a long period in which it had a blissfully low profile. The utility was the frequent target of derision after the blackouts of 1965 and 1977, and politicians could win elections by running against the company.
Now, the company's customers hardly ever face voltage cuts or blackouts. And while utility stocks are down, Con Ed is well regarded among major utilities. The company's conservation program, "Enlightened Energy," won the applause of environmentalists and the financial community, because the Public Service Commission promised Con Ed a higher rate of return if it could invest enough money to help its customers use less power.
But the recent court battles have left the company on a short leash. The settlement with the state, which runs to hundreds of pages, goes into excruciating detail. For example, the company will pay the costs of up to four environmental monitors from the Department of Environmental Protection. There are numerous deadlines, with daily fines for missing them ranging from $250 to $10,000.
Company executives say they believe they have already changed attitudes and practices, a contention partly endorsed by the Department of Environmental Conservation, where people involved in negotiating the consent decree said that after some initial shock when it received the charges in 1992, Con Edison resolved to do better.
Mr. Marsh, speaking of Con Ed like a longstanding enemy he had recently agreed to make peace with, said: "These are serious violations, but they didn't destroy the environment of New York City. There are things that have to be done right, should be done right, weren't being done right."
The company has proven that it can do many things right. On Oct. 26, its Indian Point 2 reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., broke the world record for longest continuous operation of a light-water reactor, the kind used in the United States and most of the rest of the world. The absence of unplanned shutdowns is an indication of safe performance, according to Federal regulators. The plant, which started its current run on May 10, 1993, is scheduled to run until Feb. 4, 1995.
Perhaps harder than running a nuclear plant well, Con Ed now wants to make itself loved. That is especially difficult in a densely populated service territory, which Mr. McGrath called "a fishbowl."
Perhaps thinking of the Con Ed employee in the drills who plays the role of pushy pedestrian, the chairman said that the utility would have to do its job well because "we do our work right here in full view."

GRAPHIC: Chronology: "CHRONOLOGY: Troubles at Con Edison"
 
Gramercy Park Explosion
On Aug. 19, 1989, A steam pipe exploded on East 20th Street, near Gramercy Park, killing three people and injuring 20. Con Edison reported four days later that the accident spread asbestos, and then evacuated the site and equipped its workers with anti-contamination clothing.
In December, 1993, a Federal grand jury indicted the company and one of its executives for conspiracy for failing to promptly report the asbestos. The company maintained its innocence until Oct. 31, when, with the trial under way, it pleads guilty. It has already paid $90 million to settle civil lawsuits.
Current status: a probation officer is preparing a report; sentencing is scheduled for next month.
 
Environmental Violations
On June 9, 1992, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation charged the company with 319 violations, dating from 1984 to 1991, and sought $20 million in penalties. On Nov. 15, 1994, in the largest settlement ever with the state agency, the company agreed to pay $9 million in penalties, and spend another $5 million on environmental restoration and education. Also, the company agreed to an outside audit and said it would hire two prominent environmental attorneys, both of whom have successfully sued Con Ed in the past, to oversee the work.
Current status: Auditor has not yet been hired.
 
East Side Steam Pipe Blast
On Nov. 10, 1992, a 40-year-old steam pipe at the Waterside generating station, at 1st Avenue and 40th Street, ruptured, killing a echanic who was scalded to death. Five firefighters were injured, one critically. In May, 1993, the Occupational Safety and Health administration concluded that one cause was failure to drain the pipes, the same reason for the Gramercy Park explosion, and proposed to fine Con Ed $247,000. Con Ed contested the fine.
Current status: The case is before an administrative law judge. If Con Ed loses, the United States Attorney could decide to investigate whether any of the violations were wilful, which would make them criminal. (pg. 62)

HEADLINE: Human Rights Organization Urges Stronger Action by the U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
A leading human rights organization is calling on the United Nations to reconsider its policy of neutrality and to act more forcefully against those who carry out atrocities in the new rash of small conflicts around the world.
"Faced with genocide and mass slaughter, neutrality should not be the ultimate value," the group, Human Rights Watch, said in a report published on Friday. It calls the United Nations "unique in its capacity to legitimize force in the most extreme circumstance to uphold human rights." 
 The international survey, "Human Rights Watch World Report 1995," also accuses major industrial nations of following policies that subjugate, and sometimes obliterate, human rights concerns in the name of trade. It takes issue with the argument that economic growth leads to improvements in civil and human rights and the spread of democracy.
"Indeed, even if economic development could be correlated in the long term with improved respect for human rights -- an unproved proposition -- that would offer little solace to those who are imprisoned or tortured today," the report said.
Human Rights Watch, which this year expanded its organization to new bases in Europe and Central Asia, and also opened an office to scrutinize the United Nations, is sharp in its criticism of the Clinton Administration, specifically Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
Under Mr. Brown, the report said, American delegations have been "hawking trade and investment deals while relegating human rights to the ineffectual realm of private diplomacy."
"The Administration's position on India exemplified the shift," Human Rights Watch said. "Its refreshing but short-lived public criticism of Indian abuses in Kashmir was replaced by the eager promotion of an 'emerging market' where public discussion of human rights was taboo."
In Indonesia last month to attend a summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Mr. Brown played down questions of Indonesian human rights abuses and what American labor leaders have called unfair practices in the workplace.
The Clinton Administration has also backed away from early promises to be tough on China, at one point publicly undercutting its Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights during talks about renewing a favored trade status for Beijing.
Human Rights Watch said in its report that Washington is not alone in adopting "commercial diplomacy" as a policy.
"Germany, France, Canada and Australia all vied for Chinese commercial contracts, with waning interest in Chinese repression," the report says. "France, driven by geopolitical designs and commercial motives, led the charge to embrace Iraq's genocidal regime. The European Union, having concluded a cooperation agreement with India in 1993 conditioned on respect for human rights, lapsed into silence on the atrocities in Kashmir in 1994."
In addition to focusing on international trends that it believes to be of concern at a time when many countries are poised between uncertain democracy and ethnic conflict or renewed totalitarianism, the report surveys the situations in individual countries, grouped regionally. It also looks at special projects ranging from arms control or prison conditions to women's rights and children's rights.
"Human Rights Watch World Report 1995" is available from the publication department of Human Rights Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y., 10017. The price is $25, which includes postage.

HEADLINE: Ranchers Balk at U.S. Plans To Return Wolf to the West

SERIES: Who Owns the West? -- Third article of a periodic series.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.

 BODY:
After more than a century of policy flip-flops that saw the gray wolf go from the most loathsome animal in America to the celebrated subject of perhaps the most extensive environmental impact statement ever done, the mythic predator is a single court hearing away from a formal return to the West.
That it has taken two decades, 120 public hearings, directives from six Presidents, dozens of Congressional committees and $12 million worth of studies to get to a point where wolves could soon run through Yellowstone National Park tells much about the heavy load of significance that has been saddled on the wolf. 
 What Federal biologists hope to do in early January is to return a predator with a lust for fresh meat back to a part of the country that is overrun with moose, elk and deer -- staples of a wolf's diet.
But even as Yellowstone park rangers put the final touches on one-acre pens to be used to acclimate the wolves to the park's Lamar Valley, cattle and sheep ranchers are balking at the turnabout in attitudes and policy. The ranchers, the biggest beneficiaries of the campaign 70 years ago to eliminate the wolves from the West, have filed a lawsuit that threatens to hold up the project. On Dec. 21, a Federal judge in Wyoming will decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
For those most passionate about bringing the wolf back, the project is viewed as a grand restorative deed, balancing a zealous act of one era with a corrective act of another. It is absurd, they argue, that wolves still roam free not far from the urban masses of Rome, but are not yet allowed inside North America's largest temperate zone ecosystem, the greater Yellowstone area.
Without wolves, the world's first national park "is a heart without a heartbeat," in the words of Renee Askins, founder of the Wolf Fund, a Wyoming group devoted to returning the animal to this area.
Under the plan, 30 wolves in Canada, tagged with radio collars so biologists can track them, are to be released into Yellowstone and into the wilderness of central Idaho, 15 to each area. Eventually, over five years, the plan is to establish a population of about 150 wolves in each area.
But one person's call of the wild is a rancher's nuisance with a 1,500-pound-per-square-inch bite. The ranchers see an America where less than 2 percent of the population works the land and where beef prices continue to fall with declining demand.
"When wolves were a fact of the area, most people made their livelihood from the land," said Bill Wheeler, a third-generation rancher in western Montana. "Now, only 1 1/2 percent of the population is involved in agriculture, and the other 98-plus percent have been indoctrinated by a Disney mentality about the wolf."
Studies in Minnesota, where nearly 1,700 wolves live among dairy farms, and in northwest Montana, where a few wolves have trickled down from Canada, show that very few domestic animals are killed by wolves. The rate in Minnesota is less than one loss per 10,000 cows. And in Montana, dogs kill far more sheep than does any wild predator.
Federal biologists say fewer than 20 cattle and 110 sheep a year would be lost to wolves near Yellowstone.
But if livestock loss is not the real issue, what exactly has made wolf restoration such a complicated, divisive and expensive effort?
Ranchers say keeping the wolf out of the West is a symbolic stand for control. Wolves, like bison, were eliminated from the West to make way for cows and sheep. Some farmers think they are being pushed aside now to allow a bit of the wild back into the equation. With restoration, they fear, will come a host of regulations.
"Until very recently, the score stood at cows, 99,200,000; wolves, 0," Rick Bass wrote in his book, "The Ninemile Wolves" (Clark City Press, 1992).
Now, even in their own communities, ranchers seem to be losing the spin battle. Once viewed overwhelmingly as the embodiment of lechery and predation, the wolf has become such a cuddly favorite that agriculture groups have tried to force school boards in the West to present them in a less sympathetic light.
A few years ago schoolchildren in Bighorn, Wyo., a tiny ranching town on the front range of the Rocky Mountains, were asked to conduct a mock civic debate on the wolf. To the surprise of their parents, none of the middle-school children wanted to take the side against wolves, teachers said.
A 1991 poll by the fish and game department in Wyoming, perhaps the most conservative state in the West, found that a majority of those surveyed favored a return of the wolf. And surveys in Yellowstone Park have shown that visitors favor a return of the wolf by 6 to 1.
This change is all the more remarkable considering what the Federal Government did over a 50-year period to demonize and eliminate the wolf. From the 1870's to the mid-1920's, up to $1 million a year was paid in bounties for dead wolves. The animals were tortured, burned and poisoned by the thousands, all the while portrayed as child-eating sneaks. By the 1930's, nary a single wolf could be found in all the West.
Now, most Federal biologists say eliminating the wolf was a grievous error, upsetting the balance of nature in one of the few places in America that was balanced. Without the wolf, Yellowstone, with nearly 60,000 elk and 4,000 bison crowding its boundaries, finds itself in desperate need of predators, park biologists say. Wolves would thin the ranks of these animals, which are now near their all-time high for this century, by 5 percent to 20 percent over time, they estimate.
What is more, bringing wolves back to Yellowstone would generate an additional $19 million a year in new tourism dollars, according to a Federal study.
For all the animal kingdom what-ifs and economic numbers, wolf restoration remains an issue that always veers into values and culture. Returning the wolf to the West "is a symbolic act, just as exterminating wolves from the West was a symbolic act," said Ms. Askins of the Wolf Fund.
She laments that the wolf issue has become so wrapped up in the West's political fights over land use. Both sides see it as a place to draw the line.
"Wolves aren't going to cause the decline of Western civilization any more than they are going to restore blissful symmetry to the cosmos," she said. "They will cause some fascinating changes, and once in a while they may cause some trouble."
Ms. Askins, a Yale-educated biologist who lives in Moose, Wyo., inside Grand Teton National Park, has devoted the last 13 years of her life to wolf reintroduction. "I started out with the idea that facts could change minds, and I ended up with the idea that this is a fundamentally emotional issue," she said.
By the first of next year, she expects to do something rare in the age of big-budget environmental lobbying: close the doors of her organization and declare victory, her mission accomplished. "I can't wait to be out of a job," she said.
If Judge William Downes of Federal District Court in Wyoming does not grant the preliminary injunction sought by ranchers, the program to bring back the wolves would go ahead as approved by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in May.
But if it is temporarily halted in court, the program could miss its window of opportunity in winter, considered the best time to bring a predator into Yellowstone. After that, critics in Congress could further cripple the program by denying funds to the reintroduction team, as was done in earlier years of political skirmishing.
Many ranchers are not convinced by a provision of the restoration plan that would allow them to kill wolves if they catch them chewing up a farm animal. Nor are they swayed by a $100,000 fund set up by environmentalists to pay ranchers for any loss of livestock. Since 1987, when a few wolves started to wander into northwest Montana, Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental group, has paid $17,000 in compensation to 20 ranchers.
"They're not obligated to pay us," said Jim Magagna, who runs 5,000 head of sheep in Wyoming. "Once the wolves are in there, they could run out of money. Then what?"
In trying to block the wolf's return, various interest groups in the West say they are waging a long-term fight.
The real issue is land use, said Steve Lechner, a lawyer with the Mountain States Legal Foundation of Denver, which filed the suit against the wolf plan.
"Once you get wolves in there and let them run loose, pretty soon the whole Rocky Mountain area will be locked up," he said. Because the wolf is listed as endangered in the West, it has protection under the most powerful environmental law on the books -- the Endangered Species Act.
But under an amendment to the law passed in President Ronald Reagan's first term in 1982, ranchers will be able to kill or harass the wolves if they threaten livestock.
Supporters of bringing the wolf back had hoped to showcase the animal's return around the holidays as a telegenic example of how the Endangered Species Act can work. Now, they are worried about another long legal fight that most Americans would find arcane.
If the wolf is doing well in Minnesota -- the only state in the lower 48 where it is not listed as endangered -- then there is no reason to expend Federal help to bring it back in the West, critics argue. But the act itself, facing what is likely to be a tough fight for renewal next year in Congress, requires the Government to preserve and restore any species threatened with extinction in "all or a significant portion of its range."
Wolves used to live almost everywhere in North America. Bringing wolves back to Manhattan is unlikely (outside of Hollywood's effort this year, in which Jack Nicholson played an editor who takes on wolf-like sensibilities after he is bitten by one).
There is no better place for a fast-moving, meat-eating predator with a keen sense of family values and superb hunting skills than in Yellowstone National Park, the wolf's friends say. "The wolves that are dropped in there are going to think they died and went to heaven," said Hank Fischer, the Montana representative of Defenders of Wildlife.
With the wolf in place, Yellowstone would be the only area in the contiguous United States inhabited by every mammal it had at the time whites first came to the continent -- "a pretty remarkable superlative," said Wayne Brewster, a park biologist on the Federal wolf-recovery team.
Sensing the inevitable, some ranchers have started to adjust their views. They still think bringing wolves back is a wrong-headed idea. But in the West, as elsewhere, money wins a lot of arguments. While cows become less valuable in a era of cheap beef, wolves howling in a forest grove at night might just raise property values, some ranchers say.
"The history of the wolf has not been good," said Mr. Wheeler, the lifelong Montana rancher. "But I can now see one possible advantage to all this -- a parade of land buyers who would get their kicks out of watching wolves."

HEADLINE: The Keys Fight to Put New Life in Florida Bay

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISLAMORADA, Fla.

 BODY:
He has no fancy scientific titles, but Jimmy Lozar has been fishing off the Florida Keys for years and says he knows dead water when he sees it.
"If I come up on a flat and I see sharks and rays and bait fish hopping up, you know it's alive," said Mr. Lozar, a guide to the shallow fishing waters known as the flats. "When you see nothing, you know something drastic has happened." 
 What has been choking off life in the waters south of the Everglades is algae. The pea-green algae sometimes cover as much as 40 percent of Florida Bay, or 400 square miles. The algae mean that there is little food or shelter left for fish.
The problem, conservationists say, is a system of canals built by the Army Corps of Engineers on the mainland after World War II. The canals channeled fresh water, which normally flowed through the Everglades and into Florida Bay, out into the Atlantic Ocean.
While the canals helped turn swampland into valuable farmland, Government scientists and conservationists say, they also set off a chain reaction that started with the bay becoming briny and ended with the algae incursion. In the process, the changes killed vast patches of sea grass and sponges that serve as breeding grounds for fish, shrimp and spiny lobster.
The algae problem worsened two years ago when a drought increased the salt content of the bay and further threw off it biological balance. Alarmed by what they saw, guides, commercial fishermen, scuba divers, hotel owners and business and government officials in the Keys started fighting to save Florida Bay and the tourism that is the backbone of the economy of the Keys.
Today, the top political issue on the island chain is the fight to bring more fresh water to the bay -- in the way it flowed before World War II. Restoring the natural flow would mean flooding thousands of acres of farmland that are kept dry by the canals, said Paul Dye, director of marine conservation for the Key West office of the Nature Conservancy, a private environmental group. "About 15,000 acres of land on the eastern edge of the Everglades has to be bought to fix the problem," he said.
In November, business officials and fishermen from the Keys and conservationists scored a victory when Florida officials cleared the way for the state's water managers to condemn and buy 1,800 acres of tomato fields to allow fresh water to trickle overland from Lake Okeechobee through the Everglades to the Bay.
State officials expect to pay an average of $2,600 an acre for the land, or about $4.6 million for the 1,800 acres. They will use money set aside for just that purpose.
Farmers and their supporters protested the move, warning that the loss of farmland would mean the loss of jobs as well as tomatoes. Conservationists and fishermen, citing the possible loss of jobs linked to the fishing industry and to water-related tourism, countered that the state and Federal Governments should buy even more land.

Players Present Plan To the Team Owners

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK, N.Y., Dec. 10

 BODY:
In an effort to begin the end of their four-month-old strike, major league baseball players presented a new proposal to the owners today, calling for a tax of about 5 percent on club payrolls, a contribution of at least $30 million of their money to an industry growth fund and input in crucial matters like television and expansion.
The owners did not reject the proposal immediately, but they left little doubt that they would reject it. 
 Whereas the salary cap and tax plans the owners have on the table are heavy on payroll punishment to drive down salaries, the players' proposal emphasizes partnership to eliminate labor confrontations and create a cooperative relationship and new revenues.
The owners' ideas would have a more immediate effect in achieving their goal -- lower salaries. The players' three-part plan would have a long-range effect by finding ways to generate greater revenues to help pay for player salaries and increase the clubs' profits.
"It is not hyperbole to call the plan revolutionary," said Lauren Rich, a union lawyer and one of the architects of the proposal. "For the first time, players are prepared to put their money where their mouth is."
The players, Rich said, went through "a lot of soul searching" in approving the proposal at their meeting in Atlanta earlier this week.
"There are aspects of this that can be negotiated," she added, "but the central core of the proposal represents the players' unwavering commitment not to give up what other generations of players have achieved for them. They will not give up their basic principles, like free agency and a free market, that other generations made sacrifices to get."
But the players, Cecil Fielder said, also want to "end all this negativity" and "not be in a situation where we scar the game so badly that we would all be in trouble."
After the owners' negotiating committee received the proposal at the Arrowwood resort and conference center in this Westchester County town, it asked union officials to agree to a joint embargo on the release of the proposal's details until noon today.
The members of the clubs' committee, one person who was in the room said, thought that disclosure of the details would prompt owners who weren't present to call committee members and ask questions about the proposal, and they didn't want that happening.
Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, said he, too, had preferred that the union not make the proposal public, but Donald Fehr, the union leader, said his membership had been clamoring to see it.
John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, the owners' chief labor spokesman, said management was encouraged by the players' concerns "about our mutual self-interest in growing the game," but he said the clubs would evaluate the proposal on three criteria:
"Does the plan address cost certainty? Does it result in the reduction of player costs from 58 percent to 50 percent of revenue? Does it deal with payroll disparity and encourage competitive balance?"
The owners are expected to answer at least the first two questions, and possibly all three, negatively and reject the proposal. They will most likely view the 5 percent tax rate as relatively puny compared with the limitless rate called for in the proposal the owners made Nov. 17. The players proposed a 1.5 percent tax in September.
If the owners' tax had been in effect this year and the season had been played in its entirety, the Detroit Tigers would have paid nearly $44 million in taxes. At the players' rate, the Tigers' tax would been less than $3 million.
The players' proposal, however, would create the same $58 million the owners want to generate for low-revenue clubs under the revenue-sharing plan they adopted last January. But the owners would phase in their plan, reaching 100 percent in the fourth year, while the players would have the full amount in effect immediately but would end the sharing after three years.
The players would generate $35 million with the payroll tax (which they said could cost the players a total of $100 million over all) and the remainder with a gate-sharing plan (25 percent for the visiting team, 75 percent for the home team) and the existing pay cable pool the clubs share.
Using the clubs' 1994 economic projections, the San Diego Padres would have received the most money under the players' proposal, $10,213,000, and the Toronto Blue Jays would have contributed the most, $8,563,000.
The industry growth fund calls for each side to contribute half of a fund of at least $60 million. The players would take $30 million from their licensing program or other union sources; the money would not come from players' salaries. The clubs' share would come from fees they would get from expansion, which, the players proposed, would occur by 1998 with the addition of at least two teams.
The two sides would jointly pursue the creation of new revenue by promotional and community service activities; licensing, advertising and marketing projects; international development, including player tours, licensing, media relations and support for international baseball federations; improvement and replacement of stadiums with particular attention to guidelines for cities and communities for retention of major league teams, and development of new and emerging media technology.
A committee made up of four players, four owners and staff members from both sides would administer the fund.

Players Weren't the Only Ones Holding Paper Bags

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
BACK when there used to be baseball -- before greed shut it down -- most teams stayed at the Hyatt on 42d Street. Actually, the hotel is called the Grand Hyatt -- Grand as in grandiosity, as befitting its remodeler, an 80's kind of guy named Trump.
Back when there used to be baseball, a certain type of entrepreneur used to congregate outside the Grand Hyatt, carrying a briefcase or a cigar box or an album with vinyl pockets. 
 I remember one day leaving the Grand Hyatt with a friend of mine who is a star pitcher. We were on our way to Little Italy for some pasta and escarole. A man was standing on the sidewalk, holding a stack of baseball cards.
"Would you sign these, please, sir?" the man asked, with Dickensian servility.
My friend signed one while he walked down the sidewalk. I happened to glance at the man's stash. Another unsigned card of my friend was now on top.
"Didn't I see you here last night?" my friend asked. I know him well enough to recognize his ripe sarcastic tone.
"Yes, sir," Uriah Heep replied. He couldn't afford to be offended. My friend was coming back after lunch. He might sign another card.

 Some ballplayers don't sign at all on the street. I can't say I blame them. Most ballplayers have no qualms about signing at autograph shows where they are being paid. It's a business deal, usually a cash business.
A Federal grand jury indicted Darryl Strawberry and his agent Thursday on charges of not paying taxes on over $500,000 from baseball card shows. I have no evidence Darryl did what they say, but I would guess Darryl's an easy target. He's so noticeable -- he's no hero to establishment America -- and, by his own testimony, he was out of control on drugs and alcohol while playing for the New York Mets, that most 80's kind of team.
Is that the ultimate legacy of the Mets? They won exactly one pennant and one World Series and now that the 80's are long gone, their names surface in cash-only rumors. I'm waiting to see if the Feds are as eager to go after some major icons as they are in going after Darryl.
Sports collectibles are big business. I'm not sure why. I'd love to be able to afford a work by William Dole or Richard Diebenkorn or Joseph Cornell -- to gaze at, every day. But a Mickey Mantle rookie card in a safety deposit box? What's the point? Then again, just the mention of Rotisserie leagues induces a huge aching void deep in my soul. When did money and sports become fused?
We used to ask for autographs at the old Garden and Ebbets Field when I was a kid. It meant we could stand next to Frank McGuire or Jackie Robinson for a few seconds. We'd bring home the autographs and put them in a raggedy album and when we grew up, our mothers would throw them out. It was a rite of passage. Now 11-year-old weasels hoard Doc Gooden rookie cards. And grown men with stubble on their chins, their bellies hanging out of their T-shirts, stand around outside hotels.
"Paper bags full of money," said another friend of mine, who had insight into the collectibles business back in the Gordon Gekko 80's. "Somebody rents a hall to run a card show, probably pays by check. The dealers pay cash to put up a table at the card show. They probably pay cash. The public pays cash to enter. The public pays cash for autographs from stars. And the players take their money in cash."
My friend told about a former player who took his paper sack of money to a mall and tried to get the twenties converted into hundreds. The store manager called security, and it got pretty sticky until somebody recognized the player as a Hall of Famer.
"Another famous player wouldn't take cash," my friend added. "But he would double-bill his plane tickets -- his endorsement and the card-show proprietor. One guy was different. Stan Musial had a reputation for always wanting a check. Stan the Man. He wanted everything done right."

 The market was hot in the 80's. Milken and Boesky were selling whatever they sold. Pete Rose was blustering in from Japan with an attache case full of American dollars and expecting to swagger past customs.
"It just exploded," my collectibles maven told me. "Serious money was being made. It was like buying land in Southern California. With the rare exception, you'd never see officials coming to card shows to make sure about receipts and taxes. Baseball card shows sounded cute, like a flea market. Meanwhile, the prices were going out of sight.
"I'd say, 'Hey, we're only as strong as the economy,' " my friend added. "You used to have just the Topps series. Then you had Fleer and Donruss. You could handle three sets. Then there were 40 sets, still most of them baseball. Companies were putting out cards for players in AA ball, hoping the players would make the majors and their cards would rise in value. Everybody got greedy."
The stock market crashed in 1987. Pete Rose went to prison. Now the Feds are scanning old weekly newspapers and penny-savers and hobby periodicals. The ballplayers' names and faces are very big in the advertisements. I just hope the Feds find it in their hearts to question the Hall of Famers. And the dealers. And the guys standing outside the hotels and the ball parks, with stacks of cards in their hands. It all goes around.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL NOTEBOOK;
Next: Action by Roman Numerals

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Short of an unexpected reversal in their thinking and strategic planning, and the players' new proposal notwithstanding, the owners will meet Thursday in Chicago and invoke Impasse/Implementation I. And the reason this week's action will require a Roman numeral is because it will trigger Impasse/Implementation II.
The sequence will be as follows: Once the owners declare an impasse and implement their Nov. 17 salary cap proposal, negotiation will turn to litigation, the players will continue their strike and the owners will intensify their plans to open spring camps and play the season with replacement players. 
 But the replacement players themselves will have to be a subject for negotiation with the union, and the only way for them to be eligible to play in the major leagues, other than agreement with the union, will be for the clubs to declare an impasse in those negotiations and implement a new type of major league roster by expanding the existing roster or creating a new one. That's II.
Actually, there is another way. The clubs could open spots on their existing 40-man major league rosters by releasing players in wholesale numbers, but somehow it doesn't seem very likely that the Chicago White Sox would release Frank Thomas or the Seattle Mariners Ken Griffey Jr. or the San Francisco Giants Barry Bonds.
"Roster size is subject to collective bargaining," Chuck O'Connor, management's chief labor lawyer, acknowledged. "We'd have to bargain to impasse with the union on it. You can't act unilaterally to bring temps in."
Roster size is covered in Article XV of the collective bargaining agreement and in Major League Rule 2. The clubs can't change the size in their initial implementation because they haven't included it in any of their proposals and they haven't negotiated it to this point.
But the clubs, if they want to use replacement players, would have to do something about the roster because players in the major leagues have to be on major league rosters.
"I don't think you'd see wholesale stripping of regulars," O'Connor said. "I suspect they'd have to expand the rosters. It's not unusual when you have temporary replacement workers that you have interim rules, including wage scales and seniority rules, because they are temps."
Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said the union would bargain with the clubs about rosters. "Expansion of rosters is something we feel strongly about," he said. "We will have significant contributions to make to that discussion."
Bill Murray, the executive director of baseball operations in the commissioner's office, said no decision has been made on rosters. He said the clubs would most likely create a temporary roster or expand the existing roster to a number around 60.
Just where the replacements would come from is the key question, but an agent said he has heard the clubs plan to use players from the Class A and AA levels of the minor leagues and college seniors who have exhausted their college eligibility as well as striking players who are willing to become strikebreakers.
"Far be it from me to suggest to the clubs what they should or shouldn't do with replacement players," Orza said. "I'm just telling them whatever replaces major league baseball players on strike won't be major league baseball."
Those terms -- major league baseball and major league players -- are not meaningless terms. Under a different section of the expired labor contract, they raise an intriguing question.
Article II deals with recognition of the union as the "sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all Major League Players, and individuals who may become Major League Players" during the term of the agreement. The agreement has expired, but are the owners prepared to withdraw recognition from the Players Association so that the union cannot represent the replacement players who become major league players?
Impasse/Implementation III?
 
No Hint of Latin Defections
 The way word has spread in recent weeks that many Latin players can be expected to report to training camps next spring, it was beginning to look as though scouts and other club officials had embarked on a campaign to create that impression, hoping that other players would think of going to camp themselves.
But Ralph Avila, a Los Angeles Dodgers vice president who operates the team's baseball complex in the Dominican Republic, said he had no indication that Latin major leaguers would act differently from any other group of players.
"All made statements to the news media here they want to play but they have to support the strike because they want to keep the union," Avila said. "They don't want to strike; they want to play. But they have to support the union."
Avila said his conversations with players have been limited this winter. "We talk off the record a little bit but not too much," he said. "In the past they used to come here every day in the off season to work out, but in the strike situation, they're not allowed to come here. I see them at the stadium, in restaurants. We talk about things off the record. We got instructions not to interfere with anything."
As for the notion that Latins don't have a strong allegiance to the union, Avila said: "I think Latin players are in the same position as American players. They are very disciplined players. We understand they belong to the union and they have to support the union. We think different, but I understand the situation with the players. They have to keep the discipline."
 
Some Kind of Committee
 The partnership portion of the new proposal the players presented to the owners yesterday prompted a look at yet another article of the expired agreement. This one, Article XXV, was designed in the 1990 negotiations and calls for the creation of a labor-management committee.
"The purpose of this Committee," the article says, "is to discuss, explore and study problems referred to it by the parties to this Agreement and to promote the economic development of Baseball." Furthermore, the committee was to meet three times a year.
According to one lawyer involved in labor matters, the committee met in the first couple of years of the agreement, "but I don't remember any over the last two years." That lawyer and another recalled what appears to have been the sole function the committee created -- a charity golf tournament in the first year of the agreement.
The players intend for their proposed partnership venture to be taken slightly more seriously.
 
The Post-Canseco Strategy
 Kevin Kennedy was a sucker for Jose Canseco's cajoling style two seasons ago in Texas, but the new Red Sox manager will not let his newest player compete with Roger Clemens for the No. 1 pitching role in Boston.
The Texas Rangers, on the other hand, believe they will miss Canseco's bat less than they will benefit from Otis Nixon's glove and the arm of the free-agent pitcher they plan to sign with some of the $5.1 million they don't have to give Canseco next season.
The Rangers, it should be remembered, got 31 home runs and 90 runs batted in from Canseco last season and still finished with a won-lost record 10 games under .500, albeit a first-place record 10 games under .500. Their defense was the worst in the American League, committing 106 errors, nearly twice as many as Baltimore's league-low 57, and their pitching staff had a 5.45 earned run average, second worst in the league, and gave up the most home runs, 157.
General Manager Doug Melvin expects Nixon to make a significant difference roaming center field.
"There were more triples hit in this park than any in the league," Melvin said. "I'm a believer in having a quality center fielder. In Baltimore, we had Brady Anderson, Mike Devereaux and Steve Finley. That outfield helped a mediocre pitching staff. Jeff Ballard had an 18-8 record one year. When you have an infield with limited range, they need three ground balls to get through to score a run. A ball that's not caught and gets through in the outfield can do a lot of damage."
So can Canseco -- with his bat, not his arm.

To the Editor:
Your article perpetuates a dangerous equation of psychosis with schizophrenia, reflecting assumptions that contribute to erroneous diagnoses of schizophrenia in manic-depressive cases. 
 Psychosis is a state of brain dysfunction with increased dopamine brain activity that can occur both in schizophrenia and in a significant minority of manic-depressive individuals. Thus the impaired ability to think rationally, distorted perceptions and impaired ability to interpret sensations or the intent of others can strike both manic-depressive and schizophrenic patients.
The assumption that manic-depressive illness typically strikes later in life is not correct; many individuals experience the onset as adolescents, with its main symptom dysphoria rather than mania or depression -- the person is irritable and difficult.
In addition, creativity occurs only when the manic-depressive person goes into remission or stabilizes at a mild low-grade manic level. This reflects a dopamine level that is too low to trigger psychosis. The schizophrenic person has a bizarre semblance of creativity when there is a psychotic loosening of associative thinking. Once the schizophrenic recovers from the psychosis, there is lack of original thinking as well as paucity of all thinking.
Manic depressive episodes follow psychosocial stresses (like a spouse's pregnancy) or physiological stresses (such as smoking marijuana, which lowers serotonin and triggers increased dopamine activity in the brain). All these factors are precipitants rather than causes of manic-depressive illness, which are genetic. The genetic causes consist of contributing to irregular synthesis of proteins like dopamine as well as receptor molecules.

HEADLINE: In Praise of the Counterculture

 BODY:
Generational bonding experiences have always been important in American life. Civil War veterans kept meeting until time scythed down the last of them. The Depression shaped the economic dreams, and fears, of millions of young couples and their children. People who fought in World War II have moved through history with a fortifying set of common memories. So have the children born to them during and shortly after that war.
 This last group profoundly altered the way Americans think about their inner lives, their fellow citizens, the earth upon which we live and the process by which older citizens in Washington decide when and where young Americans die in combat. 
 Now, in an excess of Republican triumphalism, the party's new leaders have decided to make "counterculture" into a pejorative. What flapdoodle. Only a few periods in American history have seen such a rich fulfillment of the informing ideals of personal freedom and creativity that lie at the heart of the American intellectual tradition. Like many of his elders, Representative Newt Gingrich may prefer a stricter regimen of social conformity and religious observance.
 But the millions of Americans who incorporated the cultural ideals of the Sixties and the decade's healthy spirit of political activism are foolish to abandon the high ground because of his post-election slanging. Certainly the excesses of the decade are easy to parody, and its summery, hedonistic ethos then and now reduced modern puritans to fits of twisting discomfort. America is still close enough to the frontier experience of relentless work and danger to view any kind of fun with suspicion.
 No true historian, however, can believe that it is possible to repudiate so large a cultural event in a nation's history, or to dismiss its seminal political events as a "McGovern-nik" aberration.
 The 60's spawned a new morality-based politics that emphasized the individual's responsibility to speak out against injustice and corruption. It was this renewed sense of responsibility that led enough people to raise their voices to end America's most disastrous foreign military adventure, the Vietnam War. On this level, the Sixties saw an exercise in mass sanity in which a nation's previously voiceless citizens -- its young -- overturned a war policy that was, in fact, deranged.
 The spirit of the age, like the tactics of the antiwar movement, was shaped by the civil rights movement. Its lessons of citizen empowerment, to use the 90's term, led to the progress of the environmental, women's and gay rights movements. The counterculture, in sum, produced a renewal of the Thoreauvian ideal of the clear, defiant voice of the dissenting citizen.
 There was another empowering aspect of the counterculture's confrontation with the Washington monolith. Those days produced the sad wisdom, now indispensable in American politics, that the Government will lie to protect its interests and that constant vigilance is necessary to keep it honest.
 The influence of 60's individualism was not limited to politics. It fostered a psychological movement that, while it burdened our shelves with tomes of psychobabble, also enabled people in emotional torment to ask for help without being stigmatized. It gave people in dead or abusive relationships permission to break out.
 Would many Americans truly like to imagine a society returned to the dictatorship of the majority culture? Would they like to go back to the days of blatant, sanctioned discrimination against African-Americans and women, to a world deprived of all the 60's ingredients that still simmer in the cultural stew, including an American music that has become a global language?
 We think not. For one thing, there are too many Republicans who are also Grateful Dead fans or, for that matter, divorced, ex-potheads and opponents of state-regulated prayer and abortion.
 At its essence, the counterculture was about one of conservatives' favorite words: values. It was a repudiation of the blind obedience and reflexive cynicism of politics as usual. It was about exposing hypocrisy, whether personal or political, and standing up to irrational authority. As in any large movement, it accommodated its share of charlatans and sociopaths. But it is part of us, a legacy around which Americans can now unite, rather than allow themselves to be divided.

HEADLINE: Do We Feed Defense Instead of the Poor?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I sit on the board of directors of Part of the Solution, a Bronx soup kitchen and shelter. On Nov. 30 we voted, with intense anguish but out of fiscal necessity, to close the shelter component of POTS. That means 12 more people will be out on the streets and the 500 on our waiting list have seen their hopes of shelter dwindle even further. 
 Two days later you reported that President Clinton, apparently seeking to appease Republicans in Congress, is seeking a $25 billion increase over the next six years in military spending.
 The rationale for that increase is that the military must be ready to defend America's "national interests." That ubiquitous phrase, invoked to justify spending more than $1 trillion on the military during the last decade, has a hollow ring.
 What is the national interest? Surely, if the phrase has any meaning, quality education for our children, food for the hungry, homes for the homeless, jobs for the unemployed and affordable medical care for the sick must be critical constituents of our national interest and collective security.
 St. Augustine, in "City of God," criticizes Babylon and, by implication, the militaristic empires of his day: the name for Babylon, he said, was "Confusion." Need more be said about our Federal budget priorities?

Bronx Homesteading: It's Grueling, but Rewarding

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
FRED NEHRING first visited New York City in the 70's as a sailor in uniform, and he remembers how well the city treated him: free tickets to Yankee Stadium, free tickets to the U.S.O. dances and a bunk at the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Club on Lexington Avenue for $3 a night.
When he moved to the city, he liked to take the subway to places "outside the beaten tourist track," scouting for places he'd like to live. He said he began to seek out neighborhoods full of abandoned properties. 
 To Mr. Nehring, the deteriorating buildings were "a terrific waste."
"These were beautiful buildings; not like some cruddy, ugly buildings that had been abandoned," he said. "I felt the thing to do was to get into fixing them up."
He found an agency that administers homesteading projects where mostly city-owned abandoned buildings are purchased by individuals or groups willing to put "sweat equity" into fixing up the property. The homesteaders usually receive a combination of grants and loans from local, state and Federal agencies -- and in return, the agencies restrict the amount of profit homesteaders can make if they sell their renovated property. There are also income guidelines for the individual homesteaders.
There were no properties available when Mr. Nehring asked. Nevertheless, he volunteered some time and helped a group called Self Help Works form a credit union. At the time, he says, he was "largely unemployed," although he picked up some small home contracting jobs, mainly painting and plastering.
As he continued to work with the credit union -- it eventually hired him and he now runs it -- he heard about a homesteader group being formed on Alexander Avenue in the South Bronx, about a block from the police station that played a starring role in the 1981 movie "Fort Apache, the Bronx."
There, in an abandoned tenement at 272 Alexander Avenue, he met Juan Carlos Taiano, Mr. Taiano's son, Marcello, and the rest of the homesteaders. When he joined the group, it was in flux, he said.
"The founding members had been starry-eyed artists and idealists," Mr. Nehring said, "and many of those had left. This calls for a commitment to the long haul; we still have one opening."
The chronology of a homesteading project is grueling, not for the faint of heart. The initial offering plan was published in 1986. This particular group's proposal was formally completed in early 1987. In January 1988, Mr. Nehring became a member. On June 23, 1993, the homesteaders bought the building from the city for $1,750.
The group's first task was to clear out the derelict building. The first infusion of money came from the Housing Trust Fund, a state program run by the nonprofit Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, which gave $30,000 in seed money. Most of that went to pay the architect for his drawings and applications, "but we managed to pay for eight or nine Dumpsters," Mr. Nehring said.
"We found rats and a family of puppies," he said. "The roof was filled with refrigerators, which we gleefully threw off onto the backyard; after we cleared out the building, we sealed the windows with plywood."
Their brick tenement had been cruelly treated over the years, and its interior needed to be stabilized. There were three or four fires "before we had site control," he continued. "The last fire was especially brutal; the fire company had to cut through the roof to hose down the building; there were a lot of beams actually burnt through."
TO correct structural weakness, the homesteaders built a four-story interior framework of 2- by 4's to support the rear wall. "At least we stopped the building from falling down," Mr. Nehring said.
But now money was a pressing issue. There had been no budget for the lumber for the restructuring. The group sold the bathtubs and iron pipes to continue.
Each member of the group was paying -- and continues to pay -- $50 a month toward insurance. "We never had any more money to pay for Dumpsters," Mr. Nehring said. "Nevertheless, we managed to get the tubsout, and over this period, a really great thing happened: These strangers who were sort of thrown in your path . . . ." He paused. "You get really close to them."
Mr. Nehring began listing his fellow homesteaders.
"One, Carlos, is married. He was an architect in Argentina but his credentials aren't recognized here, so he's stuck with painting and construction jobs. His wife is Elva. His son, Marcello, or Mark, has a separate apartment. Then there's Gilberto, he's married to Elizabeth. They have a son and a daughter. He works at Roosevelt Hospital, as a surgery admissions clerk.
"Then there's Milton. His wife's name is Mrs. Zorn. He has a grown son and daughter but I think the daughter's going to move in. He's a butler-handyman for very wealthy people. His wife's a housekeeper; they work as a team. Then there's Gloria Garcia, she's single but we gave her a two-bedroom apartment because she wants to have foster kids. Marcello and Gloria are teachers at separate schools."
Eventually, the group received $431,000 from the New York State Housing Trust Fund, $105,000 from the city's urban homesteading program and both a $65,000 loan at 3 percent and a $36,000 grant from the New York Landmarks Conservancy -- the grant to replace the missing metal cornice. The Landmarks Conservancy estimates that the homesteaders have contributed $65,000 of their own money and "sweat equity" to the renovation, which totaled $730,000.
The project also received financial aid from three other groups: an $11,000 loan from the Parodneck Foundation for Self-Help Housing and Community Development; an $8,700 grant from Con Edison's Renaissance Program and a $9,000 loan from the Self-Help Works Federal Credit Union, which Mr. Nehring heads.
The building was established as a self-managed co-op with seven apartments, with the five one-bedroom shareholders paying $420 a month maintenance and the holders of the two-bedroom duplexes paying $540 a month.
ALTHOUGH that may seem cheap, Mr. Nehring points out that the group members did much of the work to fix up the building. And, unlike shareholders in a nonrestricted co-op, the homesteaders cannot make any profit if they decide to sell their units. The program is also income-limited; a single person, for example, cannot earn over $26,700 a year to participate. The group cannot spend any of the building's substantial reserve fund without permission of the urban homesteading board. In addition, the group must pay for an audit each year and $500 for an annual inspection by the board.
"It's a good deal for the homesteaders if they live here a long time, because they pay less per month than the average owner," said Karen Ansis of the Landmarks Conservancy. "But if for some reason they have to move out in the first few years, then they don't do as well."
"Beggars can't be choosers," Mr. Nehring said, "and we're begging."
But the homesteading group is undaunted by restrictions or delays. Last week, the members still had not moved into their spotless units, which they show off proudly: shining floors, superb white tile bathrooms and small but serviceable kitchens with almond formica cabinets.
There is a snag in obtaining the building's certificate of occupancy because of the lack of an interior basement stairway. The group's architect is trying to work it out. Mr. Nehring is optimistic he will be able to finally move in within a month.
Despite his 40-minute commute to work on the No.6 subway from 138th Street and Alexander Avenue -- and despite entreaties from his woman friend to come live with her in Mamaroneck -- Mr. Nehring isn't about to back out now.
"This is my baby -- a person's place defines their identity and this defines my identity," Mr. Nehring said. "I'm a homesteader."

THE COLLECTED STORIES OF LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.95.) Nineteen stories, the oldest from the 1940's, by a writer unfashionably and passionately concerned with the beliefs and behavior of the WASP civilization that until very recently produced America's ruling class.
 
D.H. LAWRENCE: The Story of a Marriage, by Brenda Maddox. (Simon & Schuster, $30.) Lawrence's violent life with the formidable Frieda Weekley, who bedded him 20 minutes after she met him, makes for absorbing if unappetizing reading.
 
THE DIVINE CHILD: A Novel of Prenatal Rebellion, by Pascal Bruckner. (Little, Brown, $21.95.) A wonderfully appalling story by a French novelist about a monster in utero.
 
IN PHARAOH'S ARMY: Memories of the Lost War, by Tobias Wolff. (Knopf, $23.) The follow-up volume to Mr. Wolff's memoir "This Boy's Life" is a series of small, elegant, personal sketches of his year in Vietnam.
 
THE LAST SHOT: City Streets, Basketball Dreams, by Darcy Frey. (Richard Todd/Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) Mr. Frey examines the myth of deliverance through basketball on the courts of Coney Island, where black youths compete to be exploited by coaches, colleges and, in the rarest cases, by professional sports.
 
LOST PURITAN: A Life of Robert Lowell, by Paul Mariani. (Norton, $27.50.) This approach to the "real" character of a protean confessional poet uses letters and diaries to reveal a writer whose fascination with preachers, statesmen and generals hints at restlessness with his own art.
 
MAKING MALCOLM: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X, by Michael Eric Dyson. (Oxford University, $19.95.) Malcolm X is the thread that stitches together these eloquent, freewheeling essays on hip-hop culture, black films and the tragic lives of poor black men.
 
THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG, by J.M. Coetzee. (Viking, $21.95.) The hero of Mr. Coetzee's grimmest novel yet is Dostoyevsky himself, trapped in generational and political clashes, trying to scrape meaning from the death of a son.

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL

 BODY:
Sometimes, as a former editor, I read the front pages of The Times -- or The Washington Post or The Los Angeles Times -- the way editors have designed them to be read. Quite an exercise.
I begin at the top right corner, the now-conventional (though hardly logical) place where the editors of large-size papers display their choice of the most important article of the day, called the "lead" but spelled "lede." After reading the page 1 portion of the lede, I move to the left-most column to read the page 1 portion of the off-lede, or second most important article, and then similarly work my way through the opening paragraphs of the other articles at the top of the page, those "at the fold" and finally those at the bottom. 
 En route, I may be interrupted or distracted by assorted pictures, word boxes and charts. But assuming that I reach the bar code at the bottom by the intended route, I would then, as on a recent Thursday with The New York Times, have to plunge inside the paper with the following half-thoughts like these somehow embedded in my mind:

Newspaper layout requires that I carry this baggage of six, seven or eight articles interrupted in midsentence or midword until, here and there, I encounter the continuation of each one. I will not, of course, encounter them in the order in which I left them; they were arrayed on page 1 in their presumed order of importance, but their continuations are neatly arrayed inside with articles on related subjects -- starting with international news, then national, metropolitan and so on.
Because The Times is by no means unique in its devotion to this bizarre design, a nasty choice daily awaits tens of millions of readers. They can:
A) Read the front-page articles only to the point of interruption and just forget about the rest;
B) Select one, perhaps two, front-page articles whose continuations they will immediately seek out, as directed, skipping the other front-page news and leaping over a good deal of the news inside;
C) Not read the front page at once in its entirety but rather pursue the continuation of each article as directed, repeatedly returning to page 1 to pick up the next;
D) Take in page 1 and renew acquaintance with the topless bottom of each article wherever they find it, vaguely recalling where they left off or occasionally peeking back at page 1 to pick up the thread. Or simply abandon the interrupted passage and press shakily forward.
Small wonder, given the perversity of this routine, that there is no good English word to describe the process of continuations and, as far as I can determine, no good history of how it came to be. In the jargon of journalism, the interrupted articles are said, accurately enough, to "jump" to an inside page and the second portion of the article is widely called "the jump."
Jumping seems to have started modestly, without hurdles, in the age of movable type and one-sheet papers, when front-page narratives simply continued on the backside. The break came to be called a "turn" or "turning" and many newspapers carried on with this turning from front page to back page when they expanded to four and eight pages. To this day, some large newspapers place the continuations of front-page articles on the back of the same section, even if that requires upsetting the classification of news packages by subject matter.
Until the early 1930's, The Times ended lede stories on page 1 or "turned" them mostly to page 2 or the back page. The routine jumping of other articles to inside pages began about 1907 and accelerated during World War I. By 1933, most front-page stories jumped every which way, burdening the reader but perhaps pleasing the advertisers who wanted more traffic for the pages bearing their messages.
They should be pleased no longer. Experience, anecdote and surveys persuaded me some time ago that readers are annoyed by the jumping and that perhaps half never bother to follow the front-page articles inside; they'd rather quit than leap. But my impatience was not shared by other editors, or the publisher, and the restraint of tradition overcame my resolve. Too bad, because there exists a device that would perfectly preserve the traditional appearance of any paper's front page while eliminating the barbaric ripping in two of every day's most important reports.
The device at hand is a summary and signpost of a longer article, which we call a "reefer" but spell "refer" since it is a sentence, caption or short article "referring" the reader to some kind of elaboration elsewhere in the paper.
As soon as tomorrow morning, with hardly a change in their appearances, The Timeses of New York or Los Angeles or The Washington Post or The Philadelphia Inquirer could produce front pages of "refers" -- meaning concise and well-written summaries that resemble, and occupy the same space as, the tops of the now interrupted articles. But instead of screeching to an awkward halt in midsentence, the refers would end coherently and then advise the reader to seek a "Detailed Account on Page 13."
USA Today often uses this device and has even overcome the refer resistance of reporters, who are reluctant to see their names disappear from page 1 dispatches. Its remedy is to have the same reporter write and sign both the page 1 summary and the detailed account inside.
The editors would still rank the news of the day in descending order by the way they arrange the refer summaries on page 1 and they would still classify the news by subject inside. The reader who is content with a summary of any matter would obtain a coherent one; the reader who wants a fuller account would be directed inside, as always. The reader stumbling upon a dispatch inside would no longer find it topless. And newspapers would run a better race against more fluid media if, replacing jumpers with refers, they finally call off the annoying morning calisthenics.

HEADLINE: Hook, Line and Sunk

BYLINE: By Timothy Egan; Timothy Egan is the Seattle bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
CLENCHING A KNIFE IN HIS TEETH, FINGERS BLOODIED from a long night wrestling squid and a new net that cuts to the bone, Tony Demelo finishes up his chores in the port where Herman Melville learned how to swear. The morning light has chased away the prostitutes and drug dealers who roam the cobbled streets of New Bedford's waterfront district, bartering in Portuguese. Nearby, commuter traffic carries workers with soft hands and clean clothes to office towers in Providence and Boston.
For more than a week Demelo has bounced atop the Atlantic at its most convulsive, sleeping on a bunk in a cabin smaller than a prison cell. His 55-foot boat reeks of blood, fish slime and rust -- a hybrid scent that has enveloped this harbor since it was a British colony. 
 "Out there, we watch the Red Sox, the Bruins, we got a VCR and I cook too," he says. "Chicken, lobster. I made pork chops the other night. Out there, nobody tells you what to do because everybody knows what they got to do. You can scream at the top of your lungs if you want."
Out there, of course, is the open water. Fishermen have given the world a handful of aphorisms, but one you seldom hear them say anymore is this: It's a big ocean out there.
Instead, the seas became crowded with floating technology units -- million-dollar vessels chasing fish with the aid of Loran navigational systems, sonar and Comsat satellite images. Weekend captains in shiny shoes could punch in a few computer entries and find out precisely where they were on the water and get a look at what was schooling 50 fathoms below.
Man versus fish used to be a fair matchup. But the ancient chase turned into a rout; in many quarters, it's all but over and -- surprise -- mankind has won. To the victors go the empty seas. Now, the only question is what to do with the last of the nation's hunter-gatherers, fishermen without fish.
Demelo says he was drawn to the water, down from the hills above Buzzards Bay, almost by instinct. He may be only 20, but he cannot imagine a life tethered to the land. "You kidding me?" he says. "Why would I ever want to do anything but fish?"
The idea of New Bedford or Gloucester, Mass., or Astoria, Ore., no longer sending people out to sea may also seem unimaginable.
From the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific shore, where Lewis and Clark spent a winter subsisting on salmon, to the fog-haunted ports of New England, docks no longer flow with fish blood and fresh cash. Virtually every major American commercial fishing region outside of Alaska is in severe trouble; nearly 80 percent of the nation's known commercial species are now overfished or harvested to the limit of what can be sustained, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
Landings of cod, haddock and flounder, the principal ground fish that have long supported the New England fleet, are near their lowest recorded levels. Most of Georges Bank, a centuries-old mother lode, has been closed to commercial fishing; biologists say it is all but played out. Coastal communities in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest have been declared Federal disaster areas.
Boats weighed down with overdue bank notes stand idle. Taverns fill at midmorning. And with too many vessels and not enough fish, the Federal Government has been asked to buy out all the deeply indebted fishermen that it helped bring into the industry in the first place. The Canadian Government, after the collapse of its Atlantic cod fishery, has done just that, spending more than $1 billion on 30,000 welfare fishermen.
"I hate to think of paying people not to fish in this country, but we already pay farmers not to farm, loggers not to log and dairymen not to milk," says Howard Nickerson, president of the Offshore Mariners Association, which represents boat owners in New Bedford. He is 81, an "old Yankee," he says, in a port dominated by Portuguese-Americans. "A guy who goes fishing thinks he's in control of his own destiny. That's simply not true anymore."
Blame the weather, technology, pollution, environmentalists, bureaucrats. All played a role. But when it comes right down to it, the honest fishermen say that they killed their own future.
THE NATION'S COMMERCIAL FISHING industry was born in the waters of New England, which produced a bounty of cod that allowed the Massachusetts Bay Colony to carry on a prosperous trade with Europe in the 1630's. And the Atlantic shore is where the industry now looks as if it has come to die. In New Bedford and Gloucester, communities that have always matched their civic pulse to the rhythm of the sea, it is not an easy fade.
Ghosts are everywhere in New Bedford, home of the world's largest whaling fleet in the 1850's and the nation's most valuable fishing port for 8 of the last 10 years.
At the town's main wharf, the old brick auction house where millions of fresh fish were sold from boat to buyer has just been sanitized. Commemorative signs are springing up, new floors have been laid and a few tourists with video cameras are sniffing around, one step ahead of the cultural anthropologists. A dead forest of smokestacks surrounds New Bedford, planted in hollowed-out textile mills that had boomed as whaling peaked before the Civil War. Most of them have been closed for more than half a century. They were never given a proper burial.
Just across the Acushnet River from the port is a row of modest mansions, each house straight-lined and strong-shouldered. The neighborhood rose just before the Revolutionary War, inhabited by a lot of people whose names were preceded by Captain, names now engraved on the fronts of the houses. The cemetery, also, is full of captains. For all of the contemporary pallor of New Bedford, this captains' row is a puffed-up chest to the wind. They were mariners then, back when the name meant something more than a baseball team with lousy relief pitchers.
"Nowhere in all America will you find more patricianlike houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford," Melville wrote in "Moby-Dick," published in 1851. At the time, New Bedford was the home port for more than half the American whaling fleet. The sailors went to sea for up to three years and returned with barrels of sperm whale oil to fuel the Industrial Revolution, baleen for corset stays and cash that found its way into the mansions above the bay.
Melville wrote about the Seamen's Bethel -- opened in 1832 and dedicated "to the moral improvement of seamen" -- but he seemed more taken by the bearded, beery conspirators who avoided moral improvement.
Next door to the bethel is the Mariners' Home, a three-story haunt where a transient sailor, down on his luck and stuck in port, can spend the night for $10. It was built in 1787. The latitude and longitude is etched on the wall outside. Inside, an aging "watchman," as Janis Liepa is known, sips from a large bowl of bean soup and chomps on a slab of meat. "Geraldo" blares from a corner television. There is not a sailor in sight.
"We get three or four guys a week that wander in," says Liepa, a native of Latvia who fished for 35 years. "I don't know what we're going to do when the fishermen stop coming in."
They have already started to disappear. For most of this year, New Bedford has ranked as one of the most job-hungry cities in America, with an unemployment rate as high as 15 percent among its 100,000 people. Mandatory restrictions on fishing -- emergency measures designed to save what fish are left -- could cost an additional 8,000 jobs, city officials estimate. Conservation measures adopted this year require most New England fishermen to reduce their workdays by 50 percent over the next five to seven years. By the end of that time, Federal officials say, half the fishermen may be gone for good.
One of those fishermen, John Pereira, captain of the Lucky Venture, strolls the New Bedford wharf, commiserating with other landbound captains. "I'm going crazy right now because I can't fish," he says.
Up the coast in Gloucester, decay is less evident, but the early stages of maritime gentrification have set in -- a sure sign that fishing is on the way out. Gloucester calls itself the oldest fishing port in America. Samuel Champlain came ashore in 1606 to caulk his boat, and the port has been active ever since. "Captains Courageous," the movie tale of two fishing boats on a race home, was set there. Now, a host of captains advertise whale sightseeing trips and below-retail lobster. Weekenders fill the bed-and-breakfasts. In one section of town, there is an earnest-looking art colony, filled with bright-painted clapboards and cozy restaurants.
Though just 30 miles from Boston, Gloucester looks to the Atlantic for self-worth. There is a sense of ageless routine, like a rural village in Europe. It seems musclebound, everything bolted to bedrock, holding on against the winds that whip Cape Ann. The editorial page of The Gloucester Daily Times carries George Will, but above the Washington pundit one typical day is a column about storms, this one titled, "Northeaster Is the King."
The business news centers not on the stock market, nor the rebuilding Massachusetts economy. Its focus is how many fish are brought into port every day, and the price paid for them. Of late, the news has been all bad. Fishermen seem to spend more time nursing hangovers in St. Peter's Club, named for the patron saint of fishing, than they do at sea.
In the Cafe Sicilia, a block or so from the waterfront and nestled between Sal's Hair Styling and Valentino's Sicilian Cooking, a cluster of men sip coffee and argue in Italian about soccer games. An older man enters, and is asked about the fishing.
He shrugs and frowns. "No pesce."
John Sanfilippo is so knotted up with anger he can barely speak. Over breakfast, in a modified accent, he says: "I don't want to sell my boat. I just want to fish. How come I can't just fish?" He wipes his face and, for an instant, seems to cry. "I just want to fish."
Sanfilippo is 49 and wears a baseball hat that says Gloucester Fisherman.
"I went to see the priest," he says. "Told him I didn't know what to do. Things are bad. The priest said, 'What about retraining?' I said: 'Retraining? I don't know nothing else. The only other thing I'd like to do is be a priest.' But I'm too old for that."
He went out this morning in the Giovanna, his 47-foot trawler, which costs about $50,000 a year to maintain. He came back with less than $200 worth of fish, he says. In the glory days, just a few years ago, the catch would have been 5 to 10 times that amount. Dragging a trawl net, he fishes for flounder, cod, haddock -- the most endangered of New England stocks. Last year's haddock catch of 880 metric tons was the lowest ever recorded. Thirty years ago, the fleet used to take up to 50,000 metric tons.
In Gloucester's fishing community, the women do most of the politics, the men work the boats. Angela Sanfilippo, John's wife, has of late taken phone calls at home from people like Senator Edward Kennedy and lawyers from leading environmental groups. Everybody wants to help, she says.
"But only God can bring the fish back," she says. "The Sicilian tradition is, we rely a lot on faith."
She has a gravity-defying stack of dark hair and deep black eyes, and speaks volumes with her hands. In the last decade, she helped to organize fishermen against Government plans to lease rights to drill for oil and gas off Georges Bank. Now she is the local leader of the effort to save their livelihood.
"You used to go to a wedding or somebody's house for dinner and all you would talk about is fishing," says Angela. "Now, everybody says: 'Don't bring up the subject of fish. You'll start an argument.' "
But without fishing, she says, there is little else to hold everyone together. "It's in our blood. My husband, he has six brothers, all fishermen. We once took a vacation to Bermuda, and my husband got up at 2 in the morning to fish. Some vacation, huh? My son, Dominic, he graduated from Gloucester High School, then he went to college for a little while. One day he came home and said: 'Mama, I don't want that anymore. I want to go fishing.' I cried my heart out."
At the telling of the story, she starts to cry as well. She senses there is no future in fishing; after more than 350 years, this is the end of the line.
MORE THAN ANYTHING, WHAT killed the whaling industry was the discovery of oil at Titusville, Pa., in 1859. Of course, whales were disappearing after years of heavy harvesting. But when it became easier to get the basic lubricants for the Industrial Revolution out of the ground, rather than the high seas, whaling went into decline, eventually becoming obsolete.
What has nearly killed fishing in some coastal regions of America, according to many experts, is a Federal law that fishermen lobbied heavily for -- the Magnuson Act of 1976. Until that time, fishing was a relatively small-scale affair. Boats were made of wood. Families passed on tips and nets to other family members. And the fishing fleet, for the most part, did not roam far from the American shore.
But elsewhere, fishing was going through its own industrial revolution. By the 1960's, enormous boats, many from the Soviet Union, were scouring the ocean far from their home ports. When these factory trawlers -- capable of processing fish on board, and therefore staying at sea for months at a time -- began to appear off the shores of America, alarm cries went up. Congress, in passing the Magnuson Act, created a 200-mile "exclusive economic zone" around the United States coastline, reserving that area for American fishermen. The old zone was three miles offshore.
The Government would try to build up a home-grown fleet to replace the foreign fishermen they were chasing away. The Americans, it was thought, would practice enlightened self-interest. Surely, they would never vacuum their own backyard bare.
The act also set up eight regional councils to manage each of the nation's major fishing regions. Their job was to assure that American waters were not overfished, but it was also to set the catch limit at a maximum sustainable yield -- a balancing act that was doomed from the start.
A major reason it failed, many believe, is a section of the law that exempted the fishing industry from conflict-of-interest laws. The idea was to keep regulation out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and put the fisheries in the hands of those who knew it best.
Though fish are considered a public resource -- like national forests, elk on the open range or offshore oil -- the size of the catch was set by some of the very people who had the biggest economic stake in the matter. It is as if Weyerhaeuser, the nation's largest private logging company, were able to dictate how many trees could be cut in the national forests, and then took the timber without paying a dime for it.
Inevitably, these regional councils set harvest levels that could not be sustained. The result: overfishing by foreign fleets was replaced by American overfishing.
After passage of the act, anyone who wanted to become a commercial fisherman could, with the help of a loan guaranteed by the Government, buy a $250,000 boat and start bringing in the bounty. It was free, after all; the law specifically prevented the Government from charging any kind of royalty or fee for taking fish.
In short order, big steel boats replaced the old oak clunkers. Investors looking for tax shelters found a floating one, thanks to generous depreciation allowances in the Federal tax code. In the first three years following passage, the number of fishing vessels in New England grew by almost 50 percent, to 1,300 boats. New Bedford became the nation's most valuable fishing port. In Alaska, a $2 billion annual fishery for pollock, which is used to make fake crab meat, developed over 10 years, attracting corporate giants like Tyson Foods, the Arkansas poultry king.
The old nose-to-the-wind school of navigation was replaced by digital panels in the wheelhouse. But these boats had to support loan payments, home mortgages, payrolls. Fish prices remained the same, or dropped, demanding an ever-bigger catch just to stay even. By the end of the 1980's, there were more than twice as many boats as needed to catch the available fish. And the fish totals were going down fast; cod, flounder and haddock landings in 1989 were one-fourth of what they had been in the 1960's. Representative Gerry Studds of Massachusetts warned of "biological bankruptcy" for Georges Bank.
"We developed a free-for-all attitude," says Rod Fujita, a marine ecologist with the Environmental Defense Fund. "Fishermen were given an incentive to catch every fish they could because ifthey didn't do it, somebody else would."
As long ago as 1639, laws were passed to assure that the waters of New England would never be fished out. But in the last 15 years, as the numbers were crashing, the fish council in charge of New England could not bring itself to set strict limits. Conservation came, belatedly, only after an order from a Federal judge.
The Magnuson Act is up for reauthorization in Congress. The National Marine Fisheries Service considers it "an embarrassment," as Brian Gorman, a spokesman, says. But efforts to overhaul the law will be fiercely fought by some elements of the fishing industry, who say the act needs only minor tinkering.
"I like to think we learned our lesson," says Dick Schaefer, conservation director of the Fisheries Service. "We should have restricted technology. And we should have limited the number of people who could fish."
By contrast, he and others point to lobster fishing in Maine. Every crustacean on the Atlantic floor could be scooped up in a season if there were no restrictions. But lobstermen are strictly regulated -- mainly by state rules that apply to waters up to three miles offshore -- and the fishery has remained relatively healthy.
"We share an equal part of the blame -- the industry and the Government -- for what happened," says Nickerson, the boat owners' president. He sat in his waterfront office in New Bedford, under a faded picture of a young John F. Kennedy. "We don't want handouts, but a lot of these guys are going to need a buyout or they are going to lose their homes."
Three years ago, when Studds floated the idea of the Government buying out fishermen, there was a storm of opposition. Now, the industry has rallied around the idea as their last, best hope. Take the cash and try something else, they say. The alternative is to dry-dock in a museum.
NEW BEDFORD'S CIVIC LEADERS, DESPERATE for a boost, have proposed turning their waterfront district into a national park, a lure for tourists seeking a bit of old-salt authenticity before moving on to the comforts of Cape Cod. It is the national cycle, churning history into package-tour-cum-cappuccino-stop at an ever-faster rate.
Americans love bloodless villages that recall some bit of their past. Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco is the largest visitor attraction in California, after Disneyland. Despite its name, there are almost no real fishermen. And thousands flock daily to Williamsburg, Va., the colonial hamlet with authentically dressed daytime residents eagerly showing off the skills of 18th-century Virginians.
But it may be impossible to freeze-frame men who net bottom-dwellers in 20-foot seas, or to import tough guys who know how to mend a net despite a hangover.
John Bullard, the former Mayor, says New Bedford would not need to do much to become a money-making curiosity. The heart of the old town remains largely as Melville described it. But the historical district does have a logistical problem: it is cut off from the port by the expressway. And there is the question of what to do with the real live sailors, prostitutes and assorted old mariners who now inhabit the place. Are they going to pose for tourist cameras, spit on command?
Earlier this year, in an effort at triage for a threatened way of life, Congress appropriated $30 million in relief to New England fishing communities and $15 million to the Pacific Northwest, where salmon runs have been decimated. The fishermen look at the relief money as a way to get rid of them, quietly. Nobody within smelling distance of salt water thinks it will save the industry.
"They want to make this into a tourist town, and fishermen don't fit," says Angela Sanfilippo. "The feeling is, get out of the way." She came to Gloucester after fishing collapsed near her hometown, Porticello, Sicily. Now she sees a similar pattern taking hold in New England.
"The pleasure boats came into Porticello and the fishermen all were forced to leave," she says. "We had a fleet with no fishermen."
More than ever, fish are raised in pens on a fast-growth diet, chickens of the sea. No special skills are needed to round them up. Last year, more salmon came from fish farms than were caught by all the gill-netters of the Pacific Northwest. But if consumers rarely complain, what is the real loss? Norwegian seafood on a menu in Kansas City tastes no different than the same fillet smothered in Yankee charm on Cape Cod. So why should we bother with how it got there?
Over the last seven years, more than 17,000 I.B.M. workers in the Hudson River Valley have lost their jobs, devastating communities like Poughkeepsie and Kingston. Before that, the steel industry all but disappeared in Pittsburgh, taking with it nearly a third of the population. If every fisherman who stands to lose a job in New England or the Pacific Northwest were crowded together -- a total of about 12,000 people -- they might fit into one tall skyscraper. Why, then, should they merit taxpayer bailouts and sympathy?
Perhaps, as some have argued, because most self-respecting fishermen wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near an office building. Fishermen, like cowboys, represent an unshakable part of the American tradition. They are thought to be free, answering only to the elements, slit-eyed at dawn.
"They are tough, resourceful, self-respecting and also (some say) hidebound and cranky, too independent to organize for their own survival," Peter Matthiessen wrote in "Men's Lives," his tribute to Long Island's vanishing striped-bass fishermen. "Yet even their critics must acknowledge a gritty spirit that was once more highly valued in this country than it is today."
Of course, the freedom, the link to a way of life that goes back to the apostles of Christ and then some, does not make fishermen any more deserving of Federal help than the person in the starched white shirt helping to make the office payroll computer more efficient. The ability to mend a net is no more inherently noble than the ability to fix a copying machine.
But the traits, quirks, skills and language that evolved over eons in fishing communities may soon disappear in this country. In five years, we may hardly notice. There won't be fewer fish sticks, or even a dip in the national economy; just another nudge toward homogenization of the national character.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FIFTH AVENUE;
Fifth Ave. Regains Luster, and Even the Ginza Blinks

BYLINE: By Bruce Lambert 

 BODY:
For decades, Fifth Avenue from 49th to 57th Streets ranked as the premiere shopping venue in the world -- until the last five years, when recession pushed it into a slump. As Fifth languished, its rental prices were surpassed by those in Tokyo's Ginza, Hong Kong's Nathan Road and even an intersecting neighbor, East 57th Street.
But now Fifth is back on top again, says the Hirschfeld Group, a Manhattan-based national consulting firm specializing in retail space. Its annual survey shows that the avenue is commanding an average of $375 a square foot in annual rent in 1994, edging the Ginza and 57th Street. Just last year, Fifth Avenue lagged $95 behind the Ginza. 
 Behind the numbers of Fifth's resurgence lies a certain irony, that the avenue has won its new exclusivity as its commercial landscape -- from the Warner Brothers store to Banana Republic -- has gained a new mass appeal. But it is also a story of self-improvement efforts and shifting economic fortunes.
"The crowds have come back, and business is terrific," said Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, a business group. Faith Hope Consolo, a managing director of the retail brokers Garrick Aug, said: "Fifth is a world-class address. It's making both a comeback and a transformation, still with luxury stores but bringing in theme stores and entertainment retailing."
Property owners formed a business improvement district last year to clean up litter and graffiti and post security guards to chase away sidewalk peddlers, three-card-monte con artists and pickpockets. Under a city program, most airline offices and banks that lined Fifth have relocated to make way for more retail. A concerted effort evicted many disreputable electronics shops and rug merchants who exploited the avenue's cachet with phony going-out-of-business sales and other gimmicks.
In filling the vacancies, Fifth Avenue has changed its personality. Along with elegant stores like Tiffany's, Bergdorf Goodman, Cartier and Saks, it is expanding with stores catering to a wider audience. (Some traditionalists, of course, would say that Fifth, along with 57th Street, has come to resemble something of a theme park.)
Warner Brothers, which opened last year on the corner of 57th Street, filling a long-vacant spot, draws thousands of customers daily and averages a sale every six seconds, said Michael Hirschfeld, whose firm conducts the rent survey. Other new stores include Coca-Cola's gift shop, the Nine West shoe store and the Museum Company and Tower Records at Trump Tower. Disney is on the way to 55th Street, Nike is taking the old Bonwit Teller space at Trump Tower. Near 52d Street, Liz Claiborne is filling a vacancy, and Banana Republic is taking the former Japan Airlines spot.
"Fifth has certainly gone through major turnover, a changing of the guard," Mr. Hirschfeld said. "If I were going to predict the future, I would say it will be more of the Disneys."
Also boosting Fifth Avenue is the recovery in the city's economy and tourism. Fifth Avenue stores are a destination for many visitors and draw others who come for the area's attractions.
"The foot traffic is phenomenal," Mr. Cusick said. Business from Fifth's flourishing scene is spilling over to some side streets, especially restaurants.
Fifth Avenue's restored worldwide ranking also reflects the declining fortunes of competing strips overseas. The Ginza's tumble after five years in first place comes at a time of Japan's economic troubles and big currency swings.
Fifth Avenue offers not only a prime site for selling but also a prestigious promotional location -- "a symbolic billboard," Mr. Hirschfeld says. After years of vacancies, Mr. Cusick said the opposite problem was emerging. "If you want flagship property on Fifth," he said, "hurry up, because we're running out of space." BRUCE LAMBERT

Panel's Proposals to Divide A District Divide a District

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
With 32,000 students in Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, South Ozone Park, Howard Beach and the Rockaways, School District 27 is one of the city's most crowded. Because demographic projections predict continued growth in southeast Queens, a Board of Education advisory panel has recommended splitting the district in two.
But the proposal has divided the local school board and pitted neighborhoods against one another in a debate over its geographic, economic and racial implications. 
 Under the two variations of the proposal, a new District 27B would consist of the Rockaways, Broad Channel and perhaps three schools in Howard Beach. District 27A would comprise the northern part of the current district.
However, opponents of any split, most of them residents of the western Rockaways, with a predominantly white and affluent population, say a new District 27B would be too small, too isolated by the peninsula's peculiar geography and choked by the poverty of Far Rockaway. They say it would foster racial segregation and decrease property values.
James B. Egan, the school board president, questioned the viability of a District 27B, which would have fewer than 12,000 students. "If you look to some of the other districts," he said, "being small doesn't seem to have helped them."
But some Rockaways residents, particularly those in Far Rockaway, which is mostly black and mostly poor, believe that creating a District 27B would create a positive focus on the problems in their schools, which have the lowest reading scores in the district. James Sanders Jr., a member of School Board 27, who lives in Arverne, said: "We need to bring services to where the people are. It will increase parent involvement, because it will be our district instead of the district."
Splitting the district would in some ways make an unofficial arrangement official: a satellite district office was set up in Intermediate School 53 in Far Rockaway after parents there complained of not being able to make the trip the district office, which is in Ozone Park.
In a report last month, the advisory panel offered two alternatives for creating District 27B. One plan would include just the Rockaways and Broad Channel. The second plan would add three Howard Beach elementary schools.
Many residents of Howard Beach, which is predominantly white and working class, support the first idea. Mr. Egan, the school board's president, said: "There is a group on the mainland that would like to cut Rockaway out of their lives. They want to get rid of the Rockaway schools, which are some of the lesser performing and more impoverished schools in the district."
Margaret Cummings, a secretary and mother of three who lives in Howard Beach, said she supported the split -- as long as her community was not affected. "We don't want our children going over a bridge to a junior high school in Rockaway," she said.
By law, the advisory panel was required to consider the district's size, educational needs and compliance with the Federal Voting Rights Act, as well as the area's geography.
Across the city, redistricting has raised complex and sensitive issues of race and class as the panel has considered the representation of minorities on local school boards, and which schools, because of their poverty levels, would qualify for special Federal financing.
The Board of Education has until February to make a decision on redistricting. Meanwhile, debate and discussion on the issue are continuing at public hearings.
"It has created a lot of ill will among the different areas," said Steve Greenberg, a member of School Board 27, who lives in Breezy Point, on the west end of the Rockaways. "People are saying, 'You don't want to be with us,' and, 'We don't want to be with you.' Personally, I would prefer to leave things as they are." DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

HEADLINE: COPING;
Nurse Radio: Out of the Medical Wilderness

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
WHILE pushing a needle into me recently, Renee Trambert ordered me to listen to her radio program. I was in no position to argue. She told me that it was on WBAI-FM (99.5) every Friday at 1 P.M. for an hour, and that it reflected the sensibility of the nursing community -- precise and honest, yet compassionate. And so I became a fan of "Healthstyles," even if it meant missing a lunch rich in fats and empty calories.
It's the least I can do. These are embattled times for nurses. While female healers are no longer burned at the stake, they are subjected to the modern equivalent, being dismissed and replaced with billing clerks. In the city alone, the State Health Department predicts, more than 3,000 hospital-based registered nurses are expected to lose their jobs in the next three years. I imagine that one of them may very well be the person who doesn't respond when I press my call button in the middle of a hospital night. 
 "Healthstyles," an informative mix of interviews, readings and call-ins, was founded in 1979 as a monthly show called "everywomanspace" by two nurses, Diane Mancino and Paula Tedesco. The current producers and moderators are all nurses at major medical centers. Their show is the rarest of voices in the current health care debate -- an outreach to the medical consumer, open to feelings, long on sharing information and refreshingly free of surgeons who sound like fighter pilots.
"Whoa, no doc-bashing please," said Barbara Glickstein, slightly red-eyed from editing a show on organ transplants. "We are not whiny nurses; this is not a negative show. We promote the positive. You know about the Child Life program at Bellevue? A national model. I grew up on the Lower East Side and went to Bellevue and got better pediatric care than a lot of rich kids who went to private physicians. Child Life has Bank Street developmental workers, nurses, docs, dealing with the whole child."
"Doctors and nurses collaborate, but their roles are different," said Diana J. Mason, a director of education and research with a Ph.D. "Doctors treat the disease. We treat you, get you out of bed, teach you the breathing exercises, involve your family. We talk to you about preventing the disease or minimizing its effects, and we're listening to you and looking for clues about what else might be going on."
"It's a cliche, I know, I know," said Ms. Trambert, waving a hand without a needle, "but we use the word empowerment a lot. We want people to be able to help themselves, find the support groups, the alternative options. Nursing is about dealing with the real things, the constipation after surgery, sex, urinating, eating, the quality of life after the crisis."
We were sitting around a table talking about nurse radio and the delicate balances of a highly trained profession -- predominantly female in a male-dominated subculture -- struggling to shed old images of witch or handmaiden while holding onto old images of intuitive caregiver, toucher, comforter. Along with Gwen Alford and Belinda Wheeler, the three nurses have produced shows ahead of the wave on assisted suicide and suicide prevention; the politics of pain, and violence as a public health issue. On any given Friday, you might learn about the overlap between nurse practitioners and primary-care physicians; how to talk sex to your kids, and what to ask first when you're picking a hospital (what's the nurse-patient ratio?). The tone tends to be firm, calm, upbeat and very direct.
"New York City is behind the times in many ways," said Dr. Mason. "While it's the mecca for research and high-tech medicine, it's not progressive in certain aspects of patient care where nurses are involved. In smaller communities, nurses and doctors often run in the same social circles, which is not true here. So class as well as gender issues play out bigger."
Ms. Glickstein, who has master's degrees in public health and urban planning, thinks that most doctors enter medical school filled with altruism, but that their "inner light" is often destroyed by residency.
"The big thing now is 'patient satisfaction.' Docs are told to be more humanistic for economic reasons. I don't care how they come around as long as they do. They need to be more like nurses."
AIDS, the nurses agreed, has had an enormous impact on attitudes. As young health workers see other young people die, they must confront not only their own mortality but their inability to triumph over disease.
"This is why so many nurses volunteer for AIDS or hospice duty," said Dr. Mason. "It's back to basic nursing, about symptom management and caring, not curing."
"Something we want to do in the program," said Ms. Glickstein, "is help people recognize that an illness is not self-defining. It doesn't become who you are. And that you can be challenged by change."
"We'd like everyone to recognize that nurses are very cost-effective," said Dr. Mason. "When a nurse makes sure that a mother knows how to hydrate her newborn properly, she won't be back in a few days with a dehydrated baby. And another thing: I don't order a lot of tests."

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
Splendor in the Glass, 3 Kings, Many Menorahs

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
DOWNTOWN -- En Garde Arts, the site-specific theater company, had a site-specific benefit on Dec. 5. It was held on the vast, unfinished 51st floor of one of those Wall Street financial towers with offices so high up that they seem almost above the law as well as the city.
 "Great performance in a great setting," Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan borough president, said from a lectern in front of floor-to-ceiling windows that were looking out at a glittering panorama of the metropolis. "That's what En Garde Arts is all about, and I submit to you that that's what New York is all about, too." 
 The guests, including Wendy Wasserstein, Madeline Kahn and Brendan Gill, who were sitting at tables under exposed insulation and strings of light bulbs, seemed to agree with that. They also applauded Ms. Messinger's stalwart promise that much of the Manhattan waterfront below would be converted to parkland for public use over the next decade.
 But if New York is all about great performances in great settings, it's also a playground where everybody who wants be included in the game learns to get along. Donald J. Trump, whose plans to develop part of the Upper West Side waterfront have been one of the major controversies of Ms. Messinger's tenure, didn't make any speeches. But he was there, waiting to see Marla Maples Trump preside as the Queen of New York in a special performance of a play by Ms. Wasserstein. It took a poke at him even before his wife had a chance to deliver her lines.
 "I love this parade," Sarah Jessica Parker said to Michael J. Fox in a scene in which they watched the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. "It reminds me of New York before there were Benetton shops and a Trump Organization."
 UPTOWN -- "Nobody asked me to play one of the Three Kings," Charles Kuralt was saying backstage at Avery Fisher Hall on Dec. 5 before a performance of "Bending Towards the Light," a jazz version of the Nativity, "but I was sort of hoping they would."
 Mr. Kuralt, the former CBS News correspondent, would have to content himself with introducing the 10-year-old nontraditional tradition (which was performed last year at a synagogue).
 The Three Kings were being played by the jazzmen Tito Puente, Jon Faddis and Jimmy Slyde.
 "I love this event," said the jolly Mr. Kuralt, who would have looked terrific in a Santa suit. "When you first hear that they're going to swing 'Silent Night,' you worry, but it has a very reverent feeling. Jazz is just the thing to get you into a spiritual mood."
 A little later, when "The First Noel" was wafting out of a shepherd's saxophone and drifting up toward the concert hall's heavenly heights, the Three Kings (who don't appear until the end of the Nativity, as anybody familiar with the story knows) had just finished being dressed.
 "This king's for hire," said Mr. Slyde, 67, who has danced with Honi Coles and Gregory Hines. With tap shoes in hand to avoid making a racket, he joined his fellow Kings on their pilgrimage: they went up in an elevator, then down some stairs into the backstage darkness, where no light from the east or anyhere else was there to guide them.
 "Watch your train," Mr. Faddis, the trumpet player and music director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, told Mr. Puente, the Latin percussionist.
 They emerged into the brightly lighted terrazzo desert of the lobby (they'd be making their entrance from the back of the hall) and were held there by a kindly stage manager, while Gail Wynters as the Virgin Mary finished singing a jazz lullaby inside.
 Finally, the doors were opened, and to the raucous swells of a big-band version of "We Three Kings," they stepped inside and down the aisles to present the gift of their talents.
 DOWNTOWN -- "It feels so weird to have my menorah in my backpack," Jon Nalley was saying on Dec. 1 at the Brecht Forum educational center on West 27th Street, where he placed his menorah next to some others on a table for a ceremonial group lighting.
 Mr. Nalley, an openly gay member of Community School Board 2, was at a combination Hanukkah Festival and Commemoration of World AIDS Day, organized by a group called Jews for Racial and Economic Justice. "During the Berkeley sit-ins of 1964, the students lit menorahs, too," he said.
 A little later, with matches at the ready, Mr. Nalley joined a circle of about 100 people who expressed as much faith in the power of political action as they did in prayer, and who were also feeling somewhat dimmed by November's election results.
 "It's a very dark time in this city of ours," said Rabbi Ellen Levine, who works for a Jewish hunger relief organization called Mazon. "In very dark times, we want to try to light up the night. And when we light these menorahs, we have to think about how we ourselves are going to become the candles."
 The program that followed included dreidel-playing, post-modern dancing, singing and some political speechifying that emphasized the Hanukkah story as one of refusal and insurrection. As is the age-old tradition with political meetings, talent shows and school assemblies, the evening went on for a long, long time. So long that by the time the last comforting latke had been eaten and the last song sung, the candles of the menorahs had gone out.
 But even then, it seemed that nobody wanted to go home.

HEADLINE: Coming In From the Cold: A Fur Lovers' Backlash

BYLINE: By JULIA SZABO 

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, a New York record company executive who lives with two cats adopted from the North Shore Animal League bought herself a full-length female ranch mink coat. Shortly after that, she witnessed an antifur protest in front of Fred the Furrier, a Fifth Avenue shop that has since gone out of business, and she began to feel less and less comfortable about wearing her coat on the street.
 Eventually, fearing verbal assaults, paint splattering, egg hurling or some other form of antifur harassment, she put her fur into storage, where it remained until last December, when she began wearing it again. And two weeks ago, she ordered it out of storage again in preparation for winter. 
 With determination and misgivings, weighing a desire to stay warm and look good against fear of social pressure, many women are planning to wear fur again. This trend is not a reversal of the one against wearing fur; rather, it's a backlash by fur wearers who have felt intimidated in the last few years. Some are taking furs out of prolonged storage, and some are buying new or used furs. Others are buying parkas, sweaters and anoraks with fur trim. Most have struggled with the specter of threats and intimidation -- real or exaggerated -- but have decided that wearing fur is a matter of choice rather than a moral issue.
 The record company executive said she overcame her fear of public ridicule after doing volunteer work with terminally ill babies, which made her feel there were far worse things in the world than wearing fur. "I'm very much a staunch supporter of the First Amendment," she said. "They have a right to their opinion and to protest, and I have a right to my opinion and to wear fur."
 Despite her anger at the antifur movement, she is still cautious. Like many women who have decided to wear fur, she spoke on condition that she not be identified, concerned that her employers would think less of her for wearing fur. She will wear her fur to work, she said, but will take it off and fold it inside out before taking the elevator to her company's offices. "That way, I don't offend them, they don't offend me, and I can enjoy my fur and stay warm," she said.
 Some statistics seem to support the anecdotal accounts of women planning to wear fur again. "Every year there's a carry-over of coats that are brought in for storage that the women do not take out and wear," said Bob Selden of Goldin Feldman, a Manhattan furrier that offers storage services. "I'd say this year the percentage is significantly lower than in previous years, which means that more women are taking their coats out for whatever reason -- I assume to be worn."
 Fur retrieval is also up at Madame Paulette, a dry cleaner on the Upper East Side that offers fur storage. George Melidosian, who handles the furs, said that 280 pieces were retrieved in the last few weeks alone, compared with 200 in all of last year.
 Nonetheless, for every woman who's planning to wear fur again, there are plenty of women who are deciding this is the year not to wear fur, in deference to the wishes of friends, employers and children.
 Dan Mathews, a chief strategist for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an antifur group, asserts that fewer people are wearing furs and that those who do in New York are generally foreigners. But the fur industry, which has faced problems quite apart from the antifur movement, including a prolonged recession and several warm winters before last year's deep freeze, says sales are up.
 KAREN HANDEL, a spokeswoman for the Fur Information Council of America, says fur sales have risen 20 percent in the last two years, from $1 billion in 1991 to $1.2 billion in 1993. But at the same time, many designers have abandoned fur, including Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani, Bill Blass, Ralph Lauren, Isaac Mizrahi and Todd Oldham.
 One reason people may be feeling more at ease wearing fur is that it is becoming harder for fur lovers and haters alike to tell the difference between real and fake furs, so advanced is the technology employed by makers of synthetic pelts. Some designers even combine real and fake pelts in the same coat. Karl Lagerfeld, for one, in his last collection for Fendi, mixed the real and the fake the way his muse, Coco Chanel, once mixed real jewels with paste.
 On lower Broadway, the Canal Jean Company offers a selection of vintage furs priced from $5 to $70, with a few pieces marked as high as $100. Out front, fake furs are jumbled up with their real cousins in bins that invite vigorous investigation. Smaller fur pieces, anything with fur trim and fake fur coats are selling especially well, said the store's merchandise manager, Sandra Cullen.
 Nonetheless, the high profile of the antifur movement has placed many people in the position of having to justify and rationalize their decisions to wear fur. Many fur wearers insist they are humane, animal-loving Americans who are simply exercising their right to freedom of expression.
 "My parents came from China, so it's really hard for me to understand people in this country telling you what you can and cannot wear," said Helen Lee Schifter, a fashion editor at Mademoiselle who owns one fur and two coats with fur trim.
 Shannon McLean, owner of the Cose Belle boutique on East 69th Street, is a vegetarian but owns a fur coat. "I don't go to restaurants and tell people: 'How can you eat meat? Don't you know what it's doing to your system?' " she said.
 For some, buying used furs has helped relieve them of the dual stigma of ostentation and cruelty; their justification for wearing secondhand furs is that it's a form of recycling, the animals in question having died long before animal rights was recognized as an issue.
 "I bought a sable shawl last summer at a thrift shop in Southampton," said Anne Moore, a hat designer. "It's the best thing in the world, and I don't feel guilty because it was killed years ago and it cost only $35."
 Lauren Ezersky, a contributor to Paper magazine, who described herself as "very antifur," said of fur-wearing: "I think that it's kind of passe and a sign of vanity. However, I do have an ermine handbag from the 20's. I bought it at a flea market and I paid almost nothing for it. That animal's been dead for so many years. Why should he go to waste? He was beautiful, and now I'm wearing him."
 Of course, such arguments do not sit well with antifur advocates.
"I think those are the most callous fur wearers of all," Mr. Matthews of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said of people who consider themselves animal lovers and wear fur.
 Some complain that fur wearers are unfairly singled out, in a way that meat eaters and leather wearers are not, because fur is primarily women's apparel. "It is an exquisitely, emphatically female piece of iconography," said Marcia Pally, the president of Feminists for Free Expression, an advocacy group, and the author of "Sex and Sensibility: Reflections on Forbidden Mirrors and the Will to Censor" (Ecco Press, 1994). "I remain concerned and troubled by what I think is veiled misogyny in the antifur movement. I notice that people do not go after leather, which is iconographically more male than female, and I think one question that needs to be asked is, Why the tremendous rage against women who wear fur?"
 "It's not a women's issue," said Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "Whoever is wearing fur hears from people who are appalled by the pain and suffering and death, and women should not be considered so frail that we have to be insulated from criticism. If we are doing something that's appalling, it doesn't matter what gender, what race, what age, what anything we are -- cruelty is cruelty."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: George F. Cloutier;
Pines, Pure Water and Lots of Wildlife

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THIS is the time of year when everyone is fixated on trees, particularly the Christmas products of Connecticut's tree farms. And among tree farmers, George F. Cloutier of Ballamahack Road in Windham, the state's Tree Farmer of the Year, is considered one of the best.
Mr. Cloutier, 72 years old, is a 1949 graduate of the forestry program at the University of Connecticut. A forest fire spotter in Idaho, he later joined the International Paper Company in Maine and New Hampshire before returning to Connecticut to take various forestry jobs and retiring in 1978 as acting state forester. 
 During a recent stroll on the fire roads that crisscross his 110-acre property, Mr. Cloutier discussed the Christmas tree business and the role it plays in forest management. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. How much land do you need for a Christmas tree farm?
A. I've got about an acre and a half. That gives me crop of a couple of hundred trees a year in a 10-year rotation. I used to have about 15 acres but the gypsy moths came in and wiped them right out.
Q. What do people want?
A. They want spruce, and they want fir. Spruce is an easy one, it's very compact, but it doesn't hold its needles as well. Fir is the premium one. I've got Fraser fir from the southern Appalachians, a wonderful tree, and Douglas fir from out West. Balsam fir is all right if you grow it up north -- I've got 10,000 down here that aren't worth the powder to blow them up.
Q. What are the main advantages of Christmas trees for a farmer?
A. They make money. That's why I'm back in the Christmas tree business. And they're a fast crop. But it's also a heck of a lot of hard work.
Q. What's the work?
A. Trimming, clearing around them, and keeping them healthy. Everybody wants a prime, beautiful, unmarked Christmas tree, but they're hard to come by. A certain percentage of your Christmas trees will be perfect without you doing anything to them. But the greatest percentage of them, you have to work like a dog on.
And then there are the different tastes -- some like them open grown, others like them so dense you can hardly put anything on them.
Q. From a grower's perspective, what's the perfect tree?
A. Well, the average house ceiling is about seven feet tall, so let's say a six-and-a-half footer. It's medium density to maybe full density. And it should be a conical shape opening to a 30 to 60 degree slope from top to bottom, and it should be four inches in diameter at the base, so you can put it in a stand. But some people are very choosy, and some people are not. Trees that I wouldn't touch, someone will come in and fall in love.
Q. What percentage of trees meet those criteria?
A. That depends. If you control the brush the first seven or eight years, 60 or 70 percent of them might be. But if they're not growing in good, open sunlight, it might be 30 percent.
Q. Is there any use for trees that don't meet the grade for Christmas?
A. Just let them grow. Christmas trees evolved from timber plantations. They would plant the trees close together to get good form and high branches, then every 10 years they'd go in and clear some out, and the thinnings would become Christmas trees. When they got too big, the thinnings were used for something else, pulpwood or boughs or whatever. Eventually what was left was used for timber.
Q. How long has tree farming been around?
A. The tree farm program was started right after World War II, but there have been tree farmers around since the 1890's. Most farmers didn't care very much for the woodland, but some did and took very good care of it. Certain species, clearcutting is the only way to grow them. But you should cut in patches, never destroy a large enough area that you lose the feel of the forest. And that kind of management can be beneficial. Wildlife, particularly birds, are creatures of the edge, so they're going to have more area to live.
Q. Does tree farming ever really pay the rent?
A. Only on rare occasions. You have to have a lot of agricultural land close to a large population for Christmas trees. But the competition is getting very stiff -- everyone wants to get in on it. A crop of timber, on the other hand, takes 60 to 80 years to grow. Any one landowner today probably has it for 20 or 25 years, so all you do is build up the equity in it. You'd need a minimum of 2,000 or 3,000 acres for a working tree farm, and there's no such a property left today in Connecticut.
Q. Is tree farming less bothersome to neighbors than other forms of agriculture?
A. Yes and no. It certainly doesn't have the odors, or the continual noise. But some neighbors are pretty darned fussy about what you're doing. They don't even want you cutting down a tree. Do you know there are towns that are outlawing tree cutting in certain places because people are afraid it's going to destroy the view? This is private, tax-paying property, and you're not allowed to cut the trees because it destroys someone's esthetics. We've got to shut those people off.
Q. Besides the Christmas trees, do you plant the others, or tend what's there naturally?
A. There's some planting. I collect red oak seed, which is about our superior hardwood right now, and every time I take a walk I spread them out, Johnny Appleseed style. But sometimes it doesn't pay to plant. Out there I planted 1,000 or 2,000 hemlock trees every year for 40 years, and almost all are gone because of the deer population explosion. Usually you don't plant trees unless you're in an open field and all the old fields have grown into hardwood forests. You might introduce species to help wildlife, such as a crab apple or elderberry, or plant something that you don't have, but you're always bucking Mother Nature when you do that.
Q. Do foresters ever make the wrong decision about what to plant?
A. Well, when I was on the state Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation committee we heard about this wonderful shrub in Pennsylvania, multiflora rose. And another, autumn olive. So we brought them in and planted them, and they turned out to be great for wildlife, but they also turned out to be noxious weeds. We can't control their spread.
Q. So we don't have as much control as we'd like to think?
A. Mother Nature does a lot to govern any management that you try to do. She changes it at her will. She's got wind storms and heavy snows and ice storms. Anyone who thinks they're smart enough to control an entire ecosystem is a nut.
Q. What benefits do we derive from the forest other than wood?
A. You're producing drinking water, primarily. You're protecting the watershed. You're preventing pollution. The forests filter the water going into the ground, and going into the streams and rivers. Every time we put in a highway or a house lot, we put in drainage ditches and culverts to direct rain water down to the nearest stream, instead of putting it off onto the land like it used to be. You know any trout streams left in Connecticut? Darned few. Because so many of the forests are gone.
Over there I've got a stand of maple, and I get maple syrup out of it. I've got walnut trees, and blueberry and raspberry. There's lot of wild turkey in here, beaver and otters, mink and weasel, all the waterbirds you can think of, hawks and owls. This used to be farmland too poor to support people, but now it's supporting forest crops and wildlife.
Q. Do people understand the need for forest management?
A. People don't understand. When they start teaching in the schools that you don't cut trees, something's wrong. Where are you going to get paper for writing or books, or pencils? We need wood for furniture and houses. The problem is the lawyers who are making policies where it should be left up to the natural resource managers. We've got 3 million acres of land in Connecticut, more or less. And 1 million of it is already developed, or maybe a little more. There's about 1.5 million acres left of forest land. We need a million acres at least to protect our watershed. Long Island Sound is dying because of what we're doing in the forests. We've got to zone it to protect it. But they bring in lawyers to make decisions in natural resource management, and you're going to get the wrong decisions.
Q. Is Christmas tree farming important to forest preservation, or is it too tightly managed?
A. Even land in Christmas trees is a good forest. It filters the water supply, and it provides habitat for wildlife. Lots of trees are never going to make it as Christmas trees; they're going to stay in the ground. And as soon as you cut a section, you're going to get another crop in. It will always be covered with trees. You can't do any economic forestry on 5 or 10 acres -- you've got to have large tracts of land. And if you want to collect and filter water, and have all the amenities that go with forest land, you can't afford to continue to chew up the forests. All our land is going into development, and some day it's going to catch up to us.

U.S. Decline? Not in Golf Balls, Mister!

BYLINE: By BILL GEIST; Bill Geist is a correspondent for CBS News and a former "About New York" columnist for The New York Times. This article is adapted from his most recent book, "Monster Trucks and Hair-in-a-Can: Who Says America Doesn't Make Anything Anymore" (G. P. Putnam's Sons).

 BODY:
I KNOW, I know: America doesn't make baseballs any more, no VCR's or fax machines; steelworkers and farmers are endangered species; the balance of trade has completely lost its equilibrium, and our top companies have lost a third of their jobs to places like Mexico at 10 cents on the dollar.
But to those who lament the post-industrial economy's going to hell in a handbasket, let me say a few inspiring words. Monster trucks, aerosol hair, fingernail technology, Elvis impersonators and, yes, used golf balls. 
 It's a high, arching drive off the eighth tee at Grand Cypress, a beautiful drive, sailing through blue skies this spring morn in Orlando, Fla.
And yet . . . the drive is beginning its initial descent a bit . . . early . . . it seems, its path carrying it well short of the green, toward splashdown in this altogether charming (to the landscape architect) little -- kerplop! -- lake.
"Attaboy! One more time!" whoops Jim Reid, sitting idly by in a golf cart by the water hazard. He would. He is the Used Golf Ball King of Florida. And therefore the World!
Where others see grief and frustration, he sees opportunity. "Basically, I profit from the mistakes of others," Jim says.
Next comes a ball struck rather poorly, flying low as if to evade radar detection and skipping once! . . . twice! . . . three times! on the waters, before sinking to Davy Jones's pro shop below.
"It's a sweet sound, isn't it?" Jim asks, leaning back comfortably, one foot on the dash of the golf cart, listening to the sound of palm fronds in the breeze punctuated by the bloop! plop! kerplunk! of golf balls upon the waters.
Anyone can play golf; fortunately for Jim Reid, not very well. (In my own case, if I want to play 18 holes, I have to do it on the longest day of the year.) And golf is growing fast -- more and more people every day are not playing the game very well. Florida alone has more than 1,000 courses.
And even as the level of play is going down, golf-course design is becoming more spectacular, with larger and more abundant water hazards, many of a size that, were they in Arizona, developers would be putting up 1,200 condominium units around them and calling them "Pollo del Mar." This is all to the good, the way Jim sees it.
JIM moved to Florida from Oklahoma a few years ago, to leave the rat race for paradise.
But things turned out a little differently from planned. Jim took a job as a surveyor with Walt Disney World, pulling down about $250 a week. His wife, Beverly, took a job with the phone company. They bought a little house. Not all that different from Oklahoma when you got right down to it. They sat in traffic with the air conditioner on instead of the heater. And they worried about hurricanes instead of tornadoes.
But Jim did get to go scuba diving once in a while. And one day, he put on his gear and hopped into a water hazard on the Rolling Hills golf course in Longwood to see what he could see.
"I dove down to the bottom," he recalls, leaning back in his golf cart, "and what I saw was amazing. The entire bottom was solid white. Golf balls. Thousands of golf balls. White gold!"
He scooped up a bunch and examined them in the daylight. "Most of them looked just like new," he said. He showed them to the course manager, who offered Jim 10 cents a ball.
Jim dove back in. He came up with more than 2,000 balls that day, making almost as much in a few hours as Disney World paid him for a week.
After talking it over with Beverly, he took the plunge and quit his job at Disney World.
"It was kind of embarrassing" at first, he says. "When people ask what you do for a living and you say you work at Disney World in Orlando, they say, 'Well, this guy's a solid citizen.' But you say your profession is diving in mud holes for golf balls, and they kind of back off, you know?"
But dive he did, and the harvest was plentiful. He brought home carloads of balls and put them in the washing machine. Beverly had supported him in his decision to try this cockamamie scheme but drew the line at destroying her washing machine. She told him to buy his own: a 20-year-old Maytag. A capital investment.
The neighbors didn't much care for the idea either, listening to 500 golf balls go round and round in the washing machine until all hours of the night (you'll recall the racket of just one tennis shoe in a dryer). So Jim did what he had to do. He hired the neighbors.
And he experimented with the technology. "You don't just open up the Yellow Pages and look for used golf-ball processing equipment," he notes, correctly. For a while he cleaned the balls in a cement mixer. But that scoured the dimples completely off the balls, making them behave peculiarly coming off the tee. A golf pro complained about this, but called back to say maybe it wasn't such a bad thing after all -- everybody was signing up for lessons.
Jim and his staff of neighbors washed the balls, then perched them on nails and spray-painted them for that "Like New" look. They boxed them up by brand and by condition for resale, often at half the price of new balls.
Word spread, and other divers became interested in this promising Golf Ball Recycling Industry. Jim began buying balls from other divers. Soon, 18-wheelers were backing up to his garage, bringing old muddy balls and taking them away Like New. He finally had to move his business, called Second Chance, to an industrial area.
"When I quit my job," he said, "I figured I'd have to find 2,500 golf balls a week to break even" -- to get back the $250 a week he made at Disney.
Fortunately for Jim, last year he found 10 million golf balls.
I mean, like, so what if America's not making steel anymore! One single citizen with entrepreneurial spirit is retrieving more golf balls than the rest of the world combined!
"HOW'S the fishing today?" yells Jim, greeting one of his divers, who is backing up to the loading dock with bags of balls in his pickup truck. Remember the sponge divers of Tarpon Springs? No? Well, these are the Used Golf Ball Divers of Orlando, the epicenter of the golf boom, where Used Golf Ball Diving is becoming a full-time, full-fledged occupation. Soon the Teamsters will be trying to take it over. Students will be able to major in Used Golf Ball Diving at Florida State.
But environmentalists needn't worry. America's oyster and clam beds may be dying from over-fishing and water pollution, but not Florida's golf-ball beds.
"Some of them completely replenish themselves in a couple of weeks," Jim says, amazed. But then, some 200 million new golf balls are manufactured every year. And where do they all go? Gone to hazards every one. When will they ever learn? "Never, I hope," Jim replies.
All manner of species thrive in these waters: the Spalding, Max-Fli, Top-Flite, personalized balls (Jim Harrison, Jim Reid has found your golf ball), balls imprinted with the Lord's Prayer.
The beds yield other treasures, too: bicycles, X-rated videos, murder weapons -- occasionally even the murderees themselves! The divers find lots of golf clubs, hurled into the water by temperamental golfers. One diver has 200 clubs at home.
"Pretty good day," says Tony Chastain, a meat-cutter turned diver. "About 2,500 balls."
"Get 'em over at Grand Cypress?" Jim asks.
"Yeah. Right off the tee there on the ninth," Tony replies, graciously divulging a hot spot to the other divers.
Al appreciates it. He's a little disappointed with his catch: 1,383. "One day I netted 4,500 over at Pelican Bay. Now that was a day."
Jim Reid pays the divers 8 cents a ball. Waders -- who retrieve them with their toes from the shallows -- get 10 cents. It's a skill thing.
One diver, Dan Beecher, retrieved 600,000 balls one year. He makes about $50,000 a year, and drives an El Camino with a car phone.
But Tony says it's no picnic out there. "It takes a different breed of person to be down there hour after hour in the dark with snakes and eels and your imagination." Others talk of stepping on broken glass and jagged pieces of metal. Several divers have been struck by golf balls, one lost a finger to a snapping turtle and Jim Reid himself was hit by lightning while under water.
And golf-ball diving is a craft. Bob Cooke has retrieved more than three million balls, and he is a pro in every sense of the word. "I don't wear gloves," he says. "You've got to feel the balls. Gloves'll cut down your take 30 to 40 percent." Analysis is part of the game, too. "Most golfers are right-handed," he says, "and most slice the ball, so you work the hazards on the right side of the fairway."
About 50,000 golf balls a day(!) arrive at Second Chance from courses as far away as Hawaii. They are counted, rinsed and then marinated in a vat of Jim's secret sauce, a whitener. And he does mean secret. His workers sign a five-page pledge not to divulge its contents. The business has become lucrative and competitive.
The business has become structured, too, even to the point where Jim pays golf courses up to $2,000 a month to mine their water hazards. "Once I pick the balls up, I own them," he explains. "Legally, they're abandoned property."
After the balls are soaked in his secret whitening sauce, they're sprayed with a clear acrylic formula that is, likewise, top secret. The balls are then sorted by condition and brand name by three people who drop them into a Rube Goldberg contraption with PVC pipe going every which way. Jim didn't order that monstrosity out of the Yellow Pages either. He built it.
Some of the balls in poor condition are sold to cruise ships, on which passengers practice their drives into the ultimate water hazard. Other bad balls -- get this! -- are used in counter-poaching. If Jim finds extensive poaching on courses where he has the rights, he'll dump them into the water to make the poachers work for hours picking up worthless balls. Yes, he carries it that far.
THAT'S how Jim Reid became the Used Golf Ball King of Florida. In 1993, his company had gross revenues of about $1 million. His factory had gone to two shifts, and he was buying and selling on the world market. About one-third of the sales went to Europe; one-third to pro shops in this country; and one-third to chain stores. One big customer: Wal-Mart. And he started to prefer the term "reconditioned" to "used" for his product, if you don't mind.
"The only thing that could hurt me," he said, with no trace of a smile, "is if one of the major companies comes up with a floating golf ball. That won't happen. It would hurt them worse. The way it is now, everybody makes money but the guy who hits the ball."
But what did happen is that Jim sold out. He recently got $5.1 million for Second Chance from Sport Supply Group, a Dallas company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
So. Jim Reid found paradise, just as he'd planned when he moved from Oklahoma. At 50, he is retired, spending much of his time on his 53-foot boat, cruising from Fort Pierce down to the Bahamas and over to the Keys. But he doesn't play golf. Not really fond of the game.

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young -- A periodic report.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Dec. 11

 BODY:
When other children were hearing fairy tales, Garland Hampton heard bedtime stories about the day Uncle Robert killed two Milwaukee police officers, or the time Grandma, with both barrels, blew away the father of two of her children back in '62. By the time he was 9, he had seen his mother kill her boyfriend.
Now, at 15, locked up in the County Jail and awaiting trial on murder charges, Garland is still enough of a child that he is afraid he might cry when darkness falls. 
 But he is old enough to have had a nasty past of his own, too: at 10, there was trouble about stolen bicycles; at 12, he was picked up for shooting and wounding a gang rival; at 14, for carrying a .357 Magnum and a bag of cocaine, and now, for gunning down a fellow gang member. Prosecutors say he is an adolescent menace to society, who must pay for his sins like a man.
Garland just says he is scared.
"I guess I been scared all my life," said Garland, a stocky boy with a hint of a 70's-style Afro, who cried as he talked about his life. "For me, living has been the same as running through hell with a gasoline suit on. I don't want people feeling sorry for me, but I really ain't had nothing good happen to me. The ax fell heavy on my head."
The trajectory of Garland's life so far was not inevitable: indeed, many children whose family lives are enmeshed in violence and neglect never get into trouble with the law themselves.
"Not all kids from violent families will be violent themselves," said Patrick H. Tolan, an associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois in Chicago. "But the more violence that kids are exposed to, the greater the likelihood that they will become violent. If you're going to bet on somebody, he's got the history."
In Garland's family history, violence was like a cursed heirloom, passed from generation to generation. As a little boy, Garland wanted no part of that legacy. He used to stay up late, on a kind of guard duty, afraid that the grown-ups drinking and screaming in the next room would kill each other.
When he was 9, they did. His mother spent 14 months in prison on manslaughter charges for killing her boyfriend as he slapped her around the kitchen and slammed her into a radiator during an argument over money. She was pregnant with the man's baby, their third child, her fifth. Garland saw the shooting while hiding behind the washing machine a few feet away and smelled the gun's smoke as it curled upward like a lost spirit.
"I seen him die on the floor," Garland said. "I always called him Daddy. He was one of the only people who was nice to me. He used to talk to me about being a man."
Garland is not yet a man, but the family legacy of fighting, and killing, has already passed to him. In June, Garland had his own argument over money with Donell T. Storks, another 15-year-old in his gang. In a few minutes, Donell was dead, two bullet holes in his head, and Garland was headed for jail and judgment.
 
The Studies
A Volatile Mix: Neglect and Abuse
 Garland could hardly have been groomed for a life of crime and punishment any better if his family had followed a set of instructions.
Experts in criminal justice, psychology, and child development all cite precisely the experiences of his upbringing as the major factors that lead children to become violent: neglect, abuse, inconsistent parents, a violent neighborhood and family members who engage in violence themselves.
"The family is the most powerful predictor for a child becoming violent," said Byron Egeland, professor of child development at the University of Minnesota. "Clearly the family is crucial in understanding the violence we're seeing in the streets. The streets may have something to do with it, but it's what the kid brings to the street that I think is the most important."
While it is impossible to predict how an infant will be affected by a childhood of violence, fear or neglect -- and indeed, many children are remarkably resilient -- there is no doubt that children learn their most important behavioral lessons, healthful or unhealthful, from their families.
"The family is the strongest socializing influence for a young child," said Kathleen Kostelny, a senior research associate at the Erikson Institute for Advanced Study in Child Development in Chicago. "Kids who experience violence in their community and violence in their home are at a greatly increased risk for a whole host of bad developmental outcomes."
Children who come from families in which a close relative has been incarcerated have an especially high likelihood of getting into trouble with the law themselves. Justice Department studies based on data from the late 1980's show that more than half the juvenile delinquents imprisoned in high-security reformatories had close relatives who had also been incarcerated.
Children who have suffered neglect or abuse, too, are more likely than others to turn to crime. In a 1992 study, The Cycle of Violence, for the National Institute of Justice, an office of the Justice Department, Cathy Spatz Widom, a criminology professor at the State University of New York at Albany, reported that "being abused or neglected as a child increased the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile by 53 percent, as an adult by 38 percent, and for a violent crime by 38 percent." One estimate put the number of child abuse and neglect cases last year at 1.9 million.
Professor Widom says, however, that while violent, abusive homes increase the odds that children will end up in jail, "it's by no means inevitable." Most of these children never have run-ins with the law, she said. Many other factors, including neighborhood, school, peers, access to firearms -- and luck -- play a role in who pulls a trigger and who doesn't, who goes to prison and who goes to college.
Not many children have witnessed as much bloodshed as Garland or come from a family so quick to pull a gun or a knife to settle disputes. Not many know, as Garland did, that they can get a pistol any time from beneath their grandmother's mattress.
But America is full of children who have seen so many fathers beating up mothers, so many playground gang fights and so many years of bloodletting on the big and small screen, that they could easily think that violence is as natural as eating or sleeping, that everybody does it.
This can be especially true in the neighborhoods like Garland's on Milwaukee's North Side, where resources are few, frustrations high and most of the youth programs and decent jobs long gone.
"The extra-home social supports have deteriorated to almost nothing," said Dr. Bruce Perry, chief of psychiatry at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. "These kids are really left adrift. The truth is we made these kids. Our culture is reaping what it sowed."
The harvest is as bitter as it is plentiful. Almost everyone in these places knows someone who died a violent, early death. But the deadly mix of children and violence is not confined to the inner city. The offspring of abuse and neglect can be found almost anywhere in the nation: in Appalachian hollows and in comfortable suburbs.
And they can be found in white, working-class neighborhoods like the South Side of Milwaukee, where 16-year-old David Newbury and another native son, Mark Rea, sexually assaulted and then clubbed to death a 15-year-old classmate, Charlene Dvorak, near Pulaski Park in 1993.
David's court records and other documents reveal a childhood of domestic violence, alcoholic parents, beatings with belts and fists, cruel words and indifference. His parents did not attend his murder trial. Before he was sentenced last year to life in prison, David told a probation agent, "I lived like I was treated."
 
The Family
'Shotgun Mamma' Filled in as Mother
 "Garland had a lot of potential," Janet Mayfield, one of Garland's seventh grade teachers, said in an interview. "He still does. He's caring and smart. This didn't have to happen. All he ever needed was some love and a chance to get out of his environment."
Those charged with protecting the city's children were well aware of that environment. Case workers and probation and police officers had been keeping track of Garland and his family since he was 2 years old.
In 1988, he and his six younger siblings were removed from the custody of their mother, Willie Jean Hampton, because of her drug use and allegations that the children were being abused and neglected.
But they weren't sent far. They were placed with their grandmother, Fay Lee McCoy, nicknamed Shotgun Mama or Grandma Gauge since as she puts it, "people in the neighborhood know I've killed before."
Mrs. McCoy did not hide her history. She bragged like a soldier home from the front, telling everyone -- family, neighbors and even case workers -- that in her 67 years she had killed several people. Only one killing could be confirmed: the slaying of her boyfriend in Arkansas in 1962.
"I don't believe she killed all them people she said she did," said Marie Grant, a friend of Mrs. McCoy for almost 30 years. "She gave the kids those impressions so the kids would be afraid of her. It worked. They thought violence was a way of life."
One case worker wrote in Garland's file that although Mrs. McCoy did "not reflect the image of a perfect substitute parent," the children preferred her to their mother and accepted Mrs. McCoy as "the most stable and secure alternative to their turbulent past life style."
Over the years, the children went back and forth between the two women. When they lived with their grandmother, the household often included their mother, her half-sister Melinda Collins and Ms. Collins's son. Always, they lived in neighborhoods where gang members owned the hallways, selling drugs and women's bodies and firing their guns in the middle of the afternoon.
Garland has never met his father, who walked out while Garland was being born. His whereabouts are unknown.
What finally took Garland away from his family was his 1991 arrest for shooting into a group of gang rivals and wounding one of them. The Juvenile Court sent him to a detention center, and later a group home.
In 1992, case workers placed six of Ms. Hampton's seven children in foster homes. But Garland, who at 13 had just been released from the group home, was allowed to stay with his grandmother. His mother was still living there.
"Why did they place him back in that house?" Mrs. Grant asked. "They knew the circumstances. I guess the system don't give a damn."
Garland was sent back to the group home in November 1993 for possession of cocaine and a gun. He ran away in March, returning yet again to his grandmother's apartment, and three months later, got into the fight that led to the death of Donell Storks.
 
The Guns
At the Age of 11 A Gift of a Pistol
 When Garland was 10 his grandmother, Mrs. McCoy, pulled him downstairs to the basement and taught him how to handle a pistol. She thought she was doing the right thing. She had grown up poor and hard in the 1930's and 40's in the rural South. Having a shotgun hanging over the bed was as common as wearing hand-me-down shoes.
Mrs. McCoy had to drop out of school in the third grade and go to work picking cotton and figured that Garland had a better life than hers. She just wanted him to know how to protect it on the streets.
A psychologist wrote in the custody case that Mrs. McCoy's instincts were protective but that she had been simply overwhelmed by her family's life and luck. Violence has haunted her family for at least three generations, from Warren, Ark., to Milwaukee, where the family settled in the late 1960's hoping for a better life.
In 1962, during a fight, Mrs. McCoy shot and killed Robert Lee Collins, the father of two of her 17 children. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and spent a short time in jail.
Her son with Mr. Collins is Garland's Uncle Robert, who is serving two life sentences for murdering two Milwaukee police officers during a robbery and chase in 1981. He was 19 when he was sent away.
Garland started carrying a gun, a pistol his grandmother gave him, at 11. "Everybody I knew was strapped," street slang for armed, he said. "If you weren't strapped, you was risking your life."
And around the time he should have been blowing out the candles for his 12th birthday, Garland shot into a knot of street gang rivals with a .22-caliber rifle, wounding one of them in the chest.
 
The Streets
A War Zone For Life's Lessons
 In Garland's America, there is little time for childhood. "I feel like I been grown my whole life," he said.
Long before he was charged with a murder of his own, Garland had seen neighbors and strangers stabbed, hit with shovels, kicked, beaten, pistol-whipped, threatened, robbed, riddled with bullets, arrested, overdosed, passed out drunk, strangled and zipped into body bags.
One of Garland's elementary school teachers, Lonnie Anderson, a soft-spoken African-American who became Garland's mentor, used to drop him off at home after field trips.
"Our relationship was like father and son," Mr. Anderson said. "I don't think his family even knew his dreams. He wanted to go to college, to play football. You knew you had a person who wanted better in life. I wonder if his family knew what they were doing to him."
Mr. Anderson could see what the streets were doing to him. He would watch Garland get out of his car and with each step down his block, be transformed from a seventh grader still excited by a school outing into a tough guy trying to survive in a tough place. The little boy's face became hard, his gait a swagger, his smile a memory.
"If I had to wear the same pair of pants and walk 10 miles to work every day," Mr. Anderson said, "I wouldn't raise my son in Garland's neighborhood. I don't know what I would have become if I had gone through what that boy has."
Donald Krueger, the former principal at the Bell Middle School, which Garland attended for a couple of years, said Garland had been a "quality kid" despite his troubles.
"There were two Garlands," Mr. Krueger said. "You could see this war going on inside him all the time."
Signs of his internal war appear on his seventh grade report card, where his home economics teacher wrote, "Cooperative and courteous, is a pleasure to have in class." But his science teacher said, "This is a minus grade, lacks respect for authority."
By the end of eighth grade, Garland stopped going to school. The street had called him.
On the street, Garland is known as Boo, a name his family gave him because when he was small he enjoyed jumping out of closets to scare people.
At 15, Garland became a father himself. His 9-month old son, Garland, or Lil Boo, lives with his 15-year-old mother and her grandmother on Chicago's West Side.
"I'm going to be there for Lil Boo," the baby's young mother said. "Garland's mother wasn't there for him. Nobody was."
The baby's grandmother smiled as he tried to stand. "He's a sweet baby," she said. "I hope he stays that way. I'm going to do my best to make sure he does."
 
The Legacy
A Broken Promise Of a Better Life
 Garland's mother, Willie Jean Hampton, was 16 when Garland was born. Now at 32, her soul and spirit are weary from living a life that sounds a lot like her son's.
She said she was abused by her aunt when she and her brother and sister lived with her mother's sister in Kansas City, Kan. "She treated her dogs better than us," she said earlier this fall. "A person who treats kids like that don't need to live."
Now in jail awaiting trial on armed robbery charges, she used to tell Garland about the whippings and the hungry nights that she and her sister and brother had suffered through, and she promised her first born that his life would be better.
"It ain't worked out that way," Garland said. "We were raised just the same as she was." He took a bite of a Kit Kat bar, his favorite candy, and offered a piece to his lawyer, Robin Shellow.
Garland says he wants his son to grow up different than he did. "I want him to grow up with love. I want him to know he has a daddy. Even if I can't be there with him. I'll always love him."
He said he had found more love on the street than at home. His arms are scarred with gang tattoos from around the time he joined the Vice Lords street gang at 11 or 12. One, a champagne glass, is a tribute to ghosts, he said, "to celebrate all the brothers who ain't here no more."
Now Garland is charged with killing one of those brothers himself. Last June 10, shortly before midnight, he and Donell Storks had an argument in an overgrown yard behind an abandoned house.
The two had known each other since age 8 or 9. As members of the Vice Lords, they had run the streets, gambled and bragged about girls together.
Police reports, prosecutors and Garland say that the day before Donell was killed, Garland was given $100 by his grandmother but that he had lost the money and blamed Donell. Garland recruited 18-year-old Kenyetta Helm, another Vice Lord, to help him get the money back, and the three teen-agers stepped into the darkened backyard.
Moments later, Donell was dead, shot twice in the head from a few feet away. Either shot, the coroner reported, was enough to kill the boy.
Garland signed a confession, saying he was sorry for shooting Donell, that he was sorry for everything. Mr. Helm also had his gun out that night. He did not fire it but was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Garland says now that he did not tell the police the whole story, about how scared he was that night, how he wet his pants, how he shot Donell in self-defense after Donell pulled his gun, like a wild West gunfighter.
The police say no gun was ever found on Donell. Garland said Mr. Helm had taken it and hidden it, an assertion Mr. Helm denies.
"We were all strapped that night," Garland says. "I wanted to run but I thought Donell would shoot me. I felt like I was going to die. I felt like the world was going to come to an end. I was scared."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Casts Shadow for Garment Workers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PEN ARGYL, Pa., Dec. 8

 BODY:
They are scared, angry and frustrated, but mostly scared. Many have worked in the garment mills of Lehigh Valley for 30 years and more. The whine of sewing machines and dust of fabric have become as familiar as early snows and now the threat of unemployment.
While the removal of worldwide trade barriers and the lowering of tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are expected to help American high-tech and service industries, they mean fear among the nation's garment workers. 
 These are men and women of modest means from modest towns, like this one in the rolling hills above the Allentown-Easton corridor of eastern Pennsylvania, who cut large swaths of cloth and sew together the various elements that become a piece of clothing. They already work for relatively low pay, about $15,000 a year, but they face strong competition from places like Bangladesh, Taiwan, Singapore, where wages are far lower, working conditions bad and benefits virtually nonexistent.
But the rush toward a free trade world, which began during the Reagan and Bush years, is threatening the little security American garment workers still have. Their industry has been in turmoil for more than 30 years, as many of the mills in the North fled to the South and then overseas. In its peak year of 1973, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union had more than 1.2 million members around the country, mostly women; by June of this year, membership had dropped below 800,000.
In the Lehigh Valley, the decline has been even worse. A study released last month by Thomas Hyclak, a professor of economics at Lehigh University, found that the region lost almost 54 percent of apparel workers from 1972 through 1990. While other types of manufacturing jobs also fled the region in that time, the decline in apparel was one of the steepest.
The area has managed to attract new jobs in insurance, health care and other service industries, but many apparel workers, trained for nothing else, say they have no idea what they could do if their factories closed down. They feel that trade pacts like GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will jeopardize their well-being.
"It seems like a dying industry," said Tammy Impechiate, a 37-year-old mother of three who works as a seamstress at Fashions by Danielle here, even though her husband, Joseph, is a part owner. "Used to be, there was a blouse mill on every corner. Now, there's only a handful left. Even when I started out of high school 19 years ago, mills were everywhere. Now, it's scary. You don't know if your company is going to close down or if you can get another job. I've got children who want to go to college. I don't know if I can afford to send them."
Mrs. Impechiate is typical of apparel workers in the region. Many finished high school, married young, moved into small houses on an acre or two of land, found a job in the mills and never did anything else. Never had to. For the most part, they led quiet, stable lives.
But through the 1980's, and more so now with the conclusion of the international trade agreements, the feeling of insecurity pervades every garment factory.
Some, like Maryann Corcione, who sews blouses for Scotty's Fashions in Little Gap, Pa., already work a second job to make ends meet. For 12 hours every two weeks she cleans a bank. Her husband, James, is a maintenance worker at a K-Mart.
Mrs. Corcione and others in the plant have already seen life without Scotty's, a family-owned business with five plants in the region. The company shut down for six months two years ago and then called back just over half the 2,100 employees. She was one of the lucky ones.
"I worked at the bank a little more and kept hoping I'd get my job back," she said. "I called every day, asking what was going on."
And if the plant closed again? "I don't know what I'd do," she said. I was a meat-packer once. Maybe I could go back to that field if something happened. Without experience at anything else, forget it."
Many workers say they know of GATT but understand little of the economic theory that says it will make the country richer over all. They believe it is only the latest nail in the garment industry coffin.
But Nancy Shoemaker, a 54-year-old sewer at Anna Sportswear in Pen Argyl, says she understands all right. She follows all the political developments that affect the industry, and GATT makes her boil.
"What's a little person going to say?" she said. "What good does it do to scream our heads off? We're helpless." A single mother with three grown children, she has worked almost 25 of her 59 years in the mills and watched many of her friends lose their jobs.
"The industry I work in is not going to be here in a short while," she said. "Textiles are gone. We ought to have a Boston Tea Party for textiles, bomb the ships as they bring in the goods. Am I afraid? Of course, I'm afraid. Wouldn't you be scared?"
She mustered up a laugh. "I'm going to be on welfare, if the Republicans don't do away with it."
Others see no humor at all. Ronnie Smith, 52, who works in the cutting room at Anna Sportswear, said his view is that free trade does nothing but put people out of jobs.
"I blame Clinton," he said, alluding to the Administration's promises to create jobs. "He lied like hell at the beginning, then as soon as he got a good offer, there it is. Everybody here's losing their job."
Mr. Smith has worked for 30 years as a part-time electrician and for 21 years in the mills, which is steadier work, he said. If he loses his job, he said, he will go to school to learn something else.
Age is a factor that weighs heavily on many of the workers. Mrs. Impechiate said she was worried about her 55-year-old mother who lives alone and works at another mill.
"She's afraid," Mrs. Impechiate said. "She's worked there since she was 16. She has no other skill. What would she do? Me and my sister, we would have to take care of her." She acknowledged how lucky she was to have married the boss. "But if the business goes, we're both out of a job, and my mother couldn't help us."
A mother of five from Bangor, Pa., Mary Shiner, 54, and the only wage earner in her family, said she always loved working in the mill because she had time to get her children off to school before beginning work at 8 A.M. and she got off early enough, 3 P.M., to greet them when they returned.
But over the 11 years she has sewn garments, she has watched factories close and friends lose their jobs and now worries constantly that her plant might shut down.
"I love my work," she said. "It's been good to me and it's been a good job for the kids. But I told all my children to try to stay out of the factories. It's not going to be there through their lifetimes."

Mary Shiner, 54, left, who has sewn clothing for 11 years, says she worries constantly that she will lose her job. Tammy Impechiate, 37, feels a threat even thought her husband is part owner of the factory where she works as a seamstress. "If the business goes, we're both out of a job," she said.

HEADLINE: Highflying Merrill Hits a Snag

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
In a year when most of its Wall Street rivals have been reeling from tumbling earnings, Merrill Lynch & Company is on track to log its second most profitable year ever.
Having escaped the large trading losses suffered by rivals like Salomon Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Morgan Stanley Group when interest rates began rising in February, Merrill, the country's largest brokerage and investment firm, continued to rack up profits and became the darling of stock analysts who follow the securities industry. 
 Then came Orange County.
Since news of Merrill's heavy involvement underwriting and bankrolling a large part of the highly leveraged portfolio that forced the California county into bankruptcy last week, the company's stock has plunged. Lawsuits are piling up, and Merrill is under investigation by Federal and state regulators.
Though it remains to be seen what the company's liability will be, at the least Merrill faces years of litigation that could end up costing it millions of dollars.
"Most of these cases get settled whether there is merit to them or not," said a lawyer at a rival securities company who insisted on anonymity.
Even so, with what is known so far, few securities analysts and industry executives believe that the potential payouts threaten the future of Merrill, which had $16.5 billion in revenues last year.
In an interview on Friday, Merrill's top managers said that the company acted properly in all its dealings with Orange County, and they expressed confidence that this would become clear once all the facts are in.
"People can write what they want and they can also file lawsuits," said Daniel P. Tully, Merrill's chairman and chief executive. "That doesn't mean that everything that someone writes is accurate, or that all lawsuits are meritorious."
On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed Merrill about its relationship with Orange County.
Separately, the S.E.C. is already investigating accusations of fraud relating to Merrill activities in both Massachusetts and New Jersey.
Mr. Tully said there was nothing wrong with Merrill's municipal finance department, which leads Wall Street in underwriting. If anything, he said, "we are extremely proud of our municipal finance business from the point of view of our origination and underwriting efforts."
As Orange County's troubles have unfolded, Merrill has been accused of a variety of misdeeds, including irresponsibly selling highly risky derivative investments to the county's treasurer, Robert L. Citron, who controlled a portfolio representing the assets of 187 county agencies, school districts and cities.
Derivatives are securities whose performance is based on the performance of simpler, underlying securities. About five years ago, Merrill pioneered the sale of derivatives -- they are sold mostly to corporations -- to municipalities. Merrill will not say how much it earned from its sales to Orange County.
Mr. Tully and his team said Merrill acted as a salesman to Orange County, not as its financial adviser, and therefore bears no responsibility for the way an experienced investor like Mr. Citron, who resigned last week, invested the fund's money.
What went wrong, they said, had more to do with Mr. Citron's decision to borrow heavily than the derivatives that Merrill sold to him.
Still, future litigation may hinge on whether Merrill had a responsibility to stop selling securities to such a heavily leveraged fund.
"I think a brokerage has a duty not to permit a customer to invest in an inappropriate fashion, especially when taxpayers' money is at stake," said Melvyn I. Weiss, a partner at the law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach in New York.
Mr. Weiss represented the City of San Jose, Calif., when it sued 13 brokerage firms, including Merrill, after losing $60 million in the early 1980's.
Those controversial investments were similar to the ones made by Orange County. Indeed, Michael Stamenson, the Merrill salesman who serviced San Jose, also sold billions of dollars worth of securities to Mr. Citron, reaping tens of millions of dollars in revenue for Merrill Lynch.
Merrill executives call the San Jose case different because there were questions about whether the city's financial officer had made illegal investments.
The company litigated the case for six years before settling for $750,000 in 1990 without admitting any wrongdoing. The executives said they settled to avoid a costly new round of litigation after a new judge was assigned to the case.
Two other companies involved in the case, E. F. Hutton and Paine Webber, continued the legal fight. After a six-month trial that ended in June 1990, the two firms were found liable for violating Federal securities laws and were ordered to pay the city $13 million.
Mr. Weiss said he felt that the situations in San Jose and Orange County "are virtually identical."
Mr. Stamenson has also aroused controversy because he and two other Merrill employees each contributed $1,000 to Mr. Citron's re-election campaign.
On Friday, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which along with the S.E.C. regulates brokers, said it was investigating whether Merrill violated the "pay to play" rules that prevent securities firms from making political contributions in order to win underwriting business from municipalities.
Mr. Tully and his team said Merrill had not violated the rule because it was applicable only to municipal finance professionals. Mr. Stamenson is an institutional salesman separate from Merrill's underwriting business, they said.
Asked if Mr. Stamenson was the kind of employee the company wanted on its payroll, Mr. Tully answered: "Hell, yes. We're totally supportive of him."
David H. Komansky, Merrill's executive vice president in charge of the debt and equity markets group, went further. "I would say that Stamenson is exceptional as far as understanding the investment philosophies and goals of the clients he works with," he said.
Merrill also faces a lawsuit from a group of investors who say that they were not told the true nature of Orange County's troubles when they bought some of the $600 million in notes issued by Merrill on behalf of the county last summer.
Merrill executives said the offering statement circulated at the time made clear that the proceeds were to be placed into the county's investment fund, that the fund was highly leveraged, that it was interest-rate sensitive and that it invested in derivatives.
For Mr. Tully, Orange County is a black mark in what by most accounts has been a stellar performance as chief executive. Five years ago, Merrill was known as a bloated giant that spent lavishly and was unable to wring profit from the huge revenue brought in by its more than 40,000 employees.
At the end of 1989, the company took a $470 million charge against earnings as part of a huge reorganization that many skeptics predicted would bear little fruit.
But under Mr. Tully, the company managed to rein in its costs. It also exploited its huge retail broker network to become the industry's leading issuer of new stocks and bonds.
From 1990 through 1993, Merrill earned $3.1 billion, more than it had earned during its previous 18 years as a public company.
Still, those were fat years for every firm on Wall Street. The true test of Merrill's strength came this year, when it continued to reap profits while the rest of the industry stumbled as interest rates began to climb.
In the first nine months of this year, Merrill earned $855 million, putting it on course to surpass 1992, Merrill's second-best year with earnings of $893 million.
Merrill has an asset management business that earns it regular management fees -- no matter how the markets perform. The company directly manages $167 billion in customer assets and holds an additional $381 billion in custody, a franchise that no other firm challenges.
"These are very steady businesses," said James Hanbury, a securities analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. "When the rest of Wall Street goes down, they don't. They go up."
Last month, Moody's Investors Services said it was considering raising the rating on Merrill's $15 billion of long-term debt above A1, making it the highest-rated independent securities firm. That would have decreased the cost of Merrill's borrowings.
But as a result of Orange County, Moody's said on Friday that it was no longer considering the move because the company's liability was unclear. Still, it gave Merrill a small vote of confidence by reaffirming the company's existing A1 rating for long-term debt, which among securities firms is shared only by Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
After dropping more than $4 a share since Orange County's problems were publicized, Merrill stock closed at $33.625 a share on Friday, up 12.5 cents.
So far Mr. Tully has earned praise concerning his handling of the crisis. Last week, when several other firms sold off a total of $11.5 billion of securities held as collateral for loans to Orange County, Merrill did not call in its $2 billion loan.
"I think it was a statesman-like act," Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., said. Merrill's decision also spared it from being named in a lawsuit by Orange County against the other securities firms.
Orange County officials declined to comment on their relationship with Merrill Lynch. And Mr. Tully declined to discuss what talks, if any, went on between Merrill and Orange County officials before the bankruptcy filing.

HEADLINE: The Hemisphere Summit Talks: Strictly Business

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Although Latin American leaders have often been seen as distant neighbors in the past, most of those who came here this weekend knew Miami better than the American President.
With their countries building on this intimacy, economic integration seems bound to accelerate in the Americas through the end of the decade. 
 For the summit meeting, statisticians froze a frame in the blur of United States exports and investments speeding south. In the last decade, they said, United States exports to Latin America have doubled and direct United States investment has quadrupled.
Increasingly, Latin leaders speak more than American English. They speak the economic language of the United States.
"The United States needs 450 million guys down there with credit cards," President Gonzalo Sanchez Lozada of Bolivia said in an interview, referring to the economic aspirations of Latin Americans.
With all of the countries of the hemisphere but Cuba finally governed by democratically elected leaders, traditional themes like human rights and democratic rule are taking a back seat to business.
"The business of the summit is business," the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a left-leaning research group based in Washington, said at the meeting by way of complaint.
On maps, Miami is closer to 16 Latin American and Caribbean capitals than it is to Washington. Noting that trade with Latin America through Miami increased from $2.4 billion in 1971 to $40 billion last year, officials here said they feared that a new, protectionist Congress would not share Miami's euphoria over a free-trade zone for the Americas.
"Our fear is that Congress will only approve fast track for Chile," said Charles Dusseau, Florida's Secretary of Commerce, referring to a tool that simplifies the process for trade treaties by allowing the executive branch to negotiate them.
But Clinton Administration officials predict that Latin America's shining trade and investment opportunities will penetrate any protectionist fog that collects over the nation's capital. Bolstered by the recent bipartisan victory for the global trade agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Administration's free traders found their voice in Miami.
"Most everybody accepts that the global economy is here -- if you build a fence you miss markets," Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the President's senior counselor, said of prospects of building bipartisan support for a hemispheric free-trade zone. "We are going to have to work very earnestly to find the right balance and to move ahead with the free-trade agreements."
Although the United States has the hemisphere's third-largest Latin American population, after Brazil and Mexico, it has been painfully slow to look south. The last inter-American summit was held in Uruguay in 1967.
At that time, recalled Ambler H. Moss, who took part in the Uruguay meeting, the Latin Americans "were all expanding state enterprises, raising barriers against imports, nationalizing American companies and blocking American investment." As director of the North-South Center at the University of Miami, Mr. Moss has watched Latin America's free-market policy revolution of the last decade.
"Today, the typical Latin American head of state is a salesman," he said. "They are all here hustling business for their countries."
Buoyed by the amiable mood here, participants proposed holding inter-American summit meetings regularly, either every two years or every four years.
"The atmosphere was splendid," Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs, said as the summit meeting closed today. "We now have a flight plan that will keep us busy for years to come."
With an economy five times as large as Latin America's, Uncle Sam has traditionally felt an avuncular urge to give economic lectures to his Latin nieces and nephews. But on the subject of free trade and integration the pupils seem to be racing ahead of their teacher. Only 10 years ago, Mexico refused to join GATT for fear that it would harm its protected industries. After joining the North American Free Trade Agreement this year, Mexico is joining a free-trade group with Colombia and Venezuela on Jan. 1.
By the end of this decade, a series of regional free-trade blocs are to be merged, allowing goods and services to circulate largely duty free throughout Latin America.
Regular regional summit meetings are quickly wiping away the pomp and tension that traditionally characterized meetings of Latin American heads of state.
"When I was Foreign Minister in 1985, there were countries that had never been visited by presidents of their neighboring countries," said Enrique Iglesias of Uruguay, president of the Inter-American Development Bank. "Now they use the familiar 'tu' with each other," he said, referring to the intimate form of address. "Their wives know each other."

HEADLINE: Time Warner's 'Time Machine' for Future Video

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
This is a test. This is only a test. It is not -- repeat, not -- the interactive television and home-shopping system that will be in your home by Christmas. Or next Christmas. Or maybe ever.
That, roughly, is the cautionary message from executives at Time Warner Inc. as they prepare to plug in their long-awaited "full service network" in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. 
 After two years of preparation, a torrent of publicity and a delay of more than six months, Time Warner will hook up the first of about 4,000 homes to the most ambitious experiment yet in interactive television. By some time next year, the company hopes, nearly the entire group of homes will be wired.
But for all the sizzle -- and there will be plenty of it -- the watchword is still caution, not just at Time Warner but at most other telephone and cable television companies that are conducting similar tryouts. No company has yet committed itself to offering exotic new services on a broad basis.
Time Warner executives refuse to say how much they are spending on the Orlando project, though in terms of the company's revenue it is surely a drop in the bucket. And they refuse to predict when they might reach a verdict on a wider expansion.
"The task here in Orlando was basically to build a time machine," said James Chiddix, senior vice president for engineering and technology at Time Warner Cable and a principal architect of the Orlando network. "This platform represents where technology can be a couple of years hence, and we are now in a unique position to discover how real people are going to spend real money to buy services."
Over the last year, the cost and difficulty of building interactive video systems has become more apparent. One trial after another has been delayed by technical problems. Within the cable television and telephone industries, there is great uncertainty about which services will be popular and whether they can be offered profitably, particularly exotic services, like interactive video shopping and grippingly realistic on-line video games.
Even in what is widely expected to be a popular service, like video on demand -- allowing customers to order movies whenever they want from an on-screen menu -- many experts say the economics are dubious. In an extensive test of movies on demand completed last year by U S West and Tele-Communications Inc. in Denver, customers bought fewer than three movies a month on average. In surveys, moreover, viewers have proved unwilling to pay much more for a movie than the $3 or $4 charged by video stores.
That leads to basic cost problems for a telephone or cable service, said Robert Alexander, head of Alexander & Associates, a New York consultant. "A movie can tie up your line for two hours," he said. "if you can only charge about $4, and Hollywood is going to take about half of that, it means you're getting about 1.6 cents a minute for the line." That is less than what telephone companies often charge for ordinary phone calls.
The point of the Orlando experiment, Time Warner executives say, is to find out what people will want when the equipment that is now so expensive becomes affordable several years down the road.
The Orlando system is undoubtedly the most futuristic network introduced so far. Beyond using the latest switching and computer technology, Time Warner and marketing collaborators like Spiegel Inc. have done more than any other group to blend Hollywood magic with Madison Avenue marketing in developing new video services.
Viewers will turn on their television sets to see a rotating carousel on the screen that will allow them to select and watch specific movies at any time of day, shop in an "electronic mall" and play what promise to be grippingly realistic video games.
Entering the mall, viewers will pass by graphical representations of storefronts and they will be able to view video displays of products from Spiegel, Eddie Bauer, Crate and Barrel and other merchants. A printer next to each television will be able to deliver tickets, discount coupons and printed information.
Time Warner has plenty of competition. Nationwide, cable or telephone companies have started or are planning more than 30 significant trials of new video services, according to Alexander & Associates, which has monitored the experiments. Most of these will let viewers call up movies from a library -- a service known as video on demand -- and many will offer a selection of two-way information services as well.
But nobody is sure how much interactivity the ordinary viewer will want. "The vast majority of consumers are very interested in better entertainment and information options, but what 'better' means varies among different segments of population," said Nicholas Donatello, president of Odyssey Inc., a market research company in San Francisco that surveys customer attitudes toward new media technologies.
Many companies are being conservative even as they try out new services. In West Hartford, Conn., for example, Southern New England Telephone has started a trial in 400 homes that allows customers to get ordinary cable television service and to choose from a library of 1,650 movies and shorter programs. But the company is wary about plunging into more unusual services, and chiefly views the video on demand as an added option with which to win over cable subscribers.
"There is a real danger that you can overload customers with a bunch of services that are too complicated and not easy to use," said Ron Serrano, a senior vice president at Southern New England Telephone.
In Castro Valley, Calif., Viacom Inc. has been preparing to test an elaborate system that includes video on demand, interactive games, information services and shopping. But that project has been repeatedly delayed as executives rethink elements of the plan, and the company now says only that it hopes to test its newest services some time in 1995.
Two other prominent trials, one by Bell Atlantic in Alexandria, Va., and the other by U S West in Omaha, have been delayed by technical and regulatory problems.
But the biggest uncertainties are over where the real opportunities lie. Proponents of video on demand note that video-rental stores already represent a $15 billion industry; they maintain that the new technology would save customers the trouble of leaving home and worrying about late fees. Most systems, including Time Warner's Orlando project, would allow viewers to pause or rewind the programs, as if they were using a videocassette recorder.
The demand for video shopping and on-line computer games is even more difficult to predict. Catalogue sales represent a $54.7 billion business, and many consumers may indeed appreciate the ability to view video images. Spiegel, for example, will let customers view moving video images of curtains, as they are hanging in a window, in each of the colors they have available.
Davia Kimmey, corporate vice president of advertising at Spiegel, speculated that it would also be possible for customers to get experts on video to offer advice about particular products or problems. But the costs of producing interactive advertising are high, and customers will still have to wait for any product that must be shipped by regular mail.
Time Warner executives readily acknowledge the uncertainties, but add that the only way to learn is to develop a system that offers people as much as possible. To that end, they have used all the tricks of a movie and television studio to make services entertaining and easy to use. They have also used numerous focus groups to refine the look and feel of each application.
Early on, for example, the company created a vivid three-dimensional graphic presentation of a city. Viewers fly through the city, with its tall buildings and signs, and stop at their particular destination. But early focus groups of viewers found the demonstration confusing, and the company shifted to the much simpler image of a cylindrical carousel that offered different choices -- movies on demand, video games and shopping.
The technology is advanced and, at least for the moment, costly. Silicon Graphics built the computers, known as servers, that act like jukeboxes to store video programs in electronic form. With Scientific Atlanta, it built set-top boxes that have many times the processing power of current personal computers.
The devices cost several thousand dollars each -- nobody will say precisely how much -- but the theory is that those costs will plummet as chip technology advances and production in volume allows for economies.
Even more exotic services and features are in the works. Time Warner is already preparing a system that will allow viewers to call up different programs or services by giving spoken commands.
Still, they emphasize that they are not assuming the success of interactive services. The company is already investing heavily in fiber optics, which will allow it to increase capacity, improve quality and expand into the local telephone business. These modernized networks will allow room for expanded pay-per-view services and other alternatives to full video on demand.
"We are not simply spending money to enhance our systems in the hope that interactivity will some day pay off," Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner, said. "The fiber upgrades will accomplish a number of things before interactive services come along. This is a very careful, prudent, phased introduction."

President Clinton and the leaders of Canada and Mexico said today that they had agreed to admit Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that clearly puts pressure on the other nations of South and Central America to speed the opening of their markets if they want expanded trade with the United States.
The announcement came at the conclusion of a surprisingly harmonious three-day summit meeting. Mr. Clinton and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere -- only Cuba was excluded -- agreed to conclude a treaty within a decade to create a free-trade zone for the Americas. 
 But Mr. Clinton's aides made clear today that they hoped the process would actually be much speedier as countries of South and Central America race to reform their economies and to meet a still loosely defined set of requirements to join the year-old pact that is commonly known as Nafta.
"This should be evidence that we intend to accelerate the process" of eliminating a wide variety of trade barriers that still slow commerce across the two continents, Mr. Clinton said today.
A broader goal is also at work: the Administration makes no secret of its efforts to use the prospect of trade liberalization in Latin America to put pressure on the European Union and Asian countries -- where the United States will have a trade deficit of nearly $100 billion this year -- to open their own markets.
"The Europeans will be encouraged, to use a delicate word, to be more open in a number of areas we have been concerned about," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, in an interview today. "And the Asians will also be encouraged to go in this direction, or they too will be left behind."
The Administration saw reason for celebration today over the speed at which the Latin American countries have become converts to free trade after decades of competing for American foreign aid and of playing the United States and the former Soviet Union against each other for influence in the region. But the celebration did not drown out some signs of discord.
Some human rights and labor groups criticized the Administration for placing business first, contending that the communique approved today made only vague acknowledgments of the need to protect worker rights and the environment, and said nothing about broader human rights issues.
Caribbean countries complained that their tiny economies could be greatly damaged by rapid market liberalizations. The Prime Minister of Barbados, Owen Arthur, warned that "a rising tide can also overturn small boats" and used the occasion to lecture a surprised-looking Mr. Clinton about American policy on trade in bananas.
The President acknowledged at the news conference today that the continuing American embargo against Cuba had been criticized by many Latin American leaders during private meetings. Several told him that the effort to speed the collapse of Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba and to replace it with a democratically elected Government would be aided by opening commerce.
That is exactly America's argument in favor of expanding trade with China, but Cuba has been the exception to the Clinton Administration's policy of "commercial engagement" as a means of aiding democracy movements.
"Most of these countries don't agree with the United States policy," Mr. Clinton said, though he showed no inclination to change the American position. But he said that there "was a great deal of feeling that it is urgent to restore democracy to Cuba."
Chile's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement has been expected for some time. The country has been widely regarded as the free-market gem of Latin America after privatizing all but 50 of its 500 state-owned enterprises, slashing tariffs, greatly liberalizing its markets, and welcoming foreign investment. The result has been a decade of uninterrupted growth and a steady rise in wages.
For Mr. Clinton, Chile also represents a relatively controversy-free way of setting the precedent of expanding Nafta. The Administration expects little real opposition to Chile's inclusion, partly because of the country's small size. It has a population of only 13 million people, and a gross domestic product of $43.7 billion, significantly smaller than the annual sales of the I.B.M. Corporation. But its admission will pave the way for far larger economic powers, including Brazil and Argentina.
"I think Nafta will be neat, clear and straightforward," Eduardo Aninat, Finance Minister of Chile, said in an interview today, predicting bipartisan support in the United States Congress.
"The free-trade pact will provoke more foreign investment in Chile by reducing risk for the countries, and by establishing international investment rules," he said. "This puts Chile high on the map."
Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, said he welcomed Chile's inclusion, which will not be final until a series of negotiations take place next year over the exact conditions of entering into the agreement. "We have been the Three Amigos," Mr. Chretien said, appearing with President Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo, the newly elected President of Mexico. "Now we will be the Four Amigos."
The summit was another element in what the Administration has been portraying as a string of successes in foreign economic policy. Mr. Clinton has depicted these steps as a strategy to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States by expanding the market for American exports.
The first step was the passage last year of Nafta. That was followed by Congressional approval 10 days ago of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set a minimum standard of tariff reduction and protection of intellectual property rights with more than 120 countries around the globe.
The next step will be to attempt to go far beyond the trade liberalization requirements of the GATT, not with more global talk but rather with regional trade accords, and to get the three major regions of the world to agree to even larger trade liberalization.
For Mr. Clinton, that means taking a significant political risk. He must convince American workers that they will gain more jobs from new export markets than they will lose as the United States opens itself to more cheap imports. Today, for example, the President contended that NAFTA has brought a net increase of 100,000 jobs.
The biggest element of the Administration's strategy is its effort to get Asian countries to agree to free regional trade. Mr. Clinton reached a vague but promising agreement with Asian leaders in Indonesia last month to accomplish that goal by the year 2020. But in Asia, it is the United States pressing for freer trade; here in Miami it was the Latin American countries urging Washington to move faster.

HEADLINE: Is Western Civilization Worth $20 Million?;
The Gift Is Huge and Welcome, but Its Restriction to Western Studies Fuels a Debate

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Yale University called a news conference on April 17, 1991, to announce an extraordinary gift: Lee M. Bass, the youngest of four billionaire brothers from Fort Worth, had pledged $20 million to his alma mater to further its study of Western civilization.
The centerpiece of the Bass program was to be a rigorous, yearlong undergraduate course that would analyze virtual every major development in Western history, from ancient Mesopotamia to Nazi Germany. Conceived by Mr. Bass, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., then Yale's president, and Donald Kagan, the dean of Yale College, the double-credit course was to begin in the fall of 1993 and was intended to make a powerful statement -- that multiculturalism might be laying siege to the study of the West on other campuses, but not at Yale. 
 Nearly four years after that grand announcement, however, the course has yet to be designed, let alone offered to students. And half the Bass gift -- the $10 million that was to be spent on the new course and its teachers -- sits untouched in a college account, while fierce disagreement continues over how it should be spent.
The dispute says much about the perils of trying to expand a Western history curriculum in an era when debates about multiculturalism divide campuses. It also illustrates the risk of accepting a major donation with strings attached at a time of immense budgetary constraints.
The matter has become a cause celebre among conservatives at Yale, who feel the delay in using the money has been engineered by liberals on campus intent on undermining the teaching of a traditional curriculum. In an effort to diffuse emotions, Yale's current president, Richard C. Levin, is to fly to Texas on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Bass.
Yale is hardly the only institution to stir criticism by accepting a gift from a donor for a pet project. Earlier this fall, for example, Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records and son of a Turkish diplomat, gave $3.5 million to Princeton University to start a Turkish studies program, prompting an editorial in The Daily Princetonian that questioned whether there was "demonstrated student interest" in the subject.
Citing other gifts to Princeton -- including a half-million dollars from the Ruling Prince of Lichtenstein for research on self-determination -- the student editors wrote that "the specificity of these recent donations creates the impression that wealthy benefactors can purchase a professorship to help further their agenda."
Kevin Whitelaw, a senior who is the editorial chairman of The Daily Princetonian, added: "I'm not trying to say that you can buy a program at Princeton, but I must admit that the way this has happened, you could almost make that conclusion."
Such tensions between donors wishing to dictate how their money will be spent and school officials trying to retain maximum control of that spending arise all the time at universities, said Peter Buchanan, the president and chief executive of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.
"If you're on the university side," said Mr. Buchanan, a former development officer at Columbia University, "it seems to me that you try to make sure you don't make commitments or tie people's hands in ways that are going to turn out to be a real problem."
At Yale, the delay in carrying out Mr. Bass's wishes can be partly attributed to the loss of the program's two champions, Dean Kagan and Mr. Schmidt, within 14 months of accepting the gift. Dean Kagan, a vociferous conservative, had repeatedly clashed with most of the faculty, which he accused of engaging in "mutual massage" with a generally liberal student body. He resigned the deanship in April 1992 to return to teaching history and classics at Yale.
A month later, during a virtual faculty revolt over steep budget cuts that he had supported, Mr. Schmidt followed suit. Mr. Schmidt, who left to become president and chief executive of the Edison Project, did not return phone messages left with his assistant. Professor Kagan declined to be interviewed.
Leaders of some conservative national and campus groups contend that the same "liberal" faculty members who had pressed for the resignations of Dean Kagan and Mr. Schmidt are leaning on Mr. Schmidt's successor, Mr. Levin, to quietly modify the Bass course.
But many of the Yale faculty members said the problem was not one of ideology, but was a question of need: there are, they said, already more than 100 undergraduate courses at Yale that deal with broad periods of Western history or thought, from Religious Studies 277A (History of Christianity in the Ancient World: Jesus to Augustine) to Humanities 221A (Medieval Europe: From 1000 to 1492).
It is now up to Mr. Levin, an economics professor who became Yale's 22d president in July 1993, to figure out what to do with the grant. Presented last fall with an outline of the Bass course by a faculty committee appointed by Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Levin rejected it, saying the course would have tied up too many of Yale's best faculty members in an effort that would benefit a limited number of students.
While professing his support for the course content -- "What could possibly be wrong with a course that studies Plato and Aristotle and Aquinas and Machiavelli and Dante and Shakespeare?" he said -- the president is in an unmistakable bind.
With a $12 million deficit in Yale's $1 billion operating budget and a freeze on new teaching positions, Dr. Levin has no shortage of uses for $20 million. But the agreement negotiated by Mr. Bass and Mr. Schmidt is fairly explicit, calling for the appointment of seven full professors in various Western subjects and four assistant professors, as well as the implementation of the course. So far, $10 million has been used to endow the chairs of five full professors -- Mr. Kagan was appointed by Mr. Schmidt to one of them -- while the remaining $10 million remains idle as Dr. Levin mulls its fate.
"Would it be necessary to have such a course?" Mr. Levin said, repeating a reporter's question during an interview at his office here. "No."
"Was it a gift intended to serve Yale in a useful and important way?" he continued. "Absolutely."
Mr. Levin has appointed a new committee to design an alternative Bass curriculum -- rooted, he assures, in Western history -- but its proposals have not yet been made public. He denies that any faculty members have lobbied him to kill the program.
What remains unknown is how Mr. Bass, a 1979 Yale graduate whose family is among the most generous benefactors in the school's history, feels about all this. Notoriously publicity shy, the Texas-based investor did not even attend the news conference announcing his gift. In denying an interview request this week, one of Mr. Bass's assistants, Viki Slate, cited his family's policy of "not commenting on personal affairs or business."
Word of the delay broke last month in Light and Truth, a conservative campus journal financed by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which is based in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and was founded by William F. Buckley Jr., a Yale graduate himself. Institute members have singled out six campuses, including Yale, for being dominated by what they call a "radical" liberal faculty. Two newspapers that often present a conservative point of view on their editorial pages quickly picked up on the story late last month: The Washington Times, with a front-page news article and The Wall Street Journal, with an editorial.
"Whatever new courses emerge at Yale University -- under the watchful eye of faculty ideologues," The Wall Street Journal's editorial said, "they will clearly bear no resemblance to the kind the remarkable Bass grant was supposed to pay for."
Mr. Levin says that at his Tuesday meeting in Texas he intends to present Mr. Bass with alternatives to the original course outline.
"We have every intention of introducing a program that satisfies the intention of Mr. Lee Bass," said Mr. Levin, who predicted that the revised course would be approved by the faculty and in place by next fall. "I want everyone inside the Yale community and outside to be assured that we are not going to subvert the intention of the donor."
Pat Collins, the president of the Yale Conservative Forum, said he would consider any detour from the original course -- which would have employed the 11 faculty members toexamine the art, religion, philosophy, literature and politics of the West -- to be a betrayal.
"The money was given for that purpose," said Mr. Collins, who wrote the Light and Truth article describing the dispute. "If President Levin doesn't want to do it, then give the money back."
But Serena Parker, a philosophy major from Manhattan, disagrees, saying that the money could be better spent on other subjects. Ms. Parker said she had taken plenty of Western-oriented courses on thinkers like Plato, Kant and Rousseau but could not name a single non-Western course in her department.
"I'd like to write my senior thesis on African philosophy," said Ms. Parker, a 21-year-old senior. "But there isn't anyone in the department who knows about it."

HEADLINE: Delay Seen In Fed's Rate Move

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
While the Federal Reserve is clearly determined to raise short-term interest rates further, comments by the central bank's top two officials suggest that it may not act at the next meeting of its policy-making committee on Dec. 20, preferring to wait until January or early February.
The delay seems likely because top Fed officials made clear last week that they wanted to weigh information on the economy's health that would not be available until January. Fed officials also expressed little concern that any tax cuts would widen the budget deficit and feed inflation next year. 
 "The truth is that we have to be into January, beyond the end of the quarter, before we have a substantial majority of the data," said Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, at a news conference on Friday organized by the Chicago Board of Trade.
The Fed, which has already raised short-term interest rates six times this year, believes it must brake the economy's growth to head off inflationary shortages of goods and skilled labor.
Several sets of Government statistics to be made public in the next several days may still persuade Fed officials to act before January. The Labor Department is scheduled to issue November figures for producer price inflation on Tuesday, and for consumer price inflation on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve plans to issue its estimates of how close American heavy industry was to operating at full capacity during November.
An unexpectedly large inflation gain -- or signs that American factories are straining to produce enough goods -- could so alarm the bond market that the Fed might be compelled to raise rates to reassure investors that it remains intent on fighting inflation.
As Administration officials have been wont to do, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen today declined to predict what the Fed would do. But in an interview on "This Week With David Brinkley" on ABC, he said the Fed faced a difficult decision.
"I believe the next call for them will be the toughest one yet," he said, because the central bankers will not be able to precisely judge the braking effects of previous rate increases.
Several comments last week by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, and Mr. Blinder indicate that the central bank is reluctant to play the role that Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, described last week: the grinch who stole Christmas.
Rather than raise rates immediately, the senior officials could decide on Dec. 20 to give Mr. Greenspan the explicit discretion to raise interest rates in January if Government statistics then show a risk of inflation.
If Mr. Greenspan does not use this authority, then Fed officials would probably raise interest rates sharply when the policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets next, on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.
"They have seen nothing so far that dissuades them from their concern that higher inflation is around the corner," said Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Bush Administration.
Some of the strongest evidence for thinking that the Fed will delay action came last Wednesday. Mr. Greenspan told members of a Congressional panel that overall consumer, business and Government spending was critical to the level of economic growth now, and indirectly important to the level of inflation. "The degree of strength in final sales will be central to the support of future gains in output," he said.
But reliable Government statistics on spending in the fourth quarter will not be available by Dec. 20. Mr. Blinder said on Friday at the news conference that "on the spending side, we have as yet relatively little information on the fourth quarter and we are as yet guessing."
The Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its estimate of November retail sales on Tuesday. But this statistic will reflect only the beginning of the crucial Christmas spending surge.
"Next Tuesday's retail sales is another straw on the camel's back, but we need a lot more straws before we can put together a picture," Mr. Blinder said.
Fed officials often rely on anecdotal information, like the quantity and price of steel in purchasing orders by the auto makers, to gauge the strength of the economy when accurate statistics are not yet available. But they have long considered such information to be particularly unreliable around Christmas, when retail sales are an especially important part of the economy.
Retail sales, unlike sales of industrial products like steel, tend to vary considerably from city to city and from region to region because shoppers, unlike car makers, cannot scour the country for the best deals. So anecdotes from one city tend to be a poor indicator of overall sales.
Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, speculated last month that the Fed might raise interest rates anyway if Republicans pass tax cuts without spending cuts. With the economy already operating at close to full capacity, such a tax cut could stimulate further growth and feed inflation, she reasoned.
But Mr. Blinder played down this concern. "I'm only modestly worried about that," he said. "Both the Administration and the leadership of the Republican Party have said that any tax cut will have to be paid for" with matching spending cuts.
Ms. Rivlin warned of a replay of 1981, when Congress passed tax cuts proposed by President Reagan but not spending cuts. But Mr. Blinder said that he thought that sequence of events to be much less likely now because Congressional procedures have been changed to require that spending cuts be offset by tax cuts to prevent the Federal budget deficit from widening.
Mr. Blinder's willingness to play down the risk of widening budget deficits is particularly significant because he is one of the few Democratic appointees to the Fed. His Republican colleagues have been even more inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to Republican plans in Congress.
In June, Mr. Greenspan, first appointed by President Ronald Reagan, endorsed the Republican idea that the deficit would not widen if Congress cut the tax on profits from the appreciation in value of stocks, bonds and other investments. Reducing that capital gains tax, he told the House Budget Committee, would stimulate so much investment and so improve the workings of the economy that other tax revenues would rise and there would be no overall widening of the budget deficit.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Optimism Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for December rose to 97.7 from 91.6 in November, people with access to the report said last week.
The University of Michigan index is based on 100, set in 1966. An increase in the monthly reading reflects consumers becoming more optimistic about the economy. Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, set in March 1984. The record low is 51.7, set in April 1980. 
 The jump in the index suggests that "the Christmas selling season is going to be very strong," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist for Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago securities firm. "Consumers are in a positive mode. Retailers are going to be very happy."
The university also said its preliminary December index of perceptions of current economic conditions rose to 106.7 from 102.1 in November.
The preliminary December index of expectations, a component of the Government's index of leading economic indicators, also rose, to 92, from 84.8 in November.
The university delays public release of the information for one month.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Clubs Say Offer Is New, But Players Say It Isn't

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK, N.Y., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Baseball's major league club owners, on the last day of the fourth month of the players' strike, handed the players a new tax proposal tonight that they championed for its "substantial movement." But Donald Fehr, the union leader, said the proposal appeared to have "virtually all of the elements" of the salary cap the clubs really want.
Another union official, who insisted on anonymity, called the plan brilliant but said, "It's designed to deceive people." Management people appeared to be disturbed by the union's characterizations. 
 While the players' negotiators were waiting for the proposal, Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, disclosed that the Labor Department certified the strike last Thursday, meaning the Immigration and Naturalization Service will not grant visas to foreign players who could replace the striking major leaguers.
Orza said the certification applies to "job opportunities as a professional baseball player for major league clubs." Because the Labor Department specified professional players, Orza said the certification "arguably encompasses guys in the minor leagues."
More immediate, though, is the owners' new proposal, presented as a counterproposal to one the union made on Saturday. That calls for a 5.02 percent tax on club payrolls and a $30 million contribution from each side to create an industry growth fund.
The clubs gave the union 24 hours to respond, saying they needed to know by Monday evening because they have a calendar to consider, beginning with a meeting scheduled for Thursday at which the owners are expected to vote to declare an impasse in negotiations and impose their salary cap.
The cap proposal remained on the table as an alternative to the new tax plan, which borrows from the union's latest proposal. It includes the industry growth fund and a payroll tax that begins at a 4.64 percent rate.
"We look favorably upon many of the noneconomic or secondary issues they have proposed," John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, the clubs' chief labor spokesman, said. "We indicated we could work together to grow the game here and abroad. For our new economic proposal, we adapted the framework of their proposal to address some of our concerns, namely cost control and competitive balance."
He said that the owners' plan represented "substantial movement."
While the taxes appear similar, their results would work differently, and the owners' plan would have a secondary tax that would affect teams with payrolls over a designated threshold.
Union officials said the implications of the plan could not be discerned immediately. "I'm not even sure I know enough to ask questions," one union person said.
Members of the two sides held late-night technical sessions to go over elements and implications of the plan. But based on what they received in a session earlier in the evening, union people said the system would reward clubs with high revenues but low payrolls.
A basic difference in the union and management plans is the use of the $35 million that would be generated by the payroll taxes.
The union would use it as the bulk of the $58 million that would be distributed to the low-revenue clubs under the owners' revenue-sharing plan.
The clubs would maintain the elements of the revenue-sharing plan they adopted last January, moving $58 million to the low-revenue clubs in the way they originally designed. They then would take the $35 million raised by the payroll tax and use $10 million of it each year for their share of the growth fund and distribute the remaining $25 million to clubs based on the ratio between their revenues and their payrolls.
Clubs like the Mets and the Colorado Rockies would benefit the most because this year they had high revenues and low payrolls. Under the players' plan, the Mets and the Rockies would pay money into the revenue-sharing pool, but under the owners' proposal, those teams would get money back from the tax pool. The clubs thus would be encouraged to make as much money as they want; just don't spend it on salaries.
Because the high-revenue clubs generally are the ones that more likely would have the highest payrolls, the reward of tax-pool money would be an incentive to keep their payrolls down.
Clubs also would be induced to keep payrolls down by the second part of the owners' tax. The more a club goes beyond the threshold, the higher the tax rate would be.
With clubs looking to avoid taxes and gaining paybacks from the tax pool, the union believes the system would have similar effects to a salary cap. The overall aim of the system would be to get total major league payrolls down to 50 percent of total revenue, the same portion of revenue offered in the salary cap proposal.
"It seems to me the distance is still reasonably wide," Fehr said. "I can't say until we understand it. That won't be until sometime tomorrow."
If the two sides do not reach an agreement and the clubs try to use replacement players, they could try to use two different groups of foreign players as replacement workers: those who have played minor league baseball for major league organizations, and players who play baseball in their countries, from the Dominican Republic to Australia, but have not played professionally in the United States.
Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said the union has asked the immigration service to watch specifically for players that may be taken by major league clubs after they have been recruited by minor league clubs. Under the player development contract, major league clubs control players in organized baseball's minor leagues.
On the other hand, Orza said, the union doesn't want to block legitimate minor leaguers from playing minor league baseball.
"If they want to establish a procedure to stay in the minor leagues, fine," Orza said. "We don't want to prevent anyone from playing minor league baseball. But we don't want anyone to circumvent the procedure and play major league baseball."

Breaking the Mideast Cycle of Kill and Be Killed

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

BEYOND THE PROMISED LAND
Jews and Arabs on the Hard Road to a New Israel
By Glenn Frankel
416 pages. Simon & Schuster. $24. 
 By the main title of his book, "Beyond the Promised Land," Glenn Frankel means that in the last seven years, Israel has undergone a deep change, from "a small, collectivist, mobilized garrison state under siege to a more open, pluralistic, bourgeois and democratic society." In other words, Israel has been forced by events to go beyond "the old Zionist state" perceived as a utopian ideal to "a new post-Zionist Israel" that is part of the real world.
To emphasize the import of this change, Mr. Frankel, a reporter for The Washington Post who has spent many years in Israel, sets his book apart from what he calls some of the best books on Israel published in recent years: "In the Land of Israel," by Amos Oz; "The Siege," by Conor Cruise O'Brien; "Arab and Jew," by David K. Shipler, and "From Beirut to Jerusalem," by Thomas L. Friedman.
These books, he says, "tend to reinforce the fatalistic image of a promised land locked into an unbreakable cycle of violence and retribution, of kill and be killed." His book, by contrast, holds that the fateful cycle is being broken.
This break is a result, he argues, of several other momentous changes: the rise of new political forces in Israel; the fall of the Soviet Union and the arrival of nearly half a million Jewish immigrants; the death of socialism and the birth of a market economy; the defeat of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war and the ascendancy of the United States, and perhaps most significant, alterations in the Arab world, beginning with the Palestinian uprising known as intifada, which literally means "shaking off" in Arabic.
This eruption Mr. Frankel considers to have been a spontaneous boiling over of rage at Israeli oppression on the West Bank and in Gaza. Yet paradoxically, he says, the intifada empowered the Palestinians to set forth on the path that eventually led to the handshake on the White House lawn in September 1993 between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat. As one Palestinian leader told the author: "We'd been fighting these people for decades and yet we didn't know them. We thought we could learn. The intifada made it possible by creating a sense of power inside us, a sense of equality with them. It wasn't master and slave anymore. We could talk."
To illustrate his thesis, Mr. Frankel examines these various changes by focusing on some of the people and places he has come to know in Israel over more than two decades. For instance, his close-ups of Israeli soldiers and Palestinian community leaders powerfully dramatize the impossible dilemmas forced on both sides by the intifada rioting and its brutal repression.
His portraits of disillusioned kibbutzniks and striving businessmen give the reader a sense of how the economy changed as the old dream of a vast cooperative farmland was gradually abandoned. Most fascinating of all is Mr. Frankel's penetrating account of how and why Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud Party blundered in its dealings with the Bush Administration and thus gave way to Yitzhak Rabin's Labor Party administration, which was slightly more amenable to peace negotiations. Intelligent too is his interpretation of the complex roles played by the conservative religious parties throughout the turmoil.
True enough, Mr. Frankel's narrative doesn't exactly lift the reader off the page. He neglects to convey the sense of the physical setting of Israel that, say, Amos Elon does in "Jerusalem" or Saul Bellow does in "To Jerusalem and Back." His portraits of the principals are more functional than sparkling. You slog through his text picking up facts as if they were stones for a new Jerusalem.
Moreover, the author offers little in the way of historical framework, nothing about the history of the land before the arrival of Zionist settlers. The advantage of this is a sharp focus on the present. The disadvantage is a lack of deep perspective.
Still, the history that Mr. Frankel relates is coherent and dramatic. Particularly provocative is his point that by the time the Israelis and the P.L.O. reached their agreement, American Jews had lost touch with what was going on. Whether or not this is fair, you reach the end of Mr. Frankel's narrative as if emerging from a dark tunnel into a landscape that has been radically transformed. As he presents Israeli attitudes, possession of the territories doesn't seem so essential anymore, if only because Iraq's attack with Scud missiles during the gulf war demonstrated the irrelevance of territory as a buffer zone.
For an epigraph to his final chapter, Mr. Frankel has found a particularly fitting passage from Dostoyevsky's novel "The Gambler": "Sometimes the wildest notion, the most apparently impossible idea, takes such a firm hold of the mind that at length it is taken for something realizable. . . . More than that: if the idea coincides with a strong and passionate desire, it may sometimes be accepted as something predestined, inevitable, foreordained, something that cannot but exist or happen."
Whether or not peace eventually comes to the Middle East and Mr. Frankel's vision of a land beyond the promised land is fulfilled, his book shows why ineluctably the parties had to take the gamble that peace could happen.

HEADLINE: In Miami, Freer Trade

 BODY:
The United States, Canada and 32 Latin American countries declared yesterday in Miami that they would create a free-trade area by 2006 -- in effect, a larger version of Nafta. That represents a political victory for President Clinton and an economic victory for people throughout the hemisphere. By one estimate, free trade could raise income in Latin America by $500 per person -- a huge boost in countries racked by poverty.
The summit meeting's declaration is credible. Compare it to a similar pledge by Asian-Pacific nations meeting last month in Indonesia. There, countries bowing to pressure from the U.S. announced a commitment to free trade but wavered by delaying a start date and taking no immediate steps to achieve their lofty goals. Some signatories backed away within hours of the declaration. Not so in Miami. The Latin American leaders pushed the U.S. to adopt an early target date for free trade. They also agreed to concrete steps to get negotiations under way. 
 The best evidence of their resolve can be found in the record of political and economic changes that have swept over Latin America. In 1967, the last time leaders from the hemisphere met, a third of the countries were run by dictators. In Miami, every official was elected -- though elections in the Dominican Republic were corrupt and problems plague democracy in Peru and Guatemala. In 1967, most of the economies were controlled by government, closed to foreigners and stagnating. Today, governments from Mexico to Argentina are privatizing state-owned enterprises, reducing deficits, controlling inflation and opening borders to imports and investment. The turnabout in policy has turned Latin America into the second-fastest-growing region in the world and the fastest-growing purchaser of U.S. exports.
The summit leaders must now confront two challenges: how to create a free trade pact out of the dozens of trade accords that already bind nations within the hemisphere; and how to create a free trade zone that is open to democracies outside the hemisphere. Open trade within the Americas should not become a no-trade zone for anyone else.
The obvious model is the Nafta accord the U.S. negotiated with Mexico and Canada, and now Chile. Nafta goes further toward free trade than GATT, which 124 nations signed in April and Congress recently approved. Unlike GATT, Nafta will eliminate tariffs and require signatories to enforce laws protecting workers and the environment. If governments in the hemisphere negotiate an accord like Nafta, and then welcome other countries willing to play by the same rules, the Miami summit meeting will prove momentous.

HEADLINE: Orphanages Are No Solution

 BODY:
The party that professes to support family values seems excessively eager to yank poor children away from their mothers and dump them in institutions. Republican proposals for welfare reform suggest orphanages as an alternative to supporting young single mothers with children on welfare for years and years. And Newt Gingrich, the next House Speaker, has held up Boys Town, the fabled orphanage in Nebraska, as a model way to care for youngsters who might otherwise be thrown off balconies or dropped in dumpsters.
But before the nation moves very far down the orphanage road, it needs to recognize some uncomfortable facts. Orphanages, if staffed and equipped properly, are very expensive. Moreover, even well-run orphanages are often unsuitable, especially for the very young. The act of institutionalization often harms their social and psychological development. 
 The impulse behind the idealization of orphanages is understandable. All too many children live in dysfunctional homes or with relatives or foster parents who lack the resources and skills to care for them. The adoption process is often slow and cumbersome. So in extreme cases a youngster might well be better off in a small group home run by caring professionals, or even in a larger institution. But all too often the current political discourse veers in the direction of separating children from caring mothers whose only sin is that they are teen-agers, poor and unwed. Orphanages should only be a last resort. The best institution for raising children remains the family.
The move toward orphanages reflects hardening attitudes toward single mothers on welfare. One proposal endorsed by Mr. Gingrich would allow states to deny cash subsidies to single teen-age mothers and use the money instead for group homes for unwed mothers and their children -- or orphanages for their children. While some adolescents can benefit from living in small group homes, the North American Council on Adoptable Children says many infants and young children raised in institutions have a hard time sustaining healthy personal relationships.
As to cost, the Child Welfare League of America estimates that the price of maintaining a child in an orphanage, with support services, is $36,500 a year. By comparison, the average cost for foster care is $4,800 and a child's share of welfare and food stamps is $2,644. While some politicians talk breezily of private charities picking up the tab, those in the business of caring for troubled or abandoned youngsters say private resources are already stretched to the limit. Even the head of Boys Town doubts that it could be widely replicated.
That would leave the burden of supporting orphanages to the states, which have not, historically, done a very good job running or supporting such institutions as prisons, mental hospitals or nursing homes. The states would do better using their money to establish more family preservation programs, provide support services to foster families and increase efforts to recruit foster and adoptive families. Those are more modern, humane and economical solutions for dealing with dependent children than institutions like orphanages.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki: Save the Watershed

 BODY:
Despite their differences, there is one huge task that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor-elect George Pataki must face together: stopping pollution in the 2,000-square-mile watershed northwest of New York City. The watershed supplies eight million city dwellers and one million upstaters -- half the state's population -- with cheap, high-quality drinking water. Failure to protect it will require billions in filtration costs.
That is a financial punch neither official can happily absorb. They have only two years to duck it. Last December, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency told the city to clean up the water supply. If there is no real progress by December 1996 the E.P.A. will order filtration. City Comptroller Alan Hevesi says a filtration plant will cost $4.5 billion, plus annual debt service of $365 million and operating expenses of $145 million. Water and sewer rates could easily double -- a ridiculous price to pay for something New Yorkers now get cheaper than most Americans. 
 The watershed includes 100 sewage treatment plants that discharge wastewater into the streams feeding the reservoirs; most of them need upgrading or replacement. There are 128,000 individual septic tanks. There are thousands of acres of farmland and hundred of miles of roadways that produce runoffs of extraordinary toxicity. The visible product of all this human and animal activity is the algae in the reservoirs; the invisible products are the micro-organisms that water-drinkers would just as soon not think about.
New York City has long had the right to regulate economic development in the watershed. Basically, that means control over sewage, from barnyard manure to the effluents from housing developments. Under the E.P.A.'s hammer, the Dinkins administration developed a $700 million plan to upgrade the watershed sewage treatment plants and septic systems, reduce agricultural pollution, tighten restrictions on land use and acquire some 80,000 acres of buffer zones near the reservoirs and the streams that feed them. With some modifications, Mayor Giuliani has accepted that plan.
But the city cannot act unilaterally. The state's Department of Health must approve regulations governing water pollution; the Department of Environmental Conservation must approve the land purchases. It is crucial that Mr. Pataki appoint people who are sympathetic to downstate concerns.
It is even more important that Mr. Pataki engage himself personally. Whatever the city's statutory powers, watershed protection cannot proceed without the cooperation of local residents. They did not much like it when the city condemned farms and uprooted villages to create the reservoir system over the last 100 years, and they do not much like it now that the city has decided to impose new restrictions on their assumed right to develop their land.
Mr. Pataki, an upstater, has credibility in the region. Though he once sponsored a bill in the State Senate to strip the city of its regulatory powers, he now says he will do whatever it takes to avoid filtration. Gov. Mario Cuomo could speed things along by ordering his health and environmental agencies to approve the city's regulations before he leaves office. But regulations can be defeated by endless litigation; it will still be up to Mr. Pataki to win the active consent of his wary constituents in watershed counties like Delaware, Sullivan and Ulster, places where he is known and liked.
Rebuilding and replacing waste treatment plants and septic tanks and buying up 80,000 acres at negotiated prices constitute a staggering two-year workload. It is fine to tell local residents that a clean watershed with magnificent landscapes and clear trout streams will be more valuable to them in the long run than one-shot development. But they are more likely to cooperate if they can be convinced that the city will treat them fairly, involve them in planning and underwrite most of the costs.
That is where Mayor Giuliani comes in. The Dinkins administration set aside $120 million in its capital budget for municipal waste treatment programs, far short of the $700 million required for complete protection. The Mayor must assure upstaters -- not to mention Washington -- that the rest is on the way.

HEADLINE: A Needed Capital Gain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the renewed discussion of a possible cut in the capital gains tax, it is seldom mentioned that for many middle-class Americans the most significant capital gains vulnerability will come when they retire to a smaller dwelling. 
 Presently, a onetime, over-55 exemption of $125,000 is in effect. With previous housing inflation, this is often inadequate to cover the capital gains in many areas of the country. Replacing this with a full capital gains exclusion for a primary dwelling (also one-time, over-55) would place extra capital in the pockets of older Americans and reduce their retirement needs for supplemental services.

HEADLINE: Republicans May Hold Down The S.E.C. and Investor Suits

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
The shift to a Republican-controlled Congress in January is likely to make it more difficult for the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand its regulatory activities and for investors to pursue claims of fraud against the securities industry.
In interviews last week, more than a dozen legislators, staff aides, industry executives and regulators agreed that an expanded S.E.C. budget to provide for more examiners to oversee mutual funds and investment advisers and to upgrade consumer education would collide with Republican concerns that the agency is already too intrusive and creates unnecessary expenses for the industry. 
 "The greatest area of potential difficulty we face in the new Congress is with respect to the budget," Arthur Levitt Jr., the commission's chairman, said in an interview last week. Mr. Levitt would like the agency to be able to keep the fees and fines it generates to cover its own budget rather than turning the bulk of that money over to the Treasury.
But that approach has been rejected by Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is in line to lead the Banking Committee's securities subcommittee. Mr. Gramm said self-financing would allow the commission to be too intrusive and free it from legislative oversight.
The new Congress and the regulators may also collide on the issue of when and how investors may sue when they believe they have been defrauded in securities transactions. Because Newt Gingrich, the next House Speaker, has called for broad changes in the litigation process in his "Contract With America," securities litigation will be the top priority of the S.E.C.'s overseers in the House, said Stephen A. Blumenthal, who will serve as the majority counsel to the House subcommittee responsible for the commission's operations.
The S.E.C. and state regulators say that lawsuits filed by investors, called private rights of action, deter fraud and augment the agency's work.
"The prime mission of this agency is protecting the investor's interest, and the private right of action is fundamental to that mission," said Mr. Levitt, who acknowledged "a need for doing something about the costly, time-consuming and inefficient kind of litigation we've experienced."
Advocates for change, led by Mr. Gramm and his key staff adviser, the economist Wayne A. Abernathy, went further, saying the current securities litigation process, in Mr. Gramm's words, "has been distorted by greedy lawyers into a form of piracy."
Representative Jack M. Fields Jr., the Texas Republican who will head the House subcommittee that oversees the S.E.C.'s operations, questioned the merits of "a vast majority of the class action suits that are filed and settled" and would not rule out a system in which the loser in a lawsuit would have to pay all the costs. Mr. Gramm said that while he did not mean to deter small investors from going to court, "quite frankly, if someone is going to impose costs on a company, they should be liable for it."
Democrats have opposed the "loser pays" concept, saying it would discourage small investors from seeking redress.
Those who favor the Republican agenda say it will make American capital markets more competitive and efficient, without weakening investor protections. But many market watchdogs at the Federal and state level say they fear the proposed changes will shake investor confidence in the fairness and honesty of the American markets.
"We support the strongest, most efficient S.E.C. possible," said Philip Feigin, Colorado's securities commissioner and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which represents state regulators across the country. Mr. Feigin said he was concerned that the commission would not be able to obtain the level of financing it needed to be effective and was also concerned that the Republicans would try to change litigation rules to prevent small investors from bringing meritorious cases.
"There will never be enough cops on the beat," he said. "Investors have to be able to protect themselves."
Mr. Gramm said his goal would be "to reach that balance where the benefits that regulation yields in terms of an orderly and honest market is equal to the cost that regulation imposes in terms of burdens on the market." Mr. Gramm said he strongly opposed any increase in funds for the commission.
While the investor litigation process is a House priority, the debate could be more protracted in the Senate, where some of the S.E.C.'s future overseers have been less strident. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who will head the Banking Committee, has pointed out repeatedly that the current judicial system already provides safeguards against frivolous litigation.
Joel Seligman, a securities law specialist and author of a history of the S.E.C., said he was concerned about the impact that budget cuts could have. "At the moment, certain aspects of the market -- such as investment advisers -- appear to be near crisis because of a lack of meaningful oversight or inspection being conducted," Mr. Seligman said. "Unless the S.E.C. receives adequate support for that, you run the risk of a significant number of cases such as those in Orange County."
The messy bankruptcy of that Southern California county last week provided a mesmerizing backdrop for discussions about Congressional priorities for revising securities litigation rules. Some Democrats wondered whether the new leadership would become more cautious about putting limits on such lawsuits in the wake of the unfolding scandal, which has already prompted investors and the county itself to sue several Wall Street firms over $1.5 billion in losses incurred by an aggressively managed county investment fund.
"They say that a conservative is a liberal who has just been mugged," mused Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who will yield his subcommittee gavel to Mr. Fields. "Perhaps a liberal is a conservative who has just been defrauded out of $1.5 billion."
Unlike most agencies of the Federal Government, the commission actually generates money for the Treasury, turning over roughly $2 in fees and fines for every $1 it spends. And in recent years, the S.E.C. and some industries it regulates, notably the mutual fund industry, have argued that the agency should be able to use its own fees to finance its operations.
That option was rejected by at least one powerful Republican. "There will be no self-funding for the S.E.C. on my watch," said Mr. Gramm, whose disputes with the agency have had a personal edge since the late 1980's, when Richard C. Breeden, then the chairman of the commission, tried to take over the duties of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, headed at the time by Wendy Gramm, Senator Gramm's wife.
If self-financing is almost certainly doomed, Mr. Levitt said, he hoped the Republican leadership would at least recognize that the agency's budget needs are "dynamic" and fluctuate with market activity.
Explosive growth in the investment advisory business and in the mutual fund industry in the last decade have substantially outstripped the commission's inspection programs. Despite improvements made by Mr. Levitt and Mr. Breeden, the agency is still able to examine on a regular basis only the largest and most active managers of the public's money.
Smaller fund operations or advisory firms are likely to be inspected only when a scandal has occurred -- and such scandals, including unreported risks in money market mutual funds and fraudulent activities by investment advisers, have occurred frequently enough in the last year to suggest that additional regulatory oversight might be needed.
Without additional resources, Mr. Levitt's supporters say, such inspection could be provided only by reducing resources now devoted to policing the public markets and reviewing the documents supplied to investors by companies trying to raise capital.
In addition to planning a substantial increase in the inspection staff, Mr. Levitt has initiated a small but ambitious program of consumer information, aimed at giving small investors a better understanding of how to protect themselves from market fraud.
Mr. Seligman noted that Republican-dominated Congresses have not produced expansive S.E.C. budgets in the past. Indeed, historians note that the commission was kept on short rations for at least 15 years after World War II, even as the postwar markets grew explosively. The result was a flood of financial scandals that swept through Wall Street by the end of the 1950's.
"That's why it is so important that the S.E.C. be adequately funded," Mr. Seligman said. "It has the potential to nip problems in the bud through inspection and review of filings, rather than solely through enforcement actions after the fact."
The commission's supporters note that Mr. Levitt, who was appointed last year by President Clinton, is perhaps the agency's best protection against draconian budget cuts since he is seen as a practical businessman without imperial ambitions. Even Senator Gramm had kind words: "I have had a very good working relationship with Mr. Levitt. I have had nothing but the best dealings with him."
But the commission will need more than charm to head off the effects of the new leadership's agenda, its supporters said; it will need the vocal support of Wall Street itself.
"The likes of a Merrill Lynch knows that its enemy is not the S.E.C.," said one senior regulator. "Its enemies are the con artists who scare investors out of the market. Wall Street's viability depends on a very strong, pro-active S.E.C."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article last Monday about ways in which the Republican-controlled Congress might restrain the Securities and Exchange Commission misstated proposals by the S.E.C. for financing its operations out of its own income. The commission has sought to keep only the fees it generates, not both its fees and its fines.

HEADLINE: CD-ROM Review;
CD-ROM's to Get Better and Faster But Even So They May Not Survive

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH it has been around for more than a decade, CD-ROM technology has only recently become a standard component in new personal computers. And wouldn't you know it, today's technology is already well past its prime just as it is becoming widespread. That does not mean that the CD-ROM is nearing the end of its useful life, but rather that new generations of devices are emerging that will gradually, but inevitably, replace it.
The next generation of CD-ROM players and disks will begin showing up early next year, and some really dazzling advances are just two to three years away, analysts say. 
 The "ROM" part of CD-ROM -- read-only memory -- is ideal for large amounts of information that does not change. But in a rapidly changing world, a medium that cannot change rapidly is an impediment. Affordable CD drives that can be written upon repeatedly, much like a high-capacity diskette drive, will reach market next year, bringing with them great possibilities as backup devices as well as multimedia creation and distribution tools.
New standards are being developed to eliminate the difference between CD-ROM and audio CD formats. The two are largely incompatible today. One can play audio CD's in a CD-ROM drive, but not CD-ROM disks in an audio CD drive. In terms of hardware, an "enhanced CD" standard will simplify manufacturing, which in theory would lead to lower prices. In software, audio, text and video can be tightly integrated, permitting truly interactive music video disks, for example.
Most CD-ROM drives in use today are "double speed" drives, meaning they spin at twice the rate of the first generation, and thus can send data to the computer more quickly, resulting in improved video and sound performance. Triple speed or 3X is a lame-duck technology that soon will be eclipsed by "quad speed" drives.
"By the end of 1995, most computers will ship with quad-speed drives," said Bruce Ryon, an analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market research company in San Jose, Calif. "Most of the manufacturers have stopped making double-speed drives already."
The next jump in storage capacity will allow CD-ROM drives to store 3.3 gigabytes (3.3 GB) of information on a single disk.
The leap in capacity could transform the video and music industries. Even with the best data compression, the current CD-ROM disks can hold only about an hour of video images. A typical feature film thus would require at least two CD-ROM disks. At 3.3 GB, a feature film could be stored on a single "super" CD-ROM disk.
By the time these 3.3-GB disks become widespread, new technologies may have replaced quad-speed drives with something even faster. The combination of higher-speed drives and higher-capacity disks opens the possibility of laser-quality movies on a single disk, which in turn could hasten the demise of VHS video tapes. When the rewriteable 3.3-gigabyte optical disk drives reach the consumer market in 1998 or so, the VCR itself will begin to fade.
Eventually, CD-ROM itself will begin to be displaced, or even replaced, by advances in so-called broadband networks and alternative storage technologies.
There is no technical reason why software, including video and audio, cannot be transmitted over networks, whether the network belongs to the phone company, the cable TV company or the satellite company. The issue is bandwidth, or capacity of the data pipe, and time.
"It can takes hours to download video on a 14.4-kilobit per second telephone line," said Thomas Ryan, manager of media products at Apple Computer Inc., referring to the current personal computer modem standard. "For the near future, until the rest of the information superhighway catches up, we'll have to have some sort of storage capacity."
That storage may or may not be on CD-ROM. "Even in quad-speed drives, a hard disk is 100 times faster than CD-ROM, and RAM is 1,000 times faster," said Mr. Ryon of Dataquest, referring to random-access memory. As a result, CD-ROM software developers are becoming adept at mainlining parts of their programs into the computer's memory.
It is unlikely that we will have three gigabytes of RAM in our personal computers any time soon, but gigabyte-sized hard disks are already common. In the meantime, expect some sort of hybrid system involving the static storage on data on CD-ROM, linked to the immediacy of an on-line service.

HEADLINE: ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY: THE MOOD;
Orange County's Long Prosperity Appears Dented but Not Undone

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Things are suddenly looking up at the H. W. Wright Hardware Company, a small family-owned enterprise that buys the inventories of companies that go out of business.
"I think this bankruptcy is going to wipe out a lot of small-business men in Orange County -- the people who would supply oil for the county's trucks and toilet paper for the bathrooms," said H. W. Wright, the owner. "They will be the very last to be paid by the county, and a lot of these are small-business men who can't afford that kind of delay." 
 Few other businesses or economic analysts are as certain of the future as Mr. Wright as they struggle to gauge the effects of Orange County's declaration of bankruptcy last week after a loss now thought to be at least $2 billion in risky investments.
"We are truly in the dark, along with everyone else," said Paul Brady Jr., city manager of Irvine, which has $209 million in the county investment pool. "Nobody really knows the whole picture; it's too big."
With each day, the worrisome outlines of the picture become clearer. Several school districts say they may not have funds to operate past February. County supervisors say they might be forced to reduce salaries, shorten workweeks and cut staff, as well as hold back on ambitious plans to upgrade law enforcement and social programs.
Anticipating the worst, some cities and school districts have frozen nonessential spending; construction projects have been put on hold, and municipal workers and teachers are living from one uncertain paycheck to the next.
Yet most California analysts agreed that the investment losses, though huge, will not derail the fundamentally healthy economy of one of the nation's most prosperous counties. This is not New York or Bridgeport, Conn., they said, where financial crises in the 1970's and early 1990's were the result of rising debt and a declining tax base.
"The problem here is not so much a reflection of deep-seated structural, social and economic problems in the area," said James Doti, professor of economics at Chapman University in the city of Orange, "but a reflection of an absolutely terrible and irresponsible investment policy."
Mark Poster, a professor of history at the University of California at Irvine and co-author of a book on the county, agreed, saying, "We have a really rich economy here and a strong one, and it's hard for me to believe that this would do permanent, apocalyptic damage."
The Orange County bankruptcy does carry an urgent contemporary message for those who want to privatize government operations and who advocate what Mr. Poster called "a fast-shooting, fast-thinking, whatever-one-can-get-away-with approach, regardless of where it is being applied."
The county's investments were placed in high-profit, high-risk accounts that several analysts said might have been appropriate for private investors, but not for a portfolio that contained funds for schools, parks, roads and other municipal services.
"Orange County thought it was Orange County Inc., but it's not," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian of California. "This is a kind of warning shot across the bow of those who would like to slowly privatize the United States. Do they want to see it go broke? How about the embarrassment of not being able to pay the budget of the Marine Corps because naval bond investments went sour?"
Because this largely white county of 2.4 million is such a free-market bastion, solidly Republican with a median household income of nearly $46,000 (all of California, by comparison, is slightly less than $36,000), many analysts said that any attempt to recover from bankruptcy by raising taxes would be politically suicidal.
"Sorry, we goofed, and now we have to have a tax increase" will not be a popular political position in this county, said Mark Baldassare, chairman of the urban and regional planning department at the University of California at Irvine.
A near-term effect of the bankruptcy will be that the county will have to pay high interest rates to borrow money and will have difficulty floating bonds to finance construction and repair work on basic facilities and services, analysts said. Such work is essential to the county's image as a modern, well-run, well-maintained place to do business.
"I think the biggest damage is going to be higher interest rates on the bonds, uncertainty and a hit on the county's image," said Dennis Macheski of the real estate group at Price Waterhouse. "We've already been hit by a lot of things: earthquakes, fires, the recession and now a bankruptcy. So there's a fear, I think, among people worldwide of investing in Southern California, and this is one more straw."
Doubts now surround plans for projects like a new football stadium in Anaheim and an international airport on the site of the El Toro Marine Base, which is closing. Also in question now are a $107 million jail complex that is under construction in Santa Ana, as are plans for a $2.5 million library in Mission Viejo and for a new courthouse.
The bankruptcy could also stall a huge highway project including three toll roads that are projected as vital links between economically important areas of this growing county. Lisa Telles, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agency, a quasi-governmental agency that put about one-third of its investment in the county pool, said: "We are not slowing down or stopping any contracts and at this time we can meet all our obligations. But we don't know about the future."
Officials at Disneyland in Anaheim said they did not know whether they would be able to proceed with a major expansion that some analysts said would be an indicator of whether Orange County would continue to grow and renew itself. David Malmuth, vice president at the Disney Development Corporation, said expansion would require hundreds of millions of dollars in spending by local governments and agencies for new and improved facilities.
In turn, worries about such slowdowns and reduced services, along with the possibility of higher taxes and fees, could slow the county's efforts to attract companies and foreign investment.
Will property taxes rise? Will school activities be cut back? Will water rates go up? Road improvements cease? Jobs be lost? At the moment, nobody knows for certain.
"It's the pits," remarked Irma Rosales, manager of The Bod beauty store. "I am a single parent and I just bought a new home, and if the property taxes go up, that will squeeze me back out of it. They've got to make somebody pay, and it will probably be us."
Betty Campos, a customer at Luv-U Beauty in Fountain Valley, a comfortable bedroom community, used words that could have been spoken by public administrators throughout the county when she described her current spending."Definitely I am very careful about my money," she said. "I did very little Christmas shopping -- $30 worth so far."
Some good news came from Mary-Jean Hackwood, administrator of the Orange County Employees Retirement System, who said, "It's business as usual." Only half of the fund's diversified $130 million portfolio was invested in the high-risk pool, she said, and for the present, payments to retirees will be made on schedule.
After months of research, Chapman University released its annual economic forecast for the county two days after bankruptcy was declared. The forecast, modified to take account of the bankruptcy, still sounded the most upbeat note of the week.
The county, it said, had recently begun to climb out of a long recession, a little behind the state at large because of its heavy reliance on collapsing military-related industries. It predicted that the bankruptcy would slow but not halt an upturn that is characterized by a fading of the impact of military cutbacks and strong growth in construction jobs.
Mr. Doti said the effects of the bankruptcy would be "relatively mild" compared with the hard times the county has recently experienced, when residential housing values dropped in three years by $22 billion.
The bankruptcy will cause a decrease of $100 million a year in taxable sales, the report said, which is less than one-third of 1 percent of total taxable sales. The gross county product will also continue to grow while absorbing a bankruptcy-related decline of $540 million, or six-tenths of 1 percent.
These numbers signal the start of a turnaround for the county, which grew at three times the national average in the 1970's and 1980's, transforming itself from a bedroom community largely for Los Angeles into a business area that generated its own work, but then lost 7 percent of its jobs in the three years from 1990 through 1993.
The county's population, which grew by half a million in the 1980's, continues to rise. It is now 64.5 percent white, 23.4 percent Hispanic, 10 percent Asian and 1.6 percent black, with the rest a mixture of minorities.
Orange County's resiliency comes from its overall economic profile, a mixture of highly trained workers and high-technology industries that Vice President Al Gore could love.
"The real engines of growth are professional services, lawyers, accountants, management and engineering consulting, computer manufacturing and services, international trade and aerospace," said Mr. Macheski of Price Waterhouse.
The share of jobs in high-technology manufacturing is 2.6 times the national concentration, and most of these are not in aerospace but in the production of goods like medical instruments, communications equipment and computers. The concentration of professional services is 1.5 times the national average and jobs in finance, insurance and real estate are 1.4 times the national average, he said.
But the county has less than its share of government workers and less than its share of low-skilled jobs, of "hamburger flippers and dry cleaners," Mr. Macheski said.

HEADLINE: An Evening With Castro: 36 Years and No Regrets

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN and LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Summit of the Americas had just ended in Miami, and President Clinton and his counterparts from 33 other countries were heading triumphantly home. At a long table in the Palace of the Revolution in Havana, the man not invited, Fidel Castro, argued that Cuba's exclusion had been their loss, not his.
"If the summit of Miami was a great show, it would have been a better show if I had been there," he said, grinning through the beard. "We are the last rebels," he said of his Communist Government. "That was no meeting for rebels." 
 Three weeks before the Cuban revolution is to celebrate its 36th anniversary, Mr. Castro, 68, was looking a little older and perhaps feeling a little more isolated than he was willing to let on. But if that worried him, he was making an accomplished effort not to let it show.
Yes, he acknowledged during a four-hour dinner conversation in Spanish with representatives of The New York Times, he had real reservations about the market-oriented reforms his Government has undertaken to save an economy devastated by the collapse of the Soviet bloc. It pained him to sign some of those contracts for joint ventures with foreign companies.
But if he is not willing to turn Cuba into a Western-style democracy, he said, he recognizes that the world economy has changed.
"I am not a great fan of capitalism," he said. "But I am a realist."
To hear him tell it, Mr. Castro was more worried about Bill Clinton.
How is it that American voters had shown so little mercy toward their President last month, he wanted to know early in the conversation; the young Democrat had seemed to have such an attractive social agenda as a candidate. Now, so quickly, the Republicans and their traditional antagonism toward Cuba seemed to be back, and strong.
Mr. Castro skipped past the fact that even as a candidate, Mr. Clinton ardently supported a tightening of the longstanding embargo against Cuba. Nor did he say much about the further sanctions that Mr. Clinton imposed in angry reprisal for the flood of more than 30,000 refugees whom Mr. Castro let go after political tensions rose here this summer.
"The Chinese wanted Bush to win," he recalled. "The Russians wanted Bush to win. The Mexicans wanted Bush to win." Cuba's political isolation, Mr. Castro suggested, goes so far as to include rooting for Mr. Clinton.
"We hope that he will be successful," he said.
What counsel Mr. Castro might have taken on this subject was probably present in the cavernous dining room, with its black marble floors and bright green ferns.
To his right sat his good friend, the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who one night at the height of the refugee crisis had spent an evening in Martha's Vineyard talking politics, Faulkner and Cuba with Mr. Clinton.
Across the table at one end was Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's lead negotiator in the talks that produced an agreement with the Clinton Administration to stop the exodus. At the other was Jose Antonio Arbesu, the Communist Party's chief expert on United States affairs and Mr. Alarcon's senior deputy in his talks.
Covering their bets, Mr. Castro and his aides also asked after the new Speaker of the House. Where was it that Mr. Gingrich had gone to college? And what about the political future of the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell?
 
A Watchful Eye On U.S. Politics
 Mr. Castro made no effort to disguise his real concern. He seemed troubled by the Republicans' sweeping victory in the Nov. 8 election, less out of any affinity for Mr. Clinton than from a fear that the victory might delay the end of the United States embargo even more.
The refugees who fled Cuba in homemade rafts over the summer did not leave for political reasons, he insisted once again: They were driven out by the embargo and the economic turmoil it had wrought. And whatever pain the embargo had inflicted on Cubans and their Government, he promised, it would never force the sort of political opening that has been its stated goal.
"We are not going to negotiate the normalization of our relations on the basis of concessions," he said. "The United States did not blockade South Africa. It does not blockade Saudi Arabia, where few rich families own all of the wealth. The United States does not dictate political conditions to China. It does not dictate political conditions to Vietnam. Why does it have to dictate political conditions to us?"
Sipping a gin martini before the meal -- he usually prefers rum and red vermouth, he said -- Mr. Castro warmly recalled an early stay in the United States in 1948, telling of the basement apartment he had rented in a brownstone on West 82d Street in Manhattan. Later on, as a young conspirator against the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, he said, he sneaked across the Rio Grande into Texas to meet with a prospective financier.
"I probably still have a debt with American justice," he said, smiling.
Mr. Castro did not wait to be reminded of the great political mileage he has gotten out of the embargo over the years.
"Some people ask why they do not lift the embargo, because it serves us as a pretext," he said. "The day that American businessmen want to come and do business here, it would be a great headache for us. But we are ready to face that challenge.
"Will they corrupt us? Will we fall sick with a terrible infection of capitalism? We are willing to see.
"It is absolutely false that the blockade serves us as a political instrument to keep the people united."
 
No Loneliness At Cuba's Top
 The Cuban leader is said not to subscribe to the belief of his friend Mr. Garcia Marquez, the author of "Autumn of the Patriarch" and "The General in His Labyrinth," about the solitude of power. Mr. Castro takes pride in telling of his travels around the island, his meetings with the workers, the "people's assemblies" at which he says they decide the country's course.
Looking around a table of eight people much younger than himself, as waiters in white coats glided from place to place with trays of simply prepared chicken and potatoes, he spoke of the revolution's being regenerated, producing able new cadres who deserve the responsibilities he has increasingly given them. They could be trusted, he added, not to "overthrow us or put us before the firing squad."
What could be glimpsed at dinner suggested that Mr. Castro's authority remains paramount, even forbidding. Speaking about the summer exodus, one of his more senior aides regaled the table with an account of a television news story in which a Cuban interviewed at sea had staunchly defended the "Comandante" even as the refugee floated toward Florida. Another aide spoke at length of university students who demanded to endure economic sacrifices that even the Government was reluctant to impose.
When asked, senior officials almost invariably dismiss the notion of ideological divisions within the Government over the changes made. Yet Mr. Castro was candid in admitting qualms about such steps as the wide opening to foreign investment, the advent of a flourishing parallel economy for Cubans with access to dollars, and the establishment this fall of free markets for some farm and factory goods.
"I sympathize more with some and less with others," he said of the changes. "But I have supported all of them because I think they are part of a coherent, necessary strategy and they have been taken by consensus. With every one of those joint ventures, they come to me for signatures -- and I sign."
Just last Friday, he noted, the Government completed arrangements for its first joint venture with a foreign real estate firm, leasing a historic building in Old Havana to Argentaria, a Spanish company, for office space. He said he had done so "painfully."
 
Enduring Suspicions About Free Markets
 Eight years after he abolished a first experiment in free markets for peasant farmers, Mr. Castro was particularly open about his reservations in allowing all Cubans who grow vegetables, raise livestock or make handicrafts to sell their surpluses at prices set by supply and demand.
"I was never a supporter of the peasant markets we had," he said. Noting that the new markets are wider in scope and more carefully regulated, he described them as more promising than in the first experiment. But he was quick to add that he saw "negative aspects" as well, and that part of the value of the markets was in creating a greater appreciation among Cubans for the subsidized goods they buy from the state.
"I say that the agricultural markets teach more about capitalism and socialism that a thousand schools of political instruction," he said.
The challenge of rescuing Cuba's economy, Mr. Castro suggested, was psychological as well as ideological.
If he was not sanctioning the enrichment of his people, as the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has done, Mr. Castro said his Government was allowing at least some Cubans to accumulate some wealth. It was permitting farmers to hire laborers, he said, and he hinted that it might eventually ease restrictions and allow other Cubans to hire one another.
 
Making His Mark With U.S. Dollars
 As if to show that he had begun to reconcile himself to the presence of American dollars, at one point Mr. Castro asked to examine two bills and then signed them for his visitors.
Reflecting on the summit talks in Miami that he had missed, Mr. Castro maintained that his fellow Latin American leaders were selling off their assets too cheaply to private investors in a headlong rush to restructure their once heavily protected economies and gain freer trade with the United States.
Had he gotten time on the floor in Miami, he said, he would have warned of social needs left unmet, of economic development gone out of control, of a poor country being swallowed up in the big arms of the United States.
But as he bid his guests farewell, Mr. Castro seemed to yearn for a bit of that embrace.
Standing atop the front steps of the vast palace, he finally asked his American visitors to convey his best wishes to Mr. Gingrich and Bob Dole, the Republican leader of the Senate. Then he paused for a moment and remembered that a conservative Republican would soon head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
"And also to Jesse Helms," he added. "Why not?"

HEADLINE: Kenneth Rush, U.S. Diplomat, Is Dead at 84

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Kenneth Rush, who as a United States Ambassador helped negotiate the ground-breaking four-power agreement in 1971 that ended the post-war crises over Berlin, died on Sunday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 84.
A son said he had been under treatment for heart and blood ailments. 
 The Quadripartite Berlin Agreement, between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and France, ended more than two decades of East-West tensions over the divided former capital of Germany. It improved ties between Washington and Moscow, reaffirmed the Western Allies' rights in the city and paved the way for the development of peaceful relations between East and West Germany. Mr. Rush, who was Ambassador to West Germany at the time, was credited by all sides with having played a major role in the successful conclusion of the agreement after 17 months of negotiations.
Mr. Rush had come to Government from industry only two years earlier, having been appointed to the Bonn embassy by President Nixon in his first month in office. Three months later, Mr. Nixon flew to Berlin to make a speech saying that it was time for the Soviet Union and the Western powers to negotiate their differences in Europe, specifically in Berlin. He already had Mr. Rush in mind to take on that task.
The two became acquainted in 1936 at Duke University Law School, where Mr. Rush had just joined the faculty as an assistant professor and Mr. Nixon had just enrolled as a student. It was the beginning of an enduring friendship. A year later the young professor accepted an offer to join the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation with the prospect of an executive position. He became a vice president in 1939 and was named president in 1966.
Years later, when critics suggested that he lacked the experience to be a diplomat, Mr. Rush would reply with a genial smile, "I managed to become president of Union Carbide and I hadn't studied any chemistry either."
In fact, he had long been active in the Foreign Policy Association, of which was a director, and the Council on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Nixon turned to Ambassador Rush again early in 1972 and appointed him Deputy Secretary of Defense under Melvin R. Laird. But Mr. Rush stayed only until the end of the year, when the President moved him over to foreign policy again, as Deputy Secretary of State. For a time between the departure of Secretary of State William P. Rogers and the arrival of Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Rush served as acting Secretary of State.
As the Watergate storm gathered strength, President Nixon asked his old friend in May 1974 to come to the White House to take the post of Counselor for Economic Policy.
Before leaving the State Department, Mr. Rush had to receive a high-level delegation from Poland and a friend observed, "I guess you have seen the Poles."
"Yes," Mr. Rush shot back, his mind on already on Watergate, the White House and Mr. Nixon's plummeting public opinion ratings, "and 40 percent undecided about the President isn't bad at all."
He remained unwaveringly at Mr. Nixon's side to the end on Aug. 9, 1974, when the President resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal.
One month later, his newly inducted successor, Gerald R. Ford, appointed Mr. Rush ambassador to France, a post he held until 1977.
He was born David Kenneth Rush on Jan. 17, 1910, in Walla Walla, Wash., where his parents, from an old Tennessee family, had journeyed during a yearlong tour of the western United States. His father was a farmer in Greenville, Tenn., and his mother a teacher. His father died when he was 2.
After attending secondary schools in Greenville, Mr. Rush worked his way through the University of Tennessee by waiting on tables. A history major, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
He enrolled in Yale Law School, where he edited the law journal and earned an LL.B. degree in 1931. After working briefly for the Manhattan law firm of Chadbourne, Stanchfield & Levy, he was hired in early 1936 as a lawyer by Union Carbide in New York. That led to his rehiring after a year at Duke University.
Six feet tall and silver haired, Kenneth Rush had a courtly manner and a gentle sense of humor. But he was, as associates said, capable of forceful action if the situation demanded it.
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Jane Gilbert Smith; three sons, Malcolm, John Randall and Kenneth; a daughter, Mrs. Cynthia Monahan; a sister, Lanthe Rush Campbell, and 11 grandchildren. Two other sons, George and David, died earlier.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Critic Of Korea Pact Eases Stance

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A leading Senate critic of the nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea softened his tone today and predicted that the new Republican-controlled Congress would not follow through on recent threats to overturn the accord.
"As far as any efforts to scuttle that agreement, I don't anticipate any," Senator Frank Murkowski said at a news conference here, after he and Senator Paul Simon made a rare visit by high-level American officials to North Korea. 
 The comments by Mr. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, seem to remove one of the first challenges to his foreign policy that President Clinton was expected to face next year from the Republicans who swept to control of both houses of Congress in last month's elections. Mr. Murkowski is in line to become chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on East Asia in the new Congress, so his opinion on the nuclear accord will carry great weight.
The Republican legislator said he was still critical of the Geneva accord and expected it to be "examined thoroughly" but not overturned by the new Congress. He said his criticism was "quite specific," directed at a clause that allows North Korea to put off inspections of two suspected nuclear waste sites until construction of modern nuclear reactors is well under way. That will be years from now and after the expenditure of about $2 billion, he said.
Mr. Murkowski had vociferously criticized the nuclear agreement last month, saying that he would seek to overturn it by blocking the United States from buying the oil it is committed to supplying to North Korea under the pact. A few days later, at a Senate hearing, Mr. Murkowski pulled back from that threat, but some other Republican lawmakers still said they would try to block the funding needed to carry out the accord.
The agreement, signed in October, requires North Korea to give up activities that are suspected of being aimed at bomb development. In exchange it will receive two modern light-water nuclear reactors, at an estimated cost of $4 billion that will be borne mainly by South Korea and Japan. In addition, the United States will provide North Korea with fuel oil until the new nuclear plants are ready and will relax its restrictions on economic and diplomatic relations with the Communist nation.
Mr. Murkowski said his trip the last two days had "changed to some extent" his opinion of North Korea.
"I think they are desperately in need of foreign exchange, desperately in need of energy and in a transition of leadership, and as a consequence, they need assistance," he said. "And I think if that assistance can properly be communicated and transmitted we can ease tensions in this part of the world."
Despite his misgivings about the accord, Senator Murkowski apparently expressed his support for the agreement to North Korean officials.
"Both Senator Murkowski and I indicated while we would have preferred some different provisions in terms of earlier inspections, that the United States will comply with the agreement that we have signed," Mr. Simon, an Illinois Democrat, said at the news conference.
The two Senators flew to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from Beijing on Sunday aboard the first American military plane to fly into North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. This afternoon, they traveled to Seoul, the South Korean capital.
During their 28 hours in North Korea, they met with many officials including Kim Yong Nam, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. However, they were not granted an audience with the reclusive Kim Jong Il, who is believed to be the leader of North Korea although he has not officially been appointed head of state. Mr. Murkowski said they were told Mr. Kim is still observing mourning for his father, Kim Il Sung, who ruled North Korea before his death in July.
The Senators said North Korean officials stressed to them that they wanted better relations with the United States. They said they pressed North Korea to begin a dialogue with South Korea. The North Koreans expressed a general willingness to do so, but no specifics were mentioned, they said.
The Senators met today with the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, and Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo to report on their visit to the North. The South Korean leaders were said to be skeptical about the North's supposed interest in North-South talks.
Mr. Simon and Mr. Murkowski also asked for North Korea's help in clearing the cases and returning the remains of American soldiers missing in action from the Korean War.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Reject Decades-Old Limit on Veterans' Health Claims

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that Congress meant what it said 70 years ago in a law that entitled veterans to compensation for injuries resulting from Veterans Administration medical treatment, although for nearly as long, the agency has insisted that compensation was due only if the injury resulted from medical negligence.
The unanimous decision upheld a 1993 Federal appeals court ruling that the Clinton Administration had warned would cost the Government $1 billion in the next five years in claims by veterans whose treatment was not negligent but nonetheless had a poor outcome. 
 Ruling in the case of a Korean War veteran who became partly disabled after surgery in a V.A. hospital for a herniated disk, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit here invalidated an agency regulation that restricted compensation to cases of medical accident or fault.
The regulation, in various forms, dated from 1930, six years after Congress passed a law providing compensation "where any veteran shall have suffered an injury, or an aggravation of an injury, as the result of hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment" or a vocational rehabilitation program run by the V.A. Since 1989, the agency has been a Cabinet department, the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Writing for the Court today, Justice David H. Souter noted that the 1924 law did not include "so much as a word about fault." He said the Government's various explanations for why negligence should be understood as implicit in the statute were "implausible."
The decision, Brown v. Gardner, No. 93-1128, was the latest of several recent cases in which the Court has had to examine a law in light of an interpretation by the executive branch that appeared at variance with the words chosen by Congress.
Last month, for example, the Court looked at a Federal child pornography law that appeared, in the most natural reading, to outlaw the interstate transportation of packages containing child pornography regardless of whether the shippers or recipients were aware of the contents. The Court agreed with the Justice Department that the 1977 law did contain a knowledge requirement, with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist writing for a 7-to-2 majority that in the absence of such a requirement, the law would "produce results that were not merely odd, but positively absurd."
In the decision today, the Court found no reason to defer to the executive branch's longstanding interpretation of the veterans' compensation law as containing a negligence requirement. The phrase "as a result of" in the law "is naturally read simply to impose the requirement of a causal connection" without regard to fault, Justice Souter said.
He said the V.A.'s 64-year-old regulation to the contrary was entitled to no weight. "A regulation's age is no antidote to clear inconsistency with a statute," he said.
Despite the age of both the law and the regulation, the Court had not had an earlier occasion to examine the issue because veterans' cases were not subject to judicial review before 1988. That year, Congress passed the Veterans Judicial Review Act and set up a special court, the Court of Veterans Appeals, to review veterans' claims. In this case, that court ruled in the veteran's favor, overturning a determination by an administrative board, and the veterans court was in turn upheld by the Federal appeals court.
There were also these actions at the Court today:
 
Abortion Protests
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear an appeal by a group of organizations that oppose abortion, which were seeking a ruling that the Federal extortion law could not be the basis for a racketeering suit filed against them five years ago by two abortion clinics. The suit accuses the abortion opponents of conducting a campaign of intimidation against the clinics, which, the clinics said, amounts to a violation of the Federal racketeering law.
The long-running case reached the Court last year, producing a ruling that the Federal racketeering law does not require proof of an economic motive. The case, Scheidler v. Delaware Women's Health Organization, No. 94-716, is now back in Federal District Court in Chicago after an appeals court refused to dismiss it.
 
Search and Seizure
 The Court refused to hear an appeal by a man convicted of growing marijuana in his attic using a hydroponic process. The indoor garden, which required high-intensity lights and high temperatures, was found by a police helicopter equipped with a device that detects differences in heat. The device provided information that let the police get a search warrant and enter the home. The defendant argued that the use of the device was an illegal search, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction this year.

HEADLINE: Mailing Costs Go Up on Jan. 1

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The governing board of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously today to raise the price of mailing a first-class letter to 32 cents, beginning Jan. 1.
The increase, from 29 cents, is the first in four years and is below the 12.2 percent inflation rate for that period, said Sam Winters, chairman of the postal board. Rates for other classes of mail will also increase, with prices for second-class mail, like magazines and newspapers, and third-class advertising mail rising 14 percent. 
 The changes are expected to bring the Postal Service $4.7 billion in added income in 1995. The post office lost $914 million in the just-completed fiscal year and $1.7 billion the year before, prompting the independent Postal Rate Commission to approve the new rates in late November after nearly nine months of hearings.
Post offices will sell stamps picturing a flag and the letter G, with no price designation, until 32-cent stamps can be printed. The stamp can be used only for domestic mail.
For packages, parcel post rates will rise 18 percent, Priority Mail will increase 4.8 percent and Express Mail will be increased by 8 percent. Charges for international mail will also increase later this year, but the date and amounts have not been determined, postal officials said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senate Bill Would Slash Foreign Aid for Africa

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Senate Republican who is expected to have the most influence over foreign aid called today for slashing aid for Africa and population programs as well as cutting assistance everywhere except to the Middle East and Europe by about 20 percent.
In introducing a foreign aid bill, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is to become chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, proposed sweeping changes that would award assistance -- which totals $13.7 billion this year -- to countries based on whether such aid would advance America's security and economic interests. 
 On that basis, he took a harsh view of aid to Africa and proposed abolishing the Development Fund for Africa, which will provide $800 million in aid to that continent this year. He said he was not suggesting that African aid be eliminated, but rather that Africa could no longer expect an automatic annual entitlement of $800 million. From now on, he said, African nations would have to compete with other countries for a share of the smaller pool of foreign aid.
"We send money to countries where government policies actually defeat the prospects for real economic growth," he said. "It's in our interest to facilitate the transition to free markets, not to subsidize failures."
While Congress has allocated $450 million to hold down population growth overseas, the McConnell bill allocates nothing for that activity. But Mr. McConnell said he expected other lawmakers to add money for population programs during Congressional debate.
Lawmakers said the McConnell bill might win widespread support because it steers a middle course between Republicans who want to gut foreign aid and Republicans and Democrats who want to leave it largely intact. Mr. McConnell takes a kinder view of foreign aid than Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has likened it to throwing money down a "rathole."
Mr. Helms's committee is in charge of authorizing money for aid, but no foreign aid authorization bill has been enacted since 1986. That was one reason Mr. McConnell, whose subcommittee overseas aid appropriations, said he was taking the initiative.
His bill proposes eliminating the Agency for International Development and having the State Department administer aid itself. It also proposes moving the Peace Corps into the State Department.
"U.S. foreign aid must better serve U.S. foreign policy interests," he said. "Somehow along the way over the last 33 years of this program, the connection between U.S. aid and U.S. interests seems to have been lost."
Brian Atwood, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, defended his agency in a statement today, saying it has recently made reforms "that will save millions of tax dollars while delivering results for the American people."
Mr. McConnell, criticizing the Administration for having adopted a policy that favored Russia over other former Soviet republics, proposed ending that tilt by sending aid to three non-Russian republics: Georgia, Ukraine and Armenia. His bill would cut off aid to Russia, which is expected to be about $700 million next year, if its military intervenes in neighboring countries.
While aid to most countries would be cut, Mr. McConnell proposed a slight increase in aid to the Middle East, which would protect the $3 billion Israel received last year as well as the $2.1 billion for Egypt.

HEADLINE: Congress's Out-of-Work Try to Keep Smiling

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Bathed in light from the brushed gold chandelier of the spacious Ways and Means Committee hearing room, Eugene Pugliese tried to keep a sense of humor as he filled out applications for collecting unemployment in the temporary office of the District of Columbia's employment service.
"They ask you the name of your dependents, and I put down my daughters who are 7 and 9," said Mr. Pugliese, who has been a lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee for 15 years. "And then they ask you if they're physically able to work. I mean, work what? A paper route?" 
 Mr. Pugliese is among the thousands of staff members on Capitol Hill who lost their jobs in the Republican landslide last month.
In response, the District of Columbia on Friday opened the office in the committee hearing room on Capitol Hill to help staff members apply for unemployment benefits.
The majority of "Hill Rats" in the hearing room were staff members to the 37 incumbent House and Senate Democrats who were defeated. Others were on the staffs of the 28 caucuses or offices that Republicans have vowed to cut from the budget.
The employment service will offer 21 educational and preparatory sessions on applying for and collecting unemployment benefits as well as looking for new jobs.
Henry Belloso, who works for the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, spent Friday and today -- and plans to spend Tuesday -- handing out unemployment applications to the hundreds of middle-aged Congressional staff members who are now out of work.
Maggie Luca, the chief of staff for Representative Leslie L. Byrne, a Virginia Democrat who lost in November, sat alone at a round table waiting for yet another agent to call her number and review her forms.
"Part of you says, 'I'm not going to collect unemployment,' and another part of me says, 'Golly, it's my right,' " said Ms. Luca, the mother of three.
"I have never discussed collecting unemployment with anyone. It's very educational, to say the least."
Many of the applicants said they felt fully justified in collecting money from the Government because they had paid their taxes. "People paid into this fund," Mr. Pugliese said. "That's how they can justify this."
Still, he conceded that there was a stigma to collecting money. "Lawyers are not supposed to be sitting around collecting unemployment. It's not what you aspire to."
Margaret Taylor, who has worked at the District employment service for 26 years, said she anticipated that about 3,000 people would attend the 21 sessions to be held on the Hill. Ms. Taylor estimated that most of the applicants would be eligible for the highest payments, $335 a month for those who had earned more than $33,000 a year. The smallest unemployment payment is $13 a week.
As she walked past a blue velvet curtain, Denise Jefferson carried her month-old infant in one hand and unemployment forms in the other. Ms. Jefferson, 29, worked at the Office of the Doorkeeper before she went on maternity leave, but now she has no office to return to in two months, because the Republicans cut the office from the budget.
"It struck me -- the amount of people here -- and the lengths D.C. has gone to setting up an unemployment office here," Ms. Jefferson said.

Players Shrug And Dismiss The Owners' Latest Plan

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK, N.Y., Dec. 12

 BODY:
While members of the owners' negotiating committee roamed the hotel corridors promoting their new tax proposal today, union officials worked with their economists, studied the ramifications of the figures they produced and emerged with a different view.
"There is no significant difference in their proposal," Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said on the first day of the fifth month of the baseball strike. "It varies from their previous proposal in a very small degree. It still serves as a cap. They took all the things we thought would make the tax palatable and eliminated every single one of them." 
 Fehr did not go into detail; he had to meet with Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, who had just met with the owners' group. It was just after 6 P.M., and the two sides were 40 minutes away from meeting jointly for the first time today in full negotiating committees.
The owners were three days away from their meeting in Chicago at which they were expected to declare an impasse in negotiations and implement a salary cap. And the only thing that would keep them from that appointed round was a positive response from the players to their latest tax proposal.
From Fehr's characterization of the plan, it seemed obvious nothing positive would be forthcoming.
The two sides met for about three and a half hours, then broke for dinner and reconvened just before midnight and adjourned shortly after 1 A.M. on Tuesday. They planned to meet again later Tuesday morning. When they presented their plan on Sunday the owners asked for a response by tonight. But tonight they extended that deadline to Tuesday morning.
The players did not formally reject the owners' proposal, people who attended the first session said, but they made their feelings about it known, and the atmosphere was often contentious.
The owners' representatives, the people said, stated and kept restating their inability to understand why the players wouldn't view their proposal more favorably and negotiate toward an agreement.
The plan under discussion is one the owners presented Sunday as a counterproposal to the tax plan the players proposed Saturday. The tax rates in the owners' latest proposal appeared to be drastically different from the clubs' Nov. 17 tax proposal. But as one union official said after receiving the new plan, "It's designed to deceive people."
Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, who has long been viewed as the most moderate member of the owners' six-person committee, spoke glowingly of the new plan, which would begin with a 4.64 percent flat tax on all club payrolls, but would feature a secondary, over-the-threshold, cumulative tax that would serve as the critical cog in the owners' efforts to retard salaries.
"This tax may be about a third as onerous as the Nov. 17 tax," said McMorris, speaking to a group of reporters near the lobby of the Arrowwood resort and conference center. "As a broad base, it's literally 25 to 30 to 35 percent as much drag as what we previously had on the table."
McMorris readily acknowledged that the tax still would place a "drag" on salaries. "There's no question it's designed to put some drag on salaries; there's no deception to that," he said. "But it's to get the trend line moving toward a 50-50 share of our revenue. It doesn't act as a cap by any onerous stretch. As you look at the numbers -- I think their staff will agree -- we made a huge move in what our tax rates were."
But when Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, was told that McMorris assessed the proposal as being perhaps a fourth to a third as onerous as the previous plan, he said, "That view is not shared by our economists."
The owners' tax rates would change, one person familiar with the proposal said, depending on the difference between the amount the owners spend on player costs, including salaries and other items, and the amount that would be 50 percent of the clubs' total revenue. The salary-cap proposal calls for the players to receive 50 percent of the revenue, and that level is the owners' goal in the tax proposal.
The basic tax rate would vary each year, but for 1995, based on the clubs' 1994 projections, it would be 4.64 percent, and it would be assessed against each club's payroll.
If in any year the industry's total payroll exceeded 50 percent of revenue, the percentage by which it was in excess would be added the following year to the tax rate of clubs that are over the designated payroll threshold at the ratio of that extra percentage per every $10 million.
For example, if the Yankees had a $50 million payroll, the threshold payroll was $35 million and the industry expenditure was 2 percent over half of the clubs' revenue, the Yankees' tax rate would be 7.64 percent: the basic 4.64, 2 percent for the first $10 million over the threshold and 1 percent for the last $5 million over.
If the industry total again went beyond the 50 percent level the following year, the percentage of excess would be cumulative. It would be added to the previous year's excess, and that total would be added to the basic tax.
So if the Yankees, in the second year, again had a $50 million payroll, the threshold remained $35 million and the excess was 3 percent, their tax rate would be made up of the basic 4.64 percent, 5 percent for the first $10 million over the threshold and 2.5 percent for the other $5 million over for a total of 12.14 percent.
The owners proposed to generate $35 million from the tax. That money would be distributed to teams whose payrolls do not exceed the threshold. The clubs with the ratio of the highest revenues and lowest payrolls would especially benefit.
The union believes that the tax would act like a salary cap because it would prompt teams to remain at or below the threshold to avoid paying the tax. But Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves, in another hallway session with reporters, said: "Would there be teams that would elect to keep their payrolls high and pay the tax? I imagine there would be."
McMorris, meanwhile, said the clubs found much to like about the part of the players' proposal that dealt with a joint industry growth fund, to which each side would contribute $30 million for planning future endeavors, and the players' having input in various areas, such as expansion and television.
"I'm excited about having input from the players," the Rockies' owner said. "The way that's been presented I don't think we're going to have a big problem getting together in the governance area. We talked about it yesterday. It was a very positive discussion. I would presume if we could get some of the details worked out in the economics, the governance issues will not be an impediment to an agreement."

HEADLINE: U.N. Picks A Leader For Fight On AIDS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A Belgian scientist who has spent years studying AIDS in Africa was named today to head a new United Nations office that will coordinate efforts of six international organizations working on H.I.V.-AIDS research, treatment and prevention.
The scientist, Dr. Peter Piot, 45, has been associate director of the World Health Organization's global program on AIDS since 1992. Officials there said the head of that program, Michael Merson of the United States, was expected to resign shortly. 
 The W.H.O. program, along with projects sponsored by Unicef, Unesco, the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Bank, will be absorbed over the next year into the new office, still tentatively named the United Nations program on H.I.V./AIDS. It will be based at the World Health Organization's headquarters in Geneva. The task of consolidating diverse programs, often jealously guarded by agencies that devised them, will not be an easy one, officials here say.
Dr. Piot, who once said he would welcome the chance to convince the Pope that condoms saved lives, said today that "in a general climate not optimal for the moment on AIDS," he wanted to broaden research into economic and social aspects while mobilizing support for treatment.
"AIDS cannot become just another tropical disease," said Dr, Piot, who has been a leading organizer of a series of international conferences on AIDS. He has been an outspoken advocate of the rights of poor nations to organize their own responses to the AIDS epidemic and to avoid being used as testing grounds for experimental drugs.
More than 90 percent of cases occur in developing countries. Thailand, India and several African nations have high and still-growing rates of H.I.V. infection. The World Health Organization estimated in August that 17 million people worldwide were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and that 30 million to 40 million could be infected by 2000.
Dr. Piot said today that the new program on H.I.V./AIDS would coordinate money available from the six international organizations, whose programs would be streamlined to avoid overlap or competition. He said it was important to cooperate better at the national level to make the most efficient use of scant resources. He also said he would be looking for new sources of income.
"We need to go beyond traditional donors," he said. Then, referring to rich and poor nations, he said: "Funding will not just be from north to south. All countries affected should put in more resources."
Before joining W.H.O., Dr. Piot, a microbiologist who is an expert on infectious diseases, was head of the department of infection and immunity at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium.

HEADLINE: Executive Named at Kennedy To Lead Airport in Expansion

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The Port Authority yesterday turned to one its most experienced executives to manage Kennedy International Airport, at a time when the airport is undergoing major reconstruction and city officials are advocating turning it over to a private company.
Robert J. Kelly, 52, who began his career with the agency in 1970 as an economic analyst, took over as general manager of the airport's daily operation yesterday, officials said. He replaces Richard L. Rowe, who retired in June. 
 Mr. Kelly will be in charge of an airport with 800 employees and an annual budget of $200 million. More than 26.8 million passengers and 1.4 million tons of cargo have moved through the airport this year.
The airport is undergoing a $4.3 billion reconstruction to expand terminals and build new roads, a rail system between terminals and a new air traffic control tower.
Mr. Kelly's appointment comes three days after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed selling the city land under the airports or asking the Port Authority to turn their operation over to a private company.
New York City officials have been trying unsuccessfully to change the city's lease agreement with the Port Authority because they believe the city does not make enough profit from the current arrangement.
Mr. Kelly was appointed the manager of the Holland Tunnel in 1979, and two years later, took over managing the Port Authority Bus Terminal. In 1984, he became the first director of Transcom, a consortium of 19 regional transportation agencies that coordinates the highway and rail networks.
Mr. Kelly returned to the Port Authority in 1986 to head its Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals Department. In 1990, he was appointed the chief operations officer for the aviation department, overseeing Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports as well as two heliports.
Mr. Kelly said yesterday that his first goal would be "to make the airport as convenient and friendly as possible" through minor changes, like providing cleaner restrooms and better information for passengers. In the long run, he said, he would like to foster better cooperation between the authority and the airlines and to speed up transfers between international and domestic flights.

During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she did legal work for several New Deal agencies.
In later years, she had a private practice in labor law representing several large corporations, and was active in the Governors Task Force on Unemployment, the Council Against Poverty, Unesco and the International League of Human Rights.
Mrs. Poses and her husband, Jack I. Poses, were active in philanthropic undertakings, especially in the arts and education.
Mrs. Poses was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Hunter College in 1927. Her husband died in 1982.
In addition to her daughter, Ms. Kafka, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren and a brother, Abraham Shapiro, of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Smarting From Defeat, Democrats Meet and Decide Their Message Needs Sharpening

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Elected Democratic officials from throughout New York met here today to discuss the future of their battered party, and emerged saying they needed to sharpen the party's message to recover from the drubbing they took in this year's elections.
The meeting, called by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, was an effort to insure that elected officials play a major role in rebuilding a party that has been controlled by Democratic governors for the last 20 years. With George E. Pataki's defeat of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last month, the party finds itself without a designated leader and at least half a million dollars in debt. 
 The group, which met for a lengthy lunch at a restaurant in Albany, agreed to reconvene regularly, while breaking into committees to work on fund-raising, organization and developing a message.
Like many other self-help groups, the Democrats began by acknowledging that they have a problem, with some more willing than others to concede the party's failings.
"There was a surprising degree of consensus around the fact that the party really needs to stand for something, that we lost a lot of this in great measure because we don't have a message," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. "Our message is garbled, and we were beginning to be painted as the party of special interests and not the party of regular people."
Several officials at the meeting, including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said business people in the state perceive the Democrats as antagonistic to their interests, despite support for business tax cuts this year from Governor Cuomo and the Assembly, which has a Democratic majority.
"What I have said is we have to change our image to show that we're for economic growth and economic development and at the same time that we're a party that's committed to providing hope and opportunity for all of New York's citizens," Mr. McCall said.
Mark J. Green, the New York City Public Advocate, even expressed grudging admiration for the tactical skills of Representative Newt Gingrich, the next Republican Speaker of the House.
"While no one in this room much admires the principles of Newt Gingrich, we all admire his discipline and energy," Mr. Green said. "Democrats have been classically the party of brilliant individual political entrepreneurs who didn't relate to each other. This is the beginning of an effort to pool our talents, ideas and lists, one for all and all for one, and Democratic elected officials haven't done that."
Few of the 15 Democrats in attendance were ready to prescribe a new message or new strategy for the party. And the group, which included officials like Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan and Mayor Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo, deliberately avoided discussing potential candidates for the party chairmanship.
Some of those at the meeting emphasized that the victories by Mr. Pataki and Attorney General-elect Dennis C. Vacco did not necessarily signify the kind of electoral disaster that reverberates for a generation.
"This meeting of public officials is not an act of desperation by a party in disarray that has suffered a calamity," said New York City's Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. "We lost an election. It happens in 20-year cycles. It had as much to do with the delivery of message as it had to do with longevity on the part of our incumbent, who was a brilliant, brilliant Governor and history will treat very well."
Similarly, Mr. Silver said, "I don't think there was anything wrong with the agenda that we had in 1994. I think one thing that was clear was that the message, the way that we delivered the message to the voters, needs refining."

HEADLINE: In Suffolk, Less of a Sanctuary for Salvadorans

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRENTWOOD, L.I.,

 BODY:
Nine years ago, at the height of the civil war in El Salvador, Suffolk County took the bold step of joining a few dozen communities in the United States that voted to protect Central American refugees by barring public officials from reporting them to immigration authorities.
For a staid suburban region far removed from the war and with few Salvadoran residents, it was an unusual move, but one that County Legislator Gregory J. Blass said was the "humane thing to do." 
 After a decade of migration to Long Island by Salvadorans, however, Suffolk is sending a revised message. The ordinance protecting refugees was repealed last year.
And this summer, months before the passage of California's anti-illegal immigrant measure, Proposition 187, the County Legislature overwhelmingly approved a resolution asking the state for permission to deny health care and welfare benefits not just to illegal immigrants, but even to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens. They called the measure the America First Welfare Reduction Program.
"When resources become limited, government has to cut back somewhere," said Mr. Blass, a Republican of Jamesport. "It's harsh, but you have to prioritize."
The state refused to grant Suffolk County's request. But the passage of the America First resolution underscores the recent extension of the immigration debate beyond traditional havens to suburban and rural areas newly dotted with new immigrant communities.
From Palisades Park, N.J., where the arrival of Hispanic immigrants has prompted ordinances on loitering and overcrowded housing, to the suburban Los Angeles communities of Monterey Park and Alhambra, where clashes over development and culture followed the arrival of thousands of affluent Chinese, communities that once considered themselves insulated from urban dilemmas have found themselves grappling with a changing world.
The controversy on Long Island has focused on the thousands of Central Americans who began settling in the area in the early 1980's, drawn not by the county's haven resolution, but by jobs in factories and farms.
Before the outbreak of the civil war in El Salvador in 1979, about 5,000 Salvadorans lived on Long Island. By 1990, there were between 30,000 and 40,000. Refugee workers estimate that up to two-thirds may be in the country illegally.
The Salvadorans represent fewer than 2 percent of the 2.6 million people on Long Island, but their presence is keenly felt in the towns where most of them live -- Hempstead, Glen Cove and Brentwood.
"You walk through the schoolyard and all there is is Salvadorans," said Hank Mastermaker, who has lived in Brentwood for 31 years. "It's too many in one area. They buy a house and the next thing you know, six families have moved in."
Many of the Central Americans remain unaware of the debate over their presence. A decade ago, they never knew that they were being welcomed, except as a source of cheap labor. Today, few have any idea that they are being scorned.
Rosa Fuentes, a factory worker at Austin Sculpture in Holbrook, said she spends all her time working and rarely has any contact with Americans. "I don't have time to worry about those things," she said during a break from her job.
Many longtime residents voice discomfort over changes that they never expected in their suburban enclaves. Mary Crotty, of Brentwood, said that stores she used to frequent had closed and reopened with Spanish signs.
"It's a shame," she said. "It makes me feel a little uncomfortable, like I'm a person they're not welcoming in. I don't care where a person is from. I'd feel the same if all the signs were in Greek."
The Rev. John Long, a Presbyterian minister who was one of the leaders of the sanctuary movement in 1986, said he could never have foreseen the resentment that has built over the years after the vote.
"This was our effort to make Suffolk a sanctuary county," he said. "It was a pretty provocative stance."
But Suffolk has grown more conservative in the last decade. The America First resolution is one of several initiatives that undo or contradict its past progressive stances.
"We've had a recession and everyone is grabbing onto their little piece of the pie," said the legislature's minority leader, Maxine S. Postal, Democrat of Amityville, who abstained in the vote on the America First resolution. "The feeling now is that everyone has to guard what they have. Forget about building bridges; we're building walls."

HEADLINE: At Jaguar, Spit and Polish for the Balance Sheet

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COVENTRY, England

 BODY:
They were madly painting and polishing at the Jaguar Cars plant here one recent day, making the place sparkle for a visit from a loyal customer, Queen Elizabeth II.
But the changes at Jaguar of late have been more than cosmetic. After nearly five years in which it has posted nothing but operating losses -- and made its parent company, the Ford Motor Company, look foolish for having paid $2.5 billion to acquire it in 1989 -- Jaguar appears on track to reap something more than a visit from the Queen: a profit. 
 The turnaround has not come easily. The inefficiency and sloppiness of Jaguar's manufacturing were far worse than Ford had expected when it bought the company, and the amount of money and time needed to set things right far greater.
Ford has sunk more than $4 billion into Jaguar, including the purchase price, accumulated losses of more than $1.2 billion, capital injections and a $320 million investment in a newly introduced update of its XJ sedan, the backbone of Jaguar's product line.
The survival plan required wholesale changes in manufacturing and labor relations to cut costs and improve quality that had sunk to abysmal levels. (The favorite bumper sticker of disgruntled Jaguar owners: "The parts falling from this car are of the finest British craftsmanship.")
Despite slashing 6,000 jobs from its work force of 12,700 during the last four years, Jaguar will have a struggle convincing Ford that Britain is the most efficient place in which to build the next generation Jaguar, a higher volume, less expensive sedan expected to go into production by the end of the decade. But the progress so far has provided a clear shot at long-term survival for the luxury-car maker, which company executives say is Britain's largest single exporter.
Barring some unexpected foul-up, Jaguar should post a profit in the three months ending on Dec. 31, its first positive quarterly result in more than four years, following the economic recoveries in Britain and the United States and the introduction this fall of the restyled XJ sedan.
Sales next year are projected to exceed 38,000, up from about 31,000 this year and 28,000 last year, but well below the peak of 49,500 in 1988. Analysts are expecting a modest profit next year, though it remains unclear how Ford will recoup its investment.
"We've come an awful long way," said Nicholas V. Scheele, a Ford executive who is chairman of Jaguar. "We're not on track until we're showing black numbers at the end of a full year. But clearly the path is looking easier now than it was two years ago."
Ford's strategy has been to retain as much of the Jaguar heritage and mystique as possible, but to impose Ford's expertise in manufacturing efficiency, quality control and information management on a company that had come to represent all that went wrong with British industry.
"We drove in systems and procedures that had been proven throughout the world by the Ford Motor Company," said David Hudson, Jaguar's plant director. "Since the acquisition, in terms of manufacturing, we've been through a revolution."
The revolution was built on the same tactics used by automotive companies worldwide: investing in more efficient machinery, and pushing more responsibility down to the workers on the production line.
Before the acquisition by Ford, Jaguar had been a bastion of hard-core unions whose members worked to strict rules on what they would and would not do, and when. Work stoppages cost the plant a half day of working time a week.
"The relationship between management and the trade unions has not historically been, shall we say, best in class," Mr. Hudson said.
Ford negotiated a complete overhaul of the relationship, throwing out most of the old work rules and giving workers far more say in the way the cars were built. The old quality system, in which work was checked by inspectors, was scrapped in favor of a system in which workers signed off on each task and were encouraged to point out problems.
There are still some labor problems. Workers have been balking at management's plan to impose voluntary overtime, for example. But there has been only one work stoppage since 1990.
"Since the change, the lads are more committed to their jobs," said Dave Allen, a team leader. "If you're picking up faults and someone is listening to you, it's worthwhile."
To some extent, the work force has been motivated by the knowledge that the proposed smaller car -- considered by analysts to be the most important project at Jaguar in decades -- could well be built in the United States, Europe or even Japan.
Ford is not yet close to a decision on where to build the car or even whether to build it. But in Coventry, the work force and managers are aware that competitors, including Mercedes-Benz and BMW are preparing to build cars in the United States. Ford is even reportedly considering building the new Jaguar at a Mazda plant in Japan.
"You could build a Jaguar in many places around the world," Mr. Scheele said. "All of us recognize reality. The world does not owe us a living and Ford does not owe us investment."
So far, the signs at Coventry are encouraging. The number of employee hours needed to produce one car has been slashed in half in the last five years, to about 100. That is about five times that of a Toyota, but Jaguar does things like woodwork by hand.
Perhaps most important, the product itself -- Jaguar makes the XJ sedan series and the XJS sports car -- shows every sign of being much improved. Traditional problems areas like Jaguar's electronics have received special attention, including more sophisticated testing.
As a result, Jaguar's standing in the customer satisfaction survey conducted in the United States by J. D. Power & Associates, the consulting firm, has risen sharply during the last few years.
Jaguar now ranks 10th in the J. D. Power study, which measures consumers' satisfaction with product quality and dealer service after one year of ownership, up from 25th a few years ago. With a score of 143 in the 1994 survey compared with an industry average of 135, Jaguar still lags well behind Lexus, which had a score of 176, but ahead of Mercedes, at 141, and BMW at 138.
For now, Jaguar's performance rests with the updated XJ sedan series, which starts at about $53,000. It has been given a more rounded style, reminiscent of the Jaguars of old, and many of its systems have been completely overhauled.
"The changes they've made are just what they needed as a kind of holding action until they can introduce a new, smaller Jaguar that can be built in higher volume," said Karl Ludvigsen, an auto industry consultant in London.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases on Concerns Over a Delay in a Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar eased against most leading currencies yesterday on concerns that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates again until January.
Some currency dealers had expected the Fed to raise rates when its policy-making committee meets a week from today. But comments by the central bank's two top officials indicated last week that the Fed would not move until January or early February. The officials, Alan Greenspan and Alan S. Blinder, said they wanted to see economic reports that would not be issued until January. 
 Dealers' dashed hopes for a December increase in rates was "putting downward pressure on the dollar," said Richard Coss, vice president at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The dollar has benefited recently from expectations that American short-term interest rates would continue to climb against foreign rates. Higher rates in the United States tend to strengthen the dollar by attracting capital from foreign markets.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar eased to 99.96 Japanese yen from 100.11 yen on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.5725 German marks, from 1.5770 marks on Friday, and to 1.3315 Swiss francs from 1.3370 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5658, from $1.5595 on Friday.
In other currency trading, the Italian lira was weaker on speculation that the Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi might be headed for collapse. A key member of Mr. Berlusconi's Cabinet said yesterday that the formation of a new government was more likely.
Traders said the minister's remarks touched off a wave of selling, sending the lira to a record low of 1,038.50 against the German mark. The dollar, meanwhile, rose to 1,636.50 lire, from 1,631 on Friday.
The lira has been under pressure since the leading figure in Italy's anti-corruption drive, Antonio Di Pietro, a Milan magistrate, resigned last week. Yesterday, one of Italy's top judges resigned.
The Canadian dollar continued to weaken, falling to a four-month low against the United States dollar. The Canadian dollar fell as low as 72.06 United States cents, its lowest level since Aug. 5. It was last quoted at 72.10 United States cents, down from 72.27 cents on Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Glass Makers in Tokyo Accord

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it had finally reached an agreement with Tokyo to assure American companies access to Japan's flat-glass market, long dominated by a cartel and one of the most closed industries in Japan.
Even Japan's own Fair Trade Commission has denounced the Japanese glass industry, a constant source of friction over several years of trade negotiations, as an example of a distribution system that locks out foreign competition and keeps prices artificially high. Three Japanese makers account for 95 percent of the market -- and one company, Asahi Glass, controls about half of all sales. 
 The agreement, reached on Friday, three months after the two countries agreed in principle to resolve the problem, does not call for any specific import targets to be reached. But Tokyo did agree to issue detailed annual reports on the extent to which Japanese glass distributors sell imported flat glass made by companies other than their own American subsidiaries. The three Japanese concerns are also required to notify their distributors -- which are largely owned, in many cases, by the companies themselves -- that they must carry glass products without regard to the corporate heritage of the supplier.
The Government has also agreed to promote the use of insulated and safety glass, a major concession because almost no double-paned glass is used in Japan, despite the country's insistence on other forms of energy conservation.
Aides to Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said that the agreement set an important precedent. The Japanese Government, for the first time, has agreed to monitor a "keiretsu," or a grouping of Japanese companies that hold one another's stock and chiefly buy one another's products, to assure that outside concerns are not discriminated against.
That will benefit foreign suppliers, but it may also help Japanese companies to break through the invisible walls that benefit keiretsu companies and squeeze many of their domestic competitors out of the market.
American companies welcomed the agreement. "We think this will finally give us a chance to use our competitive edge," said Ralph Gerson, the president of the Guardian International Corporation, a subsidiary of Guardian Industries in Northville, Mich. Guardian opened warehouses in Japan and marketed its glass there for five years, but so far it commands only a quarter of a percentage point of the market.
"This will open up the process," said Mr. Gerson, who is politically well connected in Washington and succeeded in raising the glass issue high on the agenda of American trade negotiators. "People will know what is going on in that market, and it won't be a pretty picture."
Mr. Kantor, who said the "agreement meets all our goals," also insisted that it includes "solid objective criteria with which to judge the results."
But those "criteria" do not include the numerical targets for foreign penetration of the Japanese market that have long been an arguing point between Washington and Tokyo. Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, took credit for preventing the inclusion of specific targets. Mr. Hashimoto, a perennial candidate for Prime Minister, would be hurt by any indication that he was giving in to American demands to "manage" the economy.
About $4.5 billion in flat glass is sold in Japan every year, making it the second-largest such market in the world. The market share held by each of the glass companies in Japan has hardly budged in three decades. Glass prices remain well above world levels: Purchasing the glass to frame a small picture in Tokyo can easily cost $25 or more. .
More important, there has been little innovation in the industry. Though used in office towers, insulated glass is rarely found in homes. Japanese negotiators often argued that Japan is a temperate country and that Japanese people favor open windows that let in the breeze rather than air-conditioning. But the archipelago stretches from northern Hokkaido, where huge amounts of snow pile up, to Okinawa, which has a year-round tropical climate.
"It's not an argument," Mr. Gerson said, "as much as an excuse."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Drop In Advance of Inflation Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell lower yesterday as investors and traders grew concerned that economic reports this week will suggest that interest rates have not risen high enough to keep inflation from accelerating.
Traders also attributed early weakness in the market to selling prompted by President Clinton's comments on Sunday that he might back a middle-class tax cut. The bond market fears a tax cut would undermine prices by stimulating the economy and swelling the budget deficit. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 22/32 , to 957/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.92 percent, from 7.86 percent on Friday.
In the municipal market, where there was lingering concern about the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., yields pretty much tracked the rising rates of the benchmark Government securities.
Municipal bond prices were down an average of a quarter-point to a half-point in trading that reflected a lack of confidence in the market and apprehension of the next move by the Federal Reserve. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues rose to 7.06 percent, from 7.04 percent on Friday.
Some traders expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets next Tuesday. They say the market has already priced in an increase of 50 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
But many Fed watchers see only a modest chance of a rate increase before January. That view was strengthened by comments from the Fed's top two officials last week that suggested the Fed would not be prepared to raise rates before January. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder indicated that they wanted to see economic data that would not be available until January.
The market took a beating in the morning, as buyers held back ahead of today's producer price numbers and tomorrow's consumer price data. Retail sales are also due today. The week includes reports on industrial production and capacity utilization, business inventories, housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed's survey of business activity.
Analysts expect producer prices to show gains of four-tenths of 1 percent for November in both the overall index and the so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.
Economists note that the Producer Price Index has been restrained in the face of this year's higher prices for crude and intermediate goods, and the market will be sensitive to evidence that these are being passed through to the finished-goods level. Analysts expect a seasonal decline in the tobacco component of the index to offset a similar rise in prices for passenger cars.
Traders said that the long end of the market did not fare so well amid talk of middle-class tax cuts, fearing that any spending cuts to pay for them will not be enough, thus leading to a bigger Federal budget deficit and higher interest rates.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $27.2 billion in new three- and six-month bills at rates that were lower than than those auctioned last week. The average rate for a three-month issue was 5.76 percent, down 7 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month issue was down 1 basis point, to 6.32 percent.
The following are the results of the Treasury's auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.544	96.805	Discounted Rate	5.76%	6.32%	Coupon Yield	5.93%	6.62%	High Price	98.547	96.810	Discounted Rate	5.75%	6.31%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.61%	Low Price	98.544	96.805	Discounted Rate	5.76%	6.32%	Coupon Yield	5.93%	6.62%	Accepted at low price	92%	86%	Total applied for	$48,063,334	$51,101,003	Accepted	$13,654,730	$13,653,563	Noncompetitive	$1,572,374	$1,372,753

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
National Gypsum Spurns a Bid

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The National Gypsum Company turned down a takeover offer from a group led by its nonexecutive chairman yesterday, saying the $940 million bid, worth $43.50 a share, was too low.
The response from National Gypsum, the nation's second-largest maker of gypsum-coated wallboard, which is used mainly in houses, came less than a month after C. D. Spangler Jr., the North Carolina investor who is also the company's largest shareholder, made his offer. 
 Delcor Inc., a Spangler family investment company, began buying shares in National Gypsum about a year ago, and now holds a stake of around 19 percent.
The Delcor offer was considered by a four-member special committee of the company's board, along with Smith Barney, National Gypsum's financial adviser.
In a letter delivered to Mr. Spangler, the special committee said it had concluded that "a sale of the company at this time is not in the best interests of all the stockholders of the company, and we cannot recommend that the company pursue or support a transaction with Delcor on the terms contained in the Nov. 15 offer."
Though he holds the title of chairman, Mr. Spangler does not participate in operating decisions at National Gypsum. Mr. Spangler declined to comment on the board's decision.
Based in Charlotte, N.C., National Gypsum trails only the USG Corporation in the manufacture of wallboard. Last year the company posted sales of $511 million.
Analysts had predicted the bid would be rejected, saying the price offered was far too low, even though when National Gypsum emerged from bankruptcy in July 1993 it was valued at $12.50 a share.
"When they were coming out of bankruptcy, most of our clients were still talking about the economy as still in recession," said Barbara Allen, an analyst who follows the housing industry for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "And the industry as a whole did not become profitable until the first quarter of this year."
Ms. Allen said that based on anticipated 1995 earnings, the company is worth around $60 to $65 a share.
Despite steadily rising earnings this year, fears about the impact of rising interest rates on the housing industry had pushed National Gypsum's stock down by nearly 40 percent before Delcor's bid.
In Nasdaq trading yesterday, the stock closed at $39.875 a share, down 87.5 cents. In the last year, the stock has traded as high as $52.75 a share.
Ms. Allen and other analysts said they regarded the offer from Mr. Spangler's group as an opening thrust in what could turn into a bidding war. Indeed, National Gypsum officials said they would consider other offers.
"The board has completed its work as far as that offer is concerned," said Alan V. Cecil, a National Gypsum spokesman. "But the committee certainly views it to be in the obligation of shareholders to consider any legitimate offer."

HEADLINE: States Win in Ruling On Taxation of Interest

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
In a victory for state treasuries, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that states may tax the interest earned from repurchase agreements involving Federal securities.
States are barred by Federal law from taxing interest income on Federal notes and bonds. But states have contended that the law does not apply to repurchase agreements, a financing arrangement in which the security serves as collateral for a loan, because the income from such an agreement reflects not the interest rate on the underlying security but rather the premium that the borrower has agreed to pay to get the security back. 
 The Court agreed today in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, who said that the income from a repurchase agreement involving a Government security was interest on a loan between private parties, not interest on an "obligation of the United States Government."
Since all states already treat this income as subject to state taxation, the decision essentially reaffirmed the status quo. The Nebraska Supreme Court, however, ruled earlier this year that the state could not tax the income received by shareholders in mutual funds that participate in repurchase agreements involving Federal securities. The Court's decision today overturned that ruling. Six other state high courts have recently ruled that the income could be taxed.
The case was of particular interest to the mutual fund industry. Under earlier court decisions, mutual fund dividends attributable to direct investments in Federal securities cannot be taxed by the states. Mutual funds providing tax-free income have been popular investments, and the industry was concerned that a decision in this case might erode the general principle of tax exemption.
The Court, however, made it clear today that it was not revisiting the general issue but was addressing only the taxability of income from repurchase agreements. The Nebraska investor who brought the case, John Loewenstein, owned shares in two mutual funds, the Trust for Short-Term U.S. Government Securities and the Trust for U.S. Treasury Obligations, that participated in repurchase agreements.
Although repurchase agreements were used in Orange County, Calif., the tax issue before the Court was unrelated to the county's problems. Repurchase agreements, known as repos, were part of the county's highly leveraged investment portfolio and contributed to its fiscal collapse last week.
The decision today was Nebraska v. Loewenstein, No. 93-823.

HEADLINE: No End to Growth;
People Are Spending With Abandon And U.S. Goods Are Selling Overseas

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The economic recovery, like the Energizer Bunny, just keeps going and going. In spite of tax increases, sharp rises in interest rates this year and widespread skepticism that Washington will be able to put its fiscal house in order, rapid growth continues unabated. Unemployment has dropped to its lowest level in four years.
Indeed, as the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress last week, "there is very little evidence throughout this economy of any degree of slowdown." Mr. Greenspan, who only a little more than a year ago was complaining of powerful forces holding back the economy, added that "the 50-mile-an-hour headwinds have disappeared" and that the real worry today is inflation. 
 What is powering this juggernaut? Why were most forecasters, who as recently as this summer were predicting a much leaner expansion and higher unemployment, so far off target? Most important, can the good times last?
Two explanations for the unexpected boom stand out.
For one, many consumers -- who as recently as last year were mostly worried about keeping their jobs -- are spending with abandon. Now, with about three million jobs added to the economy this year, some of the anxiety about employment prospects has eased. And disposable income, after falling for several years running, shows signs of starting to turn up. The result? "Big-ticket buying has blown through every benchmark," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
Even more important, America's trading partners are coming out of their own recessions -- and the surprisingly weak dollar has made American goods an irresistible bargain on world markets. "Exports explain the difference between an O.K. recovery and a blockbuster," said Robert Mellman, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust.
As recently as this summer, most forecasters were predicting that unemployment would bottom out at 6 percent in the fall and economic growth would slip below 2 percent in the last quarter of 1994. Instead, unemployment is down to 5.6 percent and fourth-quarter growth is now expected to exceed 4 percent.
But can the good times keep rolling on? The forecasters' coin has certainly been debased in the last year. Nonetheless, predictions of a slowdown in 1995 and perhaps even a recession in 1996 should be taken very seriously.
This year's rapid growth proved even more surprising because the same forecasters who expected only modest gains also assumed that interest rates would be one and a half percentage points lower than today's figures. With six rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year, why has the gain in jobs and output picked up rather than slowed?
There are a variety of reasons, from more aggressive lending by banks to the long lags between tighter money and reduced investment. But that in itself is hardly an explanation for how the economy came to be so hot. And here, economists generally agree that the surge in output and employment was largely fueled by strong buying both at home and abroad of America's increasingly competitive goods and services.
Consumers did more than their share, in large part because millions of homeowners fattened their wallets in recent years by refinancing mortgages to cut their monthly payments. Another key factor, said Richard F. Hokenson, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, is that exceptionally large numbers of Americans are in their mid-20's, a stage of life in which households are formed at a rapid pace and credit-card bills are run up to the top.
All this helped generate a boom in autos, appliances and consumer electronics that exceeds the typical rebound in sales after a relatively mild recession. More generally, consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, a New York business research group, is higher than it has been since the economic downturn that began in 1990.
Consumers have a more optimistic sense of their improving prospects, Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley suggested, than those gloom and doomers who focus on the stagnation of wages rather than the steady increase in jobs. And they are plainly tired of postponing the pleasures of the good life, like Jeep Grand Cherokees and Apple Macintosh Power Books. "They're just gritting their teeth and going shopping," he said.
The less widely heralded kick to economic growth is exports. Merchandise exports constitute roughly 10 percent of overall output. With merchandise exports now growing at a remarkable 15 percent annual pace, Mr. Mellman of Morgan Guaranty pointed out, the export boom is contributing one and a half percentage points to the overall economic growth rate of about 4 percent.
Some growth for American exports was expected as the big industrial economies climbed out of recession. But the early exit from the downturn and the rapid pace of economic growth in Europe and Canada, averaging more than 3 percent, has far exceeded consensus forecasts.
Growth in global demand for everything from forks to fork lifts does not, however, guarantee that the foreign buyers will buy American. Price matters as well as quality and availability. And in the last year, American exporters have been blessed by a weak dollar that has helped make increasingly productive United States manufacturers even more cost competitive versus their European and Japanese counterparts.
But even though the expansion should continue next year, its best times may be about to end.
While exports should keep rising, it would take exceptional circumstances to match the current pace of export growth. After all, the coincidence of rapid economic advancement abroad and a weakening dollar is not likely to continue. Indeed, the dollar has already started to regain some of its lost ground.
Then, too, with factories approaching capacity and employers scratching harder to find qualified workers, sustaining strong growth without a significant increase in cost-driven inflation should prove difficult to achieve, if not impossible. In fact, most economists believe the economy is now operating so close to capacity that further increases in demand will largely translate into higher prices, rather than higher output.
Most important, the Federal Reserve's swing toward tight money in 1994 is most likely to be felt in 1995. And if rapid growth continues into next year, the Fed would feel even more compelled to respond to accumulating evidence of an economy pushing past its productive limits.
That makes the risk of a crash landing later on even greater. "The lags in monetary policy are so long," said Van Doorn Ooms, an economist with the Committee for Economic Development, "that we almost inevitably overshoot."

HEADLINE: Entitlement Bungling

 BODY:
The bipartisan commission on entitlements is heading for failure. It is scheduled to meet tomorrow for the last time to vote on a plan by its chairmen -- Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth -- to cut Federal spending by enough to keep the deficit from claiming a larger share of the economy over the next 35 years. That is the right goal. But their proposed solution is misguided, and has no chance of garnering enough votes.
The failure is sobering. Mr. Kerrey is right that entitlements, programs like Social Security and Medicare for which spending is driven by formula rather than annual decisions by Congress, pose a huge budget problem. They, along with interest payments, are expected to account for over 70 percent of Federal spending by the year 2003, leaving crumbs for everything else. Addressed now, the solutions need not be onerous. Left to fester, they could prove horrific. But as Mr. Kerrey observes, Washington displays little stomach for tackling a problem that will not bite soon. 
 The President and the chairmen made a difficult task harder still. The commissioners possess little expertise or strong ties to the White House or Congressional leaders. Politicians on the commission refused to discuss hard choices in public, especially before the elections. They were, quite properly, not allowed by law to formulate policy in private. The chairmen compounded problems by delivering their plan last week -- in effect telling commissioners to vote on politically charged ideas that they do not understand and for which no consensus has been built.
The Kerrey-Danforth plan would control deficits. But it would do so with unnecessarily Draconian cuts in Social Security. Robert Ball, a former commissioner of Social Security, estimates that the plan would reduce benefits of the average wage-earner by over 40 percent; he estimates that it would take only a 15 percent benefit cut to bring Social Security into long-term balance.
The plan also proposes to begin privatizing Social Security -- replacing the Government tax with mandatory contributions by individuals to personal savings accounts. The idea is revolutionary. But it would be prohibitively expensive to set up and serves no important economic purpose. It borders on the bizarre that the chairmen would spring this controversial idea on the commission with virtually no discussion.
Parts of the Kerrey-Danforth plan make good sense. Modestly raising the retirement age for Social Security and limiting the tax deduction for employer-paid health insurance are sound ways to save money (though savings from the tax cap would be better spent to subsidize health coverage of uninsured families than to reduce the deficit). The best outcome of tomorrow's vote would be for the commission to adopt good ideas that the chairmen have identified, even if they do not add up to the full solution Mr. Kerrey desperately sought.
The shutdown of the commission also casts doubt on President Clinton's renewed flirtation with a middle-class tax cut. It would be hugely expensive, since both parties are almost certain to include in the middle class for this purpose nearly every American. The Republicans promise to give families a $500-a-child tax credit, costing about $20 billion a year. Mr. Clinton may start off with half that much. The catch is that under current law, Congress must offset tax cuts with cuts in entitlement spending. So even if Mr. Clinton gets by with half a loaf, he will have raised the crossbar that Mr. Kerrey could not clear by $10 billion a year.
If Democrats and Republicans engage in a tax-cutting frenzy, the outcome will be hypocritical or vicious. It will be hypocritical if the cuts force Congress to make up the loss by hitting Medicare and Social Security, middle-class benefits. It will be vicious if Congress also turns, as it surely must, on welfare, housing subsidies and job training that go primarily to the poor.

ARBY'S PARENT IS NOT BUYING LONG JOHN SILVER'S

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Citing higher interest rates, the Triarc Companies, parent of Arby's roast beef restaurant chain, called off a planned purchase of Long John Silver's seafood restaurants. Triarc's plan to buy Long John Silver's, based in Lexington, Ky., for $525 million would have created the sixth-biggest fast-food company in the country. Nelson Peltz, chairman of Triarc, said the proposed merger was grounded because "the higher interest rate environment and difficult capital markets resulted in significantly higher costs and unacceptable terms of financing." Long John Silver's operates 1,456 restaurants. Arby's operates more than 2,700 restaurants worldwide.

HEADLINE: Orange County to Gradually Sell Fund in Effort to Limit Its Losses

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Orange County said today that it would sell all the holdings in its investment fund in an effort to minimize further losses, setting off a scramble among local governments and agencies in the fund to recover as much of their money as possible.
The fund now faces a 27 percent loss, or $2.02 billion, nearly one-third more than estimated two weeks ago, and the loss could grow -- especially if the Federal Reserve decides to raise short-term interest rates in the near future. 
 The fund essentially has lost money because it borrowed heavily and made big bets that interest rates would fall, not rise.
Orange County's announcement closes a chapter in the story of an investment fund whose dramatic losses forced the county to declare bankruptcy last week, the largest county ever to do so.
As financial advisers for the fund began talking to Wall Street firms about selling the holdings, more than 180 of its investors -- including cities, agencies and school districts -- stepped up their battles to get back their money, totaling $7.4 billion. [Page D1.]
The financial team advising the county may ask all investors to share the loss equally. But school districts are already demanding that they get back all their money because they were required by state law to keep their money in the county's fund.
In the meantime, these investors must decide what cuts to make in local programs to cover whatever losses they end up facing. Many have already suspended expansion projects and new hiring. They have also begun to press harder to get those who owe them money to pay their bills.
Payrolls continued to be met today, but some suppliers have asked local agencies with money in the fund to pay on delivery of goods.
Thomas W. Hayes, the former California state treasurer appointed by the county to fix the fund's problems, stressed that the liquidation of its holdings "will not be a fire sale," but "an orderly restructuring to eliminate interest-rate risks and reduce the average maturity of the portfolio." Mr. Hayes said it would take about 90 days to liquidate the fund.
The cash from the sale of the assets, he said, would be invested conservatively and without the large-scale borrowing and risky financial instruments known as derivatives that led to the heavy losses.
After days of closed-door meetings and complex numerical calculations, the new financial team, which includes Mr. Hayes and William Rifkin, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, gave its first status report in public today to the county Board of Supervisors.
The driving force behind the decision to sell the holdings was the threat of rising interest rates compounding the losses. Salomon Brothers, which has as many as 30 people working on the project, estimated that the fund would lose $300 million for each rise of one percentage point in short-term rates. The firm said that Government figures due out this week -- including those on consumer prices, retail sales and factory use -- could help encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the seventh time this year.
While the financial advisers said the fund could be partly protected from a rise in rates, selling the assets was still important because the county and its other investors needed cash in the next 90 days.
"A $2 billion loss is extremely serious," said Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer. "We're getting our arms around what this loss means in terms of belt tightening." Mr. Bennett, of the Los Angeles firm of Stutman, Treister & Glatt, said the first priority was getting the losses in the portfolio under control.
The fund disclosed losses of $1.5 billion a week ago. The county had borrowed nearly $13 billion from Wall Street firms against the $7.4 billion provided by the funds' investors, so that the investment pool totaled more than $20 billion.
Mr. Rifkin said Salomon Brothers had already "approached Wall Street firms" about selling the fund's assets and "has been encouraged by their interest." Among the firms said to be considering such bids were J. P. Morgan & Company. A J. P. Morgan spokesman declined to comment today.
Such a firm would profit by selling the various bonds in the portfolio for more than it paid. Orange County may still be better off selling the bonds all at once because the market would be depressed over time if it sold them slowly. A global firm like Morgan can try to dodge such market risk by seeking far-flung buyers for the various securities.
The most difficult aspect for a brokerage firm or bank in making such a bid would be dealing with Orange County's investments in what are known as structured notes, traders said. In the current market, with its rising short-term interest rates, there are few buyers for such bonds, which are intended to profit from sharp declines in rates.
Therefore, bond dealers are looking to combine those notes along with other kinds of investments that will make up a more appealing package and enable the firm to profit on the sale. The firm that will bid the most will be the one that has the most confidence in its ability to actually sell these notes, traders said.
More than half of the portfolio has already been liquidated. Through what are known as reverse repurchase agreements, about 15 Wall Street brokerage firms lent the county more than $13 billion and took as collateral fixed-income securities that Orange County owned.
The county was forced into bankruptcy a week ago when it defaulted on one of those loans from CS First Boston, which in turn sold its $2.1 billion in collateral. Fourteen other brokerages have since sold most of the rest of the collateral. But Merrill Lynch, which has dealt with Orange County for 20 years, has chosen to keep its $2.5 billion in collateral.
Mr. Rifkin said today that the county had lost $1.3 billion on these sales. The remaining losses that bring the total to $2.02 billion are expected to occur when the portfolio is in fact sold.
Apart from the $12 billion in liquidated collateral and Merrill's $2.5 billion, the fund has about $5.4 billion in assets. Mr. Rifkin said 40 percent of that was in conventional securities like fixed-rate debt, where the market value has declined roughly 4.4 percent. The rest is in derivatives, whose performance is tied to an underlying asset like bonds, where values have fallen 10 percent.
The county's advisers said today that meetings with the fund's top 11 investors -- who contributed 90 percent of the $7.4 billion -- were continuing in an effort to determine their needs for cash.
Fund investors said the advisers had told them that the $230 million in cash now in the fund would be sufficient to meet the most pressing needs of the top investors for the immediate future. Beyond that comment, there were no new answers on how the county would offset the losses and what services might be cut.
Late today, the Federal Bankruptcy Court here approved the fund advisers' request to sell the assets. The approval was considered routine because under a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which governs municipalities, the court may not interfere with a debtor's revenue or property. The court has limited authority, mostly to approve the plan for coming out of bankruptcy.
And in a related matter, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and a member of the Banking Committee, cited the Orange County situation today. She called on the new Republican Congressional leadership to reconsider the Contract with America proposals to be put before the next Congress on retroactively changing the nation's securities-litigation process by raising the legal standard for proving fraud.
"If the contract language is enacted," Senator Boxer argued, "municipal bond investors, private investors and even the Orange County fund itself would find it more difficult to sue successfully. The contract would do great injustice to the investing public."

HEADLINE: Modest Cuts At High Cost

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Republicans have their proposal for a middle-class tax cut. Not to be one-upped, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, offered his plan today. President Clinton will probably put forward his own tax cut for the middle class in a speech on Thursday night.
The proposals have these things in common: They are frightfully expensive in terms of what they would cost the Government in lost revenue. They spread the money so thin that they offer most middle-income families less than what it costs to buy a pizza a week. And most economists, regardless of their politics or ideology, view such tax cuts as a lousy idea. 
 The last is not surprising. Proposals for a middle-class tax cut are not about the economy. They are all about political positioning.
Take Mr. Gephardt's plan, which would reduce the taxes of all households with annual incomes below $75,000. In a speech this morning, he said, "We ought to be focusing help to the hard-pressed, squeezed, middle-income families that are either standing still or have been moving behind for the last 15 years."
In other words, the swing voters who determine election results.
Neither Mr. Gephardt nor his staff would say exactly how much his plan would cost or how large a tax break he was contemplating for each family.
But say he decided to offer each family $300 a year, or about 82 cents a day. In 1991, the last year for which statistics are available, there were 107 million taxpayers with pretax income below $75,000, about 94 percent of all taxpayers. If each one got a tax cut of $300, it would cost the Government $32.1 billion (107 million times $300), which is half again as much as the Government spends each year on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program.
Mr. Gephardt said he would find spending reductions to offset the tax breaks. But as has been the case with Republicans, he declined to be specific.
The plan being pushed by Republicans in the House of Representatives would offer each family with income below $200,000 (99 percent of all taxpayers) and children in the household a $500 tax credit for each child. That means that a family with two children would have its taxes reduced by $1,000. The 64 percent of taxpayers who have no dependent children would get nothing.
Generally, the more income that taxpayers have, the more likely they are to have dependent children. For instance, 55 percent of taxpayers with incomes from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1991 claimed at least one exemption for a dependent. Only 42 percent of the taxpayers with incomes from $30,000 to $35,000 claimed such an exemption.
The Republican staff of the House Budget Committee reported last year that the plan would cost the Treasury about $20 billion a year. Internal Revenue Service figures show that about 40 million taxpayers have children and an income less than $200,000; 40 million taxpayers times $500 comes to exactly $20 billion.
Some families, of course, have more than one child and thus would get a bigger credit. But they are presumably offset by the families whose incomes are so low that they pay less than $500 a year in taxes anyway and thus could not take advantage of the full credit.
Politicians of both parties obviously believe such proposals to be good politics: all voters would like to pay lower taxes. But if opinion polls are to be believed, the public is not particularly concerned about taxes nowadays.
In a Harris poll taken after the elections last month, two-thirds of the respondents believed that the state of the nation was not good. But when asked why they felt that way, only 3 percent said the reason was high taxes.
Robert J. Shapiro, a campaign adviser to Mr. Clinton in 1992 and now director of economic studies for the Progressive Policy Institute, is one of the few economists who advocate small tax reductions for middle-income families, and he does not do so on economic grounds. The institute is the research arm of the Democratic Leadership Council, the organization of moderate and conservative Democrats formed to push the party to the center.
"The argument is a social policy argument, not an economic argument," Mr. Shapiro said. After years in which tax breaks were given to the wealthy (the lower rates of the Reagan years) and the poor (the earned-income tax credit), the middle class should have its due, he maintained.
"People in the political class think $300 or $400 a year isn't meaningful, and if you make $100,000 a year, it isn't," he said. "But if you make $25,000 or $30,000 a year, it can be rent for a month or two."
Economists and tax policy analysts say this is precisely the wrong time for such political positioning.
"We can't afford it," said Robert S. McIntyre. "If they have extra money, why don't they cut the deficit or build a bridge or something?"
Mr. McIntyre is president of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal group sponsored mainly by labor unions that does research and lobbying on tax issues.
Norman B. Ture, president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, looked at the issue from the other end of the ideological stage and came to a similar conclusion.
"The question," he said, "is what should we do to generate growth and savings and investment and technological innovation, and for those purposes a middle-class tax cut is irrelevant."
What really irritates the economists is that they believe a strong economy, like the one now, should be the setting for strong medicine, not sugar doughnuts. Alternatively, when the economy is sour, steps like deficit reduction can worsen the problem.
"The best time to make strategic moves is when times are good," said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank Capital Markets, an investment banking concern on Wall Street. "What the policy makers ought to be saying is: 'The economy is great. Now's the time to put in place some strategies that are going to help the nation in the long run.' "

A Harsh New Arena

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
As new products go, the problems with the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessor are little more than the kind of bugs that computer-chip designers expect with each new generation of technology.
What's different this time is that the escalating importance of the personal computer in work and life -- and Intel's own efforts to promote the Pentium as a brand name for home and office use -- have thrown the designer's craft into the harsh light of public scrutiny. 
 The bugs can be worked out in future versions of the chip. Intel's high-tech reputation may be harder to repair.
Indeed, in Silicon Valley this week there was widespread condemnation of Intel's continuing refusal to acknowledge what outside experts consider to be the true depth of the problem. And yet the consensus among computer designers outside Intel seemed to be sympathy for their technical colleagues inside the world's largest chip maker.
"Most of these guys think, 'There but for the grace of God go I,' " said Jerome Coonen, an independent computer designer who helped develop the mathematical functions for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer. "They think, 'I'm lucky they haven't found those wacky operations under my hood,' " Mr. Coonen added.
Intel's Pentium foul-up can be traced to a tiny human error by an unidentified designer at the company.
The flaw that has mired the Pentium in controversy was created by the simple omission of several lines of data from the software the designers used to create the chip's transistors. That in turn meant that a handful of transistors were missing from the finished chip -- an omission that Intel did not notice in early 1993 when the Pentium was being rushed to market.
As a result a small number of division operations made by the Pentium -- just how small is a matter of hot dispute -- create an error that can affect the accuracy of some calculations.
If this were a matter of concern only to scientists, engineers and professional computer users, then the controversy would generate little interest outside the technical community.
But the fact is, of the estimated three million to four million Pentium-based computers that have been purchased, a full 50 percent have been sold into the expanding home market -- a portion of the computer industry that including all makes and models represents a business whose growth rate is outpacing business computer sales.
The lesson for technologists is clear. Consumer products, once thought to be throwaway products that could be made to lower technical tolerances than scientific and engineering gear, may in fact have even more demanding specifications. Consumers have little patience with the trouble-shooting, "bug fixes" and "software patches" that computer professionals may be willing to take in digital stride.
"It is impossible to be perfect," said Aart J. de Geus, chief executive for Synopsis Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., developer of software tools used by chip designers. "But the economic stakes are so huge."
That became clear on Monday when the International Business Machines Corporation said that it was halting shipments of its Pentium-based personal computers because its researchers had found arithmetic errors far more frequently than the one-in-nine-billion occurrence rate claimed by Intel. Instead of once every 27,000 years of normal computer use, an individual could encounter the flaw as frequently as once every 24 days of typical computer use, I.B.M. said.
I.B.M.'s motives for making the announcement were quickly debated, given that only about 5 percent of the computers I.B.M. sells are Pentium-based machines and that I.B.M. intends eventually to promote its own Power PC chip as a Pentium rival. But computer scientists say there is mounting evidence that Intel is understating the likelihood that the division errors will occur.
"I.B.M. has done exactly the right thing; customers have to be aware of the magnitude of the problem," said Vaughan Pratt, a Stanford computer scientist who has conducted his own independent analysis of the frequency of errors in the Pentium chip and found it to be significantly higher than what Intel has reported. His findings are more in line with I.B.M.'s -- and disclose even more errors in some cases.
Mr. Pratt said he was planning to meet with Intel officials to discuss his conclusions this week.
Yet some other scientists said that it was difficult to predict average error rates, as researchers at both Intel and I.B.M. had attempted to do.
Cleve Moler, president and chief technical officer of Mathworks, a software company in Natick, Mass., compared the likelihood of finding a division error with the Pentium to driving on the Massachusetts Turnpike and encountering one of five potholes deep enough to damage a car's suspension.
"If you're in California, you don't care," he said. "But if you drive on the Turnpike frequently, you had better think about whether to drive in the fast lane or not."
Several software companies, including Mr. Moler's, have already used computer networks to distribute free software fixes that work around the chip error by doing division in software rather than hardware. But these can make the mathematical calculations done on standard programs like computer spreadsheets and computer-aided design applications where precision is necessary hundreds of times slower.
Meanwhile, Intel, which continues to stand by its 1-in-9-billion assessment, has said it is working with software companies to provide a solution that will slow down the Pentium by only 5 percent. Intel officials said they would release that software sometime before the end of the month.
Some computer industry analysts worried this week that the bruising battle between I.B.M. and Intel would end up hurting all computer makers as consumers lose confidence in technology entirely.
This seems highly unlikely. Computing has become a way of life for America and the consequences of the Pentium bug are likely to be suffered foremost by Intel.

Local school districts were shouldering their way to the front today in the race to claim shares of the billions of dollars left in Orange County's depleted investment fund.
The scramble, which began after the county said it would sell off the remaining holdings in the fund, will pit the needs of schoolchildren against those of police officers, city bureaucrats and the providers of all services that make a county work. The fund's value is already estimated to have dropped by more than $2 billion, and forced the county to file for bankruptcy last week. It remained unclear how the proceeds of the sale would be divided among the many municipalities, government agencies and even individuals who have invested in the fund. 
 Orange County school districts, by law, have invested about $1 billion in the county's $7.4 billion investment pool and could face losses of around 27 percent, the size of the overall loss in the fund. But as they figure out how to answer to more than 400,000 young constituents waiting for their books and crayons and hot lunches, school officias are saying they should be protected.
"It's going to be the position of our clients that we should be paid 100 cents on the dollar out of that fund before the county of Orange gets any money," said Richard A. Marshack, a lawyer who represents three school districts that collectively have $138 million in operating funds in the county fund.
"If there is anything left over, then the county would be entitled to it, but I doubt there will be anything left over," Mr. Marshack said.
Even before today, the financial crisis had already begun to bite at schools throughout the county. At Patrick Henry Elementary School here, the principal, Patrick Hart, was told on Monday that he could not have the nine new buses and the extra portable classrooms he had been counting on for an increasing student population.
As small, noisy children carrying large briefcases poured out across the lawn to their waiting parents, Mr. Hart described his economies -- no new hiring, no extra programs, no special supplies -- and recited the new mantra of the county's schools: "Basically, it's one day at a time."
Because the schools were required by law to use the county treasury as their bank, they now argue that they are blameless and should not lose a penny because the county mismanaged its investments.
In the uncertainty that has gripped the county for the last week, most nonessential municipal spending has been frozen. Major projects have been put on hold, from the construction of toll roads, jails and stadiums to an expansion of a police communications system.
"It's certainly no picnic around here," Mel Lopez, the superintendent of the Anaheim school district, said. "We have put a freeze on everything that is not involved with what we call health and safety."
That means no out-of-town teachers conferences, he explained, no faculty seminars, no hiring to fill vacancies, no replacement of textbooks, no nonessential use of the print shop and minimal substitution for support staff like gardeners and custodians, except for bus drivers.
Peter A. Hartman, superintendent of the Saddleback Unified School District, based in the wealthy city of Mission Viejo, warned that without new funds many districts might not be able to operate past February.
"I assume public safety will have the first claim on the funds," he said. "Then I hope it will be the schools. But there are a whole lot of other people out there, big players, with billions of dollars in this. The public schools have about $1 billion, but that's $1 billion that we need, not $1 billion that we don't need. There are no cutbacks available. The only thing we can do is shut down."
In such cases, the state would have the constitutional obligation to keep the schools functioning by providing at least the minimum in operating funds.
Half of the funds for the county'sschools come from property taxes, a quarter from state aid and the rest from a mix of Federal, state and local revenues as well as the state lottery. All the funds have been deposited in the state's treasury and apportioned to the schools based on their daily attendance, local tax base and special needs.
A first order of business, officials said, was to insure that new revenues coming in are separated from the county's investment pool.
In a letter to the county, the state's acting school superintendent, William D. Dawson, demanded that as a condition for continued state financing, a special new account be opened for all new school funds.
"When we write the check, they need to assure that this goes to the schools," said Patrick Kegan, assistant superintendent for the state department of education.
Mr. Marshack, the lawyer, said that bankruptcy suits could continue for years and that some form of interim agreement would be needed to insure that school financing could continue.
Monday was the annual deadline for the property taxes that provide the bulk of school financing. A lawyer for some school districts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "The fear is that county employees are sitting in a room opening envelopes and depositing checks and that the county is simply commingling the money and using it to pay county expenses."
The next major payroll for the county's teachers is Jan. 3, and Laura Mathiowetz, a third-grade teacher at Patrick Henry, said: "We are just waiting, like everybody else. I'd be lying if I said I'm not concerned."
On Monday, she said, as she has every year, she dutifully made out her tax check to "Robert L. 'Bob' Citron," the former county treasurer whose risky investments have put her paychecks at risk.

HEADLINE: Carl Marzani, 82, 'Loyalty' Case Defendant, Dies

 BODY:
Carl Marzani, a former employee of the Office of Strategic Services and the State Department imprisoned after being convicted of hiding his Communist Party affiliation from Government loyalty examiners, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
The cause was heart failure, said his son Anthony. 
 Mr. Marzani worked for the O.S.S. and the State Department during World War II. He was convicted in Federal District Court in Washington in 1947. In instructing the jury, Judge Richmond B. Keech said: "This court is not concerned with Communist vices. The issue is whether the defendant knowingly, willfully and feloniously made false statements to Government loyalty examiners."
Mr. Marzani was charged with lying about his Communist Party membership to keep his State Department job. The Government also contended that he had been a Communist organizer in New York.
During the trial, he denied that he had ever been a Communist Party member. Afterward, he called the trial "a travesty."
The case went to the Supreme Court twice. The court's deliberations ended both times, in 1948 and 1949, in tie votes by the Justices, with one abstaining. That left the conviction standing, and Mr. Marzani spent more than two years in prison.
On Monday, Anthony Marzani said his father had resigned from the Communist Party in 1941, after having been a member for two years.
Over the years, Carl Marzani was an economics instructor, film director and book-club co-owner. His writings include three volumes of memoirs in print from Topical Books in Manhattan. Two more volumes are to come out.
Born in Italy, Mr. Marzani graduated from high school in Scranton, Pa., and studied at Williams College and Oxford University.
His 1937 marriage to Edith Eisner ended in divorce.
In addition to his son Anthony, of Manhattan, he is survived by his second wife, Charlotte Pomerantz, whom he married in 1966; another son, Daniel, of Manhattan; two daughters, Judith Cutler and Gabrielle Marzani, both of Manhattan; a sister, Marcella Cullington of Perry, Ga., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Georgia Unit Discloses Loss

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia said today that it had unrealized losses of about $49 million as a result of derivatives in the authority's $928 million investment portfolio.
The authority, set up by the State of Georgia, supplies wholesale electric power to 48 communities. The authority said that, unlike Orange County, Calif., it had not leveraged its portfolio through borrowings. 
 "We do not need to sell these securities to meet our cash needs, so we do not anticipate that we will ever realize actual losses," said Ron Vasquez, vice president of financial services for the authority.
In its financial statements for the period ended Sept. 30, the authority reported a $40.3 million charge as a result of rising interest rates, which decreased the value of some of the authority's securities. Mr. Vasquez said that by Nov. 30, the authority had lost about $9 million more from the portfolio as a result of the continued upward drift of interest rates.
The charges are booked against accumulated net revenues, which came to $300.2 million after the September charge, Mr. Vasquez said.
Mr. Vasquez noted that the authority had many long-term investments for money needed 20 to 30 years from now to decommission nuclear power plants. "On some of our investments, we have no cash flow requirement until the year 2015 or 2026," he said.

HEADLINE: Simpson Lawyers Ask to Forgo DNA Hearing

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson today asked Judge Lance A. Ito to cancel a hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence and consolidate it instead into Mr. Simpson's trial. But it was unclear whether the prosecution would agree to the defense motion, which could allow testimony to begin shortly after New Year's Day.
In their 13-page motion, defense lawyers offered several reasons the two proceedings should be joined: that combining them would help assure Mr. Simpson's constitutionally guaranteed right to a speedy trial, that many of the same issues regarding DNA's reliability will be addressed at the trial anyway, and that expediting things would protect the jury from further waves of adverse publicity. 
 Mr. Simpson's lawyers also said canceling the hearing would give some relief to the people of Los Angeles, who as of Nov. 1 had spent $1.24 million on the Simpson case.
"This course of action is plainly in the interests of judicial economy and of the California taxpayers who have been patiently footing a multimillion-dollar bill for the prosecution of this case," the motion stated.
There was no immediate response from Marcia Clark, the chief prosecutor in the case, who could oppose the defense request. But experts said there was little reason for her to go along and predicted that a separate session on the admissibility of DNA evidence, known as a Kelly-Frye hearing, would probably still have to be held outside the jury's presence before the trial, though that hearing might not be as long as previously expected.
Peter Arenella, a professor at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles, said delaying arguments about the reliability of DNA evidence until the trial would keep the prosecution from making its best case in opening statements, where neither side can refer to evidence that could later be ruled inadmissible. Moreover, testimony that is so highly technical and tedious -- "about as exciting as listening to paint dry," said Stan Goldman, a professor at Loyola University Law School in Los Angeles -- could break the flow of the prosecution's case.
Mr. Arenella said: "I see no reason why the prosecution should go along with this, because it would be a disaster. I expect this trial will not start January 4th."
But he said the Kelly-Frye hearing may go more quickly than anticipated because of what apparently prompted the defense proposal in the first place: Mr. Simpson's dwindling reservoir of patience, money and, as the families of the two victims blanket the airwaves with increasingly accusatory language, public support. Mr. Simpson is accused of killing his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald L. Goldman last June 12.
Though jurors are supposedly steering clear of all publicity in the case, the public relations setbacks being suffered by the defense could affect them. Should the protracted DNA debate take place during the trial, the jury would probably be sequestered. Should it go on beforehand, jurors would be forced to spend as many as eight more weeks ducking publicity about the case.
"They like this jury," Loyola's Mr. Goldman said of the defense team. "They believe that if they have to wait until the Ides of March before this jury actually hears testimony, they are going to lose some of these jurors." He also noted that holding the Kelly-Frye hearing during the trial would spare the defense from having to telegraph its strategy on DNA evidence.
In their motion, defense lawyers said their proposed calendar held risks for Mr. Simpson -- specifically, that the jury could get to hear damaging evidence that Judge Ito could subsequently rule inadmissible. They said Mr. Simpson had been apprised of those risks but had gone along with the motion and pledged not to raise the issues on appeal.
But Mr. Arenella, echoing widespread feelings that Judge Ito is almost certain to admit the DNA tests into evidence, said that the risk to Mr. Simpson was minuscule.
One way or another, DNA evidence promises to play a crucial role in the Simpson trial, whenever it finally gets under way. With no murder weapon and, apparently, no eyewitness testimony, the most persuasive evidence in the case may be blood samples taken from the crime scene, Mr. Simpson's Ford Bronco and his home in west Los Angeles.
Even if Judge Ito allows the DNA test results into evidence, defense lawyers are certain to mount a double-barreled challenge to them. Experts will surely criticize the manner in which the blood samples were collected and preserved, as well as the weight that should be given to any of the results.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Calls for Tax Cut For Incomes Below $75,000

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The next Democratic leader of the House promised today to propose a tax cut for anyone earning less than $75,000 a year when Congress convenes next month, a proposal that would instantly set his party apart not only from the ruling House Republicans, but also from its own White House.
President Clinton plans to present at least some of his own domestic programs for the next two years, possibly including a tax cut, in a speech scheduled for 9 P.M. on Thursday. Today, in his own speech to a policy group, the new leader of the House Democrats, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said he did not intend for his announcement to eclipse the President's plans. 
 But he also made it clear that neither he nor his House colleagues were lashed to them, either.
"We'll work as closely as we can with the President and with our colleagues in the Senate," Mr. Gephardt said. "But our agenda will come from America's houses, not from the White House and not from anywhere else."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Gephardt, Laura Nichols, said later that House Democrats had discussed their tax proposal with White House officials, but had yet to hear whether Mr. Clinton, who also favors a cut, would offer an alternative plan. If he does, she said, "We'll talk about it."
In his speech today at the Democratic-leaning Center for National Policy, Mr. Gephardt also said he would seek to force Republicans to offer a detailed plan to balance the Federal budget before any such constitutional amendment was approved and sent to the states for ratification.
He also said that House Democrats would oppose the Republican plan to cut the capital gains tax, and that they would offer a competing plan to reward companies that distributed more profits to their workers, rather than to shareholders.
Those proposals and others amount to a campaign platform for House Democrats, who, Mr. Gephardt said, are already working to regain control of the chamber in the election two years from now.
The thrust of that platform is to direct more Federal money and other Federal benefits to the middle class, and to oppose Republican policies, like the cut in the capital gains tax, as giveaways to the wealthy.
In that vein, Mr. Gephardt bitterly attacked the incoming House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, and his allies, calling them "trickle-down terrorists" and asserting that their legislative program was based on "division, exclusion and fear."
In the next election, he predicted, "they'll lose because their 'Contract on America,' whether you like or hate it, is all slogans and hot buttons without so much as a wink or a nod at real jobs and real opportunities. They'll lose because every time they've taken control of the Congress, they've rolled out their real priorities, more tax breaks for the rich."
And he rejected Republicans' assertions that the last election was an endorsement of their concept of governing. "They think they've won a mandate every time somebody turns right at a stoplight," he said.
As a practical matter, however, the Democratic platform has little more chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress than did the many proposals Republicans presented in many similar speeches in their four decades as a minority.
Mr. Gephardt wrapped his proposals in a long and sometimes florid speech in which he asserted that Democrats had been tossed out of power not because their ideas were bad, but because they had defaulted on a promise to halt a long slide in the economic fortunes of the average worker.
"We didn't speak to the growing sense of insecurity that is sweeping our factories and stores and even our board rooms: the fear that today's jobs and job growth can't guard us from tomorrow's layoffs and pay cuts," he said. "We did not speak to the growing sense that our children won't have the opportunities that we had, the sense that the American dream, the dream of doing better than your parents, may be slipping beyond their reach."
More than ideology or dislike of Government, he said, voters saw the 1994 election as a referendum on politicians' ability to deliver. On that score, he said, "The Democratic Party, the party that has fought for working people since days of the New Deal, just isn't doing enough for them."
The proposed tax cut is the House Democrats' principal answer to that disaffected middle class, and their first parry to the tax-cutting strategy of the Republicans.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, who will be the new Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, mocked Mr. Gephardt's effort to keep pace with Republicans. "His statement is exactly five weeks too late," said Mr. Archer, whose committee has jurisdiction over tax policy. "Perhaps if the Democrats' actions had matched their new-found rhetoric, last month's election would have been different."
Mr. Gingrich and other Republicans have proposed their own family-based version of tax relief: an actual cut in tax bills of $500 for every child in every taxpaying family earning less than $200,000 annually. That proposal would omit both the wealthiest taxpayers and the poorest, who do not pay taxes and would not be eligible for the credit.
Ms. Nichols said today that Mr. Gephardt's plan remained in flux. But in essence, it would exempt from taxation a part of the wages of anyone who makes less than $75,000 a year, except low-income wage earners who already receive a break called the Earned Income Tax Credit. Those people could receive either Mr. Gephardt's tax cut or the existing tax credit, but not both.
Mr. Gephardt's office said his proposal would benefit about 69 million taxpayers and would probably cost as much or more than the Republican plan, which is estimated at $20 billion a year. At that rate, Mr. Gephardt's proposal would cut the bill of an average eligible taxpayer by about $290, but how the money would be distributed is not clear.
Republicans have not said how they would pay for their tax cut. Mr. Gephardt would not say how he would pay for his either, but he promised to find some financing device that would not increase the Federal deficit.

HEADLINE: New Old Yankee Stadium?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
A preliminary plan for the renovation of Yankee Stadium calls for construction of an exact replica of the original facade of the stadium as a new outer wall for the ball park, according to Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, who was briefed on the plan.
Mr. Ferrer said the new facade would be built 40 feet out from the existing outside wall of the stadium, creating more space for a concession area and additional seating. 
 The plan is being designed by the firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum under contract by the city and the state, which have joined forces to try to keep the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, from moving the team out of the city. The Yankee management has said that fans are fearful of coming to the stadium, which is located in the South Bronx.
The preliminary plan also proposes the construction of 90 luxury seating boxes, 12,000 new parking spaces and a picnic area in the left-field bleachers, Mr. Ferrer said. A new parking garage on the Harlem River would be connected to the stadium by a pedestrian overpass.
To make access to the stadium easier, the subway station would be improved, a Metro-North railroad station built on the stadium grounds, and a new exit would be built to allow cars coming off the George Washington Bridge to take the Harlem River Drive to the 145th Street Bridge across the Harlem River.
Outside the stadium, stores, lighting, signs and parks would be upgraded, Mr. Ferrer said. River Avenue in front of the stadium would be widened into a "Walk of Fame" dedicated to Yankee heroes. Also a public high school teaching sports management would be built nearby and a 500-seat amphitheater in Joyce Kilmer Park is also proposed.
Mr. Ferrer praised the plans and said he thought it would be received well by residents of the area.
City officials who reviewed the plans have not publicly commented on them. No money figure was attached to the preliminary plan, Mr. Ferrer said. A final plan is due next year.
Forrest R. Taylor, a spokesman for the Giuliani administration, said the Mayor and Yankee officials had not been briefed on the plan. He said John S. Dyson, the deputy mayor for economic development, was familiar with the plan but had no comment.

HEADLINE: A Private Study Finds Many Children in Shelters Have Signs of Malnutrition

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Many homeless children tested by health workers in the New York City shelter system suffered from iron deficiency and other symptoms of malnutrition that could severely affect their long-term health, according to a survey by an advocacy group for the homeless.
The yearlong study of 200 children was done by the New York Children's Health Project, which operates four medical vans that travel among some of the city's shelters providing free care. The study was not scientifically designed to project precisely the extent of poor nutrition among the city's nearly 10,000 homeless children. 
 But the doctors who worked on it, and other advocates for the homeless, said the findings were a sign that the health of children in the shelter system, already at risk because of their families' economic and social instability, is further imperiled by a poor diet. They said the problem resulted not only from poverty, but from a shelter system that makes it difficult for mothers to feed their children well.
The study found that 42.5 percent of children between ages 1 and 3 living in the shelter system who were examined suffered from iron deficiency or anemia -- a level twice as high as the national average for children living below the poverty level and six times greater than for those living above it.
Preschool children between 3 and 5 who were examined fared even worse. Their rate of anemia and iron deficiency -- 24.7 percent -- was 2 1/2 times the national average for poor children and 10 times greater than for children in economically stable homes.
The children studied were all those seen by Health Project doctors in their medical vans on one day last year and whose cases were followed.
Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to cause problems not only in children's physical health, but also in their cognitive development.
Iron deficiency is widely considered as one of the best indicators of poor nutrition. The project plans to study nutrition among the city's homeless children more intensely, said Dr. Anne Greene, the project's medical director, but decided to release these preliminary findings now because "they were so disturbing we wanted to draw attention quickly and begin to intervene."
The study also found that nearly 20 percent of the homeless children surveyed were not receiving food stamps, which they are entitled to, and that two-thirds were without benefits due them from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.
Beyond the statistics, doctors working with the Children's Health Project said that mothers they interviewed were frustrated and demoralized trying to adequately feed their children while in shelters that often have limited cooking equipment, provide little refrigeration, are far from affordable supermarkets and supply pre-packaged meals that are often tasteless and lacking in basic nutritional value.
The mothers also complained that even when they receive the proper food stamps and WIC benefits, the money falls far short of what they need to give their children healthy, filling meals.
"This is consistent with what we see day to day," said Steven Banks, coordinating attorney for the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project. "Federal, state and city policies are creating a lost generation of children indelibly scarred by their experience in the shelter system, literally physically harmed as a result of their shelter experience."
Joan Malin, the Commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, said it was difficult for her to comment on the study before reading it. She said that the city provided extensive nutritional counseling to homeless families, tried to place them in shelters with cooking facilities and worked to assure that they received all the benefits to which they are entitled.
"A portion of the homeless population has complicated problems" that would affect the nutritional health of their children, Ms. Malin said. But, she added, "I don't think by and large that they are different from those of the very poor throughout the city."
Dr. Irwin Redlener, president and co-founder of the Children's Health Fund, which provides private money for the Children's Health Project and other medical initiatives for poor city children, scoffed at Ms. Malin's assertion that the city provided means for homeless families to feed their children nutritionally.
"If that's what she thinks, she needs to visit some shelters," said Dr. Redlener. "There's a lack of reality to her claims."
In response to the project's findings, the Children's Health Fund plans to announce today a new initiative to improve nutrition among homeless children. The new effort, called the Health and Nutrition Action Initiative, will be financed in part by a grant from Share Our Strength, a national hunger-prevention organization.
The new program will include improving nutritional counseling for homeless mothers and increasing nutritional screenings for children.

HEADLINE: Pataki Team Weighs Curb On Welfare

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki's transition team is reviewing a proposal by a Republican lawmaker that would allow the state to establish sharp new restrictions on welfare benefits to adults deemed able to work.
The plan is intended to circumvent provisions of the State Constitution requiring the state to provide "aid, care and support of the needy." Advocates for the poor have long viewed that clause as a safeguard against the Legislature's slashing of welfare services for the poor.
But under the new proposal, which was developed by the State Senate's Social Services Committee, the Legislature would create a new category of needy people, known as transitionals, who would be eligible for reduced services and cash grants. 
 Though the plan does not clearly define who would fall into that group, it would mainly include able-bodied, childless adults. Other welfare recipients who were deemed unemployable because they were permanently disabled, chronically ill or aged would continue to receive a higher level of state benefits.
The plan is directed at only the state and locally financed program known as Home Relief, which provided $1.2 billion in aid last year, mostly to single or childless adults. State and Federal welfare programs for families and children are not dealt with in the proposal.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said: "There are a number of reports being prepared on how to achieve fundamental reform in welfare. We will take a look at all the proposals and their recommendations as soon as we receive them."
Senator Joseph R. Holland, a Spring Valley Republican who is the Social Services Committee chairman and a member of the transition team, said setting restrictions on welfare programs, including time limits, has always been considered vulnerable to court challenges because of the State Constitution's provisions for the needy. His proposal, he said, would allow such restrictions to pass the constitutional test.
"This particular way of defining the needy has never been tried in New York before," he said. "The constitutional mandate to help the needy is not a bad thing, but it's getting out of hand."
In the campaign, Mr. Pataki advocated reducing welfare spending by cutting administrative costs, improving anti-fraud measures and requiring more Home Relief recipients to work for their checks. But he also said he would consider setting time limits on Home Relief grants, a proposal he voted for in the Legislature.
One member of the Pataki transition group reviewing welfare proposals praised the report, saying she thought it established a constitutionally defensible approach for the state to set time limits on welfare. "The Home Relief population is no homogeneous group," said Mary E. Glass, Westchester County's Commissioner of Social Services. "It contains a group of people, probably somewhere between 35 percent to 40 percent, who are employable."
The state's Home Relief population is larger than in any other state, about 390,000 people, three-fourths of whom live in New York City. In 1993, Home Relief cost $1.29 billion, which was split evenly between the county governments that administer the programs and the state.
The idea of restricting Home Relief is sure to encounter strong opposition in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he had not seen Mr. Holland's report and could not comment on it. But other Assembly members expressed reservations about the idea.
"There may be cost-efficient means of getting more people into work," said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat. "That's where we ought to direct our efforts instead of looking at more punitive measures."
Mr. Holland said he planned to introduce legislation early next year to create the two-tiered system for Home Relief. He also plans to introduce bills setting restrictions on cash grants and other services to transitional Home Relief recipients.
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the incoming Senate majority leader and a supporter of restricting welfare spending, said he had not seen Mr. Holland's report today but he thought changes in the welfare system were "inevitable" next year.
A task force named by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will release its own proposals for revamping welfare on Wednesday. That study, which will be sent to the Pataki transition team, will call for allowing counties to cut off welfare checks to employable Home Relief recipients who do not find jobs or enter work-training programs within three months.

HEADLINE: Stocks Little Changed as Dow Slips 3.03

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended little changed yesterday as gains in bank issues, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris outweighed lower prices for oil, drug and technology issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.03 points, to 3,715.34. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.68 point, to 450.15, and the Nasdaq composite index added 0.37 point, to 719.49. 
 Advancing stocks outpaced declining issues by almost 6 to 5e on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume climbed yesterday to 307 million from 285.7 million.
Thom Brown, money manager at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood Inc. in Philadelphia, said, "The bank stocks received a lift after Lehman Brothers raised its investment opinion on Mellon Bank and Keycorp." The stocks were also bolstered by a decline in interest rates as yields on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to a two-month low of 7.85 percent. Higher rates had led to concern that banks' profit margins will shrink.
Among banks posting the largest gains were Bankers Trust New York Corporation, ahead 1 3/4, to 58 7/8; the First Chicago Corporation, up 1 1/8, to 46 3/4; Nationsbank Corporation, up 1 1/8, to 46 1/4; Mellon, ahead 1, to 31 3/4, and First Fidelity Bancorp, up 1 1/8, to 45 5/8. Keycorp rose 1/2, to 24 3/4.
Electric utilities, also sensitive to moves in rates, extended a three-week-long advance. The Duke Power Company climbed 1/2, to 41 3/4; Northern States Power Company rose 7/8, to 46 7/8, and Houston Industries increased 1/4, to 35 1/2.
Since dropping to a six-year low on Nov. 22, the Dow Jones utilities average of 15 stocks has climbed 4.5 percent.
Elsewhere, Philip Morris climbed 1 1/8, to 57 5/8. Analysts said tobacco stocks were unlikely to be hurt any time soon by a Florida judge's decision to grant class-action status to a lawsuit brought by 25 airline attendants. The attendants contend they were harmed by second-hand smoke.
Disney surged 1 1/4, to 43 3/4. The company said sales of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" videos topped 20 million copies.
General Electric rose 1/2, to 47 7/8. The company's chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., told analysts at a meeting last night that "it would be better to err toward raising the dividend too much rather than not enough." Sears, Roebuck & Company rose 5/8, to 45 1/8. The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales last month increased 1.2 percent amid a surge in purchases of consumer durable goods such as refrigerators.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer dropped 3 1/4, to 38. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel rejected Rhone-Poulenc's Taxotere as a treatment for breast cancer and some types of lung cancer.
Automatic Data Processing Inc. surged 2 1/2, to 55 1/4. The data processing company said it expects earnings in the year ending next June 30 to grow more than 15 percent.

Bank's Head Will Retire Early in 1998

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
J. Carter Bacot, the strong-willed chairman of the Bank of New York Company, said yesterday that he would retire in early 1998 and that the bank's board had approved his choice of Thomas A. Renyi to be his successor.
Until now, Mr. Bacot, 62, had not set a retirement date and had divided management responsibilities among a group of executives, none of whom was a clear heir-apparent. In an interview in his ornate office on Wall Street yesterday, Mr. Bacot, who has run the Bank of New York for 12 years, said he had been planning to name a successor for nearly a year. 
 "You've got to let someone else run the show at some point," he said. "I will have been chairman for 15 years."
The Bank of New York, with $50 billion in assets, is the country's 16th-largest banking company.
Mr. Renyi, 48, was named yesterday to the posts of president and chief operating officer of the holding company and its main operating unit, the Bank of New York. He had already been president of the holding company.
The appointment pushes aside Alan R. Griffith, 52, who had been chief operating officer and president of the holding company. Mr. Griffith will now be vice chairman of the company and the bank and will principally look after its rapidly growing credit-card operations.
Mr. Renyi has most recently run the bank's other quickly expanding area: providing computer processing and safekeeping for various securities-related areas. For example, the bank is the leader in holding shares of foreign companies so they can issue American depository receipts that are traded on exchanges in the United States.
Mr. Renyi will keep those duties and also supervise banking with corporations and consumers and the bank's credit policy. Previously, he had been the bank's top officer in charge of preventing bad loans. In 1988, he oversaw the integration of the Irving Trust Company into the Bank of New York.
That merger, one of the few hostile takeovers in the banking industry, established Mr. Bacot's reputation as one of the toughest bankers in the country, willing to offend the gentlemanly sensibility of the profession in the relentless pursuit of efficiency. Mr. Bacot said Mr. Renyi's performance in that merger was one reason he was chosen for the top spot.
"The two banks had very different cultures," Mr. Bacot said. "Tom did a fine job explaining to those people that we wanted to stay the way we did things around here and why we did them that way."
Since then, the bank has grown by employing a strategy based on parsimonious spending and diversified businesses. The bank has extensive branches in the suburbs of New York City, a nationwide mortgage company and a series of lending specialties for various industries, including the media business.
Analysts said Mr. Renyi's appointment was a clear signal that the Bank of New York was no longer pursuing a merger with the Fleet Financial Corporation, a similarly sized banking company based in Providence, R.I. Fleet has been looking for a partner for a so-called merger of equals in which the combined institution could achieve economies of scale and diversification. Such deals are easier to arrange financially than those in which one bank pays a large premium to buy another, but they are much more difficult socially, because the managements of the two partners must cooperate.
Mr. Bacot declined to talk about Fleet in particular. He said that the company would like to diversify outside the New York area but that it would seek to do so by acquiring banks under terms that kept the Bank of New York and its corporate culture under the control of the current holding company.
"Mergers of equals are hard to do," he said.
Mr. Bacot said the bank would continue to seek acquisitions to expand its securities and credit-card businesses and would likely wait to buy banks until the prices for banks fall. "We don't have to merge to grow, so we will be opportunistic," he said.
Mr. Renyi lives in northern New Jersey with his wife and the youngest of his three children. In his spare time, he plays golf and hikes near his house on the coast in Maine. After receiving an M.B.A. from Rutgers University and serving in an Army military intelligence unit, Mr. Renyi joined the Bank of New York in 1971 as a trainee.
Shares of Bank of New York rose 75 cents yesterday, to $28, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Producer Inflation Moderate; Retailers Post Strong Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Inflation at the producer level climbed by half a percentage point in November, while retailers posted very strong sales in the month, the Government announced today.
But most of the increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index reflected rising energy prices, particularly gasoline prices, which tend to be volatile and do not always signal broader inflation trends. Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose one-tenth of a percent in November. Producer prices are the prices manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. 
 The slow pickup in prices came even as retail sales increased 1.2 percent from October. The reports indicated that the accelerating inflation that the Federal Reserve has repeatedly forecast in raising short-term interest rates six times this year has yet to appear. The data heartened investors, who appeared to agree with the more optimistic interpretations of today's figures and bid up bond prices. [Page D7.]
The Fed's top interest-rate policy committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday, after extensive speculation about whether it will raise rates for a seventh time since February.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, told a Congressional committee last week that sales of finished products to consumers, businesses and government were an important consideration now as the Fed tries to gauge the economy's health.
But Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Fed, said at a news conference on Friday that today's retail sales figure would not by itself represent a reliable barometer of the economy, because the figure is subject to revision and because retail sales represent only part of the overall demand in the economy for goods and services.
The producer price figures today held hints of trouble ahead that might concern the Fed. Raw material prices rose a full percentage point in November. Prices for so-called intermediate goods like steel bars and lumber, which are used to make finished products like cars and houses, jumped 1.1 percent, the largest monthly increase since October 1990, when these prices rose 1.4 percent.
Sooner or later, producers will start passing these prices on to retailers, which will eventually pass the increases on to consumers, said Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm.
 But Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, pointed out that with food and energy included, intermediate prices have risen only slightly over the last year while raw material prices have actually fallen by 2.7 percent.
"The increase in producer prices looks worse than it actually is," he said.
The overall Producer Price Index had fallen by half a percentage point in September and again in October, so many economists had expected it to bounce back today.
By contrast, retail sales rose considerably faster than most economists had expected, and many different kinds of retailers posted higher sales. Retail sales were up 8.7 percent from November of last year. The Commerce Department also revised upward its estimate of the gain in retail sales in October, to 1.3 percent from 1.1 percent.
Seasonally adjusted sales of cars, furniture, building materials and other durable goods were especially strong in November, rising 2.3 percent, while sales of nondurable goods like clothing and groceries were much weaker, climbing four-tenths of a percentage point.

U.S. Report On Inflation Spurs Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds surged yesterday as buyers were encouraged by a report on producer prices that showed no evidence of inflation accelerating.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 22/32 , to 9530/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.85 percent, from 7.92 percent on Tuesday. The yield is only five basis points more than the yield of 7.80 percent on the five-year note and four basis points more than the yield on the 10-year note. 
 The narrowing difference in yields between some Treasury notes and bonds suggests that "inflation expectations are being lowered," said Tony Crescenzi, a trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company.
Prices of municipal bonds rose even as Orange County, Calif., authorized the liquidation of its investment pool. Some $1.2 billion in new issues came to market yesterday. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues fell to 7.01 percent, from 7.06 percent on Monday.
Traders concerned about the selling of Orange County debt were relieved by the announcement that the sale would take place over 90 days, said Ron Jester, a trader at Lehman Brothers.
"Everybody was aware that there was an additional $8 billion," Mr. Jester said. "The only thought was of $8 billion hitting the Street all at once, which would immediately have to be hedged."
Treasury bonds rose after the Government said producer prices rose about as expected in November. The Producer Price Index gained half a percentage point in November. But excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, the index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent. The slow growth in producer prices came even as retail sales showed a stronger-than-expected gain of 1.2 percent for the month.
The reports "are good news for us," Michelle Baires, investment analyst at the Beneficial Life Insurance Company in Salt Lake City, which has $1.2 billion in bonds.
Today, the market turns its attention to the report on consumer prices for November. Economists surveyed expect the Consumer Price Index to rise three-tenths of 1 percent from one-tenth of 1 percent in October.
"The bear market is certainly not over yet," said Mark Sauvigne, a trader at Chemical Securities. "Rates will continue to go higher into next year."
In the corporate bond market, Laidlaw Inc. led three issuers in selling $359 million of corporate and related debt as spreads on some corporate debt widened.
Bonds of finance companies and other short-term corporate securities lost value yesterday as some investors sold them to buy bonds of government-sponsored agencies that offer fatter yields.
Spreads between bonds sold by government-sponsored agencies and comparable Treasury securities have widened by as much as 30 basis points in the last week as investment banks sold agency debt held as collateral for loans made to Orange County.
"It's still a buying opportunity," said Anne Ruff, who manages $2.5 billion for the United Services Life Insurance Company. Ms. Ruff, who was buying agency bonds even before the bankruptcy, said the spread widening gave her even more incentive.
Even so, while agency bonds may have taken their lumps, they may not narrow immediately. "Even though a lot of dealers have already sold collateral, there's more for them to sell," she said. "That will keep agency spreads wide."

Grey Will Take A Big Write-Off

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
In an unexpected disclosure, Grey Advertising Inc. in New York said yesterday that it would take a large noncash write-off in the fourth quarter, resulting in "a substantial loss" for the full year of $18 million to $20 million.
The write-off will be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, or $27 to $31 a share, the agency company said, almost entirely for good will associated with acquisitions made overseas mostly in the 1980's. 
 Edward H. Meyer, Grey's chairman, president and chief executive, said the charges were related to "our experience in coming out of the advertising recession in Europe and other markets." For instance, Grey's direct marketing operation in France was closed, and several British subsidiaries were integrated into the Grey agency operations there.
On an operating basis, Mr. Meyer said, "Our international operations as a group are strong and are a major contributor to the company's profits."
Grey will raise its annual dividend for the 20th consecutive year, by 25 cents a share, to $3.50, payable on Dec. 29 to shareholders of record on Dec. 22. In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Grey shares closed at $148, down $1.

HEADLINE: How Rent, Not Food, Can Hold a Restaurant's Fate

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
LA COTE BASQUE, one of New York City's most esteemed and historic restaurants, has lost its lease after 36 years and will be moving in April. As is true of so many restaurants in New York, its dislocation has little to do with food quality, dining trends or management practices. It will have to move, and take on the risk and disruption that entails, because the Walt Disney Company wants to open a gift shop in the space, at 5 East 55th Street, and has offered the landlord substantially more than the $750,000 a year La Cote Basque pays for its 4,500 square feet.
"What can I do?" asked Jean-Jacques Rachou, the chef and owner. Mr. Rachou is being bought out with one year remaining on his 15-year lease. He is now looking at another site in the same neighborhood. Neither Mr. Rachou nor his landlord, the Coca-Cola company, would discuss the terms of the agreement. 
 In New York, where prime restaurant sites command six-figure rents, where many entrepreneurs are now compelled to take on partners with cash to cover expenses and where every square foot must be accounted for on the bottom line, it is clear that real estate plays a big role in determining the city's tastes.
Restaurant industry sources estimate that roughly 50 percent of new ventures in New York City fail within three to five years. Of those, at least 10 percent close primarily because of lease difficulties, real-estate agents and restaurateurs say.
"Rent is one thing you can't really control, and it is such a key element in success," said Fred Sampson, the president of the New York State Restaurant Association. "It is one area where you can be sandbagged before you even get started." After several years of stagnation, restaurant rents have recently started rising.
New York's gastronomic trail is littered with restaurants that have closed in the last year over rent disputes -- among them Chelsea Central, on lower 10th Avenue; Hulot's, on Lexington Avenue; Lora, on West 13th Street; Brazilian Pavilion, on East 53d Street; May We, on Lexington Avenue, and Romeo Salta, on West 56th Street.
Sometimes a landlord refuses to renew a restaurant's lease because it can get more money from another tenant; other times, bad timing contributes to real-estate problems.
In 1986, less than a year before the stock market crash, a luxury restaurant called Mondrian, owned principally by the chef Dennis Foy, signed a $28,000-a-month lease on a space at 7 East 59th Street. The restaurant opened in 1988, after more than $3 million in renovations. "We never made money," recalled Tom Colicchio, the former chef. "We tried to renegotiate the lease, like a lot of restaurants back then, but the landlord had no interest in it." Mondrian closed in 1992.
Many restaurants that assumed high leases in the booming 1980's have renegotiated the rents, as property values and their earnings declined. "Those that could not, just struggled or closed," said M. David Tell, a real-estate lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Wormser, Kiely, Galef & Jacobs.
Still, despite the high rents and volatility in the economy, restaurateurs, real-estate agents and landlords say that entrepreneurs are still drawn by the potential for great success.
"The rents are lower in other cities, like San Francisco, but you don't do the kind of business out there that you can in Manhattan," said Drew Nieporent, who has three restaurants in New York, including TriBeCa Grill, Montrachet and Nobu, and the year-old Postrio in San Francisco.
A large restaurant in midtown Manhattan occupying a 5,000-square-foot space, say on 56th Street between Fifth and Madison avenues, could pay $600,000 or more a year in rent; on Madison Avenue, from the 50's to around 80th Steet, also a prestigious location, the lease could be in the $400,000 range.
Five thousand square feet on Park Avenue South, one of the hottest new restaurant areas, commands rents in the $150,000-to-$200,000 range. On the Upper West Side, prices can go as high as $350,000; prime space in TriBeCa is only slightly less.
Restaurateurs in Chicago have far lower costs to contend with. A 5,000-square-foot restaurant space in one of the most desirable areas, say, off North Michigan Avenue, rents for around $120,000, one-fifth of an equivalent location in Manhattan.
New York's extraordinary rents -- not to mention building costs -- affect the restaurant business in many ways. For one, they influence what types of establishments open. The modest family venture -- the work of a husband and wife who save their money and open their own place by themselves -- is increasingly difficult to realize in a prime Manhattan location, real-estate agents say.
"The days of the mom-and-pop operation are finished," said Michael Whiteman of the Joseph Baum & Michael Whiteman restaurant consulting company. "With minor exceptions, you have to have backers today."
Mr. Whiteman added that the need to find financial backers necessarily affects a restaurant's size, decor and food approach and puts tremendous immediate financial pressures on the owners.
"A restaurant needs instant success," Mr. Whiteman said. "There is such a heavy outlay to get started that there is no time to build up business. The pressure to succeed quickly is immense."
Alan Stillman, who owns four major midtown Manhattan restaurants, agreed. "Ten years ago you would get a location and work it for a number of years," he said, "but now the imperative is for instant success."
Part of the need for outside investors comes from high leases and start-up costs. "Today you see many three-to-five-partner package deals," said Joseph Porcelli of Maloney & Porcelli, a real-estate law firm. "In the 80's there were a lot of investors who went into restaurant investment for the fun of it, but those days are over."
Restaurateurs differ on what they consider to be a reasonable ratio of rent to sales. Mr. Nieporent said that he considered a rent in TriBeCa to be reasonable if it equaled 4 to 5 percent of sales. "That means if I do $1.5 million I can't afford more than about $65,000 rent." Others said 7 to 10 percent of gross was more realistic.
Restaurateurs in New York say that rents are relative; a high rent in a busy part of town may be preferable to a low rent in a quieter spot.
"It remains true that the most important thing is location, location, location," added Jean de Noyer, who has 30 years' experience on the Manhattan restaurant scene and currently owns Le Comptoir, on East 67th Street; La Goulue, on Madison Avenue, as well as the Supper Club, near Times Square. "If you can do the business necessary, then these rents are not a big problem."
After La Goulue lost its old location, on 70th Street off Madison Avenue, in 1992 because the landlord preferred another tenant (Prada, a women's accessories store), Mr. de Noyer moved to Madison Avenue and 65th Street, reopening in late 1993. There, his 2,800 square feet cost $360,000 a year, compared with less than $200,000 in his old 2,000-square-foot space.
Restaurants are frequently urban pioneers, the first new businesses to put down roots in marginal neighborhoods. They may benefit from reasonable leases at the beginning but often find that rents soar when the neighborhood improves.
"Landlords in New York are not looking for a good tenant usually," Mr. Nieporent said. "They are looking for someone who can pay the rent. That's why you have so many lease changes." Earlier this year, Mr. Nieporent concluded negotiations for a space on Hudson Street in TriBeCa.
"It was difficult, and there had been several failed restaurants in the space before, most recently Cafe Americano," he said.
Landlords have mixed feelings about restaurants as tenants. They are desirable because they tend to pay higher rents than retail or other commercial tenants, but they are risky. "Restaurants tend to go out of business more than other places, so they may pay extra for the stability risk," Mr. Porcelli said.
Landlords say it is unfair to paint them as avaricious business people who have no regard for their tenants aside from the monthly rent check.
"There are some landlord villains just as there are some tenant villains," said Jon Chodosh, a real-estate broker who also owns some rental properties in TriBeCa.
"I have been left with a $10,000 water bill by tenants, unpaid rent and other bad debts that I just had to cover," he said. The risk in this tenuous marriage, he contends, is mutual.
Despite the perils, restaurateurs continue to scour New York City for spaces.
"It's very busy out there right now," said Ernest Graziani, a restaurant and lease consultant in Manhattan.
Mr. Porcelli, the real estate lawyer, added, "The restaurant business continues to be an occupation for romantics."

MORE JOB CUTS ARE POSSIBLE AT BOEING, CHAIRMAN SAYS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Boeing Company, Frank A. Shrontz, said yesterday that more production and employment cuts were possible next year, though they would not be close to the huge levels of the last two years. "I am not sure all the decline is behind us," Mr. Shrontz said at a news conference. Boeing, based in Seattle, has laid off about 24,000 people in the last two years and has cut production by about 50 percent, to 18.5 airplanes a month, because of the worldwide airline recession.

HEADLINE: Clinton Tax Plan Said to Include Family Credits and Student Help

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The White House is preparing to propose about $50 billion in income tax cuts, probably through a mix of tax credits for families with preschool children and new deductions for college and technical education, Administration aides said today.
The proposal is an effort to reclaim middle-class voters who deserted the Democrats in last month's mid-term elections and to fulfill a promise President Clinton made during the 1992 campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton is expected to sketch the outlines of his tax proposals in a speech to be broadcast nationwide from the White House at 9 P.M. Thursday. The President's speech will be carried live on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, PBS and C-Span.
Perhaps $35 billion in cuts over the next five years would come in the form of a $500 per child tax credit for families earning less than $100,000 a year, with another $20 billion in tax deductions for post high school education, officials said.
To pay for the President's proposals, there would have to be compensating savings in a wide range of Government programs and agencies, including the sale to the private sector of some operations of the Department of Energy that produce electric power in western states.
These ideas were among the most popular that emerged after a two-and-a-half hour meeting with the President and his senior economic and political advisers this morning, officials said. But it was unclear tonight whether Mr. Clinton had given final approval, and several officials emphasized that the specifics could yet change.
Even before the White House proposal could be settled, House Democrats unveiled similar ideas on Tuesday. The President now faces the pressure of far more sweeping proposals from Congressional Republicans, including a letter today outlining a 10-point list of recommendations for Mr. Clinton's speech from the next Speaker of the House, Representative Newt Gingrich, and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole.
Among the suggestions in the letter, which was understood to have been suggested by Mr. Dole: That Mr. Clinton endorse a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, "recommit" himself to tax relief for working families, trim the bureaucracy and red tape, reform welfare and refuse to support or expand United Nations peacekeeping operations without Congressional agreement.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich also called on the President to announce that United States forces would assist the evacuation of United Nations peacekeepers from Bosnia only if the European allies first agree to support lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. The Administration's policy has been to shy away from imposing such a specific demand on the allies.
"The American people have afforded us an historic and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dramatically change government for the better," the letter reads. "And the American people aren't the only ones watching -- so is the world, and its young democracies emerging from generations of government oppression."
The White House tonight rejected one Republican proposal: That the Administration impose a moratorium on new regulations for the first 100 days of 1995. Calling the idea a "blunderbuss" in a letter to Mr. Gingrich, the Office of Management and Budget said it could harm food, health and labor standards.
Cooperation will not be easy. The House Republicans' "Contract With America" calls for a child tax credit about three times as costly as the one Mr. Clinton is considering. It would also offer $500 per dependent child, but with no age limit, and it would be extended to families earning up to $200,000. Nearly two-thirds of taxpayers have no dependents and would not benefit from the proposal.
White House officials said the 10- to 15-minute address, which Mr. Clinton wants to use to set a course for the second half of his term, would include many specifics on how the President hoped to help middle-class families. The details of his proposals for shrinking government and cutting spending are more likely to be embodied in his State of the Union and budget messages next month. Aides said tonight he would deliver the Thursday speech from the Oval Office, not his residence, as they had said earlier.
"We have a whole plan, a full circle," one aide said. "You won't see all the circle Thursday night."
One of the questions that remains unclear is precisely how an income tax credit would be structured. For example, officials said the full credit might be available for families with incomes up to $60,000, and phased down in value for families earning up to $100,000.
After promising a tax cut for the middle class in 1992, Mr. Clinton dropped the idea in favor of deeper deficit reduction last year, when Congress did pass an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit that amounted to a significant tax break for low-income working families.
Repeatedly, and especially since the Democrats' sweeping losses in the November elections, Mr. Clinton has said he wants to make good on his promise to do something for the middle class. Tax credits for worker education would be especially consistent with Mr. Clinton's longstanding beliefs, and similar ideas have been backed by labor unions and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council whose leaders have recently blamed Mr. Clinton for straying from the group's core beliefs.
The President and his top advisers have repeatedly said whatever tax cuts they proposed would be aimed squarely at working Americans -- which is why the White House has been particularly cool to Republican pressure to cut capital gains taxes.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Personal finance magazines are profiting from concern over financial markets.

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
IT seems most unlikely that 1994 will go down in history as a great year for the financial markets. Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index, are down close to 3 percent thus far, while the price of the 30-year Treasury bond has dropped so much that its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, is up nearly one-fourth.
Nevertheless, the four leading personal finance magazines -- Money, Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine, Smart Money and Worth -- all turned in good performances for the year and have realistic expectations for further growth in 1995. Why? 
 "We are running into a monumental wave of acute interest in personal finance," said W. Randall Jones, chief executive of Worth, which is owned by a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments. "In these uncertain times when the economy looks more like an electrocardiogram than the Great Plains of America, people are looking for answers and solutions."
David Carey, publisher of Smart Money, owned by the Hearst Corporation and Dow Jones & Company, offers a similar rationale. "Everyone today is essentially self-employed in that they have to take control of their retirement planning," he said. "If the business books like Business Week, Forbes and Fortune are about the life of business, then the personal finance magazines are about the business of life."
The four magazines reported significant advertising revenue increases for the first 11 months of this year over the corresponding period last year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. But discounting from the rate card is rampant in the magazine industry, leading to widespread skepticism of the numbers by some media buyers. Still, ad pages can be easily counted, and here, too, there were gains all around.
The largest ad-page percentage increases were racked up by the two new kids on the block, Smart Money, which soared 92 percent, to 828 pages, and Worth, which jumped 21 percent, to 612 pages. Kiplinger's rose 12 percent, to 790 pages, and Money continued in first place with 1,133 pages, although its gain was less than one percentage point.
Worth and Smart Money also posted big circulation gains of approximately 50 percent over the previous year, according to the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations for the period ended June 30. Worth posted paid subscription and single-copy volume of 391,000, and Smart Money had sales of just under 500,000 copies. Money and Kiplinger's sold many more copies -- the former about two million and the latter around one million -- but they both reported declines of 7 percent.
Whatever the editorial similarities among the personal finance magazines, each tries to maintain a distinct identity. One may claim that it attracts an audience with a larger household income and so will focus more articles on upper-income readers. Another may claim that its audience has greater educational achievements and therefore is more inclined to read magazine articles.
Perhaps the most extensive separate-identity program in this field is that of Money, which has behind it the resources of Time Inc., itself a unit of Time Warner Inc. In addition to the magazine, Money's other activities include the publication of the Money for Kids annual and two newsletters, the testing of an as-yet-unnamed magazine for young adults and the creation of three indexes: the Small Investor Index, the Consumer Comfort Index and the Cities Index.
"We are moving from a single magazine entity to a broad-based business of personal finance," said Michael Pepe, a group publisher who lists Money among his responsibilities. "It's the creation of what we call Money Inc."
With brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and other financial services companies moving more and more into each other's turf, the demand for ad space in the personal finance magazines could very well expand next year, regardless of market fluctuations.
"The appetite for personal finance guidance is so great that there is room for magazines that have different tones and different philosophies," said Knight A. Kiplinger, publisher of Kiplinger's. "The first cutbacks will be in the secondary books that don't generate the leads and the sales that the personal finance press does."

HEADLINE: Panel on a U.S. Benefits Overhaul Fails to Agree on Proposals

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
After 10 months of work, a Federal advisory commission said today that it could not agree on any specific proposals to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare or other Government benefit programs.
The commission's failure, at its final meeting today, bodes ill for efforts by Congress and President Clinton to deal with the same problems next year. Since Republicans took control of Congress in the November elections, both parties have been proposing tax cuts for the middle class and have vowed not to make any cuts in Social Security benefits. 
 "I feel some disappointment that we were unable to make specific, detailed, item-by-item recommendations," said Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who persuaded Mr. Clinton to create the 32-member commission and who then served as its chairman.
And addressing tax reduction, Mr. Kerrey said in an interview tonight, "Tax cuts are inconsistent with the spirit of the commission's work, especially if they make the long-term problem worse."
Buffeted by political crosswinds, the panel, many of whose members serve in Congress, voted 24 to 6 to send a letter to the President saying, "This commission could not reach agreement on the details of a plan to achieve our objective."
The objective, on which commission members generally did agree, was to eliminate disparities between the projected cost of Government benefit programs and the money available to pay for them over the next 35 years.
The panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, said lawmakers and policy analysts should take a much longer view of spending and tax proposals, assessing the likely effects over 30 years, rather than over the five-year period normally used in discussions of the budget.
Mr. Kerrey said the panel had served a useful purpose by measuring the problem and by laying out policy options. "I see it as a success," he said, asserting that Congress now had the information needed to change the laws governing Federal benefit programs.
Several commission said Congress and the President were racing to cut taxes for the middle class without adequately considering long-term effects. Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, the vice chairman of the commission, said no one seemed to be concerned about the long-term economic effects of "the tax-cut proposals now cropping up like mushrooms."
Robert Greenstein, a member of the commission who is an expert on antipoverty programs, said he feared that Republicans and Democrats would "get into a tax-cut bidding war that makes our problem much worse than it already is." And another commission member, Representative Alex McMillan, Republican of North Carolina, said politicians were rushing to provide "even more free lunches."
Mr. Kerrey had wanted to increase the age at which people qualify for Social Security and Medicare benefits, reduce benefit payments to affluent people and impose new limits on tax deductions.
Labor unions and spokesmen for the elderly attacked the proposals, saying they would gut the nation's social insurance programs. John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, called Mr. Kerrey's proposals a "slash and burn" approach and said they would reduce the standard of living for millions of workers and retirees.
Another critic was Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security, who expressed relief today at the inconclusive results of the panel's work. "It's a good resolution," he said. "They did no harm."
But Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican on the commission, said, "Inaction is a willful decision to consign our descendants to misery and bankruptcy." Another commission member, Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida, said, "Doing nothing is disaster." And Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, said, "If we do nothing, we'll self-destruct."
Mr. Greenstein said the letter to President Clinton was "a confession of failure." But another commission member, Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of America, denied that there was a crisis in Social Security or other benefit programs; he said the panel, in earlier accepting the assumption of a crisis, had failed to do its job of sorting fact from fiction.
In its report to Mr. Clinton, the commission said the Federal budget deficit was now equal to 2.3 percent of the nation's total economic output. If benefit programs are allowed to grow with no change in current law, it said, the deficit will be 19 percent of economic output in the year 2030.
Members of the commission repeatedly praised Mr. Kerrey as bold and courageous, but they said he had not laid the political groundwork for his recommendations. Indeed, they said, there was little discussion of the details. Representative C. Christopher Cox, Republican of California, said, "We have been unable to debate, consider or amend any of these recommendations." Alluding to the Republican victories on Nov. 8, Mr. Cox said, "Our commission has been overtaken by events."
Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, a member of the commission, said that Mr. Kerrey and his staff had not done enough work to estimate the effect of their proposals on the average person receiving Social Security or Medicare benefits. Likewise, when "my staff asked what kind of savings could be expected, in real dollars, over the next 5, 10 and 20 years," he said, "the commission did not have the data."
Other criticism of Mr. Kerrey came from outside the commission.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Mr. Kerrey had pressed the commission to accept his proposals "without any of the careful deliberation that such consequential decisions" require.
Lawrence T. Smedley, executive director of the National Council of Senior Citizens, said the true problem was not the generosity of Medicare but the rising cost of health care. Nothing proposed by Mr. Kerrey would curb such inflation, he said.

HEADLINE: After Year of Despair, Tobacco Farmers Enjoy Prospect of Better Times

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: THOMASVILLE, N.C., Dec. 9

 BODY:
This time last year, tobacco country was awash with doomsayers, and John Collett, a tobacco farmer for three decades, felt little but gloom.
Manufacturers were cutting domestic tobacco leaf purchases in favor of less expensive imports. Lawmakers and health experts were pressing for tough new restrictions on smoking. To finance its health care overhaul, the Clinton Administration was proposing a steep tobacco tax increase that could raise the cost of cigarettes to $4 a pack. 
 "In more than 30 years as a tobacco farmer, I sent two children to college and kept my wife in the clothes she likes," Mr. Collett said as he wandered his 150-acre farm. "But last year and before that it looked bleak for us farmers and I was just glad that I was 62 and not 32 and just starting out."
What a difference a year makes.
To the surprise of just about everyone in the industry, imports of foreign tobacco leaf declined this year while exports of American-blended cigarettes surged, swelling the demand for home-grown tobacco.
The call for a huge tobacco tax increase faded with the death of the Administration's health care plan. Furthermore, last month's elections cheered tobacco interests convinced that the new Republican-controlled Congress will be as hostile to new taxes and restrictions on smoking as the Democratic-controlled Congress was receptive.
The good news for tobacco country is likely to get still better on Thursday when the United States Department of Agriculture is to announce a sharply increased growing quota for tobacco farmers for 1995.
At the start of summer, growers thought the quota, which they accept in exchange for stabilized tobacco prices, would fall as much as 40 percent. Instead, the quota is expected to rise 16 percent to 19 percent, meaning farmers could sell at least 926 million pounds of tobacco in 1995, according to the growers group, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative and Stabilization Corporation.
A big reason for the increase is that manufacturers have declared that they would nearly double their purchases of top-grade flue-cured tobacco, to 570 million pounds in 1995 from 288 million pounds last year. The rest of the sales will be in burley tobacco.
"It's a surprising turnaround and I'm on cloud nine," said Mr. Collett as he examined his five curing barns packed with the crinkled, dry, golden leaves of tobacco.
That buoyancy is also evident at Tobacco Road, the Philip Morris plant 60 miles south at Concord, in Cabarrus County. There, for an average of $20 an hour, skilled technicians in pressed, tan uniforms work on a highly automated production line that spits out about 85 billion cigarettes a year, or up to 14,000 a minute.
The increases in export demand have meant boom times at the plant, with 40 percent of its output of Marlboros, the No. 1 selling cigarette worldwide, going overseas.
"We could have worked seven days a week and 12 hours a day since Labor Day to meet the demand, and many people did," said Amos L. McClorey, president of Local 229-T of the Bakers, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers International Union, which represents the unionized hourly workers among the plant's 1,800 employees.
"Three years ago we were on three- and four-day work weeks because of slack demand and the anti-smoking zealots poking holes in the industry left and right," he said. "And last year at about this time, management here was telling us to expect the same this year. But it didn't happen and there's been a real upswing now."
Canny politics, incessant marketing and good timing contributed to the upturn for tobacco and tobacco growers. Last year, as cigarette makers increased their use of cheaper imported tobacco, lawmakers from tobacco-growing states pushed through legislation that required manufacturers to have at least 75 percent American tobacco in their cigarettes.
Irate over the requirement, which took effect in January, manufacturers drastically lowered their planned 1994 purchases of newly harvested tobacco or tobacco in growers' inventories, choosing to use up their own extensive inventories instead. But then the demand for cigarettes surged overseas, forcing the manufacturers back into the auction barns this fall, said Tom Slane, an analyst with the Tobacco Merchants Association.
Agriculture Commissioner James Graham of North Carolina, who has seen tobacco's many ups and downs in the last 30 years, said cautiously that the prospects "look good for another year and perhaps even beyond that." For more than three years, he said, growers have been "perched at the edge of a cliff," and the upswing in the demand has let them draw back.
"It's like a reprieve to a dying man," Mr. Graham said.
As for the anti-smoking forces, they concede that the Republican victories in Congress and the cooling of the electorate's ardor for changes in health care make it far less likely that new taxes or new Federal restrictions on smoking will be passed any time soon. But Joe Marx, a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health, an umbrella lobbying group for anti-smoking and health advocates, said that efforts by state and local government to restrict tobacco had their own momentum.
Despite the conservative tide, he noted, 70 percent of California's voters rejected a proposition that would have weakened local smoking restrictions, while Arizona voters approved a 40 percent state tax increase on cigarettes.
Further, Mr. Marx said, the market forces generally favoring cheaper imported flue-cured tobacco have not disappeared and will continue to haunt domestic growers.
Before the upturn, tobacco growers had seen their sales drop to 798 million pounds last year from about 899 million pounds in 1992. In 1993, for the first time in a decade, the sale of the tobacco crop in North Carolina fell below $1 billion. The state is the nation's largest grower of the flue-cured tobacco, which makes up about 60 percent of most cigarettes made in the United States.
Domestic demand for cigarettes has been shrinking an average of 3 percent a year as the public has grown health conscious, putting dents in the $47 billion-a-year American tobacco industry. Tobacco companies had been able to offset this a bit with an average 2 percent annual growth in the $4.2 billion export market for American-made cigarettes, although that market decreased somewhat in 1993.
But this year tobacco exports came roaring back, encouraged by manufacturers' aggressive marketing of American-blended cigarettes, changing social patterns that made smoking more acceptable for women and the falling of some trade barriers. Projections suggest exports will jump 10 percent this year, to a record 216 billion cigarettes, from 195.5 billion cigarettes in 1993, said Mr. Slane, the tobacco analyst.
That kind of demand is allowing workers in cigarette plants like Concord's to tap into the good life long associated with tobacco growing.
"You see a lot of those around here lately," said Mr. McClorey, the union official, pointing to a Mercedes Benz among the cars leaving the plant during a recent shift change. "And those are hourly workers driving those cars, not executives."
The campus-like Tobacco Road factory, whose 2,100 acres are bathed in the sweet smell of tobacco leaves, sits in the heart of the state's traditional textile region but has become Cabarrus County's largest taxpayer, returning about $2.5 million a year in taxes to the county compared with about $900,000 from the textile plants.
Statewide employment in cigarette manufacturing plants has declined to 17,900 in 1994 from nearly 29,900 in 1965, said Thomas Faison, a senior associate with MDC Inc., an economic development consulting firm in Chapel Hill. But he and other analysts said that the declines reflect increased automation, higher productivity and increased capital investment in manufacturing.
While older plants in Richmond, Durham, N.C., or Louisville, Ky., have experienced layoffs in recent years, the 15-year-old Concord plant has trimmed staff through attrition.
"We haven't felt the decline in domestic demand for cigarettes here," said Terry Rowland, the Cabarrus County tax administrator. "And if there is any obsolescence in the tobacco industry it's not here at this plant."
Back at the Collett farm here in Thomasville, a smile spread over Mr. Collett's weathered face as he contemplated the future, his foot resting on 250 pounds of burlap-bundled tobacco stored in the cool, dry darkness of one of his barns. This tobacco and about 12,000 pounds more hanging in five curing barns were the excess he had grown over his 75,000-pound growing quota this year. The bumper crop was the result of good weather, good soil and superior growing techniques, he said with a wink.
It is not hard to understand why Mr. Collett was smiling: The crop from his relatively small farm should bring in about $140,000, far more than if he were growing peanuts or corn.
"I'll sell this the opening week of leaf season next August," said Mr. Collett, his hand sweeping in an arc to indicate the stored tobacco. "And with the increase in quota, I can still grow a good bit. There was a time in North Carolina when a family of four could live a year off of four acres of tobacco. You need more acres than that nowadays, but you can still make a good living."

HEADLINE: Transit Aides Flouting Rule On Residency

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
For 15 years, the Transit Authority has circumvented or ignored a requirement that its managers live in New York City, and as a result more than half of its senior officials reside outside the city, according to an audit released yesterday.
The study, conducted by the inspector general of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent organization, found that transit officials had "afforded little more than lip service" to the 1978 residency requirement, issuing dozens of waivers almost as a matter of course. 
 In fact, the policy was so widely disregarded that the Transit Authority has paid nearly $100,000 over the last four years to move seven newly hired executives from other parts of the country to suburban towns outside the city, said the inspector general, Henry P. Flinter.
"These waivers were little more than a vehicle for circumventing the residency policy while maintaining an aura of enforcement," Mr. Flinter said in the report. "If the T.A. does not believe in its residency policy and does not intend to enforce it, it should just be honest with the public and say so."
The Transit Authority's president, Alan F. Kiepper, acknowledged that his senior managers had been "less than ardent" in following the rules. He said the authority had been forced in many cases to bend the policy in order to attract highly skilled managers who were unwilling to trade suburban life in other cities for New York's urban environment and expensive private schools. "By having a strict residency policy, you restrict your choices," he said.
When the requirement is waived too often, however, the authority runs the risk that too many of the people making big decisions about the subways and buses do not in fact have to ride them, Mr. Kiepper said.
The residency requirement was established in 1978 at the request of former Mayor Edward I. Koch. Newly hired managers were asked to agree in writing to move to the city within six months of being appointed. No exceptions were allowed.
The idea was to help the city's economy and to insure the managers had first-hand experience with the bus and subway systems.
But the audit found the policy was never enforced. In the 1980's, waivers were granted freely, often for no reason at all, the report said. The audit's survey of managers who live outside the city found that about 60 percent gave no meaningful explanation for their request and 40 percent ignored the rule altogether, never even asking permission to live outside the city.
In 1990, the authority amended the policy, saying that it would allow waivers only when the residency policy created a hardship for an employee's spouse or family. But that decision backfired, the audit said. The guidelines were so vague that they became a vehicle for getting around the requirement while maintaining a veneer of enforcing it, the report said.
The results are clear. Of the 1,308 managers hired since the rule was adopted in 1978, about 512 -- or 39 percent -- still live outside the city. Counting the officials who were hired before 1978, it turns out that 42 percent of the 2,404 managers are not city residents.
Within the Transit Authority's upper echelon, the percentage is even greater: 52 percent of the executives making more than $98,000 a year live in suburbia. The list includes four of Mr. Kiepper's senior vice presidents: Jack Lusk, vice president for customer services, Jerome Forman, vice president for capital programs, Velva Edwards, who resigned yesterday as vice president for buses, and Albert C. Cosenza, the general counsel.
None of the four returned calls yesterday to discuss the policy.
The Giuliani administration, which has fought with the Transit Authority over the size of its bureaucracy and the salaries it pays its top officials, criticized the transit agency's handling of the residency requirement. First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said transit managers should be subject to the same residency requirement that city officials in charge of other services must comply with.
'When you have an agency that pays excessive salaries to its senior managers and doesn't require them to live in the city, there is a concern that there is not a sensitivity to keeping costs down so that we can avoid fare increase," said Mr. Powers, who makes $112,000 a year and lives in the city. "This is essentially a city agency, although independent, and it should have the same rules that apply to it."
Mr. Kiepper, who lives in Manhattan, said yesterday that he personally believes people with responsibility for buses and subways ought to live near them. But he said in many cases the authority has found it difficult to recruit managers if they are forced to desert their large suburban homes for cramped city quarters.
"I frankly think we need to take a tougher line on that," he said. "I am in favor of a more rigid enforcement. I am also in favor of a better policy."
But the improved policy Mr. Kiepper has in mind would in effect render the rule meaningless for most managers. In a letter to the auditors, Mr. Kiepper said the authority had drafted new guidelines that would let most managers live anywhere within the 12 suburban counties in New York State and 2 counties in Connecticut that are served by the M.T.A.
Asked about the proposal, Mr. Kiepper said he still wanted his senior managers and their deputies to live in New York City. "I think a distinction needs to be made between people who really manage the service and who make decisions about the quality and frequency of service as compared to people at lower levels who don't have that much of a direct impact," he said.
Mr. Kiepper also said the authority should be able to make exceptions in order to keep a highly skilled person. "Some judgment has to be used," he said. "Its obvious that from the figures we erred on the side of granting too many waivers and we have to right that equation and be tougher."

Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday after a report on consumer prices confirmed many investors' expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates this month.
Treasury notes and bills, which are more sensitive to increases by the Fed in overnight bank loan interest rates, rallied yesterday, while the long end of the market declined. 
 The price of the two-year note rose 6/32 , to 9913/32 , for a yield of 7.58 percent, down from 7.68 percent on Tuesday. The price of the 30-year bond fell 1/8, to 9528/32 , for a yield of 7.86 percent, up from 7.85 percent on Tuesday. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The mixed results came after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, but only two-tenths of 1 percent when food and energy prices were excluded.
The increases met the market's expectations, and bonds rallied early in the session on the news.
With the report showing that inflation is running at the same 2.7 percent annual pace as last year, chances that the Fed will raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting on Tuesday "are getting smaller and smaller by the minute," said Terrence Pigott, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.
If the Fed does surprise traders and investors by raising rates for the seventh time since February, "it would be very bullish for the long end of the bond market," said Gerry Guild, head trader at Advest Inc. The Fed has raised the Federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 3 percent at the beginning of the year.
In the municipal market, yields on many of the $693 million in new issues that came to market attracted investors, traders said.
Many of yesterday's new issues attracted interest from money managers looking to buy bonds in anticipation of a slowdown in issuance next year, traders said.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues fell to 6.98 percent, from 7.01 percent on Tuesday.
In the corporate market, ERP Operating L.P., an apartment house property manager, sold $100 million of notes, while Clark USA Inc. scrapped plans to raise as much as $250 million by selling junk bonds and stock.
The decision by Clark to shelve its sales may jeopardize its planned purchase of a Texas oil refinery. Clark is an oil-refining unit of the Horsham Corporation of Toronto.
Clark was planning to use the proceeds to finance its $214 million purchase of a Port Arthur, Tex., refinery from the Chevron Corporation., which was expected to be completed tomorrow.
Mortgage-backed securities of the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, rallied amid expectations that the Clinton Administration would present a plan today to shrink the role of the Federal Housing Administration in insuring mortgages of low-income borrowers.
A diminished F.H.A. role might curb Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through sales, since 70 percent of the mortgages backing those bonds are guaranteed by the agency, said Lakhbir Hayre, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. The other 30 percent of the loans are guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. A pass-through is a security that passes income from debtors through intermediaries to investors.
Speculation about a decline in issuance of Ginnie Mae bonds prompted some buying.
The benchmark Ginnie Mae 9 percent pass-throughs delivered in January rose 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 bond, to 10023/32 , where they yield 8.96 percent. The yield is 114 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note, down from 119 basis points yesterday. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Refilling Forstmann's War Chest

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
It will be difficult for Forstmann Little & Company to top 1994.
By Christmas, Forstmann Little, the New York leveraged buyout firm, will spend $2.1 billion to complete the purchase of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company's stable of computer magazines and the Thompson-Minwax line of paint and wood-care products. Earlier this year, it cashed in on two previous buyouts, generating bundles of profits for the firm's investors. 
 Adding fame to fortune, a founding partner, Theodore J. Forstmann, was recently linked romantically to the Princess of Wales, a rumor that he says is inaccurate and that put his face on the cover of at least one supermarket tabloid.
But after all the gold and glitter of this remarkable year, the 16-year-old buyout firm is now expected to return to an essential, if more prosaic, task: raising money. With his war chest now nearly empty, Mr. Forstmann will try to find roughly $2.5 billion in fresh capital in January, according to private investors familiar with the company's plans. To succeed, he will have to convince Wall Street that he is still hungry enough -- at age 54 and with a fortune estimated between $250 million and $500 million -- to continue fighting for the best deals.
Mr. Forstmann, in a four-hour interview at his Manhattan office, carefully dodged the question of whether and when he would approach investors. But he acknowledged that his firm, with just $300 million left after the $1.4 billion Ziff-Davis transaction closes next Wednesday, would be unable to do any new deals of similar size unless it raised new capital.
"All I can say is that I haven't decided," he said, "but I have a record I'm very proud of."
When the books are closed on the 18 deals in Forstmann Little's current portfolio, limited partners will have gotten back at least $4.9 billion from an investment of $1 billion made between 1980 and 1992. The successes include the Dr Pepper Company, now the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, and the Topps Company, the bubble gum and trading card maker, both in 1984. The 1990 deal to buy the giant General Instrument Corporation, a maker of cable television equipment, was also lucrative.
Those profits are certain even if all four of Forstmann's uncompleted deals are written off as a total loss, which he said was an extremely unlikely outcome. More realistically, if the firm can eke out at least a modest return on its last troubled investments -- the most promising is the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation -- investors could recover as much as $6 billion on their $1 billion outlay, according to Wall Street estimates.
Despite this highly profitable track record, many Forstmann watchers wonder whether today's big pension managers, who are coveted and courted by every partnership and hedge fund on the Street, will agree to grant the firm the same fees and profits as its earlier investors.
"I'm not interested in haggling over terms," Mr. Forstmann said, slicing one hand through his silver hair. "I've never changed a comma of these agreements over the years. If some guy wants to change them, his remedy is to invest with somebody else."
Speaking quietly but firmly, he added with a frown: "I know the kind of relationship I wanted to have with my investors, and I have done everything I can to keep my promises to them. If that's not good enough, then fine. I don't need it. But I'll tell you this: If I start out to raise money, I'll finish. I think it would be virtually fraudulent for me to go raise money and not plan to be here for its investment."
That's pure essence of Teddy Forstmann: intense, proud, competitive and, yes, a bit sanctimonious. And "pure Forstmann" is just what will make his new money-raising exercise so fascinating to Wall Street.
It has been nearly a decade since Mr. Forstmann stepped up to the pulpit to deliver his first, fierce sermons to Wall Street in general -- and to his rivals in the leveraged buyout business at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company in particular. Warning of the evils of using junk bonds, he argued that the only virtuous way to finance buyouts was the way he did them.
His firm often put up as much as two-thirds of the purchase price, with the cash coming from its equity fund, augmented by money borrowed on easy terms from the firm's debt investment fund. The debt fund can afford to be lenient because it also shares in the equity of the newly privatized company.
Sure enough, when the junk bond market faltered in the early 1990's, a host of buyouts arranged by rivals limped into bankruptcy court. By contrast, only one Forstmann deal has seen the inside of Chapter 11. That is the Pullman Company, the only deal that had junk bonds outstanding before the buyout. Pullman filed a prepackaged reorganization plan last month.
"Pullman is a company we shouldn't have bought," Mr. Forstmann readily acknowledged. "We got a good price, but price is about fourth on my list of priorities -- a very distant fourth. It had no significant core business, no dominant market share, no serious growth potential and it was too hooked to the economy."
The failure, Mr. Forstmann reflected with a self-deprecatory smile, was perhaps still useful as a reminder that "there is so much more risk in what I do than I thought there was."
"I really did think you could do things without ever having a problem," he said.
Mr. Forstmann's tone is not all that has changed since the days when he was scolding the Street. The eight-partner firm has undergone a quiet transformation over the last two years. W. Brian Little, the co-founder, has ceded supervision of day-to-day activities to Mr. Forstmann and his brother, Nicholas C. Forstmann, another co-founder. John A. Sprague, one of the early deal-makers, has left to start his own firm. Younger partners -- Steven B. Klinsky, a scout for new deals, and Sandra J. Horbach, whose career began at Morgan Stanley -- are emerging from Mr. Forstmann's considerable shadow. And Daniel F. Akerson, formerly president of the MCI Communications Corporation, has been recruited to add management depth.
Still, no one on Wall Street can imagine the firm without Teddy Forstmann's presence. And one need not follow Buckingham Palace gossip to know that Mr. Forstmann is deeply committed to political and philanthropic concerns that go far beyond Wall Street.
He was a national co-chairman of President George Bush's unsuccessful 1992 re-election campaign. He personally collected and delivered relief supplies to Bosnian refugees -- a commitment that inadvertently helped generate those rumors about the Princess of Wales. He said he talked with her about Bosnia at two circumspect dinner parties, one a large formal gathering in London to promote Gulfstream Aerospace, the other a party at the Georgetown home of Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company. (Romance was on neither menu, the lifelong bachelor snapped, closing the subject.)
Despite his outside interests, Mr. Forstmann remains intensely involved in the firm's portfolio, his colleagues say. He is managing the turnaround effort at Gulfstream, and he personally negotiated a key element of the Ziff-Davis deal with the Ziff family.
Ms. Horbach, who joined the firm seven years ago, dismissed fears that Mr. Forstmann would abandon Wall Street for Washington. "He would be very frustrated by all the bureaucracy," she said. "It's true Ted is not motivated by money; he has certainly made more money than I can imagine. But he does love the challenge of each new deal -- finding the deal, winning the deal, and then making the deal work."
For a long time, finding the deal was the hard part. From January 1992 until last month, the company did not complete a single buyout because it was unable to find one that met its criteria. Then, almost back to back, came the opportunities to buy the Thompson-Minwax line from the Eastman Kodak Company, and the Ziff-Davis publishing venture from the Ziff family heirs.
Looking to the future, Mr. Forstmann says the biggest problem may be coping with the consequences of his own success. Many of his investors place self-imposed "asset allocation" limits on the share of their investments devoted to high-risk, high-return ventures like his. "All the equity they still hold in our deals, which is worth many times what it was originally worth, still counts as an allocation to me," he said.
But if he decides to raise fresh capital, there is a simple way around that obstacle, he notes with a shrug. They can just put more of their eggs in Teddy Forstmann's basket.

HEADLINE: Caucasus Rebels Attack, Downing Russian Copter

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Responding to their leader's appeal to fight the Russians "until they die of fear and horror," separatist fighters in the Chechnya republic today shot down a Russian helicopter 25 miles west of the regional capital and attacked the Russian troops ringing the city.
Film taken after the helicopter was shot down showed Chechen soldiers throwing the co-pilot, who may have been alive, into a ditch by the side of the road. The pilot was killed in the crash. 
 Thursday is the deadline President Boris N. Yeltsin has given for the secessionists to lay down their weapons. In a statement tonight the Russian Government repeated its threat to "use all means necessary to restore order" in Chechnya, an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation.
"We confirm our intention to put an end to the bloodshed in the zone of the Chechen conflict," the statement said. "Those who fail to lay down their arms by Dec. 15 will be responsible for the consequences of their criminal recklessness."
The oil-rich region is important to Russia because oil from Russia's Caspian oil fields passes through pipelines in Chechnya to the Black Sea, where it is pumped aboard tankers for export.
But the chances for peace grew less likely by the hour today after the Chechen delegation abruptly walked out of truce negotiations in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia, 50 miles from Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
Pitched battles erupted at several points near Grozny. Russian television tonight showed film of dozens of houses aflame in Pervomaiskaya, 10 miles northwest of Grozny. Russian forces there launched missile attacks, according to reports from the scene.
The overall number of casualties is not clear.
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Nikolai Yegorov, told the Interfax news agency that Russian troops would not storm Grozny before Thursday, the deadline. It was the first time a senior Russian official had implied so directly that Russian forces are prepared to do just that.
Grozny seemed to be under siege today, according to reports from the capital. Streets were deserted, many shops were closed and prices were shooting up.
At the other side of the border, edgy Russian officials kept a tight lid on information, banning reporters from visiting military hospitals, interviewing soldiers or entering the military command post in Mozdok, Ingushetia.
And in Moscow tonight, the police began to sweep through train and subway stations and to stop cars to prevent possible terrorist attacks. The police have increased already common searches of anyone they suspect is from Chechyna.
Vice President Al Gore arrived in Moscow today, and while the issue of Chechnya will be addressed in discussions with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Washington repeated its general support of Russia in what it views as an internal dispute.
Vladimir F. Shumeiko, the speaker of the upper house, spoke today in favor of the tough line, calling Chechnya a "shelter for criminals from all over the country." Mr. Shumeiko described the breakaway republic this way: "A spreading cancer can only be removed by surgical intervention, however sad that may be."
But others in Moscow, supporters and opponents of Mr. Yeltsin, warned that Russia seemed to be on the verge of a long, hopeless struggle for a region it might never fully control. They expressed concern that any war in Chechnya could quickly spread to nearby regions, none of which are politically stable.
Mr. Yeltsin ordered tanks and troops into Chechnya on Sunday to end what has become a three-year drive for independence.
"You would have to know absolutely nothing about Russian history to behave in the Caucasus like a bull in a china shop," said Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky, a member of the parliament faction headed by the economic reformer Grigory A. Yavlinsky. "The war Russia fought for decades under the czars never led to victory, even though Russia had an army with the same strength as the one that defeated Napoleon. The war ended only when it was resolved that people in the Caucasus could live as they pleased."
Newspaper editorialists and liberal politicians attacked the President, questioning the timing of the invasion and voicing concern that the political tensions and fears will be used as a pretext to introduce a state of emergency in Moscow and other cities where Chechens live and work.
But in North Ossetia, which Chechnya has not always had friendly relations with, some residents said Russia should storm Grozny without delay.
"They are criminals," said Nina I. Karayeva, 72, a retired teacher in Vladikavkaz. Referring to the Chechen president, Dzhokar Dudayev, she added, "If I had a Kalashnikov, I would shoot him myself."
Mr. Dudayev, a former Soviet Army general, said Russia had increased the likelihood of all-out war. "I call on the population to wage war with Russia until it leaves the territory of Chechnya," he said in a television address, which he delivered in combat fatigues. "We have no other option. The earth should burn under the Russian occupiers."
Russian television reported that this evening, Mr. Dudayev moved from his office on the ninth floor of the presidential palace in Grozny to his basement bunker, where at least eight of the dozens of captured Russian troops are reportedly being held.
Mr. Dudayev warned that if his palace was assaulted, the prisoners would be treated according to "the rules of war." He did not appear to be referring to the Geneva Conventions.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise Moderately

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Inflation continued at a moderate pace while a rising tide of goods flowed out of the nation's factories and mines in November, according to Government reports made public today. Together, they provided new evidence of the American economy's robust health.
Stocks rose as investors interpreted the economic statistics as a signal that a prosperous economy would reward long-term investments while inflation would not significantly erode the returns. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.95 points to close at 3,746.29. [Page D8.] 
 But the bond market, after rallying early, was more circumspect. It dropped slightly as the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to 7.86 percent from 7.85. [Page D18.]
With only the final month's report to go, it now appears all but certain that 1994 will end as the third year in a row in which consumer prices advanced by less than 3 percent.
The Clinton Administration welcomed today's reports, pointing out that consumer prices are only 2.8 percent higher than a year ago. "We're ending 1994 with the same good-news message about the economy we've had all year -- the economy continues to show strong growth with modest and stable inflation," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said this afternoon.
Private economists were also enthusiastic. "This is about as good as it can get -- pretty good production and low inflation," said Sung W. Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis. "What more can you want?"
Some experts also said that the figures made it less likely that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates when its top policy-making committee meets on Tuesday.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, "does not want to be the Grinch that stole Christmas," said Kenneth A. Guenther, a former Fed official who is now the executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, a Washington-based trade group.
But some monetary-policy economists disagreed, saying that the economy's sheer unrelenting strength may yet cause Fed officials to want to take action next week because of worries that inflationary shortages of scarce materials and skilled workers may develop.
Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said that recent signs of strong car sales and other retail sales, coupled with today's figures, had persuaded him to raise the odds of a rate increase on Dec. 20 to one in two from one in three.
"The odds have been creeping higher," he said, adding that Fed officials may be further influenced by the latest figures on housing starts, which the Commerce Department will issue on Friday.
Led by rising gasoline prices, the Consumer Price Index rose by three-tenths of a percentage point in November, the Labor Department said today. It was the biggest increase since August, after increases of a tenth of a percentage point in October and two-tenths of a percentage point in September, but was still within the expectations of most economic forecasters.
Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile and do not always signal broader inflation trends, the index rose by only two-tenths of a percentage point.
The output of factories, mines, electric utilities and other industry rose by half a percentage point from October, the Fed announced today. Industry operated at 84.7 percent of full capacity, the highest level since April 1989. That is again approaching the 85 percent level often linked to higher inflation.
Today's generally benign consumer price figures masked two possible hints of trouble ahead. The overall index was held down by a drop in apparel prices as warm weather forced stores to offer discounts on winter clothing, and by a drop in new-car prices because of a seasonal adjustment.
Now that colder weather has hit and with demand for new cars remaining strong, both drops could be reversed soon. "Certainly in apparel and car sales, we will see higher prices in December and January," Mr. Sohn said.
The Producer Price Index, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday, also showed that raw materials prices were rising quickly, as are prices for so-called intermediate goods like steel that are used in making finished products like cars. Mr. Greenspan has warned that these rising prices may eventually be reflected in consumer prices.
Ms. Tyson tried to respond to these worries in her statement today, pointing out that labor costs have barely risen this year. Some other economists say this reflects the rising efficiency of American workers and a willingness on the part of many workers to accept relatively slow increases in wages because of fears of losing their jobs.
"As long as wage pressures remain in check," Ms. Tyson said, "an acceleration of overall inflation is unlikely."
Medical care costs, the subject of considerable political debate this year, rose only three-tenths of a percentage point in November after an increase of six-tenths of a percentage point in October.
By contrast, the Labor Department's index of entertainment costs jumped seven-tenths of a percentage point, led by rising costs for sports equipment and fees for participant sports. The department's food and beverage index rose two-tenths of a percent in November, with a substantial rise in fresh vegetable prices.
The index of gasoline prices rose six-tenths of a percentage point, but remained 14.3 percent below its peak in December 1990. Airline fares dropped 4.2 percent in November, and, adjusted for seasonal variation, were 7.7 percent lower than in August as carriers have competed vigorously for market share by offering many discounts.

A Land Apart: A Canadian Looks South Sourly

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
When American invaders crossed the Niagara frontier during the War of 1812, they came upon the family farm of one of the forebears of the author Robertson Davies and were astonished to find angry youths shooting at them from the farmhouse windows.
"They thought we'd be delighted to lay down the hateful British yoke, but they didn't think they were bringing another kind of yoke with them," said the man some consider to be Canada's greatest living writer. 
 Four of his ancestors fell in that engagement, the Battle of Stoney Creek, and he is proud that it helped to turn the tide against the invaders.
That Canadians are distinct from Americans is a subtheme of his novels, the most famous of which are the Deptford trilogy, "Fifth Business," "The Manticore" and "World of Wonders." In the 11th and latest novel, "The Cunning Man," the aging hero -- not unlike his 81-year-old creator -- rues the withering of Canada's British connection and the growth of the American connection "under the caress of the iron hand and buckskin glove."
Greg Gatenby, the literary scholar who directs the Harborfront International Reading Series in Toronto, said that "in anyone's delineation of the pantheon of Canadian writers, Davies holds a place close to Zeus."
With his magnificent snowy beard, great white mane and protuberant brow, Mr. Davies has a magisterial look as well. As he talked about his views of Canadian nationality on a recent day, wisps of sunlight filtered into his second-floor office above the red-brick quadrangle at Massey College, the University of Toronto's graduate college, where he is the founding master.
Mr. Davies, who was born in Ontario, said the biggest difference between Canada and the United States is in their underlying myths. "The myth of America is a very powerful one and one that we in Canada look toward with envy," he said. "You have your heroes. You have your great men of the past, you have your myth of tradition, of the conquering of the west, and the pioneer life and the gold rush life and all that sort of thing, which is enormously romantic, and nations feed on the romantic tradition."
"We don't go for heroes," he said. "As soon as a man begins to achieve some sort of high stature, we want to cut him down and get rid of him, embarrass him."
He also sees Canada as "very much a northern country -- much more like Scandinavia or Russia than the United States." Moreover, he went on, "Canada is a socialist monarchy. You hate monarchies and socialism -- and we're both."
Mr. Davies is just as eager to see Canada hold together as he is to avoid an American yoke.
"The present hullabaloo about Quebec is precisely that," he said. "It will not die down, but it will not come to anything."
He contends that economic considerations will keep Quebec in the fold. "What happens to the thousands of French Canadian civil servants who are no longer on the public payroll?" he said. "They're suddenly going to be without a job, and certainly the new Quebec wouldn't be able to provide them with comparable income. And what would Quebec do with its share of the national debt? They wouldn't want to shoulder it."
He also expects pressure from the United States. "I don't imagine for one instant that the United States wants a balkanized Canada to the north," he said. The United States says officially that it supports a strong and united Canada.
Quebec separatism is Canada's civil war, Mr. Davies said, but unlike the American Civil War, he predicted, it will not become violent. "Our civil war is a psychological one," he said. "It's a tough kind of war to fight because it's very wearing. There is never any letup. There is never any cease-fire. There is never any stopping to celebrate Christmas."
His comments about French Canadians underscore the observation of Richard C. Davis, professor of Canadian literature at the University of Calgary, that Mr. Davies "comes from a traditional male, English-Canadian base."
The French are "always complaining," Mr. Davies contended. "They have never got over the defeat on the Plains of Abraham," the battle in 1759 that established British rule in Canada.
"They're terribly unrealistic about this sort of thing, but they are also very shrewd and very practical," he said. "They know the dollar better than they know their mothers, and if they think that is threatened by leaving the dominion, they will stay."
Mr. Davies's reflections on politics come from a certain academic distance.
His cozy office is dominated by a large writing desk, bookcases and portraits of Shakespeare, Rabelais, Robert Burton -- whose "Anatomy of Melancholy" provides inspiration for the latest novel -- and John Cowper Powys, the 19th-century novelist whom Mr. Davies called "a great, great, undervalued man."
With the help of a secretary, he handles correspondence in the office and researches current projects. For example, he is now working on an article for the Dictionary of National Biography on a 19th-century English actor, Henry Irving. But his main creative work is done on his 150-acre estate in the hills of Caledon East, about an hour from downtown Toronto, where he lives with his wife, Brenda.
He taught literature at the university for 21 years and still confers with students, including many, he volunteers, who ask whether getting a job on a newspaper would harm their writing style.
A former editor of The Peterborough Examiner, as well as an actor and playwright, he tells them that journalism "teaches you to write more concisely and to get busy and write when you must, instead of just sitting around waiting for the inspiration, which isn't going to come."
And if students are making noise below, he has no qualms about opening his window, looking down sternly, beard flowing, and thundering, "God is watching!"

HEADLINE: Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda But Split on How to Reach Goals

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
Americans say they now trust the Republicans in the new Congress more than President Clinton to make good decisions on major social issues. But most remain uninformed about the Republicans' "Contract With America" and they are leery of Newt Gingrich's proposals on orphanages and a Constitutional amendment on school prayer, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
While there is broad public support for substantial change and, in general, for limiting the welfare system, balancing the Federal budget and allowing organized prayer in schools, that support splinters on the details of how to achieve these goals. 
 For instance, although nearly two-thirds of the respondents favored permitting organized prayer in public schools, about the same number said they would not want to change the Constitution to allow it.
"Those guys 200 years ago knew what they were doing," said Stanley Jaremko, a Republican from Queens who works as a fire marshal. "That's a bad thing to start off doing, because once you change one thing, then maybe you go into another thing and then, before you know it, the whole Constitution's different."
Mr. Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, and other Republicans have portrayed the mid-term elections as a referendum on their policies and leadership, as they prepare to try to end Washington's domination over social programs by replacing many of them with grants to state governments. Mr. Gingrich has been talking in grand terms about refashioning American civilization and values.
It is not surprising that most people like the basic thrust of the Contract on social issues, even though they may not have heard of the document itself. Mr. Gingrich and his allies molded the contract after extensive Republican polling to test the public's attitudes.
But the new poll suggests that the meaning of the election is far less conclusive than Mr. Gingrich suggests. Many of those polled were still fuzzy on such fundamental matters as Mr. Gingrich's identity.
"Who the hell is that?" asked Don Sherrod, 28, of Florence, Ala., an automobile painter who was one of a number of respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews after taking part in the poll. "Maybe I've seen him on TV, speaking and stuff. But when I come home from work, I'm tired, and I want to sit down in what little time I have and play the guitar a bit."
About the Contract With America, the collection of legislative proposals that Mr. Gingrich plans to bring to a vote in the House in the first 100 days of the new Congress, Mr. Sherrod said, "I'd like to have somebody tell me more about it."
Although Mr. Gingrich has been waving around his copy of the Contract with America, which was printed in TV Guide, 72 percent of those polled said they had not read or heard anything about it. And 65 percent said they still did not know enough about Washington's most celebrated politician to have an opinion of him.
Those familiar with the Georgian have a negative impression of him, by 2 to 1. Only 11 percent held a favorable opinion of him, but those 11 percent are expecting big things.
"I like his fire," said Susan Wuori, 44, a teacher from Guyton, Ga. "He's going to yell and scream and make a difference."
The new poll, conducted Dec. 6 through 9, included telephone interviews with 1,147 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Most of those polled had doubts about Mr. Gingrich's proposal that welfare benefits should be denied to young mothers and the money used to promote adoptions or Boys Town-like orphanages for their children. The public instead seemed to side more with President Clinton, who said "Governments don't raise children -- parents do."
Seventy-two percent said the children of young mothers with no income were still better off living with their mothers on welfare than being placed in foster care or a government-run orphanage; only 20 percent said the children would be better off if institutionalized.
"I almost wound up in an orphanage myself as a child when we lost our mother and our father gave us up, and it terrorized me," said Janice Evanson, 48, a computer marketing specialist from Aloha, Ore. "I wouldn't want it to happen to anyone else."
While those polled seemed reluctant to amend the Constitution, a majority said they would welcome the recitation of prayers from many religions in the public schools. Most wanted parents or students to choose the prayers to be said, rather than a school board, principals or teachers.
"I want prayer back in the schools but there are so many different religions now," said Wendy Cardona, 23, the mother of two small boys who works in a factory in Buffalo, putting foam into chair seats and bed packings. "We pray to Jesus. Someone else prays to some other statue. I don't want my son praying to Buddha."
People say they trust Republicans in Congress more than the President to make good decisions on welfare (by 60 to 28 percent); on balancing the budget (60 to 28 percent), and on school prayer (49 to 33 percent).
Mr. Clinton's overall job performance rating has dipped since November's Republican sweep, with only 38 percent expressing approval. In early November, 43 percent approved.
At first, Mr. Clinton's greater attention to foreign policy seemed to pay off with higher approval ratings; in early November, he had a 49 percent approval in foreign policy. But now that rating has slipped to 36 percent.
His rating on handling the economy has ticked up slightly, with 41 percent now expressing approval, compared with the 37 percent offering approval before the election.
But this is a matter that continues to trouble and confuse White House advisers, who do not understand why Mr. Clinton does not get a big boost from the healthier economy: 49 percent of those polled disapprove of Mr. Clinton's handling of the economy.
The public overwhelmingly favors overhauling the welfare system and balancing the budget. But when those polled are asked about specifics, their desires grow murky.
Americans hold overwhelmingly negative views of welfare recipients, for instance, and would like to place limits on how long someone can receive benefits, as the Republicans propose to do. But people also respond very positively to requiring welfare recipients to enroll in Government-sponsored work programs, a proposal of Mr. Clinton.
Seventy-one percent favor allowing welfare recipients in a work program to receive benefits "as long as they are willing to work for them," rather than being cut off after a year or two, as some Republicans propose.
Americans feel so strongly about the work ethic that 59 percent say they are willing to pay more in taxes to provide job training and public service jobs for people on welfare so they can get off welfare.
Despite their instinct for compassion, the public judges those on welfare harshly. More than half say welfare recipients could get along without it if they tried. Another 53 percent said that when people are on welfare, it is because of a lack of effort rather than because of circumstances beyond their control.
"The values and priorities of these families are really out of whack, I think," said Ms. Wuori, the Georgia teacher who says she has worked with underprivileged children for 20 years. "We know that they don't always use their food stamps to buy nutritious food. We know that the kids show up in class wearing $125 sneakers. The Government needs to work it out so that it's not a penalty for those on welfare to work. They need to work and live and start seeing the fruits of their work."
Another contradictory response came on the balanced budget amendment. While 81 percent said they favored an amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002, most people were not willing to pay the consequences.
Support for the amendment tumbled to 41 percent if it would require the public to pay more in Federal income taxes. Support for the amendment fell to just 30 percent if it would require cuts in Social Security. Support fell to 27 percent if it would require cuts in Medicare. It fell even further, to just 22 percent, if it would require cuts in spending on education.
Asked what she would give up to balance the budget, a 74-year-old retired shoe factory worker in Lebanon, Pa., who identified herself merely as Mildred, ruminated about saving "oodles of money" by cutting funds for the security of former Presidents and for military bands overseas.
Then she laughed. "There ain't going to be any balanced budget," she predicted. "Not as long as there's a world."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 6 through 9 with 1,147 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for blacks it is plus or minus nine percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Carl Marzani, 82, 'Loyalty' Case Defendant, Dies

 BODY:
Carl Marzani, a former employee of the Office of Strategic Services and the State Department imprisoned after being convicted of hiding his Communist Party affiliation from Government loyalty examiners, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
The cause was heart failure, said his son Anthony. 
 Mr. Marzani worked for the O.S.S. and the State Department during World War II. He was convicted in Federal District Court in Washington in 1947. In instructing the jury, Judge Richmond B. Keech said: "This court is not concerned with Communist vices. The issue is whether the defendant knowingly, willfully and feloniously made false statements to Government loyalty examiners."
Mr. Marzani was charged with lying about his Communist Party membership to keep his State Department job. The Government also contended that he had been a Communist organizer in New York.
During the trial, he denied that he had ever been a Communist Party member. Afterward, he called the trial "a travesty."
The case went to the Supreme Court twice. The court's deliberations ended both times, in 1948 and 1949, in tie votes by the Justices, with one abstaining. That left the conviction standing, and Mr. Marzani spent more than two years in prison.
On Monday, Anthony Marzani said his father had resigned from the Communist Party in 1941, after having been a member for two years.
Over the years, Carl Marzani was an economics instructor, film director and book-club co-owner. His writings include three volumes of memoirs in print from Topical Books in Manhattan. Two more volumes are to come out.
Born in Italy, Mr. Marzani graduated from high school in Scranton, Pa., and studied at Williams College and Oxford University.
His 1937 marriage to Edith Eisner ended in divorce.
In addition to his son Anthony, of Manhattan, he is survived by his second wife, Charlotte Pomerantz, whom he married in 1966; another son, Daniel, of Manhattan; two daughters, Judith Cutler and Gabrielle Marzani, both of Manhattan; a sister, Marcella Cullington of Perry, Ga., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 30.95 on Price and Factory Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In unusually heavy trading, the stock market rallied across the board yesterday, defying many analysts' expectations that stock prices would fall.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.95 points, to 3,746.29, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 4.82 points, to 454.97. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 6.18 points, to 725.67. 
 Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 2 to 1, or 1,565 gainers and 771 losers on the New York Stock Exchange. Still, 133 stocks established new lows and only 16 set new highs.
The stock market generally tracked the bond market yesterday, but kept on rising even when bond prices fell near the end of the day. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.86 percent from 7.85 percent.
The proximate cause of yesterday's rally appeared to be moderate inflation prospects as reflected in the Government's Consumer Price Index for November, which came in around the level of Wall Street expectations. At the same time, industrial output rose by half a percentage point in November, showing a prosperous economy.
If the price index had shown signs of accelerating inflation -- in other words, evidence that the Federal Reserve had miscalculated and had not raised interest rates enough -- the market would have plunged, analysts say. The low numbers ease, at least for now, traders' worries that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates at its policy-making meeting next Tuesday.
"We've had a run of bad markets lately, so we just needed some sort of spark to set off a rally," said James R. Solloway, director of research at Argus Research. Many analysts had expected the market to fall because they estimated that stocks were overpriced by 10 to 15 percent.
But Mr. Solloway cautioned that the market might be driven by largely technical factors, meaning that traders were buying and selling for the needs of their own portfolios, rather than responding to news events or economic reports.
For example, Mr. Solloway said, traders in recent weeks may have been selling stocks in anticipation of a reduced capital gains tax next year or engaging in "window dressing," selling poor performers and loading up on a few strong performers to improve the appearance of a portfolio.
Whatever the case, the market may have become oversold for the short term, and thus prices for many stocks became too low to ignore, he said.
The Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, with the so-called core rate, which excluded volatile food and energy costs, rising only two-tenths of 1 percent. If December continues at this moderate pace, annual inflation for this year will come in at under 3 percent.
Many stocks rose. Nextel, after falling for much of the year, jumped 2 3/8, to 15 7/8. Nextel and another operator of networks similar to that of cellular telephones, American Mobile Systems, said they would proceed with their previously announced agreement in which Nextel would own a controlling interest in American Mobile. Agreements with other companies had been delayed earlier in the year.
Novell, a computer software developer, fell 1 3/8, to 15 7/8, after Novell reported fourth-quarter earnings that were below Wall street expectations. Novell was the most actively traded stock at 15.2 million shares in some 5,400 trades. MCI Communications, the next most active stock at 5.7 million shares, involved fewer than 2,000 trades. MCI fell 5/8, to 18 1/2.

HEADLINE: New York Is Just Dandy (if You're From Another Country)

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
New York is falling apart? Mean-spirited? Expensive? A terrifying urban jungle?
Nah. Not, at least, if you're from another country. 
 Turns out New York City is a nicer place to visit than many foreign tourists think it's going to be before they arrive.
Such is the finding of a new study of tourism in the metropolitan area released yesterday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Certainly any New Yorker who has ever traveled abroad and been asked whether life here really is the way it is portrayed on "Kojak" or "N.Y.P.D. Blue" is aware of the city's image problem.
But Port Authority officials said yesterday that among the most surprising findings of the study, "Destination New York-New Jersey: Tourism and Travel to the Metropolitan Region," was that foreign visitors found the city safer, more welcoming and a better value than they had been led to believe.
More than 1,000 tourists from the Britain, Brazil, Germany, Japan and France were interviewed this fall at Kennedy and Newark airports. More than a third said they had a better time than they expected, and only 6 percent had a worse time.
For some reason, Brazilians like New York better than any other nationality does, the study said; the Japanese and the French like New York the least.
The results announced yesterday represent the concluding half of a $600,000 study, "Tourism and the Arts in the New York-New Jersey Region," that the Port Authority undertook three years ago. The results of part one, "The Arts as an Industry: Their Importance to the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan Region," were released in 1993. The purpose of the project was to quantify the relationship between tourism and the local economy, and to help the city's tourist industry.
These were among the figures:
*The region was visited by 43 million people in 1992, generating $20 billion in economic activity and $1.4 billion in state and local taxes.
*Tourism generated 185,830 jobs in 1992, making it the city's second largest industry employer, after health care.
*Foreign travelers accounted for 15.4 percent of visitors to New York.
The study also took note of the fact that though business forecasters predict a growth in the nation's tourism industry through the end of the century, the increased popularity of pursuits like gambling and outdoor adventure vacations, as well as the construction of convention centers in many other American cities, means that New York's tourist industry is not likely to keep pace.
Indeed, New York is already falling behind. Between 1989 and 1993, overseas visitors to New York City increased at a rate of 1.4 percent a year, yet the overall increase in American travel by overseas visitors was 7.5 percent annually.
As a result, the study concludes, it behooves the tourist industry to promote the image of the region more heavily and to come up with new ways to tie the city's attractions to those of the region as a whole.

HEADLINE: China Delay on Trade Pact

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 14

 BODY:
China acknowledged today that it no longer expects to join the new World Trade Organization, the successor to GATT, when it opens its doors in January.
In an angry report from Geneva in today's issue of International Business, published by China's Foreign Trade Ministry, the ministry said the outlook for its entry was not optimistic, with the United States and other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade making increasing demands on China. Beijing said it was now prepared to postpone discussions of difficult technical issues until the second quarter of 1995, as long as substantive negotiations were completed this year. 
 China wants to be treated as a developing nation, which would give it more time to prepare key economic sectors for liberalized trade.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Advances Made by Mark Put Pressure on the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar edged lower against most leading currencies yesterday as the German mark continued to strengthen against European currencies, particularly the French franc and the Italian lira.
Increased buying of marks for French francs and lire "is basically putting a lid on the dollar," said Paul Farrell, vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. 
 An uncertain political outlook in both France and Italy were the primary catalysts behind the mark's steady rise. The mark, the currency of Europe's strongest economy, is typically a haven for currencies buffeted elsewhere on the Continent.
Speculation mounted yesterday that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy might be forced to step down. Mr. Berlusconi is being investigated on corruption charges.
In France, the lack of a clear front-runner for the presidential elections next spring continued to plague the franc. Jacques Delors, who had been widely seen as the successor to President Francois Mitterrand, announced on Sunday that he would not be a candidate.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5682 marks from 1.5730 marks on Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 1.3265 Swiss francs from 1.3290 Swiss francs. But the United States currency edged up slightly against the Japanese yen and the British pound. The dollar was quoted at 100.30 yen, compared with 100.29 yen on Tuesday. The British pound fell to $1.5630 from $1.5730.
The selling of foreign currencies can at times weigh on the dollar because in shifting from lire or francs to German marks, traders have to reduce their holdings of dollars.
Traders said the dollar was also buffeted by a growing sense that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday. That view was reaffirmed after the Labor Department reported yesterday that consumer prices increased by three-tenths of 1 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Yawns greet a warning about the burning fuse on entitlements.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
CONGRESS is required to look five years ahead when it creates the Federal budget. But nobody is obliged to look to 2025 and beyond, when the all the expensive chickens that have been promised to the huge baby-boom generation -- the free medical care, the comfortable pensions -- come home to roost as the last of the generation hits retirement.
Senators Bob Kerrey and John C. Danforth volunteered to deliver the unpleasant news, agreeing last year to head a group of assembled worthies called the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. The idea, a concession to Mr. Kerrey on the eve of the vote on President Clinton's deficit-reduction package, was to sound a very public warning long before Washington faced the choice of breaking promises to tens of millions of retirees, taxing the socks off wage earners or abandoning the pretense of controlling the deficit. 
 But with deja-voodoo economics ascendant in the new Congress, Washington can no longer even summon the interest to shoot the messengers. "I'm afraid we are oscillating around a decidedly downward trend," lamented Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution. It is a trend in which politicians find it ever more difficult to deny immediate gratification to the electorate.
The first act of what was intended to be a tightly scripted morality play was the publication of the commission's interim report in August. That report, in which the commission congratulated itself on coming to a near consensus, outlined the sober realities: by 2012, Medicare, Social Security, interest on the Federal debt and lesser automatic transfers would consume 100 percent of Federal revenues. By 2030, Social Security would be technically broke and, by conservative reckoning, Federal outlays would absorb 37 percent of national income.
The solution? Increase national savings, the commission said. Contain health care costs. Compensate for the explosive growth in the numbers of dependent retirees.
But how? The details were left for the commission's final report, due today. And only in the last few weeks have Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Danforth circulated some ideas -- what they apparently hoped would be a starting point for building the 60 percent plurality needed to deliver collective recommendations to the White House. Indeed, when they publicly offered the plan last week, they received virtually no support.
With hindsight, it is not hard to understand what went wrong. The Kerrey-Danforth plan would never have been an easy sell since it included sharp cuts in Social Security checks for future retirees, an increase in the retirement age to 70, a cap on the deductibility of employer-paid health insurance and means-testing for veterans benefits. And since the commission operated under strict sunshine laws, there was never an opportunity to fashion a compromise in private.
What's more, the plan veered off the straight and narrow path of entitlement containment by, in effect, advocating the privatization of a portion of Social Security. It would have cut the payroll tax by one and a half percentage points, but required workers to invest the difference in something akin to individual retirement accounts.
Such a change appeals to policy makers of the center and right, who are uneasy about the growing dependence on Uncle Sam for retirement income. But few commission members were ready to run with so novel an idea on just a few days' notice.
Last but hardly least, suggests Robert Reischauer, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, the plan demands crisis-style sacrifice in the absence of a crisis. "Entitlements don't explode," he noted, "the budget deteriorates gradually." And that leaves policy makers without a convenient moment to rise above interest-group politics in the name of the greater good. The only real whack ever taken at Social Security came a decade ago, when Congress hid behind the big white lie that the system was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Nonetheless, it is hard to interpret the thundering indifference to the Kerry-Danforth effort as anything less than a repudiation of conservative fiscal planning. No wonder: old-stripe conservatives have little sway over the Republican House that Newt built. And with the next Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, an all-but-declared candidate for the White House, it is hard to imagine that most pragmatic of politicians will challenge the entitlement lobbies.
The same is probably true for President Clinton. He took a tentative step along the high road before the elections, criticizing the Republicans' "Contract With America" as a budget-buster. But since the slaughter, he is showing every sign of joining the competition to promise middle-class swing voters the most gain with the least pain.
For worriers like Mr. Aaron, then, it is hard to spot a silver lining in the gathering fiscal clouds. He can react only with "disappointment and sorrow when intelligent people pander" to the idea that unpleasant fiscal decisions can always be put off to another day.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices Fall on Fears Of Decline in Housing Starts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices fell sharply yesterday on expectations that higher interest rates would cause housing demand to slow.
On other commodity markets, coffee fell for the second day, while gasoline rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose 0.41 point, to 229.64. 
 Lumber prices fell as traders looked ahead to tomorrow's Commerce Department report on housing starts for November. Traders expect the report to show another decline, with mortgage rates running at their highest levels in more than three years.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber for January delivery fell $10, to $298.50 for 1,000 board feet, the most the contract is permitted to move in one day. Lumber prices have fallen 15.5 percent in less than a month.
"We haven't seen a lot of hard data indicating the housing market has slowed yet," said Gary Leeper, sales manager for the commodity division of Timber Products Company, a lumber mill in Eugene, Ore. "But if you're a contractor, or a supplier for contractors, you get a little pessimistic."
Coffee plunged for a second day as traders said Brazil's crop was adequate to keep the market well supplied, even into next year.
The United States Department of Agriculture said on Monday that Brazil harvested about 26 million bags of coffee last year, more than its previous estimate of 23.5 million bags.
On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for December delivery fell 6.5 cents, to $1.4425 a pound, a new six-month low. The more active March coffee contract also fell 6.5 cents, to $1.471 a pound, its lowest since June 27, the day after the first frost. Coffee prices have tumbled 37.5 percent since Sept. 21.
Gasoline and heating oil rose as stockpiles fell, surprising traders who expected an increase.
Gasoline inventories dropped 1.3 percent, to 212.3 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute said, while stocks of distillate fuels like home heating oil fell 2.1 percent.
Many traders had expected gasoline supplies to rise for a sixth consecutive week, reflecting record production rates as refiners push to turn out reformulated gasoline for sale next year.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 1.56 cents, to 52.65 cents a gallon, and January heating oil rose 1.06 cents, to 49.54 cents a gallon. January crude oil climbed 8 cents, to $16.99 a barrel.

The Yankees Make a Deal for an Ace in McDowell

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
The Yankees made a stunning trade late last night that could stabilize their starting rotation next season and beyond when they made a deal for the former Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell from the Chicago White Sox for Keith Heberling, a minor league pitcher, and a player to be named later.
Because of myriad uncertainties raised by the labor disagreement in baseball and the possibility of the owners' implementation of a salary cap today, McDowell is technically not a member of the Yankees and is still a free agent. 
 McDowell fell 52 days shy of being a six-year free agent after the strike began Aug. 12 and, if the owners do implement their new economic system, he would become a restricted free agent like all four- and five-year players. If that occurs, he could sign an offer sheet with any team, but the Yankees would have 10 days to match it. The qualifying offer to McDowell would be at least $5.83 million a season (110 percent of his $5.3 million salary in 1994).
But, if McDowell receives credit for his service time, the Yankees would have to compete for him as a free agent like any other team. Jim Abbott, the Yankee starter, is in a similar situation.
"We hope we can sign him," Yankee General Manager Gene Michael said last night of McDowell. "You have to take chances in this game. We think he's a good one to take a chance on."
Michael, who does not think McDowell will be granted the additional service time, said the Yankees had not yet made an offer to the right-hander because it was too early. Michael declined to discuss who the player to be named is or if the player would change depending on whether the Yankees sign McDowell.
Since the Yankees acquired a talented pitcher who has been one of the most consistent in the American League for the last five seasons, the player to be named must be a valuable commodity, too. Danny Tartabull, a high-priced power hitter with two years remaining on his five-year, $25.5 million contract, is someone the Yankees have tried to trade for the last two years.
McDowell, who turns 29 next month and has twice won 20 or more games in a season, would provide the Yanks with something they have not really had under Manager Buck Showalter: a workhorse. McDowell throws inning after inning and relishes completing games, as evidenced by his leading the league in that category in 1991 and 1992. He was 22-10 with a 3.37 earned run average and 10 complete games in 256 2/3 innings in 1993 and won the Cy Young.
"The first thing that jumps out at you is his competitiveness," Showalter said of the pitcher who averaged to throw 244 innings a season from 1990-93. "He likes to get out there and finish what he started.
Could the Yankees be concerned about Jimmy Key's off-season shoulder surgery? Could they be so concerned that they felt the need to obtain another expensive ace who could seriously escalate their payroll? Michael scoffed at the notion that the Yankees were worried about Key and insisted their payroll will be manageable, even if a salary cap is implemented. McDowell and Key would probably anchor a rotation that included Melido Perez, Sterling Hitchcock and Scott Kamieniecki. Michael sidestepped the issue, but Abbott's career as a Yankee is most likely over if McDowell signs with New York.
"Of course," said Michael, when asked if he would have made the deal if Key had not had surgery. "When you get a chance to get someone like this, you do it. We were only looking at the top pitchers. We think we got one."
After stumbling in the 1993 American League Championship Series with two losses and a 10.00 e.r.a. against Toronto, McDowell proceeded to have what was considered an erratic year for him with a 10-9 record, a 3.73 e.r.a., 6 complete games and 127 strikeouts in 181 innings. He criticized the White Sox throughout his career and was not expected to re-sign with them.
A first-round pick out of Stanford University in the 1987 draft, McDowell is 91-58 lifetime with a 3.50 e.r.a. in 191 starts, 52 of which he has completed. His repertory includes a 90 mile an hour fastball and a nasty split-finger pitch, and he is known for his intensity and for brushing hitters off the plate with inside stuff.
Heberling was 11-7 with a 2.92 e.r.a. at Class A Tampa last year. Who will join Heberling in leaving the Yankees remained the mystery.

Baseball's Best Remedy Is a Repeal

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
THE newest advice in baseball is the oldest advice in politics: Write your Senators and Representatives.
If you're interested in seeing major league baseball the way it ought be instead of picket lines and replacement players, then you the people should inform Congress that the time has come for it to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption. 
 Throughout the labor dispute that has evolved into the likelihood that the club owners will impose a salary cap today, the union has indicated that, if the antitrust exemption is repealed, it would end the strike and litigate its problems.
But only Congress can end baseball's exemption from the antitrust laws.
When the Supreme Court rejected Curt Flood's bid for free agency in 1972, Justice Harry Blackmun described the exemption that was granted in 1922 by the Supreme Court as an "anomaly" and an "aberration."
"If there is any inconsistency or illogic in all this," Blackmun wrote in his opinion, "it is an inconsistency and illogic of long standing that is to be remedied by the Congress and not by this Court."
If ever a remedy were needed, it is now.
On behalf of Florida's sumptuous spring training economy, that state's two Senators, Connie Mack, a Republican, and Bob Graham, a Democrat, have asked Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, for "speedy action on legislation applying the same laws of fair competition to baseball" that apply to pro football, pro basketball and pro hockey.
"It's not a level playing field, when owners have a remedy and the players do not have a comparable remedy enjoyed by other similarly situated athletes," Mack and Graham wrote in their letter to Hatch, who is expected to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Congress reconvenes early next month.
But much more than Florida's economy is at stake now. Major league baseball as we know it is at stake. If the impasse continues into the season, if some players cross a picket line and others don't, if the proposed United League becomes a reality, major league baseball might never be the same again.
And if the United League materializes, will it also inherit an antitrust exemption? If not, why not?
How the new Congress will react is hard to say. Some members will surely equate a repeal with an end to the strike. Others will surely not want to interfere in baseball's labor problems. Others will sneer, and rightly so, that Congress has many more important issues to consider than how baseball should be governed.
"Baseball's antitrust exemption should be done away with no matter what; baseball should be under the same laws as any other business," said Jim Bunning, a Republican from Kentucky who is Congress's only right-hander with a career 224-184 record. "At least its labor negotiations should be nonexempt from antitrust law."
Time is a factor. When the antitrust exemption was argued in Washington during the early weeks of the strike, there wasn't enough time to do much. And with spring training scheduled to open in the final week of February and the season to open on April 2, time is still short.
George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, often mentioned as baseball's next commissioner once the labor dispute is resolved, did not seek re-election after having been the majority leader of the Senate since 1989. But as one of those who did not support the repeal, he could still influence the opinion of others in Congress.
Baseball lobbyists have argued that a repeal would damage the minor leagues, that if a major league club's control over a player were to be limited to four years instead of six years, it would lose its incentive to subsidize the minors. It's an argument that would charm legislators from almost every state.
"Major league teams spend a total of $130 million on their minor league operations," said Stanley Brand, the vice president of the minor leagues' governing body. "Without that investment, the economic forecast for the minor leagues would be dire. It would eliminate 120 teams in the Class A and Rookie leagues."
But decades ago there were dozens of Class B, C and D leagues. The minors have survived without them. And whatever the future of the minors, the future of the big leagues is what's at stake now. Write your Senators and Representatives.

HEADLINE: Family Resort in the Catskills Seeking to Survive

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
When people plan a benefit -- a dinner, a dance, or maybe a walk-a-thon -- they are usually out to raise money for some charitable cause. But in the heart of the Catskills, the focus has been on a ski area.
The future of Belleayre Mountain in Highmount, N.Y., is at stake. Having survived extinction a decade ago, the midsize ski area is competing now in an industry of corporate giants. At Belleayre, a group of mostly volunteers is fighting against the inevitable wave of attrition. 
 The Coalition to Save Belleayre staged a formal dance last Friday in a lodge at the Belleayre Mountain Ski Center. The benefit was organized to raise money for the Belleayre Conservatory, a cultural adjunct of the ski area that stages summer concerts on the mountain. But summer or winter, it is all the same place, and its ultimate demise has raised concern.
"Belleayre is a family mountain," said Joe Kelly, a New York City securities executive who has skied there for 20 years. "Families who started to ski there go off to bigger areas, but then come back. That's really what Belleayre is all about -- kids, parents, grandparents."
There is reason for smaller ski resorts to be on the alert. According to a report last month in Snow Country magazine, more than 400 mostly small ski areas have gone out of business since 1977.
With survival in mind, Belleayre has decided to play the game of bigger is better. The ski center wants to acquire Highmount, the defunct resort that sits like a sleeping lamb on the backside of Belleayre Mountain. And it's also looking for an ally to develop a virgin area at the eastern end of the hill.
Recent announcements give weight to the trend toward consolidation. Sunday River, Me., now shares ownership with Attitash, N.H., and Sugarbush, Vt. Aspen and Snowmass have merged with their Colorado neighbor, Aspen Highlands. And owners of the Killington resort in Vermont have made Waterville Valley, N.H., their latest acquisition. The S-K-I Ltd. group also owns Mount Stowe and Haystack in Vermont, Bear Mountain in California and Sugarloaf in Maine.
Belleayre, an area with 33 trails and 9 lifts, has struggled for the last 10 years to keep up. As the only ski area wholly owned and operated by New York State, Belleayre cannot afford to go into the red. The state wouldn't like it, and neither would the locals. So far, revenues hold a slim lead over deficits.
"If we closed, 30 hotels would go out of business, plus another 30 restaurants or so," said Joan Bauer, director of marketing for Belleayre. "We're an essential economic catalyst to this region."
Highmount Ski Center, a privately owned operation, closed last winter. With five trails and five lifts, the area is anything but a skier's paradise. Yet the Belleayre Coalition, of which Kelly is chairman, sees Highmount as a "highly visible sore in an area that doesn't need it."
The asking price is $700,000, a cost that looks negotiable, Kelly said. Since New York City draws its water from the region, state officials look at tourism as a lesser of development evils. Kelly urges the purchase of Highmount as a call to action in a time when "attention is focused on the Catskills for its mother lode of water."
"You've got to improve to compete," he added.
In fact, the Belleayre Mountain Ski Center just finished a decade of capital improvements. The state agreed in 1984 to a $16 million subsidy at Belleayre. But a large state deficit is unlikely to loosen any more money from state funds.
Instead, Belleayre planners are trying to attract private investment. They also acknowledge that they would have to work out an agreement with state forest officials. But given the available terrain, they are determined.
Dean Gitter, executive director of the Central Catskill Planning Alliance, has reviewed a 1988 study from Snow Engineering, of Littleton, N.H. As a leading ski area planner, the engineering firm found Belleayre's untouched east side highly desirable for ski area expansion. With 600 feet of additional vertical drop, and the potential for 14 miles of new trails, there is room for adding advanced terrain to Belleayre.
It helps that Belleayre is situated within 140 miles of the New York City region.
"The ski industry is now concentrated in large and sophisticated hands," Gitter said. "But we also have the opportunity to have a first-class area close to a major metropolitan area. The mountain on the eastern end would keep most any demanding skier interested."

HEADLINE: Farewell, National Prune Day

 BODY:
The 104th Congress has not yet begun. But the incoming class of 73 new Republican House members can already claim one small victory for common sense. Last week the Republican Conference approved a freshman-sponsored resolution to end the embarrassing Congressional tradition of honoring what is trivial and, thus, of trivializing what is honorable. It is this tradition that has given us empty commemorative events like National Tap Dance Day and Dairy Goat Awareness Week.
This inflationary exercise began innocently enough when Congress designated Mother's Day in 1918. But Congress's soft spot for commemoratives has since extended well beyond Mom to considering non-occasions like National Good Teen Day, Grapefruit Month and Random Acts of Kindness Week. 
 Most proposals die for lack of support from the required majority in both chambers. But each of the more than 300 commemorative bills submitted in the last Congress ate up the time and energy required to round up the necessary signatures.
The Republican resolution, which must still be approved when the new Congress convenes, would hand the chore of designating ersatz holidays to a Presidential commemorative commission.
For this modest step toward legislative sanity, the Republican freshmen deserve praise. Having stared down National Prune Day, they might now deploy the same zeal on weightier matters so far overlooked by Speaker-designate Newt Gingrich -- like, for starters, campaign finance and lobbying reform.

HEADLINE: Orange County's Fatal Error

 BODY:
The bankruptcy of Orange County, California -- the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever -- is turning chaotic. The county's investment fund, whose contributors include 60 school districts and 11 water districts, is no longer returning principal or interest to its participants. The cutoff forced the county to suspend highway repairs and tax refunds. Schools, which were legally required to invest in the fund, health clinics and social service providers may run out of money to pay salaries.
The fiasco raises two questions. What caused the bankruptcy? What can prevent similar episodes across the country? 
 The county fund lost money by buying complex, volatile securities known as derivatives, whose value rises and falls with the price of underlying bonds, stocks, currencies and interest rates. Many observers have leaped to the presumption that money-losing derivatives caused the bankruptcy.
The presumption is unwarranted. The fund's flagrant mistake was not which securities it bought, but its choice of an irresponsibly risky investment strategy. Robert Citron, the County Treasurer, brazenly borrowed billions of dollars at low short-term rates of interest in order to buy higher-yielding long-term bonds and other securities.
The strategy amounted to a risky gamble that interest rates would fall; if they did, Mr. Citron's borrowing costs would fall and the value of his long-term bonds would rise. For years he racked up fabulous gains, becoming a local hero by earning profits in excess of 7 percent when other county funds settled for half as much. Indeed, Mr. Citron was elected as a Democrat in a ferociously Republican county even though his opponent ridiculed Mr. Citron's risky strategy.
But this year the Federal Reserve has been jacking up interest rates to clamp down on inflation. The rates at which Mr. Citron was forced to borrow rose above the return the fund could earn on long-term securities. The rate hikes sent the value of Mr. Citron's long-term bonds on a downward spiral: a prescription for bankruptcy. The fund appears to have lost more than 25 percent of its value.
It is a matter of detail which securities -- derivatives or plain-vanilla stocks and bonds -- Mr. Citron chose to trade. The strategy, not the securities, proved fatal.
What, then, was needed to stop him? Some members of Congress have picked the wrong answer: prohibiting county funds from purchasing derivatives or borrowing to purchase securities. The danger with such blanket prohibitions is that they rule out the use of derivatives and borrowing to reduce investment risk. Mr. Citron's mistake was to make one-way bets on the direction of interest rates. But prudent investment managers use the same tactics to insulate funds from movements in interest rates in either direction.
What Orange County needed was oversight. Mr. Citron was seemingly left to run amok. Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, calls on state and local governments to monitor investment managers of taxpayer money. The primary objective of government funds must be safety and liquidity (the ability to convert investments into cash for emergencies), not profit. If fund managers were forced to assess and report risks, and government supervisors were responsible for overseeing the managers, then Orange County -- one of the wealthiest in America -- would not now be threatening to lay off teachers and nurses.

The Key to the City

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
On New Year's Eve, thousands of revelers, tourists and scoundrels will once again gather in Times Square to watch the ball drop, and millions more will watch on TV. Why? The ball is but a bauble, the neighborhood a has-been. Its gaudy signs aside, the intersection of Broadway and 42d Street has long been an urban blank, sparsely populated by fast-food and electronics outlets and the last remaining peep shows.
No matter. Crowds pour into the former crossroads of the world anyway, and not just on New Year's. Even in a coma, Times Square remains an alluring international symbol of the racing, racy Gotham pulse; those of us who work there still catch a whiff of that adrenaline along with the other odors greeting us at the subway exit each morning. 
 If people hunger to come to New York's defunct field of neon dreams now, imagine the results were someone actually to build something there. The whole city could be refueled, economically and spiritually, by a reborn Times Square. You need only stroll to David Letterman's marquee 11 blocks north to see how even a single glamorous new tenant in a dark theater can transform a dead Broadway neighborhood into a mini-Times Square of its own.
Incredibly enough, given the interminable history of stalled plans, a new 42d Street is at this moment closer to reality than ever before. The wind changed, as expected, right after Disney's February announcement of its desire to resurrect the New Amsterdam, the glorious Ziegfeld palace. Construction began soon after on a nonprofit youth theater long promised for the Victory across the street. Now virtually every 42d Street parcel has become the subject of active negotiation.
According to Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, and some of the potential tenants, the bright lights include:
* Madame Tussaud's, now a leader in theme-park high tech as well as waxworks, plans to pack the old Times Tower with interactive, Manhattan-centric displays from Andy Warhol's Factory to the top of the Chrysler Building. Outside, the news zipper will not only remain lit but will circle a rehabilitated facade.
* Combining three dark theaters, MTV will create a complex that could do for the rock network what the RCA Building long ago did for NBC. John Cannelli, the MTV point man, pictures a studio for "unplugged" concerts, an unorthodox tour allowing visitors to snake through the network's production facilities, and a flamboyant restaurant that he promises will in no way resemble the Hard Rock Cafe.
* The distinctive architectural details in three other theaters will be preserved by American Multi-Cinema as it builds a multiplex of at least 24 screens, with diverse programming designed to draw the traditional Times Square audience mix.
* Four companies, Disney among them, are competing to create a flamboyant hotel across from the Port Authority Terminal.
All these plans, wildly urban-eclectic rather than homogeneously suburban-mall, uphold Times Square's indelible identity as a cacophonous, edgy center of night life. The neighborhood's very first theater, Oscar Hammerstein I's Olympia of 1895, was a multi-stage complex with a glass-bubbled roof garden; the first 42d Street sex businesses were documented as early as 1901. Times Square was never meant to be the Rockefeller Center promised by the austere Johnson-Burgee office towers of the previous development scheme.
What could go wrong now? The crucial final negotiations happen to coincide with the changeover in Governors. Any uncertainties could make one major tenant turn skittish, prompting others to flee, too.
But to keep 42d Street on track, George Pataki need do nothing -- literally so. The best way to preserve the momentum and continuity of the deal-making at this crucial pass is to retain the current state employees, led by Ms. Robertson, who have gotten so close, know the history and command the other players' trust.
Does the Governor-elect really care about New York City? We'll get an early clue if he makes sure that Times Square's dazzling new development balls stay in the air even as the old ball welcoming 1995 descends.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Making War on the Business Cycle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Greenspan Hints at Further Rises in Interest Rates" (front page, Dec. 8): Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, holds to the conviction that the price of increased economic activity is "inflation," that "inflation" is evil, and therefore it is imperative to abort increases in economic activity. It is depressing that those who so profess to honor "market theory" have forgotten how the market works. 
 It used to be that in a free-market society there was an endless rhythm of contraction and expansion. This was called the business cycle. It is not a new phenomenon.
What happened in a business cycle is that in bad times producers had to reduce their prices, and in good times producers could increase their prices. Whether you made steel or refined sugar, what you always hoped was that the time would come when you could raise your prices and thereby increase your return. Increasing your return used to be the essence of capitalism.
Even better, if you could lower your unit cost, you could even increase your return without raising your prices! Thus, producers of commodities -- iron and coal, sugar and spice -- could increase their prices and profits, while manufacturers and processors, by increasing productivity, could maintain their own prices and profits if they chose or, if the market permitted, even increase their prices and profits.
This was aptly called a recovery. What was being recovered was the opportunity to make a satisfactory return on capital. Making such a satisfactory return was what capitalism was all about.
Enter Mr. Greenspan. On Dec. 7, the day the Labor Department confirmed that in the 14 quarters of this recovery, output per number of hours worked (productivity) had risen a little more than 2 percent a year -- and in the third quarter, in particular, by 2.9 percent -- Mr. Greenspan reiterated to Congress his tired refrain. Any higher price must be called inflation. Inflation will cool off the economy. Cooling off the economy is bad. Therefore we must cool off the economy. Now.
Not when the market was ready, but when the Fed was ready.
In Mr. Greenspan's words, inflation ultimately leads to "subpar economic performance over time." So let's steer the economy to subpar performance now. Don't wait for the market to steer the economy to subpar performance later.
Wait a minute. I thought it was the bad old socialists who wanted a controlled economy. Now it is the inflation fighter at the Federal Reserve who wants a controlled economy.
Mr. Greenspan's war on the business cycle deserves examination in the public arena. The oil shocks were 20 years ago. Let's get back to business.

Cost to Consumers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To innoculate against inflation, the Federal Reserve is using counterproductive medicine. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is reported (front page, Dec. 8) as giving an unusually clear signal that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates to forestall inflation. 
 "Avis Says Costs Force a Rental Rise" (Business Day, Dec. 8) says the rental car company cited interest rate increases as one of two reasons it was raising rental cost by as much as 6 percent. Businesses pass increased costs on to consumers. Increasing interest rates increases costs.

Misplaced Euphoria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The euphoria over the November figure of 350,000 newly created jobs would be bullish if it were not for a small omission. New unemployment claims totaled a whopping 317,000, making the net gain a mere 33,000. 
 Adding to the distortion is that the gain has been in the service sector, with lower wages, than in manufacturing, where jobs are declining.
At the risk of playing Scrooge before Christmas, the first-quarter outlook is for exponential downsizing in all economic sectors, especially in government, where budgetary constraints will make it mandatory.
If the Federal Reserve continues its destructive course of raising interest rates for the seventh time, a mild recession is possible. Then look for market forces reversing the course of interest rates in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Salomon Will Start Selling Orange County Debt Today

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Orange County yesterday began the slow, hard work of rescuing itself from the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. In one sign of that effort, Salomon Brothers prepared to auction off the first $1 billion of the bonds that remain in the Southern California county's ill-fated investment portfolio.
In another sign, a Federal bankruptcy judge approved resumption of normal banking services with the Bank of America, the county's commercial bank. The judge authorized the bank to maintain a $200 million loan agreement so that the county could meet its $16.4 million automatic payroll deposit tomorrow. 
 But more potential casualties of Orange County's trouble emerged. Kemper Financial Services said it would cover losses on $198 million of defaulted county bonds it had bought for six of its mutual funds.
The auction today by Salomon Brothers will be for $1 billion of bonds bought by Orange County from several Federal Government-sponsored agencies. At an unspecified future time, Salomon will auction the county's $4.7 billion in derivatives known as structured notes, the portfolio holdings that have been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates this year.
The county announced on Tuesday that it would sell the remaining $5 billion or so of assets in the investment pool, on which the loss has already totaled $2.02 billion, or 27 percent. The sale is expected to take 90 days, but the county's financial advisers indicated that they wanted to move quickly because each percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates would add $300 million to the losses.
The auctions today will be open both to brokerage firms and to investors, according to people familiar with the planning. A catalogue of about 20 different packages of bonds for sale will be distributed by Salomon this morning, and bids will be accepted later in the morning. There will probably be a minimum bid of about $5 million, though the details were being worked out last night. The county will have the right to withdraw any of the packages from sale if it thinks the top bid is too low.
People familiar with the auction said they expected the bidding to be vigorous because there were few other bonds being offered right now -- just before the Christmas holidays. Also, with an uncommonly flat yield curve now in the Treasury markets -- interest rates on shorter-term paper are nearly as high as on long-term bonds -- many investors are interested in the sort of shorter-term debt that Orange County is selling.
Traders said the structured-note investments may be more difficult for the county to sell. These bonds, also issued by Government-sponsored agencies, have interest payments tied to complex formulas that made them rise sharply in value if interest rates fell, but plummet if rates rose. Still, a number of large Wall Street firms were preparing to bid for those bonds, including Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, J. P. Morgan & Company, Chase Manhattan Bank and Lehman Brothers. Those companies will try to find ways to hedge the volatile bonds' risk and then sell them to investors seeking a bargain.
The creditors of Orange County and of the investment pool met in Los Angeles yesterday with the United States bankruptcy trustee, Marcy J. K. Tiffany, who is the United States Trustee for the Central District of California, to form two creditors' committees.
The 20 largest creditors of the county and the pool, which each filed for protection under Chapter 9 last week, were invited, but about 250 people showed up, according to Ms. Tiffany, who under the Federal bankruptcy code is charged with appointing creditors' committees.
At the end of the day, a seven-member committee for the pool had been appointed: the Orange County Transportation Authority, water district, sanitation district and transportation corridor, as well as the city of Irvine to represent cities in Orange County; the city of Mountain View, Calif., to represent those outside the county, and the Orange County Department of Education to represent the school districts.
A glaring omission from this creditors' committee was the Irvine Ranch Water District, the fourth-largest investor with $301 million in the pool. Several creditors are irritated with the district's withdrawal late in October of $100 million from the pool. "They should put that money back into the pot for equal distribution to all," Ms. Tiffany said.
The United States trustee program was created in 1987 to oversee the bankruptcy process, mainly in large metropolitan areas. It is responsible for monitoring the trustees appointed in cases, protecting creditors' rights and preventing fraud. Though the Federal bankruptcy judge often oversees the appointment of creditors' committees, the trustee program can also be engaged to do so at the request of several creditors.
Individual investors across the nation may be affected by the bankruptcy through taxable money market funds, which bought $600 million of taxable notes the county sold in July, Federal officials said. These funds can hold only debt they can sell quickly for 100 cents on the dollar.
Kemper Financial Services said yesterday that it held $198 million of those notes in five money market funds with about $13 billion in assets. To keep the notes liquid, Kemper has "arranged a facility that assures the funds' ability to sell the notes at par," said Steven A. Radis, a spokesman, adding that the Kemper Corporation would assume the risk.
The holders of the remaining notes did not step forward yesterday.
Kemper is the first mutual fund company to rescue taxable funds affected by Orange County, but several others -- including Alliance Capital Management, the Benham Group, the Calvert Group, Franklin Resources and Putnam Investments -- have taken steps to protect investors in their tax-exempt funds.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 17, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., referred incorrectly to $198 million in the county's securities held by Kemper Financial Services' money market mutual funds. The securities have plunged in price, but they are not in default. In addition, the article misstated the number of Kemper money market funds holding the Orange County securities. It is five, not six.

HEADLINE: Comeback Kid's Tightest Corner Yet

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton faces the most critical point in a Presidency as stuffed with crises as an old-time movie serial.
 In a speech on Thursday night, for the first time since the seismic election shock five weeks ago, he will tell the nation what he intends to do, especially in the scant year remaining until the political world is caught up in another Presidential campaign. 
He has been dangerously silent until now. He has left the initiative to Republicans, who have seized it, going so far today as to suggest what his speech ought to say. Their confidence and audacity has deepened the Democrats' demoralization; a Democratic Senator said this week, "It's hard to see how we escape from the wilderness."
 The mood is evident even abroad. A senior British minister said on Monday: "No point in trying to deal with the Administration any more. They've had the stuffing knocked out of them."
 The advance intelligence indicates that the President will propose middle-class tax cuts and the scaling down, if not the dismantling, of certain units of Government. The intent is twofold: to prove that he heard the message of hostility to big government and heavy spending that the electorate sent, and to seize as his own some of the most eye-catching Republican promises.
 Mr. Clinton has to do something. All of his advisers, those whom he chose and those who appointed themselves, agree on that. But there are tremendous risks in the move to the right, which has already begun with increases in military spending and agreement to talk about school prayer legislation.
 The first is me-tooism, as it used to be called in the Eisenhower Administration, when Republican moderates infuriated their conservative brethren by espousing a watery version of the New Deal and Fair Deal. Scaling back government is, at bottom, a Republican issue. If Mr. Clinton had wanted to make it his own, the time to do so was early in his term, when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress as well as the White House.
 Instead, the President earned a reputation as a bureaucracy-builder with his health care proposals and the Republicans captured the Senate and the House of Representatives and started stressing a government of limits. Now, they are in a perfect position to one-up Mr. Clinton, no matter what he proposes.
 In their letter to the President, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who will lead the Republicans on Capitol Hill next year, threw down the gauntlet this way: "We also intend to present you with a bold plan to downsize and restructure the Executive Branch, and we ask that you join us in this effort. The American people do not want half-measures; they want real change and real cuts."
 Furthermore, cowboys who pose as Indians are seldom very convincing, and many Democrats are uncomfortable trying to out-Republican the Republicans.
 Another pitfall confronting the President is the loss of his base. The government departments and programs that Mr. Clinton is talking about cutting back were the creation of Democratic Presidents and legislators, working in tandem with Democratic pressure groups, like the unions, the minorities and the disadvantaged, and they will not like seeing their handiwork undone.
 But he does not have a lot of choice, in the view of many experienced Democrats who wish him well.
 "It will give them heartburn," said Harry McPherson, a Washington lawyer who served as Lyndon B. Johnson's White House counsel. "If he goes too far, he loses the true believers, the people who run phone banks and lick stamps.
 "But the fact is that there's really no one out there carrying the flag for liberalism any more. The shock troops of the poverty program are gone -- unions smaller and less effective, same for the big civil rights groups. The old coalition isn't big enough to win anymore, so whatever base he risks alienating, he has no choice but to try to add to it by moving right."
 Mr. Clinton has fought his way out of a lot of blind alleys; his staff talks about that whenever he seems utterly forlorn and decisively beaten, as he does now. But doing so has cost him. He has emerged from his battles bearing grievous political scars that have sometimes been invisible at first.
 There seemed nowhere for him to turn, for example, when Gennifer Flowers made her accusations during the New Hampshire primary. He survived, christened himself the Comeback Kid, and went on to win the Presidency. But that episode crystallized the "character issue." It led many voters to wonder -- and to keep wondering -- whether he was was morally fit to lead the nation.
 As President, Mr. Clinton finally found a compromise on the question of homosexuals in the military. It seemed at the time to have been a sideshow to the bigger problems on the table. But across the country last fall, Republicans used the issue to great effect in their Congressional blitz, citing it as prima facie evidence that Democratic values clashed with the country's.
 More than anything else, though, Mr. Clinton has been damaged by the widespread belief that he has no core beliefs, that he is a New Democrat one day, an Old Democrat the next. As he has twisted and turned on viciously complicated issues like Bosnia and health care, searching for consensus and finding none, he has been denounced as a trimmer and a vacillator.
 In the process, he has received astonishingly little credit for important achievements, especially in the economic sphere, where he has presided over a solid business recovery. In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, Mr. Clinton's overall approval rating is a dismal 38 percent, and his approval rating on economic issues is only marginally better at 41 percent.
 Deepening rather than erasing his image as a wishy-washy leader is perhaps the greatest peril of the course upon which the President appears to be embarking. If he merely echoes the Republicans, without putting forward at least a few distinctively Clintonian programs or ideas, he risks looking more rudderless and less convincingly Presidential than ever. And he cannot win re-election in 1996 without changing a lot of minds out beyond the Beltway.
 Just before he lost to Mr. Clinton two years ago, George Bush was in just about the same shape as his conqueror is now, with his approval rating at 37 percent.
 Comebacks can be made, even from such a nadir; Ronald Reagan's standing once sank to 41 percent. But that was in the trough of a recession in early 1983, with lots of room for improvement, and Mr. Reagan retained, even then, an electoral base and a gift for political persuasion that President Clinton can only envy.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD;
Protecting Children Going to School

BYLINE: By RALPH GARDNER Jr. 

 BODY:
ON Dec. 5 at 8:15 A.M., a 14-year-old girl was walking to school on Third Avenue near 84th Street when a black sedan pulled up beside her. A man got out and told her to get in. When she refused, he tried to grab her. The girl threw her umbrella at him and ran the two blocks back to her home screaming for help.
"The guy chased her for at least a block," said Police Officer Judy Gawley, who responded to the police call. Officer Gawley noted that while the girl passed stores, apartment buildings with doormen and a man selling Christmas trees, nobody came to her aid. Fortunately, she made it home safely. "Her parents always told her to be careful, which is probably what helped her out on this occasion," the officer said. 
 While abductions are rare, crimes involving children on their way to and from school are common enough that the Police Department recently criticized its own policies on handling them. Commissioner William Bratton has tripled the number of youth officers -- those who deal exclusively with problems affecting children and adolescents -- in each of the city's 76 precincts. Interviews with law enforcement officials, parents, students and civic groups suggest that the most challenging part of getting an education in New York City may be getting to and from school safely.
"The violence level seems to be escalating a little, which is very scary, and the crimes seem to be more random," said Tamar Lynn, a member of the West Side Crime Prevention Program. "We as parents feel less in control."
The victims are primarily boys ages 12 to 15. Their assailants are usually a few years older and correspondingly bigger and stronger. The attacks usually occur after school, as hundreds of thousands of city children are heading home on buses and subways. The perpetrators' motives can range from a desire for easy money to mugging as a sort of after-school sport, either for the pleasure of intimidating weaker boys or to impress their own friends.
Here is a sampling of incidents that have occurred recently:
* In November, the police charged a 15-year-old truant from Louis D. Brandeis High School on the Upper West Side in connection with three robberies of children. The police think he may be responsible for up to 20 such robberies, mostly in the West 90's from Amsterdam Avenue to Central Park West. "Any kid who was around he tried to shake down for money," said Thomas Hilliard, a youth officer in the 24th Precinct.
* In late October, the police arrested seven students out of a group of about 15 from Robert F. Wagner Junior High School on the Upper East Side after they attacked a boy and took his jacket as he was walking home after school with two girls. "He was beaten up pretty bad," said Sgt. Paul Smith of the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side. "I have no idea why. Sometimes these guys get a little brave, a little physical, when there's a group."
* Last year, the police arrested a group of boys after they committed robberies using a toy gun against children from several private schools. Their leader was all of 11 years old. He would slap the victims around while the others watched.
Statistics on the numbers of crimes involving children going to or coming from school are hard to come by for several reasons. Each year about 50,000 reports of petty crime involving juveniles are handled by the New Work City police, but the department doesn't categorize these incidents based on whether they happened outside schools.
A Police Department pamphlet published last April strongly criticized its own policy of not updating procedures to deal with the surge in youth crimes "in more than a generation." Among the findings: the names of offenders weren't entered into the computer files at the department's Youth Services division, so precinct personnel couldn't retrieve vital information. Among the steps Commissioner Bratton has announced is the creation of a data base to link information on youth violations of every kind. But so far that hasn't occurred. "There has been no allocation of resources yet," said Police Officer Scott Bloch, a Police Department spokesman.
Many public school principals haven't been eager to report incidents that happen outside their school gates for fear they will be held accountable. Consequently, the Board of Education hasn't been getting as much information as it should, said Zachary Tumin, director of the board's Office of School Safety.
In September, the board created a new reporting system that allows principals to report incidents outside the school without being blamed for them. But Mr. Tumin said he had not had a chance to judge the effectiveness of the new system.
Another part of the problem is that the victims themselves sometimes don't report the crimes, even to their own parents. Some fear that their independence will be curtailed by anxious mothers and fathers.
So in place of statistics, the police and parents rely heavily on anecdotal evidence. "I think it's a feeling and a feedback that we get," said Police Officer Bernard Gannon of the 19th Precinct.
David Tunick, an art dealer, says he worries about safety every day. His son, a student at the Dalton School, was mugged this fall and last year. "It's a thin line between fighting back and being submissive in order not to get hurt," Mr. Tunick said. "It's such a mixed message to give a kid."
Girls who attend private schools are rarely the victims of this kind of violence, because adolescents who attack their male counterparts apparently think unchivalrous to attack a girl. But public school girls are often victimized, sometimes by each other, often over a boy, said Gino Silvestri, the principal of Julia Richmond High School on East 67th Street. He said a girl might point out an enemy and get a surrogate to attack her after school. "You have people outside the school do it because they know it will be very tough for us to identify them," he added.
Cecilia Ford, a psychologist with a daughter in the sixth grade at the Spence School, moved nearby to ease her concerns about her child's safety. "I figured the fewer blocks she had to go, the less likelihood something would happen," Mrs. Ford said.
Parents are finding other ways to reduce the risks. "I think people are becoming more and more aware that the police can't do it by themselves," said Ann Goldsmith, the safety coordinator for the Parents League, an organization of independent schools. "More has to be done by individuals to protect their children."
Following are some of the programs set up to protect children.
Safe havens. This is a rapidly expanding network of stores that offer shelter to children when they are in danger. There are now 400 Safe Havens on the Upper East Side, another 250 on the Upper West Side, and efforts are under way to establish the program in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and in neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. The stores display yellow stickers that let children know that when they walk in and say "safe haven," they can find protection. "It happens every couple of months," said Philip Krumholtz, an owner of Morris Brothers, a clothing store at Broadway and 84th Street.
Mr. Krumholtz recently sheltered several boys after a gang of adolescents tried to steal their knapsacks. "The kids stayed here for an hour or so," he said. "I chased the other kids away, put the kids in a cab and sent them home."
Safety patrols. Each day at dismissal time at 25 private schools, parents patrol the area, wearing bright orange vests to identify themselves and carrying walkie-talkies and whistles, and sometimes cellular phones. While their value is primarily as a deterrent, in October, a mother on safety patrol at the Chapin School, on East End Avenue and 84th Street, helped the police catch a man she saw loitering near the school. Based on her description, he was later arrested after breaking into a car.
Ann Goldsmith of the Parents League said public schools didn't participate in the safety patrol program because its effectiveness depends on sending out the patrols every day of the school year and public schools can't compel parents to participate, as private schools do. to
Business district initiatives. Businesses are also joining the effort to protect children who attend schools in their neighborhoods. Perhaps the most dramatic example is at Worldwide Plaza, an office and residential complex on Eighth Avenue at 50th Street. Last February, its security force teamed up with the police, the Board of Education and the Times Square Business Improvement District after a series of gang-related incidents involving students at two nearby schools, the High School of Graphic Communication Arts and Park West, escalated from two a month to two a week, said Michael Johnson, the plaza's security director.
He deployedhis security officers with the police to make the most of their visibility. Since then, "We've had a very significant drop in incidents," Mr. Johnson said. "I've been told the arrest rate of the students has dropped 30 percent to 50 percent."
Safe corridors. These are routes primarily running from public schools to the nearest bus or subway station that are heavily patrolled by the police at dismissal time. Every precinct in the city has at least one of these routes, but some, like the 19th, have as many as six. "On the 8-to-4 shift, this is our highest priority," said George J. Kelly, the 19th Precinct's commanding officer, referring to student safety.
Safe passage. This Transit Police program puts an officer on each of 100 trains serving 85 key schools at dismissal time, from 1:30 to 4 P.M., when children are most volatile. The police ride one of the last three cars.
City buses, the public transportation system's weakest link in terms of safety, don't have police officers assigned to them on a regular basis. But the Transit Police will receive $2.1 million from the Federal government to hire 28 officers for their Surface Crime Unit. "Very likely they'll be involved in buses that serve students," said Al O'Leary, a Transit Police spokesman.
Public and private school activities. To foster friendship between private school children and those who attend public schools (and, police say, are often the assailants), the 19th Precinct's Community Council and the Stanley Isaacs Neighborhood Center run a weekend hockey league for 150 adolescents from across the social and economic spectrum. "It's an approach we're using to bridge the differences," said Howard Knoll, the center's youth director.
But it is the youth officers who are the linchpins in the Police Department's effort to curb violence against children. They try to make regular visits to every public and private school in their precinct and develop relationships with school administrators, who know better than anyone else who the troublemakers are. "The key is to break the anonymity that shields wrongdoers," Mr. Tumin said.
But Thomas Marino, a youth officer in the 19th Precinct, said his help was generally, but not always, warmly received. "Some private schools don't treat us with open arms like public schools do," he said. "Some don't think it's a good thing for a police officer to be around the school. I don't know whether they think it's a bad thing for parents to see there's trouble there."
Recently, three boys were charged with trying to rob a Dalton student around the corner from the school, in part for what they perceived as the privileges of the well-to-do. "Those preppie kids get a different amount of rights," claimed a 15-year-old, one of those charged. "If I put my hand on his shoulder, I'd be arrested." The arrests in that case came as a result of the new priority the police are giving such crimes. As soon as the boys surrounded the student, they were captured by a Dalton security guard and plainclothes officers from the 19th precinct on the lookout for such incidents.
Then, the victim agreed to prosecute. "He was very bright, had a very good memory, and was very articulate about what happened to him," said Ileane Spinner, a prosecutor for the Family Court. "He practically drafted the case for us." On Monday, two of the boys were found guilty of attempted robbery. They face up to two years probation or a year and a half at an institution for juvenile offenders.
 
 
Before Your Child Sets Off
 HERE are some suggestions from parent's groups and the police to help children reduce the risk of being mugged.
Ask children to look alert and always take note of the people around them. Daydreamers make better victims.
Remind children to walk with purpose, but not to strut or act macho. A child looking to prove himself to his friends might take such behavior as a challenge.
Suggest that children travel to and from school with a classmate whenever possible. Predators often have friends along to provide physical as well as moral support. So should other children.
Help them select streets where there is a lot of pedestrian traffic rather than deserted side streets.
Remind them to seek doormen if they think they are in danger. Many doormen are now equipped with walkie-talkies and can contact the police.
If concerned about subway safety, check with the Transit Police Department to see which trains have officers regularly assigned to them as part of the Safe Passage program. Information: (718) 330-3098. If children are traveling by bus, suggest that they sit near the drivers. For information about the Safe Corridors program near your child's school, call your local police precinct.
Remind children not to flash money or possessions, and to keep bus or subway passes in their pockets until they're ready to use them. If they are threatened, tell them to give up their possessions.
Find the Safe Havens along their route and introduce children to the merchants involved. For the location of Safe Havens, call the Parents League at (212) 737-7385.
To reduce risks, private school children should leave school blazers in their lockers.
If they become victims of a crime, call the police immediately; minutes count. But even if the call is made the next day or several days later, it's not too late. The police may arrest an assailant later for another crime and connect him or her to your child's case based on the description provided. Furthermore, the police assign officers where they think the need is greatest. If you don't report a crime, the police say, it may as well have never happened. RALPH GARDNER Jr.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX PLAN: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Outlines a Plan for Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Bracing for battle with a Republican Congress and striving to win back a disgruntled electorate, President Clinton tonight sketched a blueprint of middle-class tax breaks, smaller government and new incentives for education and training for the second half of his term.
In a 10-minute televised address to the nation from the Oval Office, the President returned to the winning themes of his 1992 campaign, presenting himself as the champion of hard-working ordinary Americans. He sounded what amounted to the opening notes of his 1996 re-election effort in remarks aimed as much at reshaping himself as the Government he wants to continue to lead. 
 Mr. Clinton summoned Congress and the country to support a package of tax breaks intended to help middle-class families care for young children, send them to college or technical school, and plan for retirement and life's biggest and most important expenses, like buying a first home. [Transcript, page A36.]
In a move to cast himself as the fiscally responsible defender of the elderly -- which could severely limit his options -- Mr. Clinton challenged Congress to pass his program "without adding to the deficit and without any new cuts" in Social Security or Medicare. He said he would finance his tax package, which aides said amounted to about $60 billion over five years, by shrinking and reorganizing Government departments in ways that he left mostly unspecified.
"Fifty years ago, an American President proposed a G.I. bill of rights to help returning veterans from World War II go on to college, buy a home and raise their children," said Mr. Clinton, who, in a speech by turns bookish and personally upbeat, recalled his own youth as the son of a widowed mother who fought to make a better life. "That built this country. Tonight, I propose a middle-class bill of rights."
As he strove to assure a hearing for proposals that the Republican Congress could well ignore, Mr. Clinton embraced such traditionally Republican notions as smaller, less intrusive government and lower taxes. But he put the debate in his own terms by suggesting his actions were a fulfillment of his 1992 campaign pledge to cut the tax burden of the middle class and invest in education and training to prepare the nation for the 21st century -- ideas also long supported by the moderate Democrats who have recently accused him of forsaking them.
The President's plan would offer an annual income tax credit of up to $500 for each child under age 13 to families with adjusted gross incomes of up to $75,000, and up to $10,000 in annual deductions for any kind of post-high school education for families earning no more than $120,000.
Mr. Clinton also proposed expanding eligibility for tax-deductible contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts to families earning up to $100,000, from $50,000 now. He would permit tax-free withdrawals before retirement age to pay for education, catastrophic illness, care of an elderly parent or the purchase of a first home.
The President also proposed to consolidate 60 Federal job training programs into a single system that would give vouchers of between $2,000 and $3,000 to those who qualify for training in private employment programs.
Speaking from his desk with a flag and bright red poinsettias behind him, the President went out of his way to seem above partisan bickering, insisting: "This is not about politics as usual. As I have said for years, it is not about moving left or right, but moving forward. It is not about Government being bad or good, but about what kind of Government will best enable us to fulfill our God-given potential.
"And it's not about the next election, either. That's in your hands. Meanwhile, I'm going to do what I think is right. My rule for the next two years will be country first, and politics as usual dead last. I hope the new Congress will follow the same rule. And I hope you will, too."
But Republicans were swift and sharp in their response. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, the new chairman of the Banking Committee and Mr. Clinton's chief Congressional critic on the Whitewater affair, accused the President of blatant accommodation to the new Republican realities.
"In a pretense of leadership, the President has strapped on the seat belt in the caboose of the freight train engineered by the new Speaker of the House," Mr. Leach said, "and made a leaner-government theme the centerpiece of both political parties."
In the Republicans' official televised reply to the President's speech, the newly elected Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee vowed that his party would renew efforts to slash the size of Government, reshape Congress and set the country on a new path.
"We campaigned on these principles, and now we are going to do something that has become all too unusual in American politics," Mr. Thompson said. "We are going to do exactly what we said we were going to do during the campaign."
Officials said the President intended to pay for his plan with a sweeping mix of consolidation and cost cutting in five Federal agencies -- the Departments of Energy, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, as well as the General Services Administration (the Government's real estate management arm) and the Office of Personnel Management -- and by continuing existing caps on spending for discretionary programs into 2000.
Discretionary programs are the part of the Federal budget that must be approved each year and have a specific, limited budget. They do not include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid or other "entitlements" on which the Government spends as much as necessary to cover all those who are eligible.
The Administration's approach postpones, at least until after the 1996 elections, hard decisions about just which programs would have to be cut to pay for the tax cuts. The White House deliberately deferred any detailed discussion of the rest of the budget until Mr. Clinton's State of the Union and budget messages next month, though the President tonight pledged a top-to-bottom review of spending in the coming weeks.
The new Republican majority in Congress has already proposed a broader, deeper range of tax and spending cuts, so even Presidential proposals that otherwise might be broadly popular with voters now face at best uphill fights and uncertain coalitions on Capitol Hill -- and quite likely will simply be declared dead on arrival in Congress.
Since the election, Mr. Clinton has struggled, first simply to absorb the Democrats' sweeping defeat, and then to respond to it, and he has been buffeted not only by bold pledges from the triumphant Republicans but also by harsh criticism and lukewarm support from many fellow Democrats. Indeed, the strongest statement that the new Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, made for Mr. Clinton tonight was that his "proposal appears to be a good one."
For the last 10 days, Mr. Clinton and his top advisers have reviewed scores of options, and aides said Mr. Clinton was still tinkering with the final version of his address until early this evening, striving to communicate both his vision for the future, and his resolve to pursue it.
"He lived the American dream," one senior aide said in a White House briefing before the speech. "He's going to say that to the American people, and he wants others to believe it again as well."
Mr. Clinton himself stressed that theme in one passage of his speech, explaining his desire to make the tax code work to support worthy social goals. "Just as we made mortgage interest tax deductible because we want people to own homes, we should make college tuition tax deductible because we want people to go to college," the remarks read.
The President repeated a line from his inaugural speech, saying "I still believe deeply that there is nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America." He also echoed the second inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln, saying that the country needed "less malice and more charity."
The proposed tax cuts would take effect on Jan. 1, 1996, but senior officials acknowledged that their full effect was likely to be phased in over time, which would diminish the initial benefit.
Officials said about $24 billion in savings necessary to finance the tax breaks would come from restructuring Government agencies and farming out some functions to the private sector, though no cabinet department would be eliminated. It appears that the bulk of such savings would come from the Department of Energy. Another $52 billion in savings would come from continuing in force the caps on discretionary spending initially adopted as part of the 1990 budget accord through the turn of the century.

Charts: "CASE STUDIES: How the Tax Cut Would Work"
 How the White House says the President's tax cut for the middle class would work for three hypothetical families. In each case, the four-person family (two adults, two children) has $50,000 in wage and salary income, $7,500 in itemized deductions, and $10,000 in personal exemptions ($2,500 a person).
 
A $1,000 REDUCTION, OR 21 PERCENT CUT
 Both children are 12 or under
 Current Tax Bill -- $4,875
 Clinton Plan -- $3,875
 
A $1,500 REDUCTION, OR 31 PERCENT CUT
 Both children are over 12; family has $10,000 in education expenses
 Current Tax Bill -- $4,875
 Clinton Plan -- $3,374
 
A $600 REDUCTION, OR 12 PERCENT CUT
 Both children are over 12; no education expenses; $4,000 contribution to individual retirement account
 Current Tax Bill -- $4,875

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Extends His Deadline for Rebels' Surrender

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 15

 BODY:
With Russian troops surrounding the capital of a Caucasus region and secessionists there threatening an all-out war, President Boris N. Yeltsin backed off tonight and extended his deadline for the rebels' surrender by two days.
In a statement addressed to the people of the secessionist region, Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin said he would set aside his deadline and give forces loyal to the local leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, until midnight Saturday to disarm. He also offered to send a higher-level delegation to resume failed cease-fire talks, on the condition that Mr. Dudayev led the Chechens' delegation. 
 Whatever the fate of peace talks, the delay in an all-out war was as much a reprieve for Mr. Yeltsin as it was for his opponent. Russian troops have met with fierce resistance in Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and their advances toward the city today were impeded by thick fog. It was not even clear that the military was capable of seizing Grozny after the original deadline elapsed.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision came during a visit by Vice President Al Gore, who is in Russia for three days to discuss economic issues and technical cooperation with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry was also in Moscow today, for talks on economic and military cooperation. By extending the deadline for a Chechen surrender, Mr. Yeltsin spared both American officials the awkwardness of being present during a full-scale Russian military attack on a city of 400,000 people.
Earlier today, the Chechen government had tried to get the United States involved by asking Mr. Gore to act as a mediator between Chechen and Russian negotiators. Washington has stayed out of the fray, insisting that it views the secession as an internal Russian affair.
Shortly before Mr. Yeltsin's statement, Mr. Dudayev also called for high-level talks to resolve the conflict over the oil-rich, mainly Muslim region. But at a news conference in Grozny, Mr. Dudayev suggested that Russian soldiers would have to withdraw from Chechen territory before such talks could begin. It was that condition that caused earlier negotiations to come to a standstill.
Mr. Yeltsin also seemed to be clinging to his preference that Chechen forces disarm before a Russian withdrawal. Saying he would view a voluntary cease-fire as "a manifestation of good will," he added, "It is essential that heavy guns fall silent and then be surrendered within the set time limit."
The new deadline also seems to offer the Russian President a personal respite. Since Mr. Yeltsin sent hundreds of tanks and thousands of troops on Sunday to bring the republic to heel, he has appeared to be in a political free fall, attacked from nearly all sides for driving the country to the brink of crisis and accused of establishing a pretense for the creation of a neo-authoritarian regime.
"The Constitution does not arrive in tanks," read a front-page headline in Literaturnaya Gazeta, a liberal weekly newspaper.
Even some Russian soldiers were openly complaining about their assignment. The newspaper Izvestia quoted a Russian officer at the front who angrily invited Mr. Yeltsin to take a first-hand look at war. "Let him and all his comrades-in-arms come down here and spend a couple of days in the trenches," the officer said. "Maybe then he'll come up with a normal way out of this mess more quickly."
Russian and Chechen forces continued to clash today around Grozny, with Russian troops positioned about six miles from the capital. At least 15 Russian servicemen have been killed since the invasion began.
In his statement, Mr. Yeltsin stressed his desire to avoid further bloodshed -- and his desire for more public support. "At this crucial hour for the Chechen people's fate," he said, "I hope that all citizens will understand my position."
Mr. Yeltsin, who is recovering from minor surgery on his nose, had copies of his statement released to news agencies rather than delivering it on television.
Throughout the crisis, in fact, he has been far from public view.
Just before sending the troops into Chechnya, he checked into the hospital for the operation. Many commentators in the Russian press are convinced that Mr. Yeltsin wanted to keep some distance from the military action and has a poor hold on his own circle of fractious political advisers.
There have been unflattering comparisons with his Soviet predecessor, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who lost the confidence of liberals and reformers when his Government attacked protesters in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Lithuania. But Mr. Gorbachev has not been particularly supportive. He described Mr. Yeltsin's tough line in Chechnya as "a big mistake, and I would say it smells of adventurism."
One of Mr. Yeltsin's closest political allies, his former Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, has joined right-wing politicians in criticizing the military deployment. Mr. Gaidar said that for the first time in two years he has not even been able to reach Mr. Yeltsin by telephone. Two of the leading figures in the Russian military, Gen. Boris V. Gramov and Lieut. Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, have spoken out against the invasion.
Pavel Felgenhauer, a military expert for the newspaper Segodnya, said he believed that the decision to extend the deadline was an effort to make a virtue out of a necessity.
"The Russian forces have yet to finish the stage of operation necessary to blockade the city," he said. "They weren't ready to storm. They figured, 'Why not make some good public relations and gain more time?' "

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX PLAN;
Text of Clinton Speech Proposing Series of Tax Breaks for the Middle Class

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's speech in Washington last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
My fellow Americans, ours is a great country with a lot to be proud of. But at this holiday season everybody knows that all is not well with America, that millions of Americans are hurting, frustrated, disappointed, even angry. 
 In this time of enormous change our challenge is both political and personal. It involves Government all right, but it goes way beyond Government to the very core of what matters most to us. The question is what are we going to do about it.
Let's start with the economic situation.
I ran for President to restore the American dream and to prepare the American people to compete and win in the new American economy. For too long too many Americans have worked longer for stagnant wages and less security. For two years, we pursued an economic strategy that has helped to produce over five million new jobs.
But even though the economic statistics are moving up, most of our living standards aren't. It's almost as if some Americans are being punished for their productivity in this new economy.
We've got to change that. More jobs aren't enough, we have to raise incomes.
Fifty years ago, an American President proposed the G.I. Bill of Rights to help returning veterans from World War II go to college, buy a home and raise their children. That built this country.
Tonight, I propose a middle-class bill of rights.
There are four central ideas in this bill of rights. First, college tuition should be tax deductible. Just as we make mortgage interest tax deductible because we want people to own their own homes, we should make college tuition deductible because we want people to go to college. Specifically, I propose that all tuition for college -- community college, graduate school, professional school, vocational education or worker retraining after high school -- be fully deductible, phased up to $10,000 a year for families making up to $120,000 a year.
Education, after all, has a bigger impact on earnings and job security than ever before. So let's invest the fruits of today's recovery into tomorrow's opportunity.
Second, bringing up a child is a tough job in this economy. So we should help middle-class families raise their children.
We made a good start last year by passing the Family Leave Law, making college loans more affordable and by giving 15 million American families with incomes of $25,000 a year or less an average tax cut of more than $1,000 a year.
Now, I want to cut taxes for each child under 13, phased up to $500 per child. This tax cut would be available to any family whose income is less than $75,000.
Third, we should help middle-income people save money by allowing every American family earning under $100,000 to put $2,000 a year tax-free in an I.R.A., an individual retirement account.
But I want you to be able to use the money to live on, not just retire on. You'll be able to withdraw from this fund tax-free money for education, medical expenses, the purchase of a first home, the care of an elderly parent.
Fourth, since every American needs the skills necessary to prosper in the new economy, and most of you will change jobs from time to time, we should take the billions of dollars the Government now spends on dozens of different training programs and give it directly to you to pay for training if you lose your job or want a better one.
We can pay for this middle-class bill of rights by continuing to reduce Government spending, including subsidies to powerful interests based more on influence than need. We can sell off entire operations the Government no longer needs to run and turn dozens of programs over to states and communities that know best how to solve their own problems.
My plan will save billions of dollars from the Energy Department, cut down the Transportation Department and shrink 60 programs into 4 at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Our reinventing Government initiative, led by Vice President Gore, already has helped to shrink bureaucracy and free up money to pay down the deficit and invest in our people. Already we've passed budgets to reduce the Federal Government to its smallest size in 30 years and to cut the deficit by $700 billion.
That's over $10,000 for every American family.
In the next few days, we'll unveil more of our proposals. And I've instructed the Vice President to review every single Government department and program for further reductions.
We've worked hard to get control of this deficit after the Government debt increased four times over in the 12 years before I took office. That's a big burden on you.
About 5 percent of your income tax goes to pay for welfare and foreign aid, but 28 percent of it goes to pay for interest on the debt run up between 1981 and the day I was inaugurated President.
I challenge the new Congress to work with me to enact a middle-class bill of rights without adding to the deficit and without any new cuts in Social Security or Medicare.
I know some people just want to cut the Government blindly, and I know that's popular now, but I won't do it. I want a leaner, not a meaner, Government that's back on the side of hardworking Americans, a new Government for the new economy, creative, flexible, high quality, low cost, service oriented, just like our most innovative private companies.
I'll work with the new Republican majority and my fellow Democrats in Congress to build a new American economy and to restore the American dream. It won't be easy. Believe you me, the special interests have not gone into hiding just because there was an election in November. As a matter of fact, they're up here stronger than ever. And that's why more than ever we need lobby reform, campaign-finance reform and reform to make Congress live by the laws it puts on other people.
Together we can pass welfare reform and health care reform that work.
I'll say more about what I'll do to work with the new Congress in the State of the Union address in January.
But here's what I won't do.
I won't support ideas that sound good but aren't paid for, ideas that weaken the progress we've made in the previous two years for working families, ideas that hurt poor people who are doing their dead-level best to raise their kids and work their way into the middle class, ideas that undermine our fight against crime or for a clean environment or for better schools or for the strength and well-being of our armed forces and foreign policy.
In other words, we must be straight with the American people about the real consequences of all budgetary decisions.
My test will be: Does an idea expand middle-class incomes and opportunities? Does it promote values like family, work, responsibility and community? Does it contribute to strengthening the new economy?
If it does, I'll be for it, no matter who proposes it.
And I hope Congress will treat my ideas the same way.
Let's worry about making progress, not taking credit.
But our work in Washington won't be enough.
And that's where you come in.
This all starts with you.
Oh, we can cut taxes and expand opportunities, but governments can't raise your children, go to school for you, give your employees who've earned it a raise or solve problems in your neighborhood that require your personal commitment.
In short, government can't exercise your citizenship. It works the other way around.
The problems of this new world are complicated, and we've all got a lot to learn. That means citizens have to listen as well as talk. We need less hot rhetoric and more open conversation, less malice and more charity. We need to put aside the politics of personal destruction and demonization that have dominated too much of our debate.
Most of us are good people trying to do better, and if we all treated each other that way we would do better. We have got to be a community again.
Yes, some people do take advantage of the rest of us, by breaking the law, abusing the welfare system and flaunting our immigration laws. That's wrong, and I'm working to stop it. But the truth is that most people in this country, without regard to their race, their religion, their income, their position on divisive issues, most Americans get up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes and raise their kids the best they can.
And most of us share the same real challenges in this new economy.
We'll do a lot better job of meeting those challenges if we work together and find unity and strength in our diversity. We do have more in common, more uniting us than dividing us. And if we start acting like it, we can face the future with confidence. I still believe deeply that there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America.
This is not about politics as usual. As I've said for years, it's not about moving left or right, but moving forward. Not about Government being bad or good, but about what kind of Government will best enable us to fulfill our God-given potential. And it's not about the next election either. That's in your hands.
Meanwhile, I'm going to do what I think is right.
My rule for the next two years will be country first, and politics as usual dead last.
I hope the new Congress will follow the same rule. And I hope you will, too.
This country works best when it works together. For decades after World War II, we gave more and more Americans the chance to live out their dreams. I know; I'm blessed to be one of them.
I was born to a widowed mother at a time when my state's income was barely half the national average. The first person in my family to finish college, thanks to money my parents couldn't really afford, scholarships, loans and a half-a-dozen jobs.
It breaks my heart to see people with their own dreams for themselves and their children shattered, and I'm going to do all I can to turn it around. But I need your help. We can do it.
With all of our problems this is still the greatest country in the world, standing not in the twilight but at the dawn of our greatest days.
We still have a lot to be thankful for. Let's all remember that.
Happy holidays, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance on Signs of Little Inflation

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the fourth advance of five sessions, the stock market rose again yesterday in unusually heavy trading, helped by further signs of a moderately growing economy with little inflation.
Computer networking stocks especially benefited because they are seen as thriving in an economy where business executives, prime customers for computers, do not fear inflation. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.18 points, to 3,765.47, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.38 point, to 455.35. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index climbed 5.01 points, to 730.68.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 337.1 million shares changing hands, about 16 percent above this year's daily average of 290 million shares.
The market may also have been helped by technical factors like stock purchases in advance of the so-called triple-witching expiration today of stock options, index futures, and options on futures.
For the most part, though, potentially troublesome economic reports, like the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index earlier this week, have encouraged stock traders because the reports showed the price increases were still moderate. But the good news was not enough to change the expectation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again, either when its policy-making committee meets next week, or early next year.
Traders' concerns about how a slowing economy would affect corporate earnings prompted falls for two of the three major long-distance telephone carriers. MCI Communications, the No. 2 carrier after AT&T, set a 52-week low of 17 1/4, before closing at 17 7/8, down 5/8.
MCI's fall was prompted by Sprint's announcement that long-distance revenue growth is expected to be flat in the fourth quarter. Sprint shares also set a 52-week low of 26 1/8, before closing at 26 7/8, down 3 7/8.
AT&T, though, closed unchanged at 51. The company said on Wednesday that it had signed up 300,000 customers in November, triple its average monthly gain. Analysts see AT&T continuing to win market share at the expense of MCI and Sprint.
MCI, at 9.1 million shares, and Sprint, at 6.9 million shares, were among the day's most active stocks.
The most active issue, at 12.3 million shares, was the American depository receipts of Hanson P.L.C., but its stock is often traded heavily around the time of its ex-dividend date, which is today. On the ex-dividend date, a current purchaser of the stock does not receive a dividend. Hanson's A.D.R.'s lost 1/8, to 18 1/8.
Stocks of companies that tie together large numbers of personal computers, printers and other gear rose sharply. 3Com, which makes equipment for such computer networks, established a 52-week high of 48 3/8 and closed at that price, up 6 1/4. Alantec, which rose 4 3/8, to 25 5/8, established a 52-week high of 26 1/4.
Morgan Stanley declined 3/8, to 61, after it and S. G. Warburg announced the halt of their merger talks for the two investment houses. Bankers Trust dropped 1 3/8, to 57 7/8, after The Washington Post reported that Federal regulators were negotiating with the concern to settle lawsuits prompted by the sale of derivatives. Bankers Trust specializes in derivatives, securities whose performance is based on the action of simpler, underlying securities.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.63 point, to 248.96, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,499 to 815. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.95 points, to 426.02.

HEADLINE: Economic Slowdown May Become Wider

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
A slowdown caused by higher interest rates may be about to spread from the home-building industry to manufacturing in general, new reports suggested today.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said the manufacturing growth rate in its region was poised to slow from current high levels. 
 The Philadelphia Fed's December index of general economic activity fell to 28.9 in December from 30.5 last month, while its index of future economic activity fell more sharply, to 17 -- its lowest level since January 1991 -- from 30.6. "Firms expect growth will continue, but at a slower pace," the report said.
In a separate report, the National Association of Home Builders said today that builders were less optimistic about sales of new homes in the next six months than at any time since the recent recession.
"Housing activity tends to lead everything else both on the upside and downside," said Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "This survey is giving a sour look."
New-home building is slumping because six increases in interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve have also raised mortgage rates.
Until now, though, there were relatively few signs that the weakness was spreading outside the housing industry. Today, for example, the Commerce Department reported that American businesses, in preparation for holiday sales, increased their inventories by four-tenths of 1 percent in October -- the seventh consecutive monthly gain.
"Retail sales were gangbusters in November, so businesses were making good judgments in October," said Gene Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, an investment firm in New York. "They stocked up but didn't burden themselves."
And the Labor Department said the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week by 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 323,000. In the previous workweek, jobless claims dropped by a revised 8,000.
In the Commerce Department report, retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers all reported inventory increases for October. In September, total business inventories rose five-tenths of 1 percent. Compared with October 1993, total inventories advanced 5.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Smith College Makes History In Naming Its Next President

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Smith College, known as one of the more conservative of the top women's colleges, and as the alma mater of Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, yesterday became the first of the nation's prestigious Northeastern institutions to name a black educator as its president.
The moment was not lost on the president-to-be, Ruth Simmons, a Harvard University graduate and the youngest of 12 children of a Texas sharecropper, who is now vice provost of Princeton University. Before accepting the post at Smith, she repeatedly and bluntly asked the trustees, "Is Smith ready for this?" 
 Dr. Simmons said she had thought it more likely that Oberlin College in Ohio, which has a long history of liberalism, would be the first of the top-rated colleges to name a black president. In fact, she was one of two finalists last spring when the Oberlin trustees narrowed their search for a new president.
"But it's Smith that accepted me!" she said, adding "I don't believe that conservative people will reject all African-Americans." Besides, said Dr. Simmons, who also has been provost at Spelman College in Atlanta, America's oldest black women's college, "All schools have some conservative alumnae, even Spelman."
At Smith, which is in Northampton, Mass., Dr. Simmons, 49, will become the ninth president on July 1, 1995. She will succeed Mary Maples Dunn, who is stepping down after 10 years.
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Simmons said she did not feel she was "a pioneer."
But she made it clear that she had questioned members of the Smith College search committee and trustees about the possibility of a backlash against her appointment.
"I pushed them hard," she said. "I was feeling somewhat tentative. They persuaded me. They responded that they thought there would be a tremendous positive response, and that the appointment would be accepted by the alumnae." Smith, which has admitted black women since the 1920's, currently has 86 black students out of 2,700.
Kate Webster, chairwoman of Smith's board and a member of the search committee, said that race became an issue after Dr. Simmons became the leading candidate.
"The unanimous belief was that, given an opportunity to show who she is, what she can do and the style with which she can accomplish things, she will allay any concerns," Ms. Webster said.
Dr. Simmons attended Dillard University in New Orleans, from which she graduated summa cum laude. She studied in France on a Fulbright scholarship and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in romance languages from Harvard University.
Her ties to Princeton go back to 1983, when she was director of studies at Princeton's Butler College and later was acting director of the black studies department. After holding several administrative positions, she was named vice provost in 1992.
Dr. Simmons speaks vigorously in favor of women's colleges.
"It's not true that all barriers to women have come down," she said. "We all imagine that some day we will live in a society that does not impede women. But will that happen in my lifetime? I doubt it. And so for now, the best way to deal with it is to separate women so that they can achieve -- especially in fields like physics, chemistry and economics."
Smith College was criticized last month when an article in The Boston Globe used it as an example of the difficulties faced by women's colleges today. The article asserted that the S.A.T. scores of recent entering freshmen at Smith were declining.
Ms. Dunn responded in a letter to the newspaper, arguing that S.A.T. scores are not the best predictors of a student's ability.
Yesterday, Stacey Schmeidel, a spokeswoman for the college, said applications for admission to Smith were at an all-time high.
Dr. Simmons's apppointment was hailed by many black educators. Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of Harvard University's department of Afro-American studies and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research, said that the appointment of a black educator to such a position was long overdue.
"She understands the poetry of administration and luxuriates in it," he said.
Frank L. Matthews, publisher of Black Issues in Higher Education, said he thought it was significant that Dr. Simmons had worked not only at an elite institution like Princeton but at a historically black school like Spelman.
"At Spelman," Mr. Matthews said, "her role model was Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman, and from her she learned the practice of tough love -- nurturing students with a realistic view of the problems that confront the black community."
"She believes that you get educated to serve the community," he continued. "If she can convey that religion, then Smith will run circles around the other Ivy League schools."
Dr. Simmons agreed that her experience at Spelman had been formative but also said the same of her years at Harvard.
"My involvement in both white and black institutions provides a kind of example of how we must move through these artificial barriers that separate higher education," she said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and California Sign Water Accord

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
California and the Federal Government signed an agreement today on how to protect the water and the wildlife of the San Francisco Bay and its vast inland delta, resolving stubborn conflicts that for years had divided the region's farmers, city dwellers and conservationists.
Concluding a year of negotiations that had continued right up to a final court-ordered deadline, the two sides produced a far-reaching pact and turned a confrontation between a recalcitrant state and a determined Federal overseer into a compromise embraced by all sides. 
 The agreement is intended to preserve a vast but ecologically fragile estuary that holds the aquatic lifeblood of central California. If it succeeds in halting the watershed's prolonged environmental decline, it may prove to be a notable achievement in the Clinton Administration's effort to manage whole ecosystems rather than regulate one industry and one species at a time.
The arrangement establishes limits on how much fresh water can be diverted from the estuary to agriculture and cities, an effort to protect endangered fish species by insuring that the young fish survive their migrations and that their breeding grounds do not become too salty for survival.
Although both farmers and cities are expected to give up significant amounts of water under the plan, the agreement does not set forth exactly how much water, within the limits set today, will flow to which users. That kind of detail will be left to state and local officials to work out later.
Farmers will face the greatest costs year in and year out, while cities will feel the effects in mostly dry years, officials said. Commercial and recreational fisheries, they said, stand to gain economically.
Unlike plans for other ecosystems, like the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest or the Everglades in South Florida, which have met with widespread hostility, the plan for the California estuary was praised today by state officials and by representatives of the region's business, agricultural and environmental groups.
"I think that this is a model for the country," Carol M. Browner, the Federal Environmental Protection Administrator, said at the signing ceremony in Sacramento. "You can do it. It took a lot of patience, a lot of listening and a lot of communication."
Gov. Pete Wilson, who criticized the Clinton Administration last year over its initial plan for the estuary, heaped praise on the agreement, calling it "a major victory of consensus over confrontation." Flanked by Administration officers, state and local officials, environmentalists and agricultural representatives, he joked, "We are lacking only Yasir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin."
At issue is a watershed so thick with man-made plumbing that it can supply two-thirds of the state's water needs, the aqueducts running hundreds of miles to the region's farms and cities.
The delta is the source of drinking water for 20 million people. It also irrigates 200 different crops, including 45 percent of the nation's fruits and vegetables.
But in addition it harbors more than 120 species of fish. And when fresh water running toward the bay is diverted to cities and farms, salt water invades the 1,600-square-mile estuary, which extends east from the bay nearly to Sacramento. Some fish species have been brought to the brink of extinction as the water quality has declined, and efforts to resolve the problem have been paralyzed by fights over the precious water among interest groups.
A year ago, under legal pressure from environmental groups complaining that the state had failed to enforce the Federal Clean Water Act, four Federal agencies stepped in and said they would impose a water quality plan on the whole region. They spelled out their proposal and said it would take effect no later than today.
But urban water managers and rural agricultural interests both believed that the initial Federal plan would set aside too much water for the estuary, worsening what the farmers call a "regulatory drought."
Resistance also came from the State of California.
Usually the states routinely set water quality standards for Federal approval under the Clean Water Act. But Governor Wilson had balked at doing so, citing problems posed by another Federal law, the Endangered Species Act, that he said made the task impossible.
But in the last 12 months Federal and state officials re-negotiated the initial plan, with the Administration agreeing to reduce the water reserved for environmental reasons. In the end, they whittled down that amount by about a fifth, from 500,000 to 400,000 acre feet in a year with normal rainfall. An acre foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough to keep two typical households supplied for a year.
The negotiators managed to make the reduction by asking scientists to come up with a new approach for calculating how much fresh water would be needed to reach the desired salinity. The new measure, based on monthly measurements instead of rough annual estimates, is more accurate and more flexible, an official said.
They also agreed on ways of protecting fish other than increasing the flow of fresh water, for instance operating pumps differently at times of the year when the young fish are most vulnerable.

HEADLINE: U.S. Signs Agreement to Help Haiti Revitalize Its Economy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Haiti's Government signed an agreement with the United States today as part of a Clinton Administration plan to revitalize the Haitian economy.
Under an initiative announced on Wednesday by the White House, the United States will provide technical and financial aid to Haiti so businesses can return to the Caribbean nation. 
 The measures are intended to improve telecommunications, energy and transportation, as well as clear the way for Haiti to borrow money from international financial institutions. To that end, the United States has pledged nearly $25 million to Haiti to clear past-due payments on loans, the White House said.
Today, officials of the Haitian Finance Ministry and the United States Department of Commerce signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint Business Development Council, which will clude representatives from the private sector and both Governments, to stimulate economic growth in Haiti.
The Haitian Government will do its part to encourage trade and investment by providing incentives to business, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said. They will include tax breaks for companies that establish operations in Haiti by July 1, 1995. President Aristide also said that by the end of this year he planned to introduce legislation to Parliament that would lower import tariffs, especially those on food.
"Our challenge is great, but our will to succeed is greater," he said at a meeting sponsored by Caribbean/ Latin American Action, a nonprofit corporation. "Haiti is back in business and ready to go,"
The immediate focus of the Clinton Administration initiative will be on the assembly and handicrafts industries, which could provide jobs for tens of thousands of Haitians who had few ways to make money under an embargo imposed against the military leaders who overthrew President Aristide in 1991. The plan includes a $12 million project by the Agency for International Development to support small Haitian businesses.

HEADLINE: Star Fades for Natural Gas Autos

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
What ever happened to natural gas vehicles?
After the oil crises of the 1970's and the clean air laws of the 1980's, the consensus among environmentalists, petroleum executives and state and Federal officials was that the United States would reap economic and environmental rewards from converting millions of vehicles to natural gas. 
 But conversion to natural gas has never caught on, and another setback could come as soon as today. A ruling on clean-car standards is expected from the Environmental Protection Agency today or early next week, and many experts expect it to eliminate one of the remaining incentives for building and driving natural gas cars and trucks.
Natural gas once seemed like such a good idea. Compared with solar power, electric cars and other energy exotica, it appeared to be a simple solution. Natural gas is clean and has a higher octane than race-car gasoline, the nation has abundant reserves of the fuel and using it requires hardly any new technology. What's more, in terms of cost-per-mile, natural gas is up to 40 percent less expensive than gasoline.
But not many have embraced the technology, with fewer than 33,000 vehicles in the nation running on natural gas, according to Federal estimates. Operators of large fleets of cars or trucks, including New York City, have found that drivers prefer vehicles powered by gasoline.
The Big Three auto makers have shown limited enthusiasm, and General Motors said earlier this year that it would suspend production of its natural-gas vehicles at least through 1996 and recall all 2,500 it had already sold. G.M. made that decision after fuel tanks ruptured and exploded in two different trucks, causing minor injuries.
Another big setback for the natural gas movement could lie in the impending E.P.A. ruling. The agency has been considering a request by New York and 11 other Northeastern states to have the Government impose strict car-emission rules for the region from Maine to Virginia. The rules would be the same as those adopted by California, and the natural gas industry believes that imposing them in the Northeast would result in the use of tens of thousands of natural gas vehicles.
But the auto makers have proposed a compromise that would require them simply to make cleaner-burning gasoline vehicles, which would be sold in all 49 states besides California. The E.P.A. has expressed interest in the auto makers' proposal. And the Big Three have vowed that no matter what is required, they will try hard to do it with gasoline and nothing more exotic.
With the prospects increasingly gloomy for natural gas vehicles, even the advocates say that instead of the millions of such cars and trucks that they once hoped for, the numbers could be much lower.
"Any reasonable projection should include zero" as a possibility, said James S. Cannon, the author of "Paving the Way to Natural Gas Vehicles," published by the New York environmental group Inform.
Not surprisingly, a main proponent of natural gas vehicles has always been the natural gas utility companies that sell the fuel. Because the United States produces 30 percent more natural gas from its petroleum fields than it does oil, there is an adequate supply and a national distribution system that already delivers the fuel to 50 million homes.
Converting cars to use natural gas requires some special equipment -- a high-pressure tank, fuel-pressure regulators and modifications to the fuel-injection system -- but none of this is very complicated.
Natural gas has an octane of 110 to 130, compared with an octane of 93 or less for the gasoline sold at filling stations, which should mean that natural gas delivers much higher power. But most vehicles converted to natural gas -- typically at a cost of several thousand dollars -- retain the ability to run on gasoline, too.
Using both fuels enables the vehicles to range beyond the limited number of fueling stations with natural gas pumps. As a result, the engines must be tuned to gasoline specifications, meaning that natural gas loses its power edge and the engine often performs worse and runs dirtier than with gasoline.
The experience of New York City is instructive. Hoping to help clean the air, reduce fuel costs and set an example for the private sector, the city government in the last few years has converted hundreds of cars and light trucks. The conversions were done largely at the expense of two local gas utilities, Consolidated Edison and Brooklyn Union Gas, and the city signed contracts with them that guaranteed certain minimum purchase levels of natural gas.
But the city has incurred penalty fees on those contracts because it is using only about two-thirds as much natural gas as it agreed to buy. City officials, seeking the reasons, say that many of the cars may still be running on gasoline or that some drivers may see them as lemons and are not driving them at all.
In fact, some of the conversions could leave that impression. For example, Joe Olive, the assistant deputy chief of operations for technical services at the city's Parks Department, recalls being stuck in traffic on a hot summer day in a 1989 Ford Bronco running on natural gas, and telling the driver that when they returned to the shop, they would have to have the air-conditioner fixed.
But the driver, Kurt Schroer, simply reached down and threw a switch that converted the Bronco back to gasoline, and the air-conditioner began working fine, Mr. Olive said.
In Texas and other places where local gas utilities have been aggressive, some fleet operators are converting. In Atlanta, for example, the city housing authority converted 18 Ford Rangers to natural gas. But officials found that converting them was one thing, and getting them to run on the new fuel was another.
Scott A. Massie, the facilities and fleet equipment manager for the Atlanta housing authority, said, "When you give people a choice, they usually go with gasoline, because it's more familiar, I guess."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
S.E.C. Begins to Investigate Orange County Board's Role

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy has shifted to the county's elected board of supervisors, even as the agency's chairman suggested that voters should throw the five-member board out of office.
The S.E.C., late on Wednesday, subpoenaed records of the supervisors that relate to the sale of bonds by the county. But county officials said today that a letter to the board from the S.E.C. assured them that the request for documents "should not be construed as an indication by the commission that any violations of the law have occurred." 
 The widening of the S.E.C.'s investigation came hours after Arthur Levitt Jr., the S.E.C.'s chairman, rebuked the five-member board for not challenging the investment strategy pursued by the former treasurer, Robert L. Citron, that forced the county to file for bankruptcy. As a result of Mr. Citron's heavy borrowing and ill-timed bets that interest rates would fall this year, Orange County is expected to lose more than $2 billion of the $7.5 billion invested by 187 local governments, school districts and other county institutions.
Mr. Levitt's speech, made with little advance notice, went unreported when it was delivered here on Wednesday. In remarks at a luncheon sponsored by the Town Hall, a speaker's forum whose members are mostly business leaders, Mr. Levitt said: "If your supervisors are so lax that they allow you the unique power, without oversight, to make that kind of speculation, I think the voters of that community should throw the whole bunch out of office."
In recent days, several Orange County residents have attended county board meetings to ask board members and other top county officials to resign. Next week, Gaddi Vasquez will take over as chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors from Thomas Riley, who is retiring, as is Harriett M. Wieder. Two newly elected supervisors, James Silva and Marian Bergeson, will take the vacant spots on Jan. 2.
The initial focus of the S.E.C. inquiry was on the brokerage houses that sold Orange County bonds to the public. At least two firms have been subpoenaed by the S.E.C.: Merrill Lynch & Company, which sold $600 million in county bonds in the summer, and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., a Dallas firm that had been retained to sell a coming issue.
The S.E.C. would not comment on its overall investigation. Lawyers close to the case, however, said the regulators were looking at whether the firms sold bonds to investors knowing that the Orange County investment pool faced losses and without disclosing that information.
Regulators are also reviewing the relationship between the county and Merrill Lynch, which has received millions of dollars in fees from selling the county's bonds. One question is whether county officials improperly steered business to Merrill Lynch because of campaign contributions or any other gifts made by brokers. Merrill has denied any wrongdoing in its relationship with Orange County.
The county succeeded today in its first attempts to sell off the portfolio. Salomon Brothers, which has been retained by the county to convert the assets into safer, more liquid instruments, sold the first batch for $483 million, taking in nearly 100 bids that totaled $7.5 billion.
"I'm pleased with the amount of interest and generally pleased with the spreads," said James A. Forese, managing director of Salomon and head of the bond syndication desk. "But tomorrow's a new day and we may not have as much response."
He would not disclose the number of winning bids. The Federal National Mortgage Association, which issued some of the bonds sold today, said that it had tried to buy back some of those bonds but that other bidders offered higher prices.
On Friday, Salomon expects to sell an additional $500 million in bonds, While today's sale was mostly of Treasury and Fannie Mae bonds with durations of three to four years, Friday's offering is expected to include bonds with longer maturities. Mr. Forese said the firm had divided the auction into two parts to avoid swamping the market.
The real test for the county is not so much the outcome of the sale of these relatively easy-to-sell conventional securities as its ability to sell its larger supply of structured notes, which are more complex instruments whose performance is tied to declining interest rates. Salomon Brothers would not discuss when or how these securities would be sold.

HEADLINE: Arrest of Financier, Accused of Stealing, Shakes Barcelona

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain

 BODY:
People in Barcelona were accustomed to seeing Javier de la Rosa, a maverick financier, met by investment bankers, Middle Eastern sheiks and Government ministers as he stepped from his Mercedes-Benz limousine. But on Oct. 18, he stepped into the arms of the police, who arrested him on suspicion of stealing the assets of his company.
The arrest shook the labyrinthine streets and grand boulevards of Barcelona. Mr. de la Rosa's rise was intertwined with that of this city of 1.7 million. 
 After 1985, when Spain entered the European Community, this bustling port city attracted billions of dollars in investments. In 1992, when the Olympic Games were staged here, fortunes were made.
The political stock of Catalonia, the region of which Barcelona is the capital, has also risen. As head of the Catalan government, a de la Rosa associate named Jordi Pujol made it possible for the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe Gonzalez, to return to power at the head of a minority Government in June 1993. Mr. Pujol agreed to throw his regional party's support to Mr. Gonzalez in exchange for favors for Catalonia.
Mr. Pujol also supported Mr. de la Rosa and his company, Grand Tibidabo, a real estate development enterprise with many other interests. The company collapsed when the local real estate bubble burst after the 1992 Olympics, and Mr. de la Rosa is accused of stripping it of $80 million in assets.
Mr. de la Rosa's supporters say he is the victim of political intrigues against Mr. Pujol, and through him, the Prime Minister.
But even during the years when he appeared to be most successful, Mr. de La Rosa's record was not all sunshine. In 1986, a Catalan bank that he had steered into heady expansion with agriculture investments, Banco Garriga Nogues, collapsed under $300 million in bad loans, and his management was widely criticized.
At the same time, Mr. de La Rosa was making contact with Kuwaiti investors, who eventually plowed $5 billion into real estate, chemical and food companies through a corporation of his called Grupo Torras.
When Spain's boom turned to bust, as the recession of the early 1990's hit, Grupo Torras went into receivership. Mr. de la Rosa and dozens of other businessmen are under investigation into how the bulk of the $5 billion was squandered.
After the Kuwaiti venture failed, Mr. de la Rosa fostered a plan for Tibidabo to develop a theme park south of Barcelona called Tibigardens, in partnership with the American beer company Anheuser-Busch.
Much fog surrounds what happened to the project, but in the end Mr. de la Rosa was forced from Tibidabo, and minority shareholders are suing to regain the vanished assets. The project is to be built by other companies.
Jose Maria Mena, the investigating judge, who is plowing through 600 volumes of documents, denied there is a political vendetta.
"In no case are we interested in persecuting any person," he said. "There is no personal desire for triumph."
But Alfredo Fraile, whose Agencia A public relations company has worked for Mr. de la Rosa for six years, contended that in the inflated world of real estate during the 1980's, many fortunes were owed to Mr. de la Rosa.
"How many people bought shares in his companies, and when the prices went up, sold at huge profits?" he said. "And where are they now? We're in a situation in Spain where they're looking for scandal, with a political component."

HEADLINE: Prosecutor Rejects Rape Cases Brought by Male Van Drivers

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
After a 21-month investigation, District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens issued a report yesterday concluding that seven immigrant van drivers working in the Rockaways had falsely accused a male police officer of raping them. Mr. Brown said Officer Reggie Rivera would not be prosecuted because the rapes never took place.
The drivers, all of whom are black immigrants working in the illicit van trade on the Rockaway peninsula, had a strong motive to defame Officer Rivera because he had issued thousands of tickets to van drivers and represented a direct threat to their livelihood, the report said. 
 At a news conference, Mr. Brown stopped short of saying the accusers had deliberately conspired to fabricate the charges, which have led to months of protest marches by black community activists. But Police Commissioner William J. Bratton did not hesitate in calling them liars.
"In no uncertain terms, backed up by a very lengthy report, the District Attorney of Queens County has made it clear that there are not seven rape victims in this case, there are only two: New York City Police Officer Reggie Rivera, and the citizens of New York City who were raped by this rat pack," Mr. Bratton said.
The accusers and their lawyers, the Commissioner said, had maliciously concocted the rape stories in order to intimidate the police from enforcing the law against the van industry.
Leon Greenberg, a lawyer for the accusers -- who was personally accused by Mr. Brown of hindering the investigation -- said the report was "a carefully crafted scheme" to cover up the truth of the allegations and protect the City of New York from a huge financial liability. He said investigators from the District Attorney's office and the police were biased against the accusers, and had fabricated evidence to make the charges appear to be a conspiracy.
And in a brief telephone interview, one of the seven accusers denied that he or the others had lied about the rapes.
"There is nothing made up in this story," said the accuser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a civil suit is being pursued. "They are trying to cover up. We thought if we went to the D.A., this would never happen to us again. But now I feel so disappointed and sick."
The case began in April 1993, when an African-born livery-van driver from Rockaway Beach accused Officer Rivera of having sodomized him at gunpoint three months earlier. In October and December 1993, three other van drivers and a mechanic who had been test-driving a van charged that Officer Rivera had raped them. And yesterday's report disclosed for the first time that two other drivers had stepped forward earlier this year to say they had been raped, beginning in 1989.
Because the District Attorney took so long to decide whether to present the case to a grand jury for prosecution, many politicians and community leaders had begun calling for a special prosecutor in the case. Several black newspapers and clergy members rallied to the drivers' cause, saying their case was being ignored because they were black immigrants operating in an underground economy on the margins of society.
But Mr. Brown said the nature of the charges produced the most exhaustive investigation in the history of his office, including hundreds of interviews, hours of surveillance, the review of 4,000 traffic tickets, and the use of an independent expert in sexual assaults.
John M. Ryan, the senior executive assistant district attorney who headed the investigation, said there was no single piece of evidence that conclusively proved the accusers had concocted their charge. But taken as a whole, he said, there was no physical or medical evidence of rape and there was a good deal of evidence to show that Officer Rivera could not have raped the men in the manner they claimed.
The report said Officer Rivera was usually writing traffic tickets during the times that the accusers said the rapes took place. The van in which the first accuser said he was raped was ticketed in a different location at the same time the rape was said to have occurred, the report said. It also said some of the physical details of the rape descriptions provided by the accusers were implausible.
Most importantly, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brown said, the accusers had a strong motive to get rid of Officer Rivera. Their report describes the officer as a "ticket-writing machine," issuing up to 200 tickets a day to drivers in the thriving unlicensed van industry, who illegally pick up passengers for less than the cost of public transportation and take them to subway stops or shopping malls.
The first accuser, described in the report as an industry leader, was so angry about being repeatedly ticketed by Officer Rivera that he organized an August 1992 meeting of Rockaway van drivers in a public library to urge them to file citizen complaints against the officer, the report said.
When those complaints failed to get the officer transferred, Mr. Ryan said, the accusers began their charges of rape. He added that he did not know if any of the accusers except the first were present at the library meeting.
The accusers' other motive was financial, Mr. Ryan said, noting that they have filed a $120 million civil damage suit against the city. Mr. Greenberg said his clients would not drop the suit.
The report also says that at least five of the seven had at one point lived in the same apartment complex on Seagirt Boulevard in Far Rockaway. The accusers have said throughout the investigation that only two of them knew each other, and yesterday, Mr. Greenberg continued to make the same point.
Asked if he planned to prosecute the accusers for making a false report, Mr. Brown said he did not, pointing out that such an action was a Class B misdemeanor, the lowest class of criminal conduct. He said building such a case would require an extensive effort for such a small charge and might deter legitimate sexual-assault victims from coming forward in other cases.
Many of the findings in the case represented a battle of experts. The accusers had hired Nat Laurendi, a retired New York City police detective who was formerly chief polygraph operator for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, who conducted lie-detector tests that he said showed they were telling the truth about the rapes. But Mr. Brown's in-house polygraph operator, as well as the F.B.I.'s chief lie-detector expert, reviewed Mr. Laurendi's tests and concluded that the accusers were actually lying.
Similarly, both sides hired experts in rape trauma syndrome to determine whether the accusers appeared to exhibit the normal characteristics of rape victims, and the two experts disagreed. The report does not address whether, because the accusers come from Africa and the Caribbean, there may have been language and cultural barriers that produced behavior patterns different from the norms. But Mr. Ryan said his office's expert on the subject has a background in the cultural differences among victims of sexual assault.
Officer Rivera declined to comment yesterday, but his lawyer, James Lysaght, chief counsel for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said his client was still upset at having "become the object of public scorn on the basis of such despicable calumny."
As a result of a court-approved agreement in the civil case, the officer remains restricted from entering the Rockaways except to go to the bank once a week. Hearings in the civil case are scheduled to resume on Dec. 27.
The officer was transferred last spring from the Rockaways to the 107th Precinct in Fresh Meadows, Queens, where he is on active duty. Commissioner Bratton said he had not determined Officer Rivera's future assignment.

Mixed Day For Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury notes and bills rallied and bonds fell yesterday after a report suggested that higher interest rates were beginning to create a slowdown in manufacturing.
The report, a survey of regional manufacturing conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, eased concerns about any acceleration in inflation and helped to confirm expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday, when its policy-making committee meets. 
 The Philadelphia Fed's index of general economic activity fell to 28.9 in December from 30.5 last month.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/8, to 9523/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.87 percent, from 7.86 percent on Wednesday. The price of the two-year note rose 1/8, to 9917/32 , for a yield of 7.51 percent, down from 7.58 percent on Wednesday and nearly 20 basis points below Tuesday's yield of 7.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Yields on the three-month bill dropped as much as 15 basis points.
The Philadelphia Fed report, coming after Labor Department reports on producer and consumer prices this week, meant "the three-year area looks most attractive," said Jim Somers, who runs a $5 million hedge fund in Radnor, Pa. "You can sell the one-year bill and buy the three-year and pick up 52 basis points."
Speculators who sold bills on a bet that the Fed would make them less valuable by raising short-term rates, reversed that bet after this week's inflation reports, traders said.
Yield spreads between benchmark mortgage securities and Treasury bonds reached their narrowest in three weeks as investors speculated that a shortage of new mortgages would insure better returns.
Municipal bonds were little changed as some investors sought to sell securities to record tax losses before the end of the year, traders said. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues was unchanged at 6.98 percent.
Orange County, Calif., began selling the debt remaining in its loss-plagued investment portfolio yesterday.
Salomon Brothers Inc., manager of the auction, took bids on nine pools of the fund's Government agency securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board; the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac.
Demand for the securities was strong, as traders expected, with $7.5 billion of bids received by Salomon.
Differences in yield, or spreads, between agency bonds and Treasuries widened by as much as 20 basis points last week after Orange County filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy because investment banks sold about $11.4 billion of agency notes that were held as collateral for Orange County's derivative investments.
The agency sales "cheapened up the agency area," attracting buyers, said Jerry Paul, who helps manage about $3 billion at the Invesco Trust Company in Denver.

The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies yesterday, with many participants sidelined ahead of the year-end holidays.
"There is very little activity and very little volume," David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. "The silence is deafening. People are just in the process of squaring up for the year end." 
 The dollar was bolstered somewhat after the German mark eased from recent highs against the Italian lira and the French franc in early trading in Europe.
The dollar had been been weighed down earlier in the week by the strength of the mark, as traders shifted out of the Italian and French currencies and into the mark. In many cases, dealers bought dollars for lire and francs and then sold dollars for marks, considered the anchor currency in Europe.
But dealers in Europe began selling marks at its higher levels yesterday to book profits and that helped to relieve some pressure on the dollar.
In New York trading, the dollar eased after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its industry activity survey showed a slightly slower pace of growth in December.
Susan Stearns, vice president at Harris Trust New York, said the milder-than-expected data "dashed speculation of any short-term interest rate hike that the Federal Reserve might do next week."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5710 marks from 1.5682 marks on Wednesday. The dollar edged up to 100.37 yen, from 100.30 yen on Wednesday.
 Some dealers had expected the Fed to raise rates for the seventh time since February next Tuesday, when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets. Higher interest rates tend to benefit the dollar by attracting investors drawn by a higher return on investments denominated in the currency.
In other currency trading yesterday, the Australian dollar rose to 78 United States cents, its highest since December 1991, a day after the Reserve Board of Australia, the country's central bank, raised short-term interest rates a full percentage point, to 7.5 percent. In New York, the Australian dollar settled at 77.80 United States cents.

'What's Wrong'? Too Much
"What's Wrong With This Picture?" has its answer: the critics didn't like the Jewish mother ghost story starring Faith Prince, and the public didn't buy tickets. It opened on Broadway on Dec. 8; it closes on Sunday.
"We decided that the best thing to do was return the 25 percent that's left of the capitalization to the investors," said David Stone, the lead producer, whose first production, "Family Secrets," has run for 15 months off Broadway. 
 He raised $1.25 million for "What's Wrong" and will give back $325,000. "We don't think the box office warrants spending our reserve to try building an audience," he added. "I'm sorry it didn't work out better, but I couldn't be prouder to have tried. We brush ourselves off and go on."
Getting in her "I told you so's" is Ruth Kalkstein, who had an option on the play from 1990 to 1993 but never found investors. She had a tiny share of this production, but she and Mr. Stone fell out after she criticized his casting and his decision to go to Broadway. So although he gave her tickets to previews, he disinvited her from opening night. "I regret that now," Mr. Stone said this week. "It probably wasn't a kind thing to have done. My mother raised me better than that."
 
A Public Goodbye
 Another pink slip has been handed out at the Joseph Papp Public Theater as George C. Wolfe consolidates his control. Jason Steven Cohen, the managing director who began there 22 years ago as a stage manager, will leave next month.
There was no falling-out, said Mr. Cohen, 48. "But after helping chart a course through tumultuous times, with the promised land of economic and artistic stability in sight, I'm hugely disappointed not to be a part of it."
As Papp's last No. 2, Mr. Cohen negotiated the Public's 99-year lease, arrangements for the now-defunct Festival Latino and exchanges with the Royal Court Theater in London.
What will he do? "Good question," he said. "I'll think about working in films or TV. Maybe I'll teach, and give back what I've learned. Maybe I'll work in somebody's orchard."
Mr. Wolfe has recently hired other administrators, including Joey Parnes as general manager, but wouldn't say what the new hierarchy will be. "I'm not being coy," he said. "I'm still assessing the structure of the institution."
 
A Polygram Goodbye
 Another theater figure left more abruptly: John Scher, a promoter of megaconcerts (including Woodstock '94) who was also the first president of Polygram Diversified Entertainment, resigned last week. Polygram is one of the few conglomerates, with Disney and Capital Cities/ ABC, that are powers on Broadway; it backed "Jelly's Last Jam," "Damn Yankees" and the long-delayed "Victor/Victoria" and owns 30 percent of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful production company.
Mr. Scher and Polygram said he left because the company's chief executive, Alain Levy, resisted Mr. Scher's plans to expand the division. He still sees "extraordinary opportunities" on Broadway, especially if more pop musicians like Pete Townshend of "Tommy" will write shows.
 
Teapot Dome-Jack the Ripper Link
 "Camping With Henry and Tom" opens with a Model T hitting a deer. The stranded men -- Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Warren G. Harding -- are joined by a Secret Service colonel reluctant to let the President wander the woods. The play, based on a real camp-out, is coming to the Lucille Lortel Theater in February. It begins rehearsals on Jan. 10, a lucky date for the playwright, Mark St. Germain. On the same day, rehearsals are also to begin for a Playwrights Horizons production of his musical "Jack's Holiday." The incident that inspired this one was uglier. After Jack the Ripper disemboweled several London prostitutes, New York's chief of police, Thomas Byrnes, boasted that he would have had the Ripper collared within 36 hours. In 1891, a prostitute was killed Ripper-style on Manhattan's waterfront, and the challenge was on.
Mr. St. Germain and his composer, Randy Courts, also wrote "Johnny Pye and the Fool Killer."
 
 
Confessing a Theft
 Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a producer is driven more by the need for publicity or the need for absolution. Which could have been stronger when James Freydberg called to confess, "I'm doing something I always hated when movie producers did it to me"?
His sin: With Khalil Kain two weeks into rehearsals for the revival of "Zooman and the Sign," now being mounted by Second Stage Theater, Mr. Freydberg stole him for the title role in his television movie "Zooman," now shooting in Los Angeles. He agonized about it, and auditioned other actors, but ultimately went ahead.
In this 1980 play by Charles Fuller, a stray bullet from Zooman's gun kills a girl on her porch during a drug turf battle. The neighbors are silent. Her father raises a sign attacking their cowardice, and infuriates Zooman.
Before the opening on Sunday, Carole Rothman, the artistic director of Second Stage, spoke of Mr. Freydberg in pleasant tones but unprintable terms, adding: "If he felt that badly about it, he wouldn't have done it. He's got to live with himself. We've found someone I think will be even better, Larry Gilliard Jr."
The reviews say Mr. Gilliard has worked out fine. Mr. Freydberg is glad.
 
Footlights
 *Glenn Close will be on vacation from "Sunset Boulevard" from March 7 through March 19. Her standby, Karen Mason, will play the role. If you insist, box offices exchange tickets.
*Paul Ronan knows what he wants for Christmas. In Kenneth Branagh's "Public Enemy" at the Irish Arts Center, he plays a Belfast hoodlum who thinks he's Jimmy Cagney. Ten days ago, there was a slip-up in a fight scene with Neal Jones, who plays his straight-arrow brother, and Mr. Ronan's two front teeth were knocked out.
*Because tourists at the TKTS booth are nervous about out-of-the-way theaters, "Inside Out," the group-therapy musical at the Cherry Lane, is experimenting. Next week, a free shuttle bus will run from Times Square to the theater, at 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village.

Phils Spend While Clubs Poor-Mouth

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
WE don't know if there will be reputable baseball in April but the owners are playing games in December. The most insulting thing the owners are doing goes far beyond threatening a salary cap at the players and then backing off for a week, as they did yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
The delay might even turn out to be statesmanlike, if you can imagine that from this bunch. In the meantime, the really despicable thing the owners are doing is conducting business as usual. They are bleating that they must have an artificial limit on salaries, but on Wednesday the Philadelphia Phillies had the nerve, the gall, the chutzpah, to sign Gregg Jefferies for $20 million for four years. 
 Have they no sense of shame? Paying $5 million a year for a good hitter who's never proven he's a winning player is not out of sight, considering the ludicrous salaries tossed around by the owners. A month ago, Houston re-signed Jeff Bagwell for $27 million for four years. But the Jefferies timing is contemptuous to the public.
The Phillies will say they are lucky to be able to afford Gregg Jefferies, that baseball never meant to stop being competitive for top players. In the most recent proposals for a tax on payrolls, the Phillies were listed as "haves" by both the owners' and the players' economists. They sell tickets, they're in a major television market, they do fine. But isn't this charade all about rich owners showing some solidarity with their poor cousins?
Legally, of course, the owners cannot afford to have an official policy of not signing free agents. They've been down this collusion path before. They clumsily avoided signing free agents like Tim Raines and lived to pay the price in damages. But the Phillies could have declined to sign Jefferies. Who made them? It was their own choice. And that's the point.
Just about every one of these owners made money in some other field, then got into baseball because they were convinced they could outsmart all those other clodhopper owners. Hobnob with the players. Win the World Series. Impress the guys at the club. So they tossed around money for players who turned out to be busts. Every town has its stories.
The owners are embarrassed at having spent like fools and being beaten by the players association for the past two decades. The owners are still threatening to get even by imposing new labor rules on the players, which would send this business into the courts and the Congress. It has come to this because the owners failed to impress the self-centered, short-sighted athletes there is any kind of financial urgency. The way the owners hide their profits, I don't believe their poor-mouthing, either.
The owners don't even have the character to close shop while they bluster. The Yankees traded for Jack McDowell Wednesday night and signed Tony Fernandez yesterday. Will Steinbrenner try to force either of them to break the picket line on opening day? That's going to this winter's version of the old Hot Stove League. Who's got the most scabs?
I wouldn't put it past the owners. They talk as if they would be performing a public service by dragging up the culls and rejects and palming them off as baseball players. Bud Selig tries to sound like Santa Claus when he says he'd personally cut ticket prices if he had to field bush leaguers.
Meanwhile, the sad-sack fans try to make sense of this. Some of them were calling in to sports radio yesterday babbling about the Yankees' pitching rotation with Jack McDowell. More likely, the Yankee pitching rotation will be names you have not yet heard. How grubby.
Not only that, Steinbrenner wants you to underwrite it. The clubs are still selling tickets for next year. At going rates. The poor fans are signing up because they don't want to lose their good locations. To see what -- the return of Jim Coates and Duke Carmel?
It's time for the fans to be offended. No more idealism. The only weapon the fans have is not to buy tickets. Lend money to Steinbrenner and Doubleday and Wilpon and Selig and The Chicago Tribune and Ted Turner and Jerry Reinsdorf? Lend money to the Philadelphia Phillies as a down payment for $20 million for Gregg Jefferies?
Let them settle this thing first. They think you're fools. Prove you're not. Never lend money to baseball owners. What a clean, pure way to start the new year.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX PLAN: NEWS ANALYSIS;
About-Face by Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
For the first two years of his Presidency, Bill Clinton insisted that reducing the Federal budget deficit was his highest calling. Tonight, he reversed course.
What is most important is not the details of what he proposed: a variety of tax breaks designed mostly for political appeal and a seemingly pain-free method of raising the revenue to pay for them. The Republican Congress is no more likely to adopt this President's budget offerings than Democratic Congresses were likely to accept President George Bush's. 
 Much more significant is what the measures say about how the President is positioning himself ideologically for his next two years in office and his race for re-election.
Rather than try to persuade the public that the deficit is a corrosive force that must be brought under control to keep it from eating away at the country's economic roots, a view held by most economists but relatively few politicians, Mr. Clinton has opted for the course Republicans have followed for years. For him, as well as for his political opponents, lowering the deficit will play second fiddle to lowering taxes.
The Republicans who will be controlling Congress beginning next year have promised to pass a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget by early in the next century, but they have given no indication whatsoever how they intend to accomplish that. Instead, they have emphasized the handsome tax breaks in their script.
Mr. Clinton's tax proposals are not so generous, but for better or worse, he is on the same stage.
The President's advisers dispute the notion that he has flip-flopped on this issue the way he did, for example, on policies regarding Haiti and Bosnia. The advisers say that Mr. Clinton has always wanted a middle-class tax cut -- after all, he proposed one during his election campaign -- but that reducing the deficit had to come first.
For three straight fiscal years, the deficit has fallen. In part, that is because of the budget Mr. Clinton pushed through Congress last year. The deficit is expected to begin to rise once more in the fiscal year that begins next October unless taxes are increased or spending is reduced further. The President ignored that in his speech tonight.
Presidential assistants who spoke to reporters tonight on the condition that they not be identified insisted that the tax cuts Mr. Clinton was offering would be fully offset by spending reductions.
Maybe so. But the proposed tax breaks were described tonight with considerable specificity. The spending cuts were described only in the most general terms. A White House spokesman said the Administration would describe the tax measures in even greater detail on Friday but would not deal publicly with the specifics of the spending reductions until next week.
No mention was made tonight of reducing the deficit further in any significant way or of steps to keep it from rising beginning in 1996.
The most unpleasant part of the President's tax proposals -- that they will be gradually introduced over a period of years rather than becoming effective immediately -- was not discussed publicly tonight.
Furthermore, most of the savings in spending -- $52 billion out of a total of $76 billion -- would be accomplished without immediate political pain by extending the freeze on discretionary spending programs through the year 2000. (Discretionary spending includes items ranging from battleships to ballpoint pens -- everything the Government puts up money for except entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, under which benefits are paid to the people who meet the eligibility requirements regardless of the total cost to the Government.)
The freeze has been in effect since 1991 and was to have expired in 1998. It has indeed held down spending. But the Administration is not saying which programs are in line for cuts in 1999 and 2000 to maintain the freeze, whether they would be in the military or social programs or what. Since no one knows who would take the hit, there is no current political cost to the President.
Only a few specific program cuts were divulged tonight, but some of them are likely to generate considerable political opposition.
For example, the Administration intends to sell dams, power stations and other assets connected to hydroelectric plants the Government owns in Western states. This would doubtless result in higher electricity costs in those states and is likely to be opposed by, among others, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, who will be the new chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and his fellow Republican from Oregon, Senator Bob Packwood, who will be chairman of the Finance Committee.
Similar proposals have arisen in the past, but they were blocked by Representative Thomas S. Foley, the Washington Democrat who was Speaker of the House.
Money would also be saved by turning over the air-traffic control system to private operators. Opponents of this step include the general aviation industry. Most of the American-built planes flown by private pilots are made by companies with headquarters in Kansas. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas will be the new Republican majority leader.
The tax breaks Mr. Clinton wants would be helpful to middle-income families but would by no means be a windfall. The White House a family with two small children and an income of $50,000 would save $1,000 a year in taxes, or less than $20 a week. A comparable family with a college tuition bill of more than $10,000 would save $1,500 a year.
The Clinton proposal faces stiff competition on Capitol Hill. Republicans in the House have offered a $500 tax credit for all dependent children in families with incomes below $200,000. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, has offered lower taxes for all families with incomes below $75,000.
Today, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, put his oar in the water with a proposal to double the personal exemption parents can take for each dependent child to $5,000 from $2,500. This would save a middle-income family in the 15 percent tax bracket $375 per child in taxes. It would save an affluent family in the 36 percent bracket $900 for each child.
An Administration official who worked on the Clinton election campaign and who disagrees with the new policies announced tonight said Mr. Clinton's decision to back away from the hard-choices stance he took in his first two years in office resulted from a lesson he learned in the Democratic primaries in 1992. Then, Paul E.. Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary with a campaign grounded in making tough, potentially unpopular budget decisions. Mr. Clinton quickly eclipsed Mr. Tsongas in the later primaries by denouncing the bitter medicine his opponent was advocating and sugar-coating his own campaign.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Lean and Very Mean

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
They were born in a land where work and hope were rights, not dreams, and for the rest of their lives it gave them a spring in their walk. They did not claim the earth, just that part of it they could earn with their muscle and brain.
They believed good steady work, wages moving up, was their part ownership in their own society. They believed that next year would be better than this one, if not always for them, then for sure for their children. Generally they turned out right, so the children believed it too, generation after generation. 
 American optimism -- for two centuries you could touch it, believe in it, as it built a great nation. No other country in history had an inspiration, a system, a concept, a mixture of people, a gift of God, a heritage -- American optimism grew out of all of them -- that worked as well, created so much for so many.
In times when despair did descend, on the nation or parts of it, America discovered the leadership it needed -- a Lincoln, a Franklin D. Roosevelt, a King. What were Dr. King's dreams but the reaching out for a right to believe in American optimism?
Now it is withering. If it expires, the epitaph will be: "Dead of lean and mean."
If you are looking for basic meaning in the last election, it is that Americans are beginning to understand that the unwritten contract between them and their society is being torn up. The understanding was that in bad times everybody would hurt but that if the boss was doing well so would the workers -- better wages to take home, more job security to build on.
Unemployment is low -- well, if you don't want to count young black men. Inflation is under control, foreign trade growing, corporate profits generally up, productivity rising. But nobody sings and dances.
Instead Americans are edgy. They look for targets -- sometimes immigrants, the press, and in the last election the party in power.
They are mad and should be madder. The surprise is that Americans are so passive while the foundations of their working lives and nation-building optimism are destroyed.
They all know what is going on -- that often it takes a husband and wife to earn what the husband once earned, that in a time that should be prosperity thousands of Americans are fired by companies showing nice profits, that if the unemployed do find a job it is at lower wages, and lower dignity, and that their kids will be lucky to get that much.
Politicians and journalists use new terms for millions of American workers and their children -- the losing class, the anxious class. Yesterday's people.
If Americans were not anxious they would be fools. First they lost the right to public security, now that of job or pride. Companies that once built links with employees now build headquarters designed to keep them away; no personal desks, please.
It is no tragedy when either party is thrown out; that is what elections do. The sorrow is that Republicans and Democrats think the solution is to throw the middle and working class a pizza or two -- which is what tax cuts will get them.
Is that what American conservatism and liberalism have come down to -- not steady jobs at better wages but a choice of toppings on the cheese? As a conservative liberal and bleeding-heart conservative I hate to believe it.
Despite the President's tax-cut speech, the real comeback chance is with the Republicans; but so far they are not even approaching it.
I cling precariously to the hope that some Republican of courage -- maybe Jack Kemp, maybe Bill Bennett -- will campaign for the party to call in its chips to convince business executives that firing thousands in good times or shifting full-time workers to temporary help without benefits is not good business sense but a disaster in the oven.
Give private industry the billions wasted so far on government "retraining" programs. But tax the money back if business does not then show job results.
If leanness-meanness goes on too long and American optimism finally dies, workers may one day fill the streets again. There will be no F.D.R. to rescue capitalism. A new counterculture can grow, this one not besotted by drugs and narcissism. American business will find out how very mean life can get.

HEADLINE: Republican Rome Inspires Republicans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell notes (Economic Scene, Dec. 8) that official poverty rates are based on the assumption that an income three times as large as the basic food budget would put people above the poverty line. This criterion is interesting compared with that used by Cato the Censor in the second century B.C. 
 Relying on Cato's estimates, F. R. Cowell, in "Cicero and the Roman Republic," calculated the annual budget of a minimum-wage free laborer and his wife during this period: food, 52 percent; clothing, 8 percent; rent and extras, 40 percent.
Food consisted of whole-wheat porridge, some vegetables, oil, salt, and watered-down wine.
In the cooler climate of the United States, clothing's share would grow and food's decline. It seems reasonable to conclude that Republican Rome's definition of the poverty line as a multiple of food needs is similar to Republican America's.
If the Roman worker's wage fell below the poverty line, he would have to give up his apartment. If his wages went higher, he would be replaced by a slave. To protect themselves, laborers rioted to extract subsidies from the authorities. This state of affairs lasted in Europe until the late 19th century, when modern welfare systems were developed.
Although slavery may now be gone, labor-replacing technology exists, and we may expect Roman-like behavior from the urban poor of the United States if welfare systems are dismantled.
After tiring of putting down disturbances, Republican America could reinstitute the welfare system. Things really don't change much.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans Inducements To Revive Wall Street Area

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed tax breaks and zoning changes yesterday to bolster the sagging real estate market of Wall Street and the rest of lower Manhattan.
The inducements are intended to encourage new housing and offices in the area and stop any further exodus of businesses. Despite the fame of Wall Street and high-profile sites like the World Trade Center, lower Manhattan's vitality has been drained by outdated office buildings and a lack of housing that leaves streets barren after dark. 
Besides the tax and zoning proposals, the plan calls for other quick actions, like new bus service and express taxicab lanes to improve transportation to the area.
The proposal also envisions more long-term, and tentative, steps to spur development, like express commuter trains from Grand Central Terminal and the Long Island Rail Road Terminal in Brooklyn. Those proposals are most likely to hinge on large public investments, and Mr. Giuliani did not identify new capital financing for them.
His aides said the tax breaks would pay for themselves through increased economic activity and the revenue that it would produce.
The plan is potentially the city's largest development proposal in more than 10 years. It is being announced at a time when lower Manhattan is buffeted by high vacancy rates, falling rents and intense efforts by real estate executives and urban planners to find ways to revitalize the entire area south of Chambers Street.
Mr. Giuliani called for sharp five-year reductions in property taxes and the commercial-rent tax, an unusual tax that business leaders have widely criticized. The cuts would apply to businesses that move to the area and companies that renew leases there, provided that they are in buildings constructed before 1975.
Commercial-rent taxes, 6 percent of a building's total rent, are almost always passed on to tenants. They would be eliminated for qualifying tenants for the first three years of the program. The taxes would then be phased in over the next two years.
Real estate taxes would be halved for the first three years and gradually returned to 100 percent over the next two years.
Mr. Giuliani also proposed easing restrictions on the height and bulk of new buildings, to spur construction.
Although lower Manhattan has been the site of some of the largest and most acclaimed real estate ventures in the nation in recent decades -- complexes like the World Trade Center, the World Financial Center, Battery Park City and the South Street Seaport -- experts say its problems are deeply rooted in the age and architecture of narrow and poorly equipped buildings, most built before World War II.
With little housing, the neighborhood becomes an urban ghost town in the evening, after office workers clear its teeming streets. Even the financial lifeblood -- the investment banks and brokerage houses -- have reduced their presence over 20 years, scattering departments elsewhere in Manhattan and computer operations to offices in Brooklyn and New Jersey.
"The plan is to make lower Manhattan precisely what it used to be, a generator of jobs," said Mr. Giuliani, who was applauded repeatedly as he described his proposals yesterday at a meeting at the Vista International Hotel in the World Trade Center. The meeting was held by the Association for a Better New York, a group made up mostly of real estate executives.
Many aspects of the proposal, including the tax and zoning incentives, would require votes by the City Council and State Legislature. John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said he hoped that both bodies would approve the plan by March.
But approval is by no means certain, particularly because the plan would require the city to forgo anticipated tax revenues at a time it faces major budget gaps.
Mr. Giuliani said the zoning and tax incentives, if approved, would be offered beginning next year. The deputy mayor for planning and community relations, Fran Reiter, estimated that the cost to the city in lost revenues from the commercial-rent and real estate taxes would be $234 million for the first three years.
But in a city analysis that assumed that the program would also retain 3,000 jobs that would otherwise move out of the city, the administration contended that the tax breaks would be offset by $346 million in new city revenues that would be mainly raised through personal and corporate income taxes.
Because the proposal is being announced when the state and city are struggling to resolve huge budget gaps, any possibility of lower tax revenues is very likely to prompt at least some political opposition.
"It's difficult for 51 Council members to agree on anything when only perhaps one-fifth of the membership would benefit," a spokeswoman for the Council, Moronke Oshin, said. She added that any hope of obtaining formal approval by March was "pretty optimistic."
The plan received mixed reviews from Borough Presidents Howard Golden of Brooklyn and Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan. "I would not want to see to see lower Manhattan's problems solved at the expense of downtown Brooklyn," Mr. Golden wrote in a letter to the Mayor. Mr. Golden said City Hall should consider offering the same incentives in downtown Brooklyn.
Ms. Messinger, who has often criticized tax abatements, called the proposal a "well thought-out blueprint" to "help stimulate all aspects of the local economy."
The plan, most of which the real estate industry widely anticipated, is being proposed as business people are struggling to find ways to revitalize lower Manhattan. Property owners there have formed the nation's largest Business Improvement District, a private organization to which they have agreed to pay $8.6 million a year to upgrade sidewalks, improve transportation and attract a variety of stores, offices and housing.
Real estate executives say there is no alternative to extensive government intervention to encourage renovation or replacement of many outdated buildings. Many, built from 1900 to 1940, have floors that are considered too small for modern offices, ceilings that are too low for labyrinths of computer wires and a lack of sufficient interior light and ventilation to be converted easily to apartments.
"The Mayor's plan recognizes the economics of obsolescence," said Richard Kennedy, associate director of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate concern, who headed a committee of business people that advised the officials who prepared the plan.
Despite the problems in the neighborhood, Mr. Giuliani said, lower Manhattan remains the third largest business district in the nation, based on its commercial real estate, after midtown Manhattan and downtown Chicago. But because of its weak market and increasing vacancies, the assessed value of lower Manhattan real estate has declined 28 percent, from $5.9 billion to $4.2 billion, since 1991.
Under the plan, developers who renovate old office buildings for offices or apartments would receive exemptions for 10 years from increased property assessments based on the improvements.
To stimulate construction further, the plan calls for creating a special zoning district covering all of lower Manhattan. Any existing zoning prohibitions on residential development would be removed. Developers would also not be required to abide by certain restrictions on building heights and setbacks from the street.
Mr. Giuliani also said about 20 buildings should be designated for landmark status and protected from alteration.
Transportation, long a serious aggravation to commuters, would be improved by creating an express taxicab corridor on an unspecified avenue between lower Manhattan and 34th Street.
The most ambitious transportation improvement would be express commuter trains linking lower Manhattan to Grand Central and the L.I.R.R. Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. Ms. Reiter said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had agreed to study the proposal, and would report to the city by the summer.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans Inducements To Revive Wall Street Area

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed tax breaks and zoning changes yesterday to bolster the sagging real estate market of Wall Street and the rest of lower Manhattan.
The inducements are intended to encourage new housing and offices in the area and stop any further exodus of businesses. Despite the fame of Wall Street and high-profile sites like the World Trade Center, lower Manhattan's vitality has been drained by outdated office buildings and a lack of housing that leaves streets barren after dark. 
 Besides the tax and zoning proposals, the plan calls for other quick actions, like new bus service and express taxicab lanes to improve transportation to the area.
The proposal also envisions more long-term, and tentative, steps to spur development, like express commuter trains from Grand Central Terminal and the Long Island Rail Road Terminal in Brooklyn. Those proposals are most likely to hinge on large public investments, and Mr. Giuliani did not identify new capital financing for them.
His aides said the tax breaks would pay for themselves through increased economic activity and the revenue that it would produce.
The plan is potentially the city's largest development proposal in more than 10 years. It is being announced at a time when lower Manhattan is buffeted by high vacancy rates, falling rents and intense efforts by real estate executives and urban planners to find ways to revitalize the entire area south of Chambers Street.

Real estate taxes would be halved for the first three years and gradually returned to 100 percent over the next two years.

HEADLINE: Fake Bank Set Up by U.S. Agents Snares Drug-Money Launderers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Federal authorities said today that a fake bank they created in the Caribbean had crippled major money-laundering schemes used by the Cali drug cartel of Colombia and organized crime groups in Italy.
As the first financial institution ever created and operated by Federal agencies in a criminal investigation, the bank produced what the American and Italian authorities said was the strongest evidence yet of direct financial links between the cartel and Italian groups that distributed their drugs. The ploy allowed the authorities to seize almost $40 million in cash as well as paintings by Picasso and Rubens. 
 So far, more than 90 people have been arrested, including three New York residents who were picked up Thursday night in Montreal. They were identified as Benjamin Marcovitch, 60, an American citizen born in Ukraine; his wife Betty Rios-Marcovitch, 36, a Colombian-born American, and Gregory Kaminer, 46, a Canadian born in Ukraine.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said in New York that the New York suspects tried to hide at least $3 million for the cartel, using commercial banks in upstate New York, New Jersey and a New York City company, Privat Capital Inc., run by the Marcovitches.
The two-year investigation was begun by the Drug Enforcement Administration and ultimately involved the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and law-enforcement agencies in four states and four other countries. The bank operated for six months as the final stage of the investigation and was closed down this month, to avert suspicion.
Appearing at a news conference at the drug agency's headquarters in Arlington, Va., to announce the success of the operation, Thomas A. Constantine, the administrator of the agency, said that the suspects arrested included 60 Americans and Pasquale Locatelli, an Italian who was described as the head of a major criminal organization operating across Europe and Canada. Mr. Locatelli, who escaped from a French jail by helicopter in a wild shoot-out five years ago, was captured three months ago in Spain.
More arrests are expected, Mr. Constantine said.
For the last several years, law-enforcement agencies have been piecing together the relationship between the cartel and organized crime in Italy. Officials involved in the latest investigation, called Operation Dinero, said they had documented the cartel's transactions with two Italian crime groups after they created a private bank licensed on Anguilla, a British territory in the Caribbean, in an effort to attract drug traffickers to convert their assets.
The bank, which was actually run out of the drug agency's Atlanta office, enabled the authorities in the United States, France, Italy, Canada and Spain to identify not only traffickers in Colombia but people they used around the world to broker their deals, collect their money and deliver their products.
In addition to the arrests, Mr. Constantine said the authorities had seized nine tons of cocaine and $52 million in assets that included $39 million in cash and three valuable paintings that a Colombian trafficker wanted sold, with instructions to bank "officials" that they they fetch at least $10 million for them.
The paintings, which were confiscated Wednesday night at Miami International Airport after a courier brought them from Colombia, included a 1904 watercolor by Pablo Picasso from his blue period, called "Head of the Beggar"; a painting of St. Paul by the 17th century Flemish master, Peter Paul Rubens; and a work of an unknown subject by the 18th century English portrait artist Sir Joshua Reynolds. One drug agent said an informer had told the authorities that at least one of the paintings had been stolen in France, but the agent said the authorities had not yet determined if that was true.
"We are most proud of the fact we could probe the underground economy of drug traffickers," said William Malarney, a drug agent who worked on the operation. "We were able to get into their board rooms and see what was happening with their financial transactions. They have spent years establishing corporations and boilerplates to protect their wealth from its true source, narcotics trafficking."
The idea to create a bank to attract profits from drug dealers came from a casual conversation with an informer several years ago, Mr. Malarney said. By that time, American undercover agents had begun infiltrating drug trafficking networks by providing money pickup services for the dealers.
But the informer told the agents that what the Colombians really needed was the convenience and respectability of a bank to handle their profits, or to exchange dollars for, say, pesos.
With help from the British Government, American agents picked Anguilla as the fake bank headquarters because of the island's laws protecting the identity of customers. "Headquarters" was an electronic address for moving money rather than a actual building, but officials said they were careful to use stationery and business cards of sizes more commonly found in Europe and made certain that any "bank official" who spoke to a money launderer used perfect French or Spanish.
"After all," Mr. Malarney said with a laugh, "we were bankers."
Once the bank was in place, officials said, undercover drug agents began promoting its services to criminal contacts in Colombia and elsewhere. Then through transactions involving loans, cashiers' checks, wire transfers and currency exchange, officials said they were able to trace the money from Colombia and then to sources the brokers were using around in the United States, Europe and South America.
Mr. Malarney and William Bruton, an agent of the Internal Revenue Service who worked on the case, said that several times, drug dealers discussed airplanes, freighters and other major purchases with people they believed to be officers of the bank.
In one instance, Mr. Constantine said, "they indicated they had $500 million they wished us to launder."
By the time the operation ended, Mr. Constantine said, the bank had created 41 corporate accounts for drug traffickers and handled 92 cash transactions totaling $8.9 million and 291 noncash transactions. Federal agents also handled another $39.5 million before the bank was functioning.
While no one in Colombia was arrested in the operation, officials said that Italy was a huge beneficiary because of the arrests of Mr. Locatelli, who had been serving a 20-year term on drug charges before his escape, and Roberto Severa, who was described as a member of the Rome crime organization called Banda Della Malgliana.
Officials said the Locatelli organization used a fleet of nine ships, including an 85-foot yacht, to smuggle drugs from Colombia and that one was recently intercepted by NATO forces, investigating whether the crew was smuggling arms into Bosnia, in violation of a United Nations embargo. After seizing the ship, the Italian military authorities found two containers on the ship filled with small weapons and ammunition.
"Locatelli is at the top of something that is not from traditional organized crime," Gianni De Gennaro, deputy chief of the Italian national police, said at the news conference. "He is a new figure. I don't know if this means traditional organized crime is weaker or we have to study this case to understand what is a new story of organized crime in Italy."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT INSISTS HIS TAX CUTS KEEP DEFICIT IN CHECK

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The White House set out today to sell President Clinton's proposed tax breaks in the face of far grander Republican promises, saying the political test was whether such proposals could be paid for without worsening the deficit -- and insisting that its cuts could be.
But senior officials withheld virtually all specifics about what Government programs they would cut in five agencies to help finance the $60 billion package over five years. And they acknowledged that the President's proposed tax credits for children and new deductions for education would have to be phased in, starting at perhaps half their eventual value, before savings would be available to finance them in full. 
 "We're talking about having a responsible program, a paid-for program, and not one penny of increase in that deficit," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "We've come too far in this budget-deficit cutting to let the next Congress turn back and start cooking the books. The President wants to make things fair without cooking those books, and that's the way to do it."
The reaction of the Congressional Republicans who will control the fate of any tax plan ranged from tepid praise for the President's ideas to brisk vows to press on further and faster, though they have generally offered even fewer specifics of how they would finance their ideas.
The Administration is committed to producing $76 billion in savings to pay for its plan and to allow further deficit reduction by the turn of the century, when the deficit would otherwise begin rising again. It has identified about $24 billion from reorganizing agencies, about half of it from changes in the Department of Energy, and is reviewing still deeper cuts.
But the bulk of the money, $52 billion, would come from extending through the year 2000 caps on discretionary spending that had been set to expire in 1998 -- meaning that the money would not materialize until 1999.
As a result, senior officials said, Mr. Clinton's proposed tax credit of up to $500 per child for families with adjusted gross incomes up to $75,000 might initially be worth just $250 per child in 1996. Similarly, his plan for deductions for college or technical training of up to $10,000 a year for families earning no more than $120,000 would probably be phased in at $5,000.
"We are going to phase in our tax relief to match our spending cuts, so that in fact we don't have up-front tax relief by down-the-road spending cuts," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told a breakfast briefing for reporters.
Ms. Tyson, Mr. Bentsen, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and other officials today repeatedly emphasized the tonic of tax cuts and training efforts, deferring discussion of medicinal spending cuts until Monday, when Vice President Al Gore is to outline many of them in the context of his efforts, already under way, to "re-invent government."
Mr. Panetta did say that the President would offer more details on the effects of continuing the freeze on discretionary spending -- that is, for all programs except those like Medicare, Social Security and others in which spending automatically increases to cover eligible recipients -- in his full budget message early next year.
"We will specify, as we have always had to specify when it comes to that kind of hard freeze, exactly how those savings will be achieved in the budget that we present to the Congress," he said. "We've had to do that the last two years. We will do that with regards to specifics here for '99 and 2000 as well."
Administration officials said an aggressive search was under way for more money in corners of the bureaucracy, an exercise that could eventually produce $22 billion over five years in the Energy Department alone, for example.
About half of that could come from selling government-owned power authorities, administrative entities like the Bonneville Power Administration, to the private sector. They already charge customers for electricity, and thus operate at relatively low cost, so selling them would bring a big one-time infusion of cash, rather than continuing savings.
Officials said other proposed cuts included $4 billion from delaying cleanup of pollution at some nuclear production sites. Other options for savings include cuts in research programs; turning over management of the Naval Petroleum Reserve, where oil bought by the Government is stored underground for use in emergencies, to the private sector, and closing one of the national laboratories that conducts high-technology research, though the site has not been chosen.
The officials said such savings could be used for even deeper deficit cutting, or to let the tax breaks take full effect immediately.
"This is not a budget document, and we shouldn't yet be held to that level of detail," a senior Presidential aide said.
In fact, the President was pressed into specifics about the tax breaks in part to win live television time for a Thursday night speech that aides initially said Mr. Clinton envisioned as a philosophical statement of direction for the next two years, in the wake of last month's elections. In the end, Mr. Clinton's 10-minute talk, which he dictated into a tape recorder and then reworked, was part wish-list for the future and part revival of winning themes from his past.
The President was cheered enough by the address that he, his wife, Hillary, and Mr. Panetta gathered the staff on the South Lawn for a brief meeting today, to thank the troops, bid them happy holidays and rally them on.
Top aides went out of their way to portray Mr. Clinton's tax proposals as consistent with longstanding priorities, like education, and his 1992 campaign promise of middle-class tax relief, which he dropped in favor of deeper deficit reduction, the success of which they said had now made tax breaks possible. But the language they chose implied a new tack.
"He is getting back to the core principles and dreams on which he ran," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
The President would consolidate 60 existing Federal job training programs into a system of "skill grants," in which qualified individuals could get vouchers of $2,000 to $3,000 for use in private job training programs.
In addition, Mr. Reich noted, Mr. Clinton's proposed tax deduction for education would apply not only to parents sending their children to college but also for anyone who sought more schooling later in life.
At a White House briefing, Secretary Bentsen pointed to charts showing the growing share to median family income consumed by the annual cost of college, now 15 percent for families with children in public colleges, up from 11 percent in 1980, and 40 percent for those with children in private colleges, up from 26 percent.
Mr. Reich, Ms. Tyson and Mr. Bentsen said the President had not ruled out a cut in capital gains taxes, one of the Republicans' chief ideas. But they said he would not support one that benefited only upper-income taxpayers, and declined to discuss how such a reduction might be made more broadly applicable.
The Treasury Department also released charts to buttress the Administration's assertion that it was the true friend of the middle class, by showing that just 13 percent of the President's proposed tax breaks would go to families with incomes over $100,000, compared with 54 percent of the proposals in the House Republicans' "Contract With America."

HEADLINE: Russian General Halts His Tanks As Qualms Over Rebellion Grow

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In an extraordinary sign of the Russian military's unhappiness with its mission in the rebellious republic of Chechnya, the commander of a tank division halted his advance about 20 miles from the rebel capital today and promised local villagers that he would not go any further.
The officer, Maj. Gen. Ivan Babichev, told weeping Chechen women: "It is forbidden to use the army against peaceful civilians. It is forbidden to shoot at the people." 
 There were other signs today in Moscow and Grozny, the Chechen capital, that both sides are under heavy pressure to find a peaceful way out of the conflict.
In what he described as a good-will gesture, the leader of the secessionist Chechen republic, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, said he had ordered his troops to withdraw one kilometer from the front line, or about half a mile, and to stop firing at Russian troops.
And the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said he would lead negotiators to resolve the conflict, promising to meet Mr. Dudayev "anywhere, anytime."
Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai N. Yegorov, President Boris N. Yeltsin's representative at the military command post in Mozdok, in North Ossetia, was recalled to Moscow tonight to attend an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to examine the crisis.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision on Sunday to send hundreds of tanks and tens of thousands of troops to bring Chechyna to heel was not a popular one, particularly in the Defense Ministry. Two leading military figures, Gen. Boris V. Gromov and Lieut. Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, have spoken out against the invasion.
Dissension among officers involved in ground operations spilled out in public today. In a remarkable display of compassion -- and possible insubordination -- General Babichev hugged weeping Chechen women in the village of Novo-Shurvoi, about 20 miles from Grozny, and assured them that he would not advance on the capital or fire upon their sons.
General Babichev had stopped his column's advance in the area after unarmed civilians blocked his tanks. Today, as a Reuters TV crew filmed the scene, the officer said he did not think he was disobeying orders. "Why should I be fired?" he asked. "Article 5 of the President's decree says that we shouldn't shoot at civilians or send our tanks against civilians."
Next to him a colonel was equally moved by the appeals of pleading villagers, who said, "Please don't kill our sons."
The colonel replied: "It is not our fault we are here. We are not going to attack people with our tanks. Let us solve this together."
In Moscow, Defense Ministry spokesmen said they were aware of the officers' comments, but declined to make any of their own.
The Kremlin, unhappy about the unflattering press coverage of the Chechen conflict, complained about "unreliable" news reports by Russian and Western journalists and threatened to withdraw the license of the independent television news channel NTV, whose broadcasts from Chechnya have angered high-ranking Yeltsin officials. In the last few days, Interior Ministry troops have fired warning shots at reporters and camera crews seeking to enter Chechnya.
Even after Mr. Yeltsin decided to postpone a final assault on Grozny on Dec. 15, the date he had set as the deadline for Chechen forces to lay down their arms, criticism of the President did not abate.
In the upper house of Parliament, a member of the Russia's Choice party returned from a visit to Grozny today and chastised the Kremlin for bombing apartment buildings in the capital, causing what he angrily described as "mass killings of civilians."
Mr. Yeltsin received a small boost from Vice President Al Gore, who is in Moscow to discuss economic issues, and who repeated that Washington looked upon Chechnya as an "internal Russian affair."
"We hope it can be resolved through negotiations, as all involved in it do," Mr. Gore added.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who was also in Moscow today, said Russian military officials had told him that they want to solve the crisis in Chechnya with as little bloodshed as possible.
"That's what they are trying to do," Mr. Perry told reporters on his aircraft. "But in terms of how they are going to do that, and what tactics and approaches they use, that I don't feel free to discuss."
Some American officials, however, expressed some serious concerns over the Russian position in Chechnya. "It is disturbing, because there seems no real consensus on what you do to get out and declare success," one official said. He said the idea of storming Grozny was hardly attractive, since military firepower is not much use in a crowded city.
To the visitors from Washington, Chechnya seemed part of a preoccupation in the Kremlin about the erosion of central Government authority in a country where taxes are not paid, organized crime is rampant and Mr. Yeltsin's decrees are often ignored. "They're looking for ways to regain that kind of authority," the official said.
There is little love for Chechnya among most Russians, many of whom view Chechens as mobsters and petty criminals. But the invasion and the Chechen resistance have for the moment recast Chechens as the underdog fighting for independence against Russian neo-imperialism.
To combat that trend, Mr. Yeltsin's office issued a statement today labeling the rebel territory a "powerful crime-breeding zone" and "one of the most sinister centers not only of Russian but also of world crime."
Mr. Yeltsin, who has been out of sight since the invasion began recovering from minor surgery on his nose, met with Mr. Gore in his hospital suite today. He was also intercepted by a reporter from the weekly newspaper Argumenti I Fakti while walking from a treatment room to his hospital room.
"A big war won't start," Mr. Yeltsin told the reporter. "The conflict is not extending beyond Chechnya so far."
But even a presidential adviser, Emil Pain, warned that the widening breach between Mr. Yeltsin and his former allies imperiled Russian democracy.
"There are two Chechen conflicts in Russia," he told reporters this week. "One in the North Caucasus, the other in Moscow. The one is Moscow is even more dangerous."

HEADLINE: Gore Upbeat After Talks With Top Russian Leaders

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16

 BODY:
After 10 days of fevered speculation about the state of relations between the United States and a more nationalist Russia, American officials said today that "a lot of air has been cleared" and that "the relationship is in pretty good shape."
Vice President Al Gore, after three days of talks with the Russian Prime Minister and a morning meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, was upbeat. 
 "My impression is there is no 'cold peace,' but instead a warm relationship that's very much on track," he said.
Mr. Gore was referring to a harsh speech in Budapest by Mr. Yeltsin, who warned the United States in the presence of President Clinton not to try to manage the "destinies of the world community," and said, "Europe is in danger of plunging into a cold peace."
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was also positive in public remarks today. "Despite some inevitable frictions, our partnership is an active one," he said. "This is a partnership needed by both countries in equal measure."
Mr. Chernomyrdin praised the work of the Joint Commission on Economic and Technical Cooperation, which he and Mr. Gore direct. The panel has focused the work of the two Governments on issues from defense conversion to environmental protection and now public health.
Asked about vows by Republicans in Congress to cut foreign aid, Mr. Chernomyrdin expressed confidence that the Clinton Administration "will deal with your Congress, and we will deal with ours."
Significant hard feelings remain on the American side, the officials acknowledged. Mr. Yeltsin embarrassed and angered President Clinton by blindsiding him in public, the officials said, only days after Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev stunned American officials by suddenly refusing to join in NATO's "Partnership for Peace," an affiliation intended to lead eventually to full NATO membership.
The Russians then vetoed a minor intensification of sanctions against their Serbian allies in the former Yugoslavia that was proposed in the United Nations Security Council, and blocked statements at the Budapest meeting assigning any guilt to the Serbs in the Bosnian war.
In a busy exchange of communications, senior American officials said, "it was made clear to Mr. Yeltsin that you don't embarrass your friends in public." But it also became clear, they said, that the Russians had misunderstood American intentions about the pace of NATO expansion.
"The Russian reaction was in part for domestic political consumption," a senior official said. "But they also made an assumption, which was wrong, that there had been some sudden decision to accelerate NATO expansion, which they understood as a threat to isolate them from Europe."
Russian officials expressed the concern that any such decision would imply that the Americans had given up on Russian democracy, the American official continued, "and writ large and personal, it meant that Bill Clinton had given up on Boris Yeltsin."
Separate Russian conversations with European officials within NATO apparently fed the Russian concern, American officials said.
The result was the Yeltsin-Kozyrev shower of cold water and deep American annoyance and embarrassment, the officials said. "But it was also a shot across the bow," one official said, addressed to a number of audiences: the Clinton Administration, the new Republican Congress, the East Europeans and domestic Russian nationalists.
"And the message was heard," the official said. The Russian message, he said, was clear: "We're in Europe whether you like it or not."
The Russian broadside may also help clarify an internal Clinton Administration problem: officials have been trying to give two different messages about NATO expansion.
They imply that it is inevitable and will be relatively quick, to pacify Eastern European countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic while encouraging Ukraine and making a nod toward Congressional Republicans. That was why the North Atlantic Council, in a statement, spoke of a study in 1995 of the process of "gradual" NATO enlargement -- apparently the beginning of Moscow's misunderstanding.
At the same time, the Americans are trying to reassure the Russians that NATO's expansion will be a "gradual and open process," with no hidden messages and no desire to isolate Moscow.
" 'Gradual' carries some ambiguity," a senior American official said. "Ambiguity can be your friend, but it can also be your enemy."
It is in the contradiction between those two messages, American officials admit, that the Russian misunderstanding could arise, providing Moscow an opportunity to raise its voice and profile. They said Mr. Gore had spent a good part of his time with Mr. Yeltsin explaining that NATO had not supported rapid expansion, but only decided to study it. "The Russians don't always believe what we tell them, of course," one official said.
The contradiction is somewhat absurd, the officials say, since it will take at least four or five years for the first East European countries to qualify for NATO membership, and current European members have no desire to expand their defense pact to the Russian border or beyond.
Mr. Gore was the first foreign official to see Mr. Yeltsin, who has been in the hospital for minor surgery, and he said the Russian President appeared healthy and fit, "hale and hearty and in good spirits." He said the signs of Mr. Yeltsin's operation, on a deviated nasal septum, were almost gone.

HEADLINE: A Plan That Tries to Please

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The blueprint for tax cuts that President Clinton unveiled on Thursday night was not only an appeal to disgruntled middle-class voters. It was also directed at the nation's nervous financial markets, which may ultimately hold the veto power over the best-laid budget plans of either Democrats or Republicans.
While it may have been fear of more middle-class wrath that forced Mr. Clinton to move at all, more than two years after his campaign promise to cut taxes for ordinary working Americans, fear of the markets also kept the proposal limited in scope. Although $60 billion over five years is a lot of money, it is still a drop in the stream of an economy rushing along at $6 trillion annually. 
 Anything much bigger, economists said today, would create doubts that either party could pay for the tax cuts they are championing with equivalent spending reductions. And even the first hint that the Administration might be weakening in its commitment to pay for any tax reduction would almost certainly lead investors to drive up already-rising interest rates, undercutting the same home buyers and university students that Mr. Clinton says he is dedicated to helping.
This counterbalancing is just the most recent illustration of how little room the President, or his opponents, have to maneuver, at least if they stick to the commitment not to make new cuts in the biggest entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
And the markets are imposing a vague sort of discipline on the notoriously flexible budget process.
"The bond market will sniff out any flimflam in the cuts," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "And if that pressure is felt by both political parties, the result could be that Washington really will be forced to drastically cut the least productive segment of the economy -- the Government itself."
The Administration's constraints were acknowledged by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in remarks today and in an interview in his office earlier this week. Mr. Bentsen, a deficit hawk whose resignation takes effect next week, said there would be "not one penny of increase" in the budget deficit as a result of the tax cuts.
"I made that mistake in 1981," he said, speaking of the time in the Senate when he voted for President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, which began the huge increase in the Federal deficit, "and I don't need to learn that lesson twice."
But as he was packing up to return to Texas, Mr. Bentsen expressed concern that the result of the President's initiative, on this and a range of other issues, would be to force the Republicans to make even more dramatic gestures. "Whatever the President comes up with," he said, "the Republicans will move to the right."
"I'm not very optimistic about bipartisan cooperation," he said, particularly on issues like the overhauling of the nation's welfare system.
It is just that scenario that could spook the bond markets, which are hypersensitive to any suggestion that the Federal deficit will worsen, after several years of successful reductions. In fact, the markets are looking for Mr. Clinton to accelerate budget cutting, because under the current plan, the deficit reduction peters out starting in 1996, as entitlement benefits continue to rise.
This morning, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said she had little fear that a bidding war between Congress and the White House would spin out of control, and send the deficit soaring again.
"It is not the case that we in Washington can freely act to do things which are fiscally irresponsible, because the result of that will be not just in domestic financial markets, but in global financial markets," she said.
"Two constraints will provide discipline -- the discipline of the voter, and the discipline of the market."
That is not to say that analysts and investors are driving every detail. If economists, for instance, had their choice, Mr. Clinton's tax cut would take a very different turn. With the economy growing at such a fast clip, few want to spur demand, which is exactly what Mr. Clinton's proposal would do if it freed up more family income now devoted to college tuition or child care. Instead, many economists would prefer to increase savings and production capacity, and perhaps cut capital gains taxes, in hopes such a cut would increase manufacturing capacity.
But economists do not run for re-election. And Mr. Clinton's aides feel considerable pressure, after a month of intense focus on bolstering free trade in Asia and Latin America, to show that they can prepare American workers for the heightened competitive pressure they will face because of more open markets around the world.
"There is still a lot of feeling in the middle of the country that free trade is a death warrant for many blue-collar workers," one of Mr. Clinton's close advisers said last weekend during the summit of Latin American nations in Miami. "Over the next year, we have to show the other side of the coin -- the retraining, the stress on college educations."
Mr. Clinton's plan comes out of that mold. Rather than just reduce tax rates or grant blanket tax credits, as some other Democrats and a raft of Republicans have proposed, this tax cut is carved from the favorite hobby horses of this Administration. There is a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for retraining or university tuition, a tax credit of up to $500 for each child under the age of 13 in families earning no more than $75,000, and a loosening of the rules on I.R.A.'s to allow deductions for catastrophic illness or buying a first home. "Clearly, we are investing in human capital," Ms. Tyson said.
But no matter how well it is clothed, a tax cut is a tax cut, and taxpayers will spend the money as they see fit. That is the central contradiction: Economic theory dictates that tax cuts are for times of economic downturn, and enacting one now spends a bullet that might otherwise be saved for the next recession.
And then, of course, there is the deficit. Mr. Clinton's own cabinet members have said time and again over the past few weeks that if they were not paying interest on the Federal deficit, the Government's budget would be in surplus this year. Rather than cut taxes, Mr. Clinton could simply declare that he would use the savings from shrinking Government to shrink Government debt -- figuring that $60 billion would do more good there than spread over millions of taxpayers, most of whom would see only a few extra dollars a week in their pockets. Some voters, Mr. Clinton's aides suggested before the election, would rather see more aggressive deficit reduction than what one termed "a fairly meaningless tax cut."
But that was October. No one in the White House was talking about that option today.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 41.72 in Heaviest Trading Since '87

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders ignored another signal of a possibly overheating economy and bid up stock prices higher yesterday during the biggest trading day since the 1987 stock market crash.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.72 points, to 3,807.19, as trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange hit 483.2 million shares. That was the third-heaviest volume after the record 608 million shares set on Oct. 20, 1987, just after the stock market plunge of Oct. 19, when 604 million shares were traded. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.45 points, to 458.80. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.61 points, to 729.07.
Traders reacted only mildly to a report that the housing industry continued to demonstrate unexpected strength, which in other sessions would have been interpreted as bad for stocks. Housing starts rose 6.9 percent in November, the biggest increase since March. [Page 48.]
And a dividend increase and big stock buyback plan by General Electric gave skittish investors a reason to invest in stocks, traders said.
Blue-chip stocks have recovered more than two-thirds of the ground they have lost since mid-November. The Dow has now advanced for five of the last six sessions, regaining some 121 points after a 171-point selloff over five sessions starting Nov. 17.
Under the peculiar logic of the financial markets this year, good news about the economy has often led to bad news for stock and bond prices because traders worry that the economy will threaten to become inflationary months from now and thus prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a pre-emptive move.
But the housing news came on a day when traders were scrambling to cope with the so-called triple witching expiration yesterday. Trading volume shoots up on triple witching days because traders must decide whether to "use it or lose it" for a wide variety of stock options, index futures, and options on futures.
Harrison Roth, senior options strategist for Cowen & Company, noted that most of the options activity was concentrated in large stocks like AT&T, Exxon and Coca-Cola. That may account for the weakness in the Nasdaq index, he said. The Russell 2,000 index of stocks, representing the bottom 2,000 companies of the largest 3,000 United States stocks, fell 0.20 point, to 241, Mr. Roth said.
But both the bond and international currency markets, which did not have the distorting effect of triple witching stock trading, also seemed to react mildly to the housing news. The dollar closed mixed against major currencies and bonds were basically unchanged. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.85 percent from 7.87 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, government trading strategist of CS First Boston, said bond prices fell after the housing report but recovered quickly because the fine print was more encouraging. Permits for future construction fell 1 percent, he said.
More important, Mr. Alexy said, 75 percent of the housing starts were for apartments, rather than single-family homes. Homes, with their large initial outlay for mortgages, furniture and other expenses, are a better barometer of consumer spending than rental apartments, he said.
Moreover, the market climate has changed, he said. The sentiment among bond traders has shifted toward a later increase in interest rates by the Fed, perhaps a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point as late as February.
"Early in the week, maybe 50 percent of traders were betting on some early tightening by the Fed," Mr. Alexy said. "Now 80 percent, 90 percent of traders are betting the Fed won't tighten now, but wait until January and probably February."
Trading of General Electric stock, at 7.9 million shares, was the heaviest of the year for G.E. and the third-heaviest of any stock for the day. G.E. rose 1 1/4, to 50 1/4.
Almost 40 percent of G.E.'s volume came from a single trade of 3,004,700 shares at the beginning of the session. The identity of the trader was not immediately known. G.E. yesterday raised its dividend 14 percent and authorized the repurchase of as much as $5 billion of G.E. stock over the next two years.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.58 points, to 250.54, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,364 to 938. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.21, to 426.23.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 25 stocks rose, led by Alcoa, which gained 1 7/8, to 83 1/2. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 316 rose, led by G.E and Exxon, which rose 1 1/8, to 61 3/4.
The most active stock, at 10.7 million shares, was Intel, which rose 7/8, to 59 1/2.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Makes His Last Speech as an Official, in a Hurry

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo began what he said would be his last speech as a public official by excusing himself for talking so fast. There was so much, he said, that he wanted to say.
 In a 35-minute goodbye at the National Press Club, Mr. Cuomo said he did not expect to become a Supreme Court justice and does not intend to become commissioner of baseball. ("If you did want to give a political opinion from time to time, you couldn't do it.") 
 He also said he did not want to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, adding that there are already a number of capable people in line for that job.
 Instead, he is negotiating with universities, where he wants to lecture on an occasional basis rather than teach full-time. He is entertaining offers from the kind of white-shoe law firms that once rejected the Queens-born son of a grocer who for years lived behind his father's store. And he has hired James M. Griffin of the William Morris Agency to help sort through a stack of book, television, radio and lecture offers.
 Of yesterday's speech, Mr. Cuomo said it was so short that it left out "a lot of the good stuff." In it, he was wholly unapologetic and combative as ever, calling Republican proposals to simultaneously cut taxes, boost military spending and balance the budget "deja voodoo." After his formal remarks, he repeated the contention that Governor-elect George E. Pataki won by counting on anti-incumbent backlash without taking on the issues.
 "I said his tax cut was so large he'd never do it, and he never will," the Governor said. "And that was the end of it. They waited until the end and brought it back. But he didn't argue with me about criminal justice. There were no issues. He just thought, 'He will be defeated because he's been there so long.' And I was."
 Lightheartedly, but often enough to suggest he wasn't entirely kidding, he suggested that he'd been fighting a funk since losing his bid for a fourth term last month. "The temptation, you know, is to whine, you know, at least a little bit," he said. "Why not? You served 12 years, you're entitled.
 "And I caught myself doing that. I began pointing out to people that ever since the Republican landslide on Nov. 8th, it's been getting dark outside a little earlier every day. You notice that?"
 Aides say Governor Cuomo has not taken the loss particularly well, spending some days obsessing about the election and others looking forward to the future. Indeed, it should come as little surprise that the complicated brooder who has so frequently been compared to Hamlet would not easily shrug off such a loss. But friends say that Mr. Cuomo is resilient.
 "I'm disappointed," the Governor said, when asked about his frame of mind following his defeat. "I'm sorry." He said he wanted a fourth term "more than I wanted the first three because I think this is a more important moment."
 "So I regret it," he said, "but it certainly in no way diminishes my gratitude to the people of the state."
 And he is by no means the "unemployed, homeless" unfortunate he jokingly called himself in his speech. He recently bought a three-bedroom Sutton Place co-op with a terrace, a river view and 24-carat gold on the bathroom fixtures.
 Much of yesterday's speech was vintage Cuomo: he blasted Republicans for pitting the middle class against the even less fortunate, saying: "In the end, behind nearly every one of the Republican proposals lurks the same harshness and negativity. And I think we need better from our leaders than to have them distill our worst instincts and then bottle the bitter juices and offer them back to us as a magic elixir."
 He also exhorted his own party to stick to its principles. "We'd rather preserve a family than build an orphanage," he said. "We believe that we're too good as a people to seek solutions by hurting the weakest among us -- especially our children. And at our wisest, we believe that we are all in this together."
 Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn said the Democratic Party hopes, perhaps, to tap Mr. Cuomoas the kind of spokesman who could "counter the Limbaughs."
 And, of course, he will continue to give speeches, saying that he has lost, learned, forgotten nothing and is eager to share his experiences. He continues to wrestle with the existential questions that follow him around, saying that his parents, a priest, and a lot of good books had taught him to expect a lot of disappointment and occasional moments of joy.
 "In the end, you've got to find some raison d'etre,"he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds Gain While Notes Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds posted their first gain in three days and notes fell yesterday as the market looked ahead to a Federal Reserve meeting and a new supply of notes next week.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32 of a percentage point, to 95. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.85 percent, from 7.87 percent on Thursday. The price of the two-year note, meanwhile, fell for the first time in four days, pushing its yield up to 7.56 percent from 7.51 percent. 
 The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond was 29 basis points, 7 basis points narrower than Thursday and down from 47 basis points two weeks ago. A narrowing spread suggests increasing investor expectations the Federal Reserve will soon raise rates. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
But many traders expect the Fed will put off an increase in short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and will wait until its next scheduled meeting, a two-day session beginning on Jan. 31, to act. The Fed has raised short-term rates six times since February in an effort to prevent inflation from accelerating. Reports on producer and consumer prices this week indicated that the pickup in inflation the Fed had warned about has yet to appear.
"The Fed has won," said Jane Wyatt, chief investment officer at Voyageur Asset Management in Minneapolis, which has $6.2 billion in bonds. "We have a moderate economy and moderate to low inflation."
A report showing a strong rise in November housing starts failed to shake the market's expectations for the Fed. The Commerce Department reported that builders increased new construction on homes by 6.9 percent last month, in the sharpest advance since March.
The report at first prompted some selling, but prices recovered as traders attributed the increase in housing starts in part to last month's mild weather. The market also focused on a decline in permits for future construction, suggesting that housing was due for a slowdown in coming months.
If the Fed does surprise traders and investors by raising rates next week, Treasury notes and bills with maturities of five years or less are more vulnerable than the long end of the market. Another rate increase "will hurt the short end, but it won't hurt the bond because it will slow the economy," said Terrence Crowe, a trader at Nikko Securities.
The prospect of a supply of new notes from Treasury auctions next week pushed the prices of three- and five-year notes lower yesterday, traders said. The Treasury plans to auction $17.25 billion of two-year notes Wednesday and $11 billion of five-year notes Thursday.
Municipal bonds were little changed yesterday amid concern that selling by bond funds may increase following a resumption in investor redemptions, traders said.
Investors resumed withdrawing funds from mutual funds this week after Orange County, Calif., filed for bankruptcy and as the yields on individual bonds became more attractive.
"Funds are net sellers," said Mike Bauer, a trader at Starr Securities. Some investors are "afraid they will get year-end redemptions" and are selling bonds to raise cash.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues edged up to 6.99 percent, from 6.98 percent on Thursday.
