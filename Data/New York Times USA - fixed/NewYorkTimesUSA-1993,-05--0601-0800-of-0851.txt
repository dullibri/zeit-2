HEADLINE: State Sells Its License Plates With a New Gusto

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
LOUIS S. GOLDBERG leaned forward on his chair with the zeal of the salesman moving in for the kill.
"Is this a success?" he said, with the implication that anyone who asks such a question must be kidding, or deranged. "The calls are coming in, 250 a day. We've sold 15,000 of them so far. Now we're coming out with the new series. Rotary is signed up for that and if Rotary wants them, Kiwanis will want them. I'm working on that now." 
 Mr. Goldberg is not a salesman, or a businessman, in the conventional sense. He is the Commissioner of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles and he is talking about special license plates.
At a time when Connecticut is almost punch-drunk from repeated blows to its economy, with businesses and industries downsizing, closing or deserting, one of the few bright spots is being provided by the state government itself.
The "Preserve the Sound" license plates -- artistic creations in shades of blue, white, black and green, with a lighthouse in the background on the left and marsh grass on the right -- have been marketed since November in an effort to raise money for education, restoration and research projects to benefit Long Island Sound, Connecticut's most visible but imperiled major asset.
Without question, the goal of $2 million in sales will be realized, said Mr. Goldberg, an ebullient man who seems to love talking up the special plates. The only question is how long it will take to raise all the money.
The special plates can substitute for the traditional white on blue license plates for motorists willing to pay a one-time price of $50, or $70 for custom-made plates of special numbers or letters. From each sale, $15 goes to the cost of producing the plates and the remainder goes to the Long Island Sound Fund, administered by the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Mr. Goldberg estimates that about 42,000 plates must be sold to realize $2 million profit. By the end of April, sales had surpassed 15,000 plates, he said, and he now anticipates a big burst of enthusiasm with the onset of warm weather.
"This is when people get out more and they see the Sound plates and want them," he maintained. He is also hedging his bet on the success of the project by opening up the sale of the plates to campers and combination vehicles this summer.
About $500,000 has already been realized from the sale of the plates and the first allotment, $170,000, will go for public access, beach grass plantings, observation platforms and descriptive signs along the coast and for a boardwalk and fishing pier on the Lieutenant River at Old Lyme near the mouth of the Connecticut River.
 
Special Interest Group Plates
 This month will see the start of another facet of Connecticut's plate promotion. This is known as the special interest group plates, which will be similar in color to the Sound plates but without the water motif. Instead, they will feature an organization's name across the bottom of the plate and its logo on the right side.
The first two plates issued will be to the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association and to the Military Order of the Purple Heart.
Organizations waiting for their own plates include: Iwo Jima Survivors Association of Connecticut, Marine Corps League, Connecticut State Firemen's Association, Rotary International, Connecticut Chiropractic Association and the Connecticut Department of Higher Education.
Mr. Goldberg is much less optimistic about sales of the special interest group plates than about the Sound plate. "We won't sell 12,000 of them," he said. But the groups themselves will buy, promote and distribute their plates for their members, leaving the Commissioner to concentrate on the Sound plate. His latest plan is to get more environmental groups and garden clubs involved in projects that benefit Long Island Sound by splitting the costs with money provided by the sale of Sound plates.
If the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles sounds more like an enterprising businessman than a state official, it is because he was a business executive for three decades. His entry into state government was unplanned, he said, and he is still suprised by it.
During the 80's, Mr. Goldberg, who is now 56, said he made enough money to semi-retire, limiting his work schedule to commuting for a couple of days to New York City as a business consultant. At home in Weston, he was playing a lot of golf the other days.
A registered Republican, he became a volunteer in the 1990 independent gubernatorial campaign of Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and received some attention for a flap he created in his town by putting up a Weicker banner on a town-owned building.
He had not met Mr. Weicker at the time, and did not do so until after the election. At a victory celebration in Simsbury Mr. Goldberg's wife suggested they go up and meet the victorious candidate.
It was later that Governor Weicker invited people who wanted to serve in state government to write him a letter. "I thought I could work for a couple of days a week as a consultant on business," Mr. Goldberg told the Governor. Instead, Mr. Weicker offered him the Commissioner's job, to Mr. Goldberg's surprise.
But he took the offer and has brought a certain verve to a job once regarded as a choice political plum open only to the most faithful of the party in power.
When the plates went on sale late last year, Mr. Goldberg decided to get a good start by offering a $5 discountfor people ordering the plates as Christmas presents. He was told he could not do that. However, the bill authorizing the special plates stipulated that the Commissioner could set the price of the plates, so Mr. Goldberg marked down the price $5 before Christmas. After that he set the price up $5. The reduced price was known as the "blue plate special," and to some in the department as the "Lou Goldberg special."
With its new family of license plates, Connecticut has joined more than 30 states that issue special license plates. The Preserve the Sound idea was inspired by the State of Maryland's "Treasure the Chesapeake" plate that went on sale in 1991 and has raised more than $4 million.
Several people are taking credit for the idea to benefit Long Island Sound, including Governor Weicker. "And if he says it's his idea, that's good enough for me," Mr. Goldberg said.
But the Motor Vehicles Commissioner will take full credit for promoting and marketing the plates, aided by volunteer help and services from several companies. I.B.M. printed a million brochures. Bell Atlantic Metro Mobile has staffed the 1-800-CT-SOUND number that people may use to order the license plates. "We've gotten more than $150,000 worth of services free," boasted Mr. Goldberg.
Public acceptance of special plates in Connecticut might be considered a bit more unusual than in other states. The land of steady habits has been very careful not to tamper with its license plates for more than three decades, with only one exception.
In 1957 the Connecticut license plate was standardized with white letters on a dark blue background. In 1974 the colors were reversed to blue letters on a white background, and from the start it was considered a truly ugly plate; a year later the decision was made to go back to white on blue.
Some of the 1974 plates are still around but the letters on most are so worn that the plates look more white on white. Commissioner Goldberg is recalling the plates because they are almost useless for identifying cars. People may simply turn them in for a new white on blue plate or, of course, for one of the Sound plates. Nothing would please him more than the latter.

HEADLINE: Brodsky Broadsides O'Rourke on Ethics

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
WHEN Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky made his formal entry into the race for County Executive last weekend before 150 supporters in Yonkers, he used the word "corrupt" 13 times in a 10-minute speech, when referring to Andrew P. O'Rourke, the man he is seeking to replace.
Mr. Brodsky, a Greenburgh Democrat who failed in a similar challenge against the incumbent Republican four years ago, was alluding to accusations that have been made against Mr. O'Rourke over the last two months that he placed government contracts with companies employing family members and friends or that he sought to use his influence to get jobs or provide other advantages for them. 
 Mr. Brodsky, who will have to defeat a fellow Democrat and the candidate endorsed by the party's executive committee, County Clerk Andrew J. Spano, in a September primary if he is to challenge Mr. O'Rourke, made it abundantly clear that he thinks Mr. O'Rourke is vulnerable on the issue of ethics in government.
Mr. O'Rourke responded by saying: "Anybody from Albany should know how to use the word corrupt successfully. Brodsky has a long way to go. If he's the candidate, I'll be happy to talk about his vision for Westchester's future." Mr. Brodsky's 1989 campaign also featured the corruption theme. The alleged misdeeds ascribed to Mr. O'Rourke in that race focused on Playland, the county-operated amusement park in Rye, where concessionaires claimed they were obliged to contribute to the County Republican Party to win contracts and where some county employees were given Republican Party administrative tasks to perform during their work hours.
Mr. Brodsky has conceded that the corruption theme did not make the impact he had anticipated four years ago and that the apparent miscalculation could have been a factor in his losing a relatively close race, 52 percent to 48 percent, to Mr. O'Rourke.
Mr. Brodsky's associates say that while precampaign polling data in 1989 showed corruption to be "a major issue," as one Brodsky aide put it, "the voters never associated O'Rourke with it." This time, the Brodsky team has observed, the reputed ethics violations are directly linked to Mr. O'Rourke.
The alleged violations include a charge that the County Executive pressured officials at New York Medical College last year to hire his son-in-law as a doctor, a charge that was given some credence by Msgr. James P. Cassidy, who was then chancellor. There is also a charge that the County Executive earlier pressed the school to accept his daughter Alice as a student.
Mr. O'Rourke recalls speaking to the former chancellor but denies any wrongdoing. Monsignor Cassidy told Gannett Suburban Newspapers he was given to understand that his help on the hiring and placement requests would facilitate an affiliation agreement with the county sought by the school.
Later, in a taped telephone discussion with an O'Rourke aide, Monsignor Cassidy stated that he "never said they were definitely related." Mr. O'Rourke has noted that the son-in-law did not get the job and his daughter did not get the interview, yet the school retained its affiliation agreement, although provisionally pending new negotiations.
Mr. O'Rourke has also defended his role in granting county contracts to a law firm that employed his other daughter, Aileen, saying he did not know she worked there because he had lost touch with her when his marriage broke up.
He also defended his role in the hiring of the woman he lives with by a company that manages the county's health insurance plan, saying that the law required disclosure of county-related jobs held by spouses and relatives.
He acknowledged that his companion's son worked for an accounting firm that received a county contract but said that employment did not require disclosure.
The so-called ethics issue has become a focus of interest for other politicians seeking re-election this year, as well as for their challengers, with meetings of the Board of Legislators punctuated now by requests for permission to abstain, with members stating, in some cases for the first time, that they have a conflict of interest because of a family member's employment or affiliation.
 
Economic Issues
 The District Attorney, Carl A. Vergari, whose planned retirement after 25 years created a scramble for that post, began an official inquiry into the allegations directed at his fellow Republican, Mr. O'Rourke. The Board of Legislators, all of whose 17 members are up for election this year, has asked the County Attorney, Marilyn J. Slaatten, to review the Legislature's options. Both investigations are continuing.
Mr. Brodsky plans to capitalize on Mr. O'Rourke's position, using the ethics issue as one of his two major themes. The other theme is economic incentives. "Once we clean out the barn and stop the corruption," he said last week, "we can turn to economic development, the basic issue."
"The O'Rourke message is 'Everything's fine,' " he said, "but that was President Bush's message, too. Is 'Everything's fine' good enough to run on? Not when this county begins to feel the full effect of white-collar job cuts. I.B.M.'s layoffs alone will put a lot of homes on the market."
Mr. Brodsky has not provided details of his economic-incentives plan, nor has he discussed how he plans to deal with Mr. Spano, who has concentrated more on making county government more efficient than on the corruption issue.
 
'This Isn't a Game'
 Mr. Spano, who backed off a primary with Mr. Brodsky in 1989 in return for what he and Dennis Mehiel, the party chairman, said was an understanding that Mr. Brodsky would step aside in 1993 if he lost the earlier race, reminds audiences of what he suggests is Mr. Brodsky's duplicity in the matter.
When he responded to the executive committee's endorsement a month ago, he observed that Mr. Brodsky was not present. Mr. Spano said: "Four years ago, he took your endorsement, he took your money, he took your support. Now he chooses not to show up. Maybe that's how you play the game, except this isn't a game."
Mr. Spano, who modernized the County Clerk's office by making records and other files computer accessible, described the county government as in need of similar upgrading. "We need the competence and experience of managing a large corporation, a $1.2 billion corporation," he said.
 
Pirro Decides to Seek Post
THE Republican Party's on-again, off-again candidate for District Attorney, Jeanine Ferris Pirro, came on strongly last week, saying she was accepting her party's nomination for the post being vacated by Carl A. Vergari after 25 years and that she planned to run a vigorous campaign.
Ms. Pirro, a former prosecutor and judge, declined the party's invitation to run for the office in mid-April, citing the demands of motherhood and a grueling campaign. In deciding to run, she said she was now convinced her children would be "well cared for" and stated that "women can be professionals and mothers, too."
She indicated, in fact, that she planned to emphasize the fact that she is a woman, saying, "It's time for a woman District Attorney in Westchester County."
 
Local Experience Stressed
 She also made it clear that she would seek to undermine the strong record of her likely opponent, Michael G. Cherkasky, who was the chief prosecutor in the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, by calling attention to his lack of experience in Westchester.
"I am a former Westchester County senior assistant district attorney," she said, emphasizing "Westchester" to the cheers of supporters in the plaza of the County Courthouse, "and a former Westchester County Court judge," using the same emphasis to renewed cheers.
Ms. Pirro was asked about a concern voiced by one of the five Democratic candidates for District Attorney, former State Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Martin, that if she became District Attorney she would have access to the files on organized crime.
 
Full Disclosure Promised
 Ms. Pirro rejected the remark as a "sad commentary," saying that Mr. Martin "can't back up the insinuation," which is that her husband, Al, a real estate lawyer, had links to organized crime.
She said, furthermore, that she has already submitted disclosure information dating back to 1986 when she ran for County Court in 1990.
She said she planned to release "all tax returns, full financial disclosure and my husband's client list" in this campaign. In addition, she said, "my husband has agreed to give whatever information needs to be given in this campaign."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Labor Unions Flex Pension Muscle

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
MOVE over, Dale Hanson. Make way, Bob Monks. Labor unions are testing their own brand of shareholder activism.
Sharing control of about $250 billion in pension money, labor unions are not about to let the big public pension funds run away with the game. Their first aim is to police foreign investments to keep them from subsidizing the loss of American jobs. 
 But, recognizing that the definition of an American company can be as slippery as the definition of an American-made car, they are wondering whether to challenge companies based in this country that ship jobs abroad. The unions are also seeking to shape the investment choices of those pension plans -- holding more than $3 trillion, almost enough to pay off the national debt -- over which they have no direct control.
Now, when, say, the Minnesota State Board of Investment proposes to move about $800 million abroad, Bernard Brommer, president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O., marches in to protest. He argued for a flat ban on foreign investments, and won the state's initial agreement to restrict investments in countries without adequate laws governing child labor, minimum wages, human rights, freedom of association and the rights of unions to bargain and strike.
Understand that labor's authority over pension funds has historically been limited -- in part to avoid corruption but also because management provides the money. Unions, often aided by outside money managers, have direct authority only over pension funds -- Teamsters, United Mine Workers, the construction trades -- that cover many employers, often small ones. Even then, representatives of labor and management share control equally.
Pension funds for the employees of a single company -- say, General Motors -- are usually controlled by that company, even if the labor force is unionized. Likewise for public pension funds, including Minnesota's, which cover city and state employees.
The public pension funds -- most notably California's, led by Mr. Hanson -- have transformed pension investing from passive buying and praying, to constant agitation. Aided by the fiery pronouncements of investors like Mr. Monks, they have successfully pressured companies to ditch old management, slim down and shape up.
Labor has had little power to resist the plant closings and layoffs that often result. But now, some unionists are at least discussing whether to use their own investments as weapons. Although uncomfortable defending management, they deride the current shareholder campaigns as little better than the takeover binges of the 1980's.
"It's the step the institutions decided to take when they didn't have enough corporate raiders around to bid up stock prices," said Randy Barber, a financial adviser to labor unions. "It's clear that management has screwed up all over the place. But what they're telling management to do is to act like speculators."
The unions are especially annoyed to see billions in pension dollars flowing abroad. Money managers have advised pension funds to increase their foreign investments sharply, both for diversification and to capture better gains if American markets cool after an exceptional decade.
But never mind about corporate and public pension funds; foreign investing has posed an especially sharp conflict for the labor funds. The unions managing these funds tend to negotiate corporate pension contributions, not benefits. Successful investments are crucial in providing the ultimate benefits.
For union funds considering foreign markets, said Thomas J. Lucey, who oversees pension accounts for the Putnam money management company, "It's an investment issue of offering greater returns versus the political and social issue of taking the brotherhood's money and creating job growth in other countries."
So far, a strong majority of union funds are considering foreign investments, but few have committed any money except through shares of foreign companies traded as American depository receipts on United States markets.
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers buys only those foreign shares traded in Canada, where it also has members, and in the United States.
The United Mine Workers, on the other hand, has sent tens of millions of dollars abroad, according to the latest Money Market Directory of Pension Funds; a union official refused to comment.
Earlier this year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., perhaps accepting the inevitable, issued guidelines approving foreign investments, but only if they don't contribute to the loss of American jobs. Union officials consulted with European counterparts who are used to having much greater say in corporate affairs.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O still questions whether foreign investments will outperform domestic stakes. But the labor federation especially favors foreign investments directed toward companies that would then buy more American products. A new Poland Partners fund that fits their criteria, aims not only to stoke Polish demand for American goods, but also to support Polish trade unions.
Under the Republicans, the Department of Labor has discouraged, if not forbidden, efforts by pension funds to pursue social goals. President Clinton and Robert B. Reich, the new Secretary of Labor, however, generally favor broader labor rights and the channeling of investments to create jobs.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., having issued its guidelines for foreign investments, is hauling lawyers and money managers in for talks later this year to make sure they get the point. Initially, the money managers protested that they knew little about the labor and export practices of foreign companies, said Jack Marco, whose firm, bearing his name, monitors their performance. His response: "I guess you're going to have to find out."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
'Waving the Market' and Other Games

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
ADAM SMITH'S invisible hand is an elegant concept, but in the real world of markets the hands at work are often all too visible. Bears and bulls spread rumors. Price changes create their own momentum as traders decide it is foolish to fight the tape. Short-term gyrations can be wildly irrational, more easily explained by the games traders play than by economic factors.
All that was evident in Wall Street's wild week, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average close over 3,500 for a couple of days before dropping 30 points on Friday. Some suggested the rise amounted to a market forecast that economic growth was going to pick up soon, but economically sensitive issues lagged. The market leaders were stocks that had been weak and were heavily shorted. 
 That was no coincidence. The rise past 3,500 was partly fueled by panic buying by shorts who had sold borrowed shares, expecting a decline, and now had to buy them back. "I can't take the capital drain," explained one money manager as the stocks he hated the most kept rising. "It's been a horrendous week." This spring the volume of shorting intensified to near-record proportions. Now a big question is how many short positions have been liquidated.
Last week's most artful game -- known as "waving the market" -- came just before the stock market closed Thursday. A big, and seemingly irrational, wave of buying in big stocks drove the Dow up 15 points in the last minute of trading, with Paine Webber executing a good part of the buy orders.
The word on Wall Street is that the buyers had huge positions in stock index call options, which they exercised Thursday night -- based on the closing prices Thursday that they had driven upward. The cash they collected from the options more than offset any losses from selling the shares Friday.
One way to tell if a market is getting overheated is to watch when the insiders decide to change the rules. That usually happens when prices have risen so high that the normally clever market makers have gone short and taken big losses. In 1980 it happened in silver, when the Commodities Exchange made it almost impossible for speculators to buy the metal.
This week's example is Andrea Electronics, a tiny company that claims it has a way to filter out random street noise from pay phone conversations and will start selling a product soon. In eight months, the stock went from $7 to $93. Then the American Stock Exchange barred the purchase of Andrea shares with borrowed money. In a wild session Friday, the first under the new rules, the price ranged from $80.50 to $102.50, closing at $86, up $20 for the week.
With swings like that, and with the Dow bouncing like a drunk on a trampoline, there is plenty of money to be made. But perhaps it is a market that is getting a bit too risky for those who are not good at Wall Street games. Even those who had never heard of "waving the market" lost money on Friday.

HEADLINE: Business Diary

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:

At Empire Blue Cross, the Board Makes Its Move
The troubles at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield were mounting so fast that heads would surely have to roll. Last week one did. The board, whose inquiry turned up troubling management and morale problems, forced the resignation of Albert A. Cardone as chairman and chief executive of the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer. And "nonprofit" puts it mildly: Empire has lost $250 million in the last two years, and its reserves are perilously low. Two other headaches: the Government, citing poor service, has threatened to cancel Empire's contract to process Medicare claims, and A.T.& T. has accused the insurer of inflating hospital bills. To top it off, Mr. Cardone did not even tell the board of these problems; stunned directors got the word in news reports and meetings with regulators. Finally, the board's patience ran out. 
 
Danes Vote With Their Brains
"Last time, we voted with our hearts," said a young Dane. "This time, we voted with our brains." Last time was June, when Denmark rejected European unity, but last week Danish voters thought better of it and ratified the treaty. To be sure, the treaty has been watered down -- a single currency is no longer required. And not all Danes had their hearts in it: a melee broke out in Copenhagen, as the police wounded at least 10 protesters. The House of Commons also voted to ratify the treaty, moving Britain closer to being the final nation to back unity.
 
China, Instant Powerhouse
Some momentous changes, like the drift of continents, take eons. But in the flick of a statistician's wrist last week, China's economy quadrupled in size -- as someone simply pulled out a new tape measure. Most studies have gauged a nation's output in dollars, but the I.M.F. looked instead at what the local currency will buy. Suddenly China vaulted from being the world's No. 10 economy to No. 3, just behind Japan -- and well behind you-know-who. "China is a great power already," one economist said. "Many people haven't quite grasped" that. But Chinese peasants aren't driving BMW's yet: per-capita income is $1,450; for Americans, who can't possibly afford higher taxes, it is $22,204.
 
An Appetite for Imports
The United States showed a huge appetite for foreign products in March, as imports -- many from Japan and China -- hit a record. That led to the widest trade deficit in nearly four years. Trade with China is a delicate issue, as President Clinton must soon decide whether to renew China's favorable trade status. But what does the trade gap say about the American economy? Pick your expert. An economist called it "a shocking number." But a trade analyst saw a sign of confidence.
 
More Video Choices? Help!
It's really happening. The people who bring you Progress have been threatening for some time to invade your home with more electronic information and entertainment choices (just what we need: the average American, starved for choices, already watches television 23 hours a day). But it wasn't till last week that two technologies -- cable and telephone -- started to converge in a big way when U S West, the Bell regional, agreed to invest $2.5 billion for 25.5 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, the nation's No. 2 cable operator. So be sure to duck. There's a superhighway for entertainment and information heading down your street.
 
Picking Up the Phone Crumbs
While the big guns in telephones and cable television are dreaming their futuristic dreams, Leonard Tow has more earthbound ideas -- and is doing just fine at it, thanks. Mr. Tow heads Citizens Utilities, a little-known Connecticut-based company that's making tidy profits on small phone, power and water companies in small markets nationwide. So tidy, in fact, that he's glad to scoop up some of the giants' crumbs. Last week, for $1.1 billion, it scooped up -- from GTE -- more than 200 local phone networks in 10 states, all insulated from big-city competition. So let the Time Warners and U S Wests do their worst; Mr. Tow is happy to "stick to the knitting." And it's lucrative knitting, by the way: Mr. Tow's pay at Citizens has been put at more than $20 million.
 
. . . Give or Take $100 Million
What a difference a couple of zeros can make. When A.T.& T. agreed to license Spectrum Information Technologies' patents for sending data over cellular phones, Spectrum said it foresaw "hundreds of millions" of dollars in royalties. To investors -- desperate to snatch anything that sounds like tomorrow's hot technology -- that was a buy signal, loud and clear. And buy they did, sending the stock from $4 to nearly $12 in just over a week. To insiders, that rise was a sell signal, and sell they did. Then, amid growing doubts about Spectrum's forecast, A.T.& T. said its royalties to Spectrum might reach "a few million dollars." Gulp. Spectrum skidded back to $6, in the heaviest trading in Nasdaq history.
 
The Humbling of Honda
Honda just hasn't been the same since Ford's Taurus rammed the Accord out of its spot as the top-selling car in the United States. It could be that Detroit has learned how to make good cars again, and buyers have caught on. But other forces are conspiring against Honda these days. The strong yen means it had to raise prices here, making its cars costly alternatives to Detroit's offerings, and a slow Japanese economy has cut into sales at home. So here's the bad news, as Honda reported last week: profits off 41 percent, North American sales off 17 percent, Japanese sales off 8 percent.
 
Allstate? Well, Almost All
Allstate's imminent stock sale is big, all right -- the nation's biggest initial public offering ever. But it's also long on controversy. Investors should like it -- the price, about $25 a share, looks good. But a lot of other people are not too happy -- hordes of Florida homeowners whose policies Allstate will cancel. Allstate saw $2.5 billion washed away by Hurricane Andrew, nearly half its capital, and it can ill afford an encore, so it plans to drop 300,000 customers to cut potential losses to $1 billion. It makes perfect sense -- except, of course, to Floridians, hundreds of whom took out their rage at a public meeting last week.
 
Rethinking Medical Malpractice
Lawyers probably like medical malpractice policy just as it is. After all, 60 cents of every dollar is eaten up by lawyers or courts. But doctors, who pay $5 billion or so for malpractice insurance, don't like it -- and neither do patients, who often wait years for their 40 cents' worth of justice. Now the President's health team wants to sweep this system aside, freeing doctors from liability and having patients sue H.M.O.'s or insurers. The Clinton team foresees faster payments and lower litigation costs. But no cheers rose up: doctors foresaw intrusive supervision, and consumer groups saw no sizable benefits.
 
Needed, Again: Technology Czar
Bill Clinton stumbled last week on his way to being the Technology President. He had a top techie lined up to be Deputy Commerce Secretary -- John A. Rollwagen, former head of Cray Research -- and hopes for him were high. But Mr. Rollwagen was mired in an S.E.C. insider-trading inquiry, and he withdrew his name. Not that he said that was the cause -- his main reason was "culture shock" on seeing Washington at work. "I knew it was different," he said, "but I didn't realize how different." He's got something there.
 
Wait! Don't Tax My State!
With President Clinton facing so much Republican flak in Congress, he can't afford to let any Democrats slip out of the tent. But last week a couple of big ones did, as some senators came up with their own budget plan. They professed a broad-brush complaint: too many tax increases. But their key goal is to scrap the fuel tax, which would batter oil states like Oklahoma or Louisiana. And the two Democrats jumping ship are David L. Boren and J. Bennett Johnston -- from, you guessed it, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
 
A Stock Record Is Dead; Round Up the Usual Reasons
 When stocks soar to a record, there must be reasons. No one really knows, of course; anyone who did would get rich awfully quick. It could be anything. Perhaps 72.4 percent of traders had a good night's sleep, compared with 41.3 the previous night. Perhaps astrology is the key. In any case, when the Dow broke through 3,500 on Wednesday, the Thursday-morning quarterbacks had to explain it, and they cited falling interest rates and gold prices after an inflation scare. But rates had been even lower weeks earlier, so why hadn't stocks been higher? Enough suspense. Here's the answer: Stocks rose because stocks rose.

Is the Party Over in Natural Gas?

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE year-old party in natural gas stocks has carried share prices for independent production companies up an average 54 percent in the United States since the end of April 1992. And pipeline company stocks have done almost as well.
Is it about time to sell, or are better days still coming in the gas patch?
For many analysts and investors, the futures market has been a tempting, bullish indicator that has led gas stocks on their upward march, with the price gains closely matching the surge in the commodity price. 
 Prices ranged from a high near $2.60 for deliveries next December to a low of $2.05 for April 1994. And the contract for deliveries this June, which traded as low as $2.06 this month, finished its last trading day on Friday at $2.20 for 1,000 cubic feet.
This very close link between gains in the gas futures market and gains in gas stocks suggests to some that the stocks are fully priced -- and maybe overpriced.
Carroll Freedenthal, president of a Houston-based market research firm, the Jofree Corporation, said that investors who bet that tight supplies will send cash prices near or above $3 for a million British thermal units -- roughly the same measure as 1,000 cubic feet -- on some cold days next winter could be disappointed.
Such heights have not been seen for gas since the winter of 1985. Mr. Freedenthal thinks the optimism for higher corporate earnings has been overdone. Canadian producers are ready to deliver abundant, cheaper supplies across the border into big gas markets in California and the Northeast, and pipelines and producers have expanded storage capacity that is now being filled, he said.
Bullish analysts like John E. Olson of Merrill Lynch Securities Research in Houston say stock prices will resume their rise before cold weather arrives later this year. The seasonal task now under way by local utilities, pipelines and producers of filling storage for next winter requires an extra 1.6 billion cubic feet a day, 22 percent more than the normal pace.
"There has been some profit-taking and digestion of the last year's gains in the last month, but I think gas stock prices will work their way higher by the end of the year," Mr. Olson said.
But this debate applies only to the North American market. Some analysts say the big excitement in global gas markets is in Asia, often overlooked, where the world's fastest-growing middle class is accelerating economic growth and energy consumption at annual rates above 5 percent.
"The gas business outside the United States and Western Europe is not well understood by the financial community,' said Robin West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm. "Something is really happening here." Richard D. Kinder, president and chief operating officer of the Enron Corporation of Houston, estimated that demand for new, gas-fired electrical power generation in China and India as well as the fast-growing economies elsewhere in Asia will amount to 550,000 megawatts within the next seven years, or three-fourths of America's total electrical-supply system.
In Central and Eastern Europe, the prospects for rising consumption are also enticing some aggressive American companies. Mobil recently signed a deal to ship gas into eastern Germany.
Unlike North America, where thousands compete and bargain daily on mostly short-term supply contracts with volatile pricing movements, markets in Asia and Europe have far fewer participants. Also, distances between rich gas fields and population centers are staggering.
Most deliveries are by tankers instead of pipelines, and the fuel is transported as liquefied natural gas. Shipyards constructing L.N.G. tankers are booming. The national oil company of Abu Dhabi recently ordered four L.N.G. tankers from a Norwegian shipyard for a total of $975 million, Mr. Olson said.
Supply contracts often are for 25 years at prices tied to crude oil. In the few years since the end of the Persian Gulf war, prices have been remarkably stable. Mobil, for instance, received $2.55 for a million B.T.U.'s in the first quarter of 1993 in its Asian and European operations, compared with $2.69 last year. In America, however, its average price rose to $2 from $1.48 in comparable periods.
Because of the lure of huge supply deals, several companies are trying to expand quickly in Asia. Mr. West said that brown-outs are common in big cities in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines and that political pressures are building to accelerate government spending for gas-fired electrical power.
These projects require huge capital investments to produce, process and transport the gas. Mobil is in an $18 billion project to develop the world's largest known gas field, discovered more than 20 years ago in the Persian Gulf near Qatar. The Mobil group plans to ship gas by 1997 in liquefied form by tanker to Japan and Korea.
Other companies' staking claims to big gas deals in Asia, Mr. West said, are Royal Dutch/Shell, Caltex (an alliance of Texaco and Chevron), Exxon, ARCO, Union Texas and Enron. Big engineering and construction companies also in the mix include Bechtel, Dresser Industries and General Electric.
Another American company, Air Products, has a near monopoly on gas liquefication technology in the region, said Simon Blakey of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

HEADLINE: A Race to Satisfy TV Appetites in Asia

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
SCENES from the satellite-television revolution in Asia:
* In Hanoi, officials of the Vietnamese Communist Party and foreign guests in some of the city's larger hotels watch the BBC's hourly news, beamed live by satellite from London.
* In Hong Kong, stock traders end their day in the office by flipping on Cable News Network to catch the opening share prices half a world away in Europe, while at home their children sit glued to a Madonna video festival on MTV. 
 * In Indonesia, rice farmers on the island of Sumatra gather around a communal television set to watch the American soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful" -- they don't understand the English script, but they seem to enjoy it anyway.
* Here in the prosperous city-state of Singapore and north across the Gulf of Thailand to Bangkok, viewers pay a monthly fee to enjoy recent Hollywood films on a new pay television service, Home Box Office Asia.
Satellite television has arrived in Asia, and it is altering the viewing and spending habits of a continent that is home to two-thirds of the world's population and some of its fastest-growing economies.
A handful of large American companies, including Viacom, Time Warner, Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, have already entered the race in Asia, facing a tough competitor in the region's largest satellite service, Hong Kong-based Star TV. Among the large American advertisers now familiar to Asian satellite-television viewers are Coca-Cola, McDonald's, A.T.& T., American Express and Merrill Lynch.
In some Asian nations -- and not just the affluent ones -- parabolic dishes are becoming as common a sight as rice paddies. The satellite-viewing audience in Asia is expected to grow exponentially as the dishes become smaller and more affordable, and as satellite broadcasters offer more programs in Asian languages.
"Asia as a market has tremendous potential," said William G. Hooks, the managing director of HBO Asia, the continent's first English movie subscription service.
HBO Asia, a division of Home Box Office, itself a subsidiary of Time Warner, made its debut last year in Singapore, now serves Thailand and will begin service this month in the Philippines. Mr. Hooks said he is optimistic HBO will be available in Taiwan and Hong Kong by year-end and in most of Southeast Asia by the end of 1994. His goal? "The HBO brand will become as well known in Asia as it is in the United States," he said.
The HBO signal is bounced off the Indonesian Government's Palapa satellite, which has a signal, known as a footprint, capable of reaching 40 million Asian households with television. "And a very modest penetration of that number will make for a very nice business," Mr. Hooks said.
The first major American company to enter the satellite-television race in Asia was Cable News Network, a division of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It started beaming its signal to Japan in 1982 and is now in 23 countries and territories in Asia and the Pacific.
LAST year, CNN opened news bureaus in Bangkok and New Delhi -- it already had Asian bureaus in Beijing, Manila, Seoul and Tokyo -- and now broadcasts a daily program on Asian business news.
ESPN, the American sports network that is controlled by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and the Hearst Corporation, is available in the Philippines and Thailand, and is planning to produce programs geared to Asian audiences as it expands satellite service across the continent.
The world's largest cable television company, United States-based Tele-Communications Inc., has joined with regional television companies in New Zealand and Singapore to begin a Pan-Asian satellite business-news channel later this year. Like HBO Asia, the business channel is setting up its studios in Singapore, which is trying to depose Hong Kong as Southeast Asia's communications hub.
The Japanese have begun limited satellite ventures outside Japan, including rebroadcasts across Asia of the evening newscast of the giant NHK network. Australian Television International, or ATVI, began broadcasting this year in Southeast Asia, with entertainment shows and news programs that focus on the region.
Kirk C. Sweeney, a communications specialist and research director at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, said he was "surprised all this didn't happen sooner," given the limited -- and often low-quality -- offerings of government-controlled television networks in Asia.
"There are only two traditional broadcasters in Hong Kong," he said. "There are only three in Malaysia, one in Singapore. I won't say that the Asian market is ready for a number of new satellite channels today, but I think it will be ready over the next five years."
But the American entrants face an entrenched rival in Star TV, short for Satellite Television Asia Region. Star, a $300 million venture that began service in 1991, already has five free 24-hour channels: MTV Asia, which includes Asian music videos but is much like its American cousin; an entertainment channel that reruns popular American and British television shows; a sports channel; a Chinese-language channel, and BBC World Service Television, the British competitor to CNN.
Star is owned jointly by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and by the family of Hutchison's billionaire owner, Li Ka-shing, and it beams off the three-year-old Asiasat 1 satellite, which has a larger footprint than Palapa. Unlike its Indonesian competitor, Asiasat 1 reaches across China and India and into the Middle East.
Although it is almost impossible to count satellite audiences, Star says its market research shows that it reaches more than 11 million households in 38 countries. It estimates that nearly half of those viewers are in China, where satellite dishes are illegal but easily purchased.
Julian Mounter, chief executive and president of Star, said pay television services are coming this fall, including an English-language movie channel to compete with HBO. Hindi- and Chinese-language movie channels are also planned. Viewers will be able to see the pay channels by renting Star-approved descrambling devices or by subscribing to local cable television.
Although Star has yet to sign a deal with an American studio for the Pan-Asian rights to films, Mr. Mounter said he expected to this summer. "We cover such a big footprint, places where HBO doesn't reach, that I think a lot of film producers will want to do a deal with us," he said.
BUT Mr. Hooks of HBO Asia said his company had a headstart over Star, with arrangements to buy films from Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures and a dozen other studios.
"Notwithstanding its obvious accomplishments, I just don't see Star's ability to go and license the amount of product needed to begin a pay TV service," he said.
Mr. Hooks, a 19-year HBO veteran, said that although company rules prohibited him from revealing the number of subscribers or revenues, HBO Asia was "doing well within our original, conservative business plan," and that he had high hopes for two of Asia's most affluent markets, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
He conceded, however, that HBO Asia would not be profitable for some time. "It will take a minimum of five years to really, successfully establish the business here," he said.
All HBO Asia films are now shown in English, but Thai- and Chinese-language subtitles are expected to be added this year. HBO's movie offerings in Asia are tamer than its American fare, a reflection of the more conservative standards of the Asian nations it most wants to serve. "Actually, I wouldn't use the word tame," Mr. Hooks said. "I would say sensitive and cautious."
HBO Asia's home, Singapore, is an especially strict censor, and HBO has already been forced to make program changes on the signal it transmits over Singapore's Government-controlled cable system, which is separate from its satellite feed for the rest of Asia.
The acclaimed American film "Goodfellas," directed by Martin Scorsese, was removed from HBO's schedule in Singapore because of heavy censorship and replaced with "PT 109," starring Cliff Robertson.
Mr. Hooks shrugs when asked whether censorship would severely limit HBO's offerings in Asia. Despite his experience with "Goodfellas" and a handful of other films, "I have been more than surprised by the lack of significant editing so far," he said, reminding a visitor that censorship is not limited to Asia. "Movies are censored on airplanes," he said. "Movies are censored in the United States of America."
 
Some Countries Curb Signals
 WHILE some Asian governments welcome satellite television, others see it as a threat to their cultural identity and even their political stability.
The power of satellite television was proved last year in Thailand, where street clashes in Bangkok between pro-democracy demonstrators and Thai soldiers helped bring down the military government.
Although the Government censored local television broadcasts of the violence, in which scores of unarmed civilians were gunned down, satellite-dish owners videotaped the scenes of violence shown on BBC and CNN. The tapes were distributed within hours across Thailand, fueling the public's anger and hastening the Government's downfall.
Singapore and Malaysia restrict private ownership of satellite dishes. Viewers there can see satellite-channel programs only as rebroadcast over tightly controlled government television. The Singapore cable broadcasting service carries CNN and HBO Asia, but not Star TV. The Malaysian Government bars satellite receivers, saying it fears a "cultural invasion" by the West.
Although Indonesia has a more authoritarian government than Singapore and Malaysia, it does have an "open skies" policy that allows satellite dishes to be purchased freely, with few limitations on what signals can be grabbed from the sky.
The dishes are everywhere in that vast archipelago nation, sprouting from rooftops of the fanciest condominium buildings in the capital, Jakarta, and from gardens in tiny farming villages on remote islands. Farmers who cannot afford a dish sometimes pool their money for a communal one.
Geography may explain why Indonesia supports the satellite industry.. Because the nation is made up of more than 13,000 islands spread across thousands of miles, it is much easier to send TV signals by satellite than by traditional broadcasting.
China and Vietnam also bar private ownership of satellite dishes, but the laws are often ignored. China may have more viewers of Star TV than any other country.

HEADLINE: Revival of the Fittest

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
THOSE who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. So are those who remember it all too well.
Take a quick look at the cultural landscape, preferably in your rear-view mirror. It's the 60's. "Tommy" is on Broadway. "Hair" is scheduled for a revival in London. The Velvet Underground is getting together again. Jimi Hendrix and the Doors rule. So do bell-bottoms and "Right on!" politics. 
 It's the 70's, too. The grand amusement park of American popular culture proudly announces a new attraction, 1974 Land, a bright and shiny place where crocheted vests, platform shoes, shag haircuts and "The Brady Bunch" live on forever.
If you like, it's the 30's, 40's and 50's, too.
Nearly everything that human reason says could never, ever -- nohow, no way -- stage a comeback has come back. An entire universe has been retrofitted and given a new lease on life.
In just a few years, the 80's will return, artfully repackaged, retooled, deconstructed, gleaming with a semiotic wax job and somehow more real than they were 10 years ago. The second time around, you get a chance to think about things, to ponder some basic questions. Like, what is going on here?
Two things are going on. The first is easy to understand. Time passes and a new generation discovers new and exciting things in the old stuff. Frantic picking and gleaning goes on, and creative editing. Yes, we'll take Hendrix. But no hourlong drum solos, please. This is one way tradition moves forward, by moving an old idea into a new context and discovering that it can do the work of a new idea.
Old styles can supply vital nutrients. The 60's are back, in part because Americans in their late teens and early 20's like the idea of a dominant youth culture. The decade of the Peace Corps, the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, psychedelic drugs and lots of rock-and-roll shines with a seductive luster. The decade looked pretty silly from the vantage point of 1974, but now some of the good stuff is coming back.
But what about all the bad stuff? That's the second, and much more significant part of the equation. The culture is delivering unsolicited warmed-over pizzas to America's doorstep. Fleetwood Mac. "Bewitched." LSD. "Ironside." Polyester. Who ordered this?
What exactly are the rules here? And if Birkenstocks can run around the track one more time, why not Earth shoes? If bell-bottoms, why not leisure suits? If "Laugh In," why not "Sing Along With Mitch?" If Lulu, why not Tony Orlando?
"With this question," said Robert J. Thompson, an associate professor of television at Syracuse University, "you're really beginning to flirt with the Rosetta stone for understanding American pop culture in the waning days of the 20th century."
As a case study, consider the phenomenal second life of "The Brady Bunch," a show that went off the air in 1974 after five seasons and then lay dormant, a ticking cultural time bomb. In the meantime, the original audience for the show grew up, went to college, married and absorbed the reflexive sense of irony that is widespread in American culture today.
IN 1991, "The Brady Bunch" exploded. A theater company in Chicago began performing episodes of the program, following the original scripts, to standing-room-only audiences. The show, "The Real Live Brady Bunch," is now running in four cities. There are three "Brady Bunch" books. An hourlong prime-time special on the series was broadcast on Wednesday. A film version is in the works.
"We used to try to identify ourselves by trying to display what we like," Professor Thompson said. "Now, there's more of a tendency to display what we make fun of. That's a major cultural shift."
Professor Thompson proposed four rules governing a successful revival:
* First, the product must be low- to middlebrow and must have been consumed the first time around with no sense of irony, often by people of a lower economic class than the people consuming it the second time around. (This is why "Masterpiece Theater" does not generate many revivals.)
* Second, the product must carry as many markers as possible that link it to a particular period. ("The Brady Bunch" was a nonstop festival of early 70's fashion, speech mannerisms and hair styles.)
* Third, the revival must be spontaneous. (When Sherwood Schwartz, who created "The Brady Bunch," produced a television revival of the show, it flopped.)
* Fourth, there must be a minimum level of technical competence.
The Thompson taxonomy is, of course, debatable. (Point 4, Professor Thompson admits, may be a little shaky.) But it covers a lot of ground. And there's no reason why extra points cannot be tacked on in the search for a comprehensive theory to explain why some things happen twice and some don't.
The power of mere exposure needs to be considered, for example. In the same way that a baby duck can form a child-mother bond with a vacuum cleaner during the critical imprinting stage, children will develop an emotional attachment to anything that flickers on the tube often enough.
This power applies even to fare like "Gilligan's Island," which survived a total of three seasons (1964-67) against competition like "Lawrence Welk," "Donna Reed" and "Kentucky Jones" but went on to a thriving afterlife in syndication and now threatens to become an Off Broadway musical.
But mere exposure is not enough to explain why "Gilligan" thrives and "My Favorite Martian" doesn't. The reason is that "Gilligan," although little more than a situation and a handful of little-known actors with a laugh track attached, exhibits a complex texture. "My Favorite Martian" is unidimensional, the television version of a pet rock. You see it; you get it; you forget it. It's gone. There's no point in kicking it around.
"Charlie's Angels," another unretrievable artifact, is a slightly different case. Wildly popular, it survived long enough to be regarded as camp while it was still on the air, thereby depleting its camp value for later generations and ruling out the possibility of a return to Farrah Fawcett hairdos.
"The A Team" will suffer the same fate. It had the bad luck to run in the age of "Saturday Night Live" and sneering stand-up comics who feast on prime-time self-parodies. There is nothing left for later generations to nibble on.
"Dragnet" survives because it was taken seriously throughout its lifetime on television. Only later did audiences learn to hoot at Jack Webb's wooden acting style, the corny voice-overs, the portentous theme music, the awesome sincerity of the whole project.
Too much popularity, in fact, can permanently taint any second-level pop-culture phenomenon. Peter Max was so overexposed during the 60's that his revivability potential is well below zero. Trudgers who manage, by persistence and guile, to string out a career long beyond any reasonable expectation do not make good revival candidates, either. Hence, no afterlife for Tony Orlando, and it's a pretty sure bet that Kenny Rogers will not be packaged in an irony-laden five-CD set by Rhino Records.
Earnest midlevel competence is nonrevivable. A musician like Peter Frampton offers no ironic openings. You have to dive a little lower in the talent pool.
The same goes for Top 40 hits. "What makes them the most dated makes them the most durable," said Gary Stewart, a vice president of Rhino, which is now in its 22d volume of repackaged 70's hits, "Have a Nice Day." He carefully distinguished between efforts like David Soul's "Don't Give Up on Us," or "Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes" and the more revival-worthy "The Night Chicago Died."
"The ones that don't make it are the mid-level, mediocre ones, just a notch below good," Mr. Stewart said. " 'You Don't Have to Be a Star to Be in My Show' won't get the attention that an 'Afternoon Delight' or 'Billy, Be My Hero' will. Also, I think there's there's an irritability criterion at work here." In other words, the song that made you want to put your foot through the radio is the one that will return.
Fashion is a little more complicated. It demands more commitment than listening to a three-minute song or sitting through a failed sitcom. It costs money and it actually touches your body. No one gets ironic except with accessories. A betting man might jump for a leisure suit right about now, but who wants to be first? Hair is even more difficult. Make a mistake and you're stuck with it for a long time. The 60's mania has not brought back the Afro, for example. Fashion has focused on the early 60's Malcolm X look rather than the late 60's Jesse Jackson look, when a serious 'fro barely cleared the doorway.
ONE-JOKE fads don't travel well through time. Not even John Waters is going to bother with mood rings, pet rocks, Hula-Hoops or Rubik's Cubes. The public's love affair with these choice items was a one-night stand, a mad night of passion that can never be repeated, even in an ironic mode. The pet rock was ironic the first time around (it may be history's first example of irony intended for mass consumption), which makes it doubly unrevivable.
The same dynamic insures that no best seller can ever return to popularity. "Peyton Place," which was to books what "Star Wars" was to films, no longer exists as a cultural artifact. Even deader are books with philosophical overtones, the ones that define, in a particularly embarrassing way, an entire generation of college freshmen. Books like "Love Story" or "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" or "Siddhartha." Do not wait for a second coming of "Your Erroneous Zones."
"Love Story" must be singled out for special attention, since it pulls off the equivalent of a triple play in the game of nonrevivability. Not only is the book gone forever, but the two stars of the movie version, Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw, also dwell in that great cultural junkyard where the macrame belts are piled in heaps, Flip Wilson still does stand-up, Helen Reddy belts out "I Am Woman" and the Fonz gives the thumbs-up sign.
The end of an age may be approaching, however. The pleasures of irony are not inexhaustible. As a strategy it has proven effective in allowing the educated to enjoy mass culture while sending out signals that they know better -- and are better -- than those who live in tract houses and see nothing funny about lawn sculpture or avocado-colored appliances. But the strategy, which is an elaborate defense mechanism and more than a little cowardly, works only so long as the people in the tract houses don't get the joke. And that is changing. They can watch David Letterman, too.
"The last decade has been the golden age of the revival of kitsch," Professor Thompson said. "But once the regular people begin to get wind of this, and start making fun of Big Boys, then the whole purpose of revivalism is defeated. The game is up."

HEADLINE: Filibuster Rises to Breathtaking New Heights of Irresponsibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Senate's defeat of President Clinton's jobs bill, and its impending burial of campaign finance reform, have been depicted as tactical victories for its Republican minority. What has escaped attention is the transformation of the Senate procedures that fueled these "victories."
Traditionally, the filibuster has been the instrument of regional interests, small states and ideological minorities bent on blocking adverse legislation or securing concessions from the Senate majority. The ability to sustain such a filibuster, as in the case of the motor voter bill, described in "A Useless Filibuster" (editorial, May 11), depends on bargaining and negotiation among visible actors. 
 This system, undeniably undemocratic as you suggest, and perhaps unconstitutional, as was recently suggested by Lloyd Cutler, has been further corrupted by what we might call a caucus filibuster. On the jobs bill, the minority caucus secured a commitment from all its members to filibuster the entire package, regardless of each senator's feelings about the merits of particular components.
By binding its members to filibuster the entire bill, the Republican caucus in effect denied its members the right to bargain. It also denied the public the right to know who among its 43 members opposed what parts of the bill and why.
Never before in Senate history has a party caucus used its power to bind its members in a filibuster that denies the public the right to know who opposes what in a given bill.
None of the traditional defenses of the filibuster apply in these cases. However insidious the "little group of men" who blocked American involvement in the League of Nations or how much Southern filibusters blocked progress on civil rights, the lines were clearly drawn. The caucus filibuster obscures such accountability and raises an already undemocratic procedure to new heights of irresponsibility.

HEADLINE: Diplomacy's Goal In Bosnia Seems Not Bold Action But Avoiding It

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE parade of Foreign Minis ters passes through Washing ton Andrei Kozyrev of Russia, Alain Juppe of France, Douglas Hurd of Britain -- but less is happening inside the offices of the high and mighty than it seems. Once again, there is no agreement on what to do about poor, bleeding Bosnia. The Europeans emerge, full of their age-old complaints about American naivete. The Americans accuse the Europeans of timidity and disunity.
One will not act without the other. "In the last analysis, it is a European problem." "When you come down to it, only the Americans can lead." After you, Alphonse; no, after you, Gaston. 
 After hundreds of hours of consultations, the best the allies could muster was a stopgap plan, announced here Saturday, to set up a half-dozen "safe havens" that they hope will afford some protection to civilians. Gone with the wind, as far as anyone could tell, is any idea of rolling back the territorial gains made by the Bosnian Serbs in 14 months of fighting.
The suspicion grows, and no one bothers to deny it with much fervor, that each side is just as happy, all things considered, to put its proposals on the table and let the other reject them. That way, each is absolved of the blame for inaction in the Balkans, a perilous place where both suspect there is little outsiders can achieve.
Inaction has its uses, of course. The big powers don't get sucked into a war they cannot end, which is what President Clinton clearly fears at the moment. He is skeptical about any intervention, he keeps saying, and unwilling to put American troops into "a shooting gallery" like "Cyprus, Lebanon or Northern Ireland" -- or Vietnam.
For the man in the street, whether the street is in Paris or Chicago or Frankfurt, that may be just as well. Opinion polls show no public clamor for military action, although they show plenty of anger at "ethnic cleansing" and sympathy for the battered Bosnian Muslims.
But inaction also has its costs, and many will have to pay, if not as dearly as those in Sarajevo. At a time when he looks less than sure-footed on domestic matters, Mr. Clinton would have liked to have looked as resolute and consistent on Bosnia as he did in his handling of Boris Yeltsin and the crisis in Russia. Instead, he looks befuddled. He cannot escape from the fact that he promised to take tougher military measures against the Bosnian Serbs and did not, and that he proclaimed himself, repeatedly and disingenuously, to be close to an agreement with Europe on what those measures would be.
George Bush left him a miserable legacy, true. A less passive American policy a year or so ago might have made a big difference. All the same, however, Mr. Clinton has failed to deliver on his promises, talking loudly and leaving his stick on his shoulder. The next time he voices threats, they will have less credibility.
 
'A Bad Model'
 The Europeans, whose prime ministers and foreign ministers come to office only after extensive experience in foreign affairs, have been slightly dubious of Mr. Clinton from the start. That is one reason he chose to surround himself with foreign-policy veterans. But in the Bosnian episode, the marching orders the President gave his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, invited failure; he was sent abroad to listen, not to persuade, and came home empty-handed.
Watching all of this, Erhard Busek, the shrewd Austrian Vice Chancellor, whose country lies just outside the Balkan cockpit, finds every reason for discouragement.
"It is a bad model for the post-cold war era," he said the other day during a visit to Washington. "The actions of the Serbs will encourage other nationalists to try to change the borders of Europe, by force if necessary. The attitude of the European Community -- you Americans were better, but not much -- will give them every reason to think they can get away with it."
In fact, the demise of the Soviet empire and the threat that it posed to the West has left the Atlantic alliance with no clear definition of where its common security interests lie, let alone how or through what organization they might best be defended.
There is a murky perception of new threats from Islamic militancy to the south and renascent nationalism in the East. But would the interests of the United States or Britain be threatened, as Washington and London believe they were in Kuwait, by a Hungarian attempt to reclaim Transylvania from Romania or a Romanian attempt to regain the part of Moldavia that belonged to the old Soviet Union?
Is it strictly a question of Realpolitik, where oil matters and morality does not? How much does the cost count in the equation of policy-making? Is the goal stabilization ("containment" was the vogue word in Washington last week), or is it punishing malefactors?
The European Community, which is finding economic unification far more difficult than it had expected, remains years if not decades removed from strategic unanimity. NATO, having lost its old enemy, has yet to find a way to play a new role as guarantor of European stability. The Group of Seven industrial nations, formed for economic purposes, including Japan but not Russia, is at best a makeshift mechanism.
That leaves the United Nations, which has been trying to keep a peace that does not exist and to succor the suffering. But as Sir Brian Urquhart, the retired United Nations Under Secretary General, concedes in an article in the current issue of The New York Review of Books, "the tragedy of Bosnia has shown that international organizations are not able to deal effectively, and when necessary forcefully, with violent and single-minded factions in a civil war."
To avoid such impotence in the future, he proposes the creation of a small, highly trained force of volunteers from many nations, "willing and authorized to take combat risks and representing the will of the international community."
 
Soul-Searching
 Whether or not it leads to such a radical departure as a United Nations legion, the Bosnian struggle has already prompted soul-searching in many Western capitals. The French are discussing the possibility of a major international conference to develop a new definition of European security, and in Washington, there is a growing realization that new methods are needed to deal with future Bosnias.
In some ways, the most destructive aspect of the last month has been the clumsily public nature of the allies' dealings with each other, and a senior Clinton Administration official commented, "We have to find ways to function more like a diplomatic alliance, which does its fighting in private, and less like a fractious family."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Peace Talks: No Sign of Life, but They're Not Dead

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
MANY Israelis and Palestinians cannot shake a nagging feeling that the air is seeping out of the balloon known as the Middle East peace negotiations.
Now back up for a moment. That does not mean the talks are dying. If the recent past is a guide, at least one of the Arab parties will hem and haw for a while, most likely the Palestinians, but in the end everyone will show up for yet another round in Washington some time in June. Who knows? Some sort of agreement is not impossible, such as a declaration of principles stating what the Palestinians and Israelis hope eventually to achieve. Among the charms of this corner of the Middle East is its tendency to sharp mood swings; that which looks hopeless today can suddenly seem quite manageable tomorrow. Certainly, each side is well aware of where solutions lie, and has good reasons to find them. 
 Still, there is no escaping the fact that stutter-start talks that opened with fanfare in a Madrid palace in October 1991 have gone 9 rounds over 19 months, and have produced nothing of substance. Increasingly, Israelis and Arabs are asking how much longer this can go on.
Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, head of the Palestinian delegation and one of its more negative voices, suggested last week that negotiations be suspended so their basic framework could be redesigned. Yossi Beilin, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, also fretted, warning that "time is not on the side of peace" but instead favors the rejectionists in each camp. While neither man was articulating an official line, the pessimism that both reflected could hardly be ignored.
Of course, one of the good things about balloons is that they can be reinflated, and Mr. Beilin knew where to look for the air pump: Washington. Forget about progress, he said, unless the Clinton Administration makes good its promise to become a "full partner" in the negotiations, by bumping heads together much as Jimmy Carter did with Egypt and Israel at Camp David in 1978. Otherwise, Israel's main negotiation tracks, with Syria and the Palestinians, will remain stuck.
 
A Ride to the Rescue?After You
 As matters stand, Syria refuses to spell out what it means by its offer of full peace until Israel commits itself to full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 war. And Israel says it will not detail the extent of its withdrawal until it hears a Syrian definition of peace. The short version: You first! No, you!
The Palestinian track defies pithy renditions. The parties are staring at large gaps between their positions on the nature of the Palestinian self-rule being discussed for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and on the future of Jerusalem. Conspicuously, many Palestinians want to waste no time moving from an interim period of self-rule to a final settlement, which for them means getting their own state under United Nations land-for-peace resolutions. But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says they are galloping ahead when circumstances -- and the prevailing rules -- call for a trot. Besides, Mr. Rabin flatly opposes a Palestinian state as a menace to Israeli security. First, let's have that interim period for a few years without any talk of territory for peace, he says; then we'll see where it leads. One reason Palestinians dislike this approach is that Mr. Rabin's Labor Government could easily be supplanted by the Likud Party and its yield-little-to-nothing philosophy. As it is, some Likud hawks started warning last week that they feel no obligation to honor any treaty Labor may sign.
So doves like Mr. Beilin say the time has come to call in the Americans. One problem is that the United States seems in no hurry to ride to the rescue, although there is talk that a senior delegation may be sent to the region to smooth the path for Round No. 10. Washington helps those who help themselves, Secretary of State Warren Christopher cautioned last week, saying that "the United States cannot travel this road alone."
There were topsy-turvy elements in all this. Here were Israelis asking for active American participation when for years, under Likud, Israel and many of its American Jewish supporters had resisted such involvement as likely to turn into unacceptable pressure. And the Palestinians, who long wanted the United States to jump in, have suddenly developed cold feet, accusing the Clinton Administration of collusion with the Israelis.
It is clear that while both sides, at bottom, want to keep talking, they still lack basic trust.
Many Palestinians see any settlement that falls short of perfection as a sellout. Their negotiators must contend with death threats and with differences between the leadership in the territories and the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis. And selling peace to the man on the street has not been made easier by Mr. Rabin's deportation of 400 accused Islamic militants to Lebanon, by a two-month-old closing of the territories that has caused economic distress and by a pronounced tendency of late for Israeli soldiers to fire at, and kill, rock-throwing Palestinian protesters, children included.
For his part, Mr. Rabin says that Palestinian negotiators who keep raising human-rights issues dwell on the conflict's symptoms, not its causes, as if the goal were to make nicer occupiers of Israelis instead of getting them to feel confident enough to pack up and leave. Indeed, from his vantage, the long territorial closing should be seen by Palestinians as the start of their hoped-for disengagement from Israel, not merely as another affliction.
Besides, the Prime Minister has his own troubles, including a Government mired in crisis, a resurgent Likud and polls that show sturdy popular opposition to territorial compromise. Cabinet ministers do not rule out a national referendum on a land-for-peace agreement. They say the polls will turn around once a real deal is on the table. Right now, though, standing under that leaking balloon, no one seems ready to bet the farm on it.

HEADLINE: For Sale, Cheap: Russia's Once-Mighty Industrial Base

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE UNITED STATES has already offered to purchase the nuclear material in the warheads of its former archenemy, Russia. Why not offer to buy up half its manufacturing base too?
In principle, it's available for about $719 million. But hurry -- prices are dropping fast! Right now, the nominal market value of the part of Russia's industries up for privatization is about that of Chiquita Brands International, or just a bit more than Americans spend each year on jogging outfits, or on food distributed in Federal school lunch and breakfast programs. 
 With the ruble cascading downward last week to an official rate of 940 to the dollar, all kinds of amusing, if spurious, calculations are possible, if one is so inclined.
It all depends on Russia's program to put the state-owned economy into the hands, however inexperienced, of its citizens. For investors, this is an enticing, cheap and oddly untraveled way to buy a slightly soiled, deeply humiliated former superpower.
Last October, the Government issued roughly 150 million vouchers, one for every person in Russia, with a face value of 10,000 rubles. That figure was decided upon by taking a ballpark estimate of the book value of a third of Russia's large industries as of Jan. 1, 1992 -- all they first thought would be privatized -- and dividing it by the population.
Since then, of course, inflation has been enormous -- about 2,600 percent in 1992 and now between 15 percent and 20 percent a month. So a voucher that could buy 10,000 rubles' worth of a company valued at 1991 prices would seem to be a very good deal indeed.
Even better, the vouchers, when issued, were worth about $25 at the then-prevailing rate of exchange. Today, they're worth about $10.64. And because many Russians would rather have instant cash, anyone, Russian or foreign, can buy vouchers from brokers for about 4,500 rubles, or $4.79.
So in theory, at that rate, one could buy up every voucher issued for about $718.5 million -- enough to run the Defense Department for one day, or about as much as President Clinton offered Russia last month in credits for grain purchases.
However. Never mind that any attempt to corner the voucher market would drive prices up very quickly -- there are other problems with the idea of buying up Russia that are instructive.
First, by no means is all of Russia's industry open to privatization. Vital defense plants and major energy and natural-resource enterprises remain in state hands, even if they are supposed to operate commercially.
Second, many vouchers are being accepted for other purposes, like buying land and shops. And many are used by workers to acquire shares in their own enterprises without having to bid for them at auction.
That is because, third, there are different privatization options. For example, a new decree requires that 80 percent of the shares of large factories be sold for vouchers. But if the enterprise chooses the most popular option -- in which employees get 51 percent of all shares -- only as little as 29 percent of the equity in the factory may be open to purchase by voucher. The remaining 20 percent may go on sale for cash only, at much higher market prices.
Fourth, and most important, the vouchers aren't actually shares in the company; they represent a way to acquire them when an enterprise first issues stock. The assessed value of the enterprises reflected in the vouchers is almost wholly artificial. Maksim Boyko, an official in the Privatization Ministry, says that a company's real value will emerge only from the sale of shares in the secondary market. Two factories with identical book values may, because of differing bids from investors, award different amounts of shares for each voucher. Then with the emergence of real stock exchanges, the shares will be valued by market forces.
Fifth, the market price for vouchers, a ruble instrument, doesn't correlate well with the exchange rate for dollars. The voucher price is low because most Russians don't yet understand capitalism and many attractive enterprises are not yet up for auction. The ruble exchange rate is low because of inflation.
What the ruble can buy at home, however, is much greater than its value against the dollar might suggest. Similarly, economists say, the labor of a Russian factory worker is worth more than $30 a month, the average value at today's rate of exchange.
But that brings up the real question: Why aren't more Western investors getting in on this fire sale, which they are legally able to do? Mr. Boyko, like other Russian officials, sighs. Reformers like him, accused by conservatives of selling off Russia's sacred jewels to rapacious foreigners, wish only that it were easier to do.
Westerners are not yet psychologically ready, Mr. Boyko said. They worry about political and financial instability, about the bureaucratic nightmares, the dearth of legal protections and the difficulty of gaining effective control over companies.
"But Western interest is growing, especially in the last month, as more companies are put up for auction," Mr. Boyko said. "We hope their interest will continue to grow, as they see which way the wind is blowing."

'Buying Black' Approach Paying Off in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED by stalled government and corporate efforts to revitalize poor areas of Los Angeles ravaged in last year's rioting, the city's black community has undertaken its own approach to economic development: it is investing in itself.
In the year since civil unrest laid waste to huge tracts of commercial property in South-Central Los Angeles, black community leaders have launched numerous programs to persuade blacks to spend their money in black-owned businesses. The theory is that this helps create jobs and increase tax dollars to improve schools and public works within black neighborhoods. 
 While the strategy of "buying black" has been promoted in New York City and other urban centers for decades, with little results, recent efforts here are showing great promise.
"We have become more sophisticated in our thinking, and many of us are realizing that if we spend money in our own shops then that strengthens us as a people," said Gene Hale, head of the Los Angeles African American Chamber of Commerce.
Over the past year, black churches, celebrities and consumers, including many from the more affluent neighborhoods of Baldwin Hills and Inglewood, have transferred millions of dollars from large traditional banks to small black-owned ones that serve the South-Central area. Those banks say that as a result they have hired more employees to handle the growing number of new accounts and that the increased cash reserves will allow them to make more loans locally.
Throughout the city, businesses are posting signs in their windows that indicate they are owned by blacks, and many black consumers said in recent interviews that they seek these out. Local groups are publishing directories of black businesses for consumers and merchants and running networking seminars for professionals.
Economic development experts, including Bernard W. Kinsey, co-chairman and chief operating officer of Rebuild L.A., the public-private consortium established in the wake of the riots to help revive the economy of the city's poor areas, agree with this investment strategy and cite the success of ethnic groups like Koreans who patronize Korean establishments almost exclusively.
 
Fueled by Frustration

 
 The black community stands to gain greatly if these latest efforts flourish. Nationally blacks earn about $277.55 billion a year, or 7.65 percent of the total money income in the country, according to Brimmer & Company, a consulting firm.
The renewed commitment by blacks to patronize the black enterprises here and elsewhere in the country has been fueled by frustration with the persistent economic decline of impoverished neighborhoods despite a variety of Federal and corporate initiatives. Moreover, many blacks interviewed said they continue to be outraged by the acquittal last year of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, and feel that supporting black businesses is a show of solidarity.
"I don't buy products where I don't see black people associated with them," Mr. Kinsey said. "To the extent that we spend our money outside of our community, we make someone else more productive than us. Ask yourself: Who is my lawyer? Who is my doctor? Where do I eat? Who does my tax returns? All of these services can be supplied by African-Americans."
Mr. Kinsey cites the proliferation of inner-city nail parlors. "There's a nail shop in every strip mall in South Central, and the shops are owned almost exclusively by people from Asia who take those dollars out of the community when they leave each day," he said. "Why can't at least some of those shops be operated by people who resemble the clientele?"
Rebuild L.A., which has encountered criticism over its slow pace, had yet another setback when Peter V. Ueberroth, the program's head, resigned Friday. Mr. Ueberroth announced he was stepping down as one of five co-leaders because he had become the focus of complaints, which was hampering the group's progress.
For decades, many black consumers refused to shop at black businesses, believing they would receive products and services inferior to those in white areas. In many cases certain merchandise and services simply were unavailable, forcing consumers to go elsewhere.
"Black people have been duped into believing that the bigger the institution, the more secure your funds will be," said the Rev. Edgar Boyd, pastor of the Bethel A.M.E. Church in San Francisco. "This reasoning comes from slavery tradition in which black folks were taught that white folks' sugar was sweeter and that their ice was colder, but we all know that's nonsense."
 
Transferring Assets

 
 Mr. Boyd, who served as pastor of Bethel A.M.E. in Los Angeles, helped organize the effort to persuade black churches to transfer their accounts to black banks, after seeing a Bank of America study that showed blacks in Los Angeles County controlled about $9.5 billion in liquid assets but deposited only 3.5 percent of that in black banks. Within the first 45 days of arranging the effort, more than $8.5 million flowed into black blacks, a trend that Mr. Boyd said is continuing.
Another group active in encouraging blacks to patronize black businesses is Recycling Black Dollars Inc., which provides establishments with banners that indicate they are black owned. Muhammad Nassardeen, the group's president, said that the banners were first used during the riots to discourage looters, but that now the signs have become a source of pride in the community.
The group plans to mail black consumers 50,000 consumer discount cards by the end of the year for use at black businesses. Card users will receive discounts at the enterprises participating in the program. "For the average, everyday person on the street who wants to do something to build up their community," Mr. Nassardeen said, "there's nothing easier than shopping at a black business. But we have to first divorce ourselves of the negative programming that has taught us that we have to go to affluent areas to get quality."

HEADLINE: One Concession at a Time;
Snip, Snip, Snip, Clinton's Budget Takes Shape

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Clinton budget plan resembles a large, unruly hedge. Every day, it seems, one branch or another gets clipped. None of the trims has changed the basic shape of the hedge. But the inability of the gardener to bring it under control once and for all raises doubts about whether he knows what he is doing.
To get his tax measures through the House Ways and Means Committee, President Clinton agreed to drop his proposal for an investment tax credit, to raise the corporate tax rate less than he wanted and to offer concessions to farmers, small businesses, oil producers, public utilities and the aluminum industry. 
 That may not be enough to gain passage by full House, where a vote is scheduled this week and the President will get little if any Republican support. So last week Administration officials and Democratic leaders discussed further arrangements to win over some rebellious Democrats who want more spending cuts.
In the Senate, the White House struck more deals. For example, Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, was promised a tax break for exported petrochemical products. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, was promised new tax advantages for farmers.
And at week's end, it was clear that a new concession would have to be made to Senator David L. Boren. The Oklahoma Democrat holds the swing vote on the Finance Committee, where the President has no Republican support and where the Democratic majority is only 11 to 9.
Mr. Boren and a handful of other moderate Senators representing both parties offered their own plan last week with fewer tax increases and deeper spending reductions than the President's. It stands no chance of passing, but it could be the starting point for new negotiations.
So far, the fundamental elements of the Clinton package remain intact: higher tax rates for the wealthy, a new tax on fuel, taxes on a larger proportion of the Social Security benefits of middle- and upper-income retirees, lower taxes on the working poor and no reductions in basic social welfare programs.
But the constant scrambling, even supporters say, makes a President look weak and indecisive, especially this President whose party controls the House and Senate by solid margins and who should still be in his honeymoon.
"Every time he gives in to one member or one interest group, that means two other members and two other interest groups are on his doorstep wanting theirs," said a Democratic Congressman from California. "I don't mean he should be rigid, inflexible, but he has to be perceived as being firm."
At Mr. Clinton's meeting with Democratic Representatives in the Capitol Wednesday morning, Representative Charles Wilson put his finger on the practical problem resulting from the uncertainty over Mr. Clinton's intentions. Voting for a tax on fuel would be very unpopular in his East Texas district, Mr. Wilson told the President. It would be politically disastrous for him to cast such a vote and then have the Administration drop the fuel tax when the bill reached the Senate.
 
An Earlier Betrayal
 The President, Congressman Wilson said after Wednesday's meeting, "pledged that he would stick with it and that he wouldn't ask us to walk the plank and then cut our feet out from under us."
That temporarily allayed the worst fears of many Democrats in the House, but those concerns were raised anew Thursday when Senator Boren announced his alternate plan, which would not include a fuel tax.
In the House Democratic cloakroom, lawmakers recalled how Representative George Miller was undercut by the Administration in March. The popular Californian, who is chairman of the Interior Committee, rounded up support in the House among fellow Westerners for Mr. Clinton's proposal to increase fees for mining and grazing on Federal lands. Then, under pressure from a few Western Senators, Mr. Clinton dropped the idea, leaving Mr. Miller high and dry.
Part of Mr. Clinton's problem is beyond his control. He faces the same political lineup that has prevented deficit reduction for a decade. Most Republicans would rather do nothing about the deficit than raise taxes. Most Democrats would rather do nothing than restrict benefits under Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which together swallow nearly half the Federal budget.
"I wish there was some popular answer to the problem of the economy," said Senator John C. Danforth, a Mis souri Republican. "There is no painless solution."
In addition, Democratic lawmakers have no feel for the rhythm of working with a Democratic President. Many, like Senator Boren, continue to march strictly to their own beat, the way they did when a Republican was President.
But some of the difficulty Mr. Clinton is having with Congress is of his own making. In the case of the grazing and mining fees, he compromised when it was probably not necessary and did so without consulting Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. And in the case of his economic stimulus bill, which was killed last month by a Senate filibuster, he rejected the advice of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and did not compromise when, it can be seen in retrospect, doing so was politically essential.
 
Embarrassments
 Moreover, embarrassing incidents continued to bedevil him last week. One developed over the abrupt dismissal of the experienced White House travel staff in what looked on the surface like back-scratching for Friends of Bill. An Arkansas travel agency with ties to the Clintons took over the office, but then was itself abruptly dismissed on Friday.
Then there was The Haircut, of course. See box, above.
Mr. Clinton was in Los Angeles on a two-day Western swing during which he tried to sell his economic program with campaign-style appearances. He was following the advice of, among others, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who had warned Mr. Clinton that Congress would never adopt his program unless the public was behind it. The trips received relatively little attention nationally. But lawmakers from California said the President dominated the news while he was there.
Until now, the President's missteps have not been critical. For all the opposition his budget has generated, no one has come up with an idea that commands more support. That could spell the difference. If the choice boils down to the Clinton plan or paralysis, Mr. Clinton will probably win. Even Senator Boren, said a sub-Cabinet official who worked in Congress and knows him well, does not want to be seen as the one who wrecked deficit reduction and brought down the Clinton Presidency.
But the political handling of the economic plan may have further ramifications. If the White House does not exercise better judgment down the road, a senior Administration official observed, the monumental political task of overhauling the nation's health-care system is hopeless.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Waiting for the Appointment: Who Will Be the Arts Chief ?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
PEOPLE in the arts know that President Clinton has had his hands full lately with Bosnia, gays in the military and the tax bill, but last week the National Council on the Arts could contain its frustration no longer about the Administration's foot-dragging on the chief appointment for the National Endowment for the Arts.
The council members, all of whom were appointed during the last two Administrations and who advise the arts endowment chairman, unanimously adopted a resolution informing the Administration how "disturbed" it was that a chairman had not yet been named. The chairman oversees the allocation of $175 million to artists and art institutions. 
 "Inaction sends the wrong signal," said Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who proposed the resolution. The Administration has not yet replied, he said.
One well-connected arts administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, speculated about the reason for delay. With all the problems President Clinton is facing, this person said, he has no desire at the moment to appoint a chairman for the arts endowment when he knows that a nominee, regardless of credentials, would come under fire both from those who think the endowment has promoted obscenity and sacrilege and from those who believe it has been cowed by shrill attacks from conservatives and now stifles free expression. Appointing a new chairman for the arts endowment now, said the administrator, would be a great way to throw away votes for, say, homosexuals in the military.
A White House staff member who also spoke on condition of anonymity was more reassuring: "I know you've heard this before," the aide said, "but we're close to a decision -- perhaps next week."
In a move that alarmed many artists and arts administrators, the Department of Justice last month appealed the decision of a Federal judge in Los Angeles that had declared unconstitutional the so-called decency standard which required the arts endowment to "take into consideration general standards of decency" when awarding grants.
The decency standard was written into law three years ago by Congress as part of a compromise that terminated a long, scratchy debate over the future of the arts endowment, which had been prompted by the Federal agency's sponsorship of shows displaying works by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. The decency standard mollified conservatives but outraged many liberals who thought it amounted to censorship. A White House staff member said the Justice Department was prompted to act only because of a legal technicality, not from any commitment to the standard.
 
Artists Challenge Decency Standard
 The constitutionality of the statute had been challenged by four performance artists who asserted that their arts endowment grants had been canceled on grounds of indecency.
Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a public policy group, said she is so angered by the Administration's support for the decency standard that she hopes whoever is offered the arts endowment chairmanship will publicly decline the offer.
Underlying these frustrations is the fact that President Clinton has yet to spell out his Administration's policy on the arts. That could not possibly put an end to every quarrel over whether a specific work of art is beyond the pale for Federal subsidy, but it could rally a demoralized constituency and provide footing for Mr. Clinton's eventual choice to head the arts endowment. A policy statement could also guide the debate on reauthorization of the endowment in September.
Unfortunately, when it comes to arts policy, previous Administrations do not offer much guidance. In fact, for at least 60 years, arts administrators say, Federal arts policy has been a hasty improvisation, dodging the tough issues and frequently doing the right thing for what many consider to be the wrong reason.
Under the New Deal in the early 1930's, artists were hired by the Government simply to reduce the number of unemployed. In the early days of the cold war, the rationale for supporting artists through cultural exchanges was for America to outshine the Communists.
Put to such use, artists were expected to entertain, and the notion that they might provoke or even shock was officially discouraged. This attitude was typified by President Harry S. Truman when he attended an art exhibit arranged by the State Department and stopped in front of a painting of a circus performer with exaggerated features. "If that's art," President Truman remarked, "I'm a Hottentot!"
During the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, the goal of promoting "excellence" was put forward as a more sophisticated rationale for Federal subsidy. When Congress created the arts and humanities endowments in 1965, their purpose was stated as the pursuit of "artistic and humanistic excellence."
Yet, to excel is to do better than others, suggesting a competitive rather than a creative accomplishment. Consciously or not, the quest for excellence was a further extension of cold war rivalry.
In the Administration of Richard M. Nixon, the budget for the arts endowment, which was $8 million in 1969, climbed to a princely $75 million five years later. According to aides, Mr. Nixon believed that the country's artists and intellectuals might soften their opposition to the war in Vietnam if flushed with Federal money.
During the 1980's, the economic impact of the arts was rediscovered. A study showed that cultural activities attracted $5.6 billion to the New York-New Jersey area. The study was used to encourage governments, corporations and other donors to support the arts as a matter of enlightened self-interest.
In recent years, the cry has been that the arts are entitled to Federal dollars because they "advance civilization," providing uplift and affirmation. But this notion is based on a false, sanitized concept of the arts, inconsistent with the confrontational styles that play a large part in today's art scene.
The challenge before Mr. Clinton, then, is to explain why the Government should support this often screechingly provocative expression.
Given his current problems, Mr. Clinton may deem it politically expedient to repeat the old cliches, half-truths and obfuscations.
On the other hand, he could do worse than argue that the arts, like health and education, are a social good and, even if sometimes painful, they deserve to be fostered by the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
As China Leaps Ahead, The Poor Slip Behind

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: GUIYANG, China

 BODY:
A NEW way of measuring the world's economies has vaulted China from the ranks of third-world nations to those of the economic powerhouses. Under calculations being introduced by the International Monetary Fund this week, relying on the buying power of each nation's currency rather than its dollar value, China's economy comes out four times bigger than most previous estimates. That makes it the world's third-largest, after the United States and Japan.
But the confirmation of China's enormous economic power helps to obscure the unevenness of the nation's economic development. China may be the world's fastest-growing economy on its way to becoming the world's largest market, but that represents primarily the activity along the country's coastal rim, from the northeastern tip of Manchuria all the way down past Hong Kong. 
 In fact, what has emerged in the past few years is a two-tier economy that is broadening the gap between rich and poor. This is worrisome to China's leaders because the same sort of gap prompted Communist guerrillas like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping to fight to overthrow the old order in the 1930's and '40's.
In its more Communist days, China was relatively egalitarian as countries go, for no one had much of anything. Indeed, the economic restructuring begun in 1978 by Mr. Deng, the nation's senior leader, initially created a more equal society. By stimulating growth in the countryside, it raised living standards closer to those of the cities.
But last week, Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji warned that over the past six months disparities between China's different regions had "widened to some extent." That seems an understatement. All indications are that income disparities have been growing since the mid-1980's, and that the pace is now accelerating.
"That could provoke a great deal of disenchantment and impatience among those whose lives are lacking," said Carl A. Riskin, a specialist on the Chinese economy at Queens College in New York.
In Guizhou, a landlocked southern province, the poverty is striking. In the mountainous countryside surrounding the city, a handful of children, their small bellies slightly distended, run around half-naked because their parents can't afford to buy them clothes. Huts are made of tree trunks, branches and straw. The typical resident's income was $123 last year, about one-sixth the average income in Shanghai.
China's 30 provinces were never all that much alike in the first place, but in their earlier years the Communists diligently played Robin Hood. They milked rich places like Shanghai to give to poorer regions. But the policy has shifted dramatically over the years, and now the contrast is sharp. The coast is vibrant, with executives striking thousands of deals every day with the outside world. The interior is crawling -- admittedly, faster than before -- yet even Chinese refer to this four-fifths of the nation as "China's third world."
 
Rich Get Richer
 Guizhou belongs to this other world. For the past dozen years, while provinces like Guangdong and Jiangsu were given economic privileges to develop, Guizhou was asked to supply its coal, timber and other raw materials at fixed state prices. The logic was that economic activity would "trickle in" to remote areas, as land, labor and transport costs rose in more developed regions.
The problem is that such a process is likely to take decades. Meanwhile, poorer areas are still subsidizing richer coastal areas with cheap raw materials. Officials tacitly acknowledge this phenomenon, but they defend it as imperative for progress.
"Development must be stable and orderly," said Zhao Jiaxing, vice director of Guizhou Economic Commission. "Actually, China can't develop evenly. But after the coastal areas get rich, their people will come here."
By some accounts, the nation has four or five million millionaires as calculated in local currency. (A million yuan is equivalent to about $175,000 at the official rate of exchange.) Some Chinese believe that such estimates, reported in the Chinese press, are exaggerations, but they have aroused some resentment.
"A certain level of gap encourages people to work," said Zhu Qingfang, who researches income differences at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "But if the gap is too big, it makes people feel uneasy."
In any case, the disparities are creating strains. Conspicuous consumption is growing in the cities, leading official newspapers to denounce "money worship." Huge migrations are creating headaches, as millions of peasants flock to cities in search of work. In the past, China restricted labor movements, but it has relaxed those rules, partly to allow urban economies along the coast to soak up surplus labor in the countryside.
One result is a talent drain from the poorer inland regions in China's northwest. The "floating population" has also made it tricky for the Government to control the birth rate. The Government's overriding fear is that the new inequities will provoke unrest. But some Chinese argue that even the poor are better off and therefore will not challenge the system.
"We know from TV that life in Guangdong may be better than here, but Guiyang is better than before," said Zhang Jinghui, a peasant who recently got a job as a vendor in this city in Guizhou. "And anyway, you can't believe everything you see on television."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
ALLIES ANNOUNCE STRATEGY TO CURB FIGHTING IN BOSNIA; U.S. OFFERS PLANES, NOT MEN

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
After months of discord and vacillation, the United States, Russia and key European allies agreed today on a joint strategy devised to contain the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to guard enclaves of Muslim civilians besieged by Serbian nationalists there.
The plan, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, Russia and Spain after a brief meeting here, calls for the United States to use air power if necessary to protect United Nations peacekeepers guarding six Bosnian towns that have been designated "safe havens" by the United Nations Security Council.
 
Issue Goes to Security Council
 But the size and duties of the peacekeeping mission will have to be decided by the Security Council, and Mr. Christopher did not specify what American aircraft would be authorized to do. That means that no use of American military force is imminent. 
 The plan is by no means a blueprint for stopping the war, but rather a series of modest steps on which the parties managed to agree. It is not aimed at rolling back the territorial gains of the Serbs, who now control 70 percent of Bosnia.
The protection of the safe havens will require the deployment of several thousand more United Nations troops in Bosnia in addition to the 9,000 that are already there. France, Britain, Canada, Spain and other countries already have contributed troops, and Russia now plans to do so, the ministers said.
 
No U.S. Ground Troops
 Although the United States would protect peacekeeping troops guarding the Muslim enclaves, it would not come to the rescue of the safe areas themselves if they are attacked by Serbs. Nor would it contribute troops to the peacekeeping effort on the ground.
The joint agreement reflects the Clinton Administration's abandonment of its earlier plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims, a proposal that was opposed by Russia and the allies, and its acceptance of the French initiative for safe havens, a strategy that it had opposed.
During his tour of Europe only two weeks ago, Mr. Christopher told officials that creating safe havens would essentially involve putting Muslims in ethnic ghettos, and thus reward "ethnic cleansing" by Serbian nationalists.
Mr. Christopher said today that he had not changed his mind about "the pluses and the minuses of safe havens," but that the United States had decided to go along with the idea because the Europeans wanted it.
"Since the international community feels, as represented by my colleagues here seated with me, that that can be a valuable concept, the United States is willing to cooperate in that endeavor," he said at a joint news conference after the meeting with Foreign Ministers.
 
Clinton Sees 'Step Forward'
 While Mr. Christopher was hammering out an agreement on the text of the plan, President Clinton, who has distanced himself from the negotiating process, was selling his economic program at a college commencement in New Hampshire. Asked if he thought the plan would do any good in stopping a war that Mr. Christopher has called "tantamount to genocide," President Clinton said, "I think it is a real step forward."
Senior Administration officials said they believed the American air capability in the region would probably be sufficient to protect and rescue endangered peacekeepers. American planes are conducting airdrops of food and medicine, enforcing the United Nations ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia, and monitoring a trade embargo aimed at cutting off the flow of aid from Yugoslavia to the Bosnian Serbs.
France has circulated a draft Security Council resolution that would authorize peacekeepers to protect and expand the safe areas and to take all measures necessary, including the use of force, to respond to attacks by Serbs. The Security Council is expected to take up that proposal in the coming week and other steps outlined today by the United States and the Europeans.
 
A Warning to Croatia
 The joint plan announced today includes a commitment to put international monitors on the border between Bosnia and Serbia to insure that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia keeps his word not to send weapons to Bosnian Serbs. Croatia would be warned that it could face economic sanctions if it assists the Bosnian Croats' campaign of "ethnic cleansing" against Muslims.
The joint strategy also calls for the rapid creation of a war crimes tribunal so those guilty of atrocities can be brought to justice; urges increased "international monitoring" in the Serbian region of Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, and calls for an increased international presence in Macedonia, the southernmost former Yugoslav province, bordering Greece.
Mr. Christopher said that the aim of the plan was to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs "to stop the killing," but there is no guarantee that such limited measures will do so that.
The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, described the joint strategy as a "realistic" approach. "No one is pretending that this is going to be an easy road, or a simple road that we've set out," he said.
Though it does not rule out alternative proposals, the joint strategy emphasizes the importance of reaching a negotiated settlement that would "build on" the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, which calls for creating semi-autonomous provinces dominated by different ethnic groups. That plan has been flatly rejected by the Serbs.
 
Pressure for U.S. Troops
 Amid the self-congratulations among the ministers was an undercurrent of discontent that the United States had refused to contribute troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force. Europeans in the United Nations force are already delivering food and medicine and ministering to the sick in Muslim enclaves and will now also be protecting them.
"I haven't agreed with the so-called division of labor between those who are in the sky and those who are on the ground," the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, said in a brief interview after the announcement. "I wish that all the great powers involved in the painful drama will assume their responsibility."
Mr. Juppe indicated that he would press the United States to change its mind, saying, "I think we'll convince all the partners to go forward."
President Clinton has adamantly refused to consider allowing Americans to take part in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia while the war is still raging. On Friday he said he would not want Americans "in a shooting gallery."
Asked why the United States refused to join in peacekeeping on the ground, Mr. Christopher said today that American planes had the "heaviest responsibility" for enforcing a ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia and conducting airdrops of food and medicine.
The six safe havens, already identified in an earlier resolution approved by the Security Council, are Srebrenica, Gorazde, Zepa and Tuzla in the east; the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo; and Bihac in the northwest. Officials said about 1.2 million people, including tens of thousands of refugees, are in the six towns. Additional havens could be added, the ministers said today.
The plan raises a number of questions that were left unanswered, like whether any penalties will be imposed if Serbs do not allow monitors to police the Serbian-Bosnian border. President Milosevic of Serbia has withdrawn an offer to allow international monitors along the border because he no longer fears American military intervention.

HEADLINE: A Strike Agitates Mushroom Country

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNETT SQUARE, Pa., May 20

 BODY:
A strike by 140 Mexican workers seeking to be recognized as a union by one of the region's many mushroom growers has failed. But it has made other people here in this affluent region freshly aware of the laborers and their tedious work and how the growers treat them.
Mushroom growers in the region, which bills itself as the "mushroom capital of the world," have faced intense public questioning and criticism about their treatment of the laborers. They work year round for 10 or more hours a day, 6 and 7 days a week. 
 A week's pay rarely exceeds $300, and most workers send a large part of their earnings to relatives in Mexico, leaving them with a minimum for living in this 138-year-old borough noted for its horse farms and stone houses.
 
Some Live in Dormitories
 There are 3,000 to 4,000 Mexican mushroom workers in Chester County, which has a population of more than 300,000. They are largely isolated by language and culture, and their children attend public schools without bilingual programs.
About a quarter of the workers live in dormitories provided by growers. The rest generally live communally in crowded slum apartments in this community of 5,200 people, including some just a few blocks from the Kennett Square Historic District, where Victorian houses are shaded by honey locust trees.
Commercial mushroom growing in this area 30 miles west of Philadelphia goes back a century to the time when Quaker and Pennsylvania Dutch settlers developed the indoor darkrooms that allowed mass production of what had previously been considered a rare delicacy. Chester County growers now produce a quarter of the nation's mushroom crop, with all the work indoors.
The strike, which began April 1, was against Kaolin Mushroom Farms to protest a new wage scale imposed by Kaolin. But it evolved into a strike intended to gain recognition of a bargaining unit, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The union provided the workers with $100 a week during the five-week strike.
Of the 140 strikers, only about 40 returned to work on the Kaolin farm; 33 were dismissed for trespassing during the strike, and 60 found jobs elsewhere or returned to Mexico. The dismissed workers are continuing to picket, asking for their jobs back. Last week, they staged a 125-mile march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, the state capital, to publicize their cause.
At a packed public forum held by the Kennett Friends Meeting here on May 7, a few days after the strike ended, Kaolin workers complained about poor pay, meager benefits and working conditions that they said were unsafe and unsanitary. Many of the striking workers acknowledged that they had urinated in mushroom beds because toilets at the Kaolin farm were so far away.
 
Like 'The 'Grapes of Wrath'
 "It's like 'The Grapes of Wrath,' " said Ree Redifer, an artist who was having a beer the other day at the Kennett Square Inn on State Street.
Thomas Macaluso, a college English professor who operates an antiquarian book shop on South Union Street, said, "In this small town with this industry, you can get a sociological picture of oppression and how it goes on."
One worker, Maria Diaz, said in an interview that the long hours she worked disrupted her family life. "I never see my son awake except on Sundays," Ms. Diaz, 33 said. "He feels lonely, but what can I do? I need the money."
Growers and their supporters strongly dispute the criticisms of their operations. "Those who call this exploitation are just uninformed or misinformed," said C. James Yeatman, a third-generation mushroom grower in nearby West Grove. Mr. Yeatman, who in the 1960's helped lead a drive to integrate the community's swimming pool by opening his own pool to black families, added, "I see no similarity between the civil rights movement and the Mexican situation."
Mr. Yeatman said Mexican workers came here of their own choice, voluntarily worked long hours and knew the struggles they faced when they brought their families with them.
 
'A Need for Healing'
 Jamie L. Tyson, the Quakers' representative for addressing peace and justice issues in Chester County, commented: "There have been many harsh words, harsh actions and untrue things said by both sides. When all this is over, there will be quite a need for healing in the community."
Kaolin Mushroom Farms is typical of the mushroom operations here. Rather than a traditional farm of fields and pastures, it is a large, windowless warehouse, where the year-round temperature is 61 degrees.
It is a warren of dark, cavernous chambers filled with long mushroom beds, stacked six or seven high like giant bunk beds. Workers fill the beds with a pungent compost of straw, manure and other organic material that has been seeded with mushroom spores.
Mushroom caps begin appearing in about six days. Then, for the next 60 days or so, pickers with small knives harvest each mushroom by hand, making their way along wooden "picking rails," which are only an inch wide and as high as 10 feet off the ground.
 
Strike Started Over Wages
 The strikers, who said they had not had a raise in three years, contended that the new wage scale imposed by Kaolin would reduce their pay and increase their workload. The scale dropped the basic wage for packers to $4.50 an hour from $5, but for the first time provided overtime pay at $6.50 an hour after 40 hours.
Kaolin said the wage scale would increase workers' pay by 5 percent to 10 percent. But workers contended it would be a wage reduction because their hours would be reduced and they would have to do cleanup work without pay.
For pickers, Kaolin put into effect a 5-cent raise, to $1.15, for each container of mushrooms. The workers said they would be required to fill each container with 16 pounds rather than 10 pounds. Kaolin said that it was retaining 10-pound containers and that it was impossible to put more than that amount in them.
The president of the family owned company, Michael L. Pia, said he had not done a good job of explaining the new wages to the employees. He also said that the company was instituting a limited health-insurance plan that was worth $600 a year and that if the workers did not want the benefits they could take that amount in cash.
 
Strike Ended May 4
 "I understand that employees wouldn't have reached this level of dissatisfaction if everything were rosy here," Mr. Pia said. "But our wages are well above industry standards, and I don't know how much more we can be expected to do."
The strike ended May 4 when the union organizers asked Kaolin to let the workers return. The company agreed to take those back it had not dismissed and said it would not stand in the way of a union election, which will be held on Thursday.
The walkout shocked the community because it was the first time that the Mexican workers, who had been known for uncomplaining hard work, had struck. The Mexicans said they had been emboldened by the legal status they attained under the immigration law of 1986 and felt free to release years of pent-up frustration.
In one of the paradoxes of global trade, leaders of the Mexican strikers complain that the proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico, which has its own mushroom farming industry, could harm the American mushroom industry. The workers, seeking higher wages and higher mushroom prices on both sides of the border, have called for a national boycott of mushrooms.
 
$665 Million in Sales
 Mushroom growers, who had national sales of $665 million last year, work on slim and declining margins of profit, according to the American Mushroom Institute, a trade organization. In the 1980's, two-thirds of the mushroom growers in Pennsylvania went out of business. But those still active, including those in Chester County, produce nearly half of the nation's annual mushroom crop of 350 million pounds.
More competition from Mexico, where wages are a fraction of those paid here, would wipe out many American growers, industry experts said.
"Growers can't comprehend the economics of this," said Ventura M. Gutierrez, a strike organizer who came here from Project Without Borders, an organization in Southern California that is trying to organize farm workers in Mexico and the United States. "If they did, they would be with us."

HEADLINE: A Domestic Dispute;
On Health Care, It Is Hillary Clinton Versus President's Economic Advisers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
When President Clinton put his wife in charge of devising a plan to revamp health care in America, politicians wondered what he would do if she clashed with his other advisers. Now they are finding out.
Such a clash over the ambitious plan being developed by Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged at a White House meeting on Thursday. Health-policy advisers support a comprehensive package of medical benefits while top economic advisers question the scope and cost of such generous coverage. 
 Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton tended to favor the more generous option but that he had not come down explicitly in favor of one or the other. Instead, he appears to be seeking a middle ground, so that he does not have to choose between his wife and his economic advisers.
At the meeting on Thursday, the health-policy advisers, with support from Mrs. Clinton, called for giving all Americans a comprehensive package of health benefits as swiftly as possible. Budget officials and members of the President's economic team, equally committed to the same ultimate objective, urged him to spend less and go more slowly in the first few years.
 
Clinton's Inclination
 An Administration official said today that Mr. Clinton in his heart favored the more generous, more costly option. But the President was also swayed by the warnings of his economic counselors, including one who noted, "We are accused now every day of being tax-and-spend Democrats."
A White House official who attended the meeting with President and Mrs. Clinton said it was like a graduate seminar on health policy.
"This is not a civil war going on here," the official said. "It's too simplistic to portray this debate as the economic advisers' cheapskate position versus the health advisers' spendthrift position. And it would be quite wrong to portray the economic team as trying to derail health-care reform. But the economic advisers do feel that too lavish a public program would impair economic growth, imperil the budget and give fodder to critics who would like to kill this program when it's released."
Mrs. Clinton, the head of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, tells Administration officials who disagree with her to "speak your mind." But that is not always easy.
 
Power of First Lady
 "By virtue of her position as head of the task force and by being First Lady and by virtue of her own intellect, which is really quite impressive, she commands a lot of respect and is treated with deference," said a White House official who attended the meeting.
Leon E. Panetta, the President's budget director, has already urged Mr. Clinton to delay releasing his health-care plan to avoid diverting attention from the struggle over tax increases and budget cuts on Capitol Hill. Mr. Clinton has described the overhaul of health care as the second stage of deficit reduction, but Mr. Panetta fears that if the President's plan is too ambitious, it will increase rather than reduce the Federal budget deficit.
His concerns were echoed Thursday night at the White House by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the men nominated to serve with her on the council, Prof. Joseph E. Stiglitz of Stanford University and Prof. Alan Blinder of Princeton University.
The three, while mainstream economists, are all on the liberal side of the political spectrum. If they have reservations about the cost of the health plan, Republicans and conservative Democrats on Capitol Hill may have even deeper doubts.
 
The Tough Part: Taxes
 After deciding on the scope of benefits, Mr. Clinton must figure out how to pay for them. He has already said he wants employers to pay much of the cost. He is considering two forms of taxation, requiring employers to pay either a fixed percentage of the total payroll or a fixed amount of money for each worker.
At the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Clinton and his advisers considered variants of these two alternatives. If the President asks employers to pay a percentage of payroll (7 percent is often mentioned), there would probably be a limit on the amount of any employee's income subject to tax. And several thousand dollars of income could be exempt from the tax so employers would pay little or nothing for low-wage employees.
If the President proposes a fixed premium for each employee, workers would have to pay a portion of the cost. But Administration officials say there would undoubtedly be some type of Government subsidy to help low-income people pay their share.
 
More Disputes Expected
 The spirited debate over the scope of benefits may be a prelude to sharp disagreements sure to emerge when the President considers whether to impose controls on doctors' fees, hospital rates and drug prices. Some of the President's health-policy advisers, unsure whether his strategy of managed competition will actually restrain prices, want standby authority to impose such controls.
But a White House official said, with understatement, "Members of the economic team are not greatly enthusiastic about cost controls" imposed by Government decree.
For one, Stuart H. Altman, dean of the Heller Graduate School for Social Policy at Brandeis University, said today: "Even price controls won't bring the growth in health-care spending to a stop. Most of the growth is driven by the volume of services, not the price."
As a result, Professor Altman, a member of Mr. Clinton's transition team, said the problems facing the President now were inevitable. "If health-care reform were easy to do, it would have been done a long time ago," he said.

HEADLINE: A Poll Lends Credence to the View of New York as a City of Two Souls

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
To many people in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx, New York is truly two cities. One is theirs, a low-rise expanse of middle-class and blue-collar communities that emphasize traditional family living and values.
The second is New York's most celebrated borough, a secular, high-rise place filled with people obsessed by culture and art, defined by wealth and fashion and circumscribed by an elitist sense of self-importance. 
 The view that the people of Manhattan are significantly different from those in the boroughs outside Manhattan -- sometimes referred to, a bit dismissively, as the "outer boroughs" -- is reinforced strongly by the latest New York Times/WCBS-TV poll.
Such broad generalizations run the risk of creating stereotypes, of course, masking the diversity within the city's huge boroughs and feeding resentments among them. But the survey found broad patterns that indicate significant cultural distinctions between Manhattan and the rest of New York City. Among them: Manhattanites are likelier to be optimistic about the future of the city than are other New Yorkers, likelier to think their neighborhoods are safe and far likelier to have no religious affiliation.
Those differences have long been reflected in local politics, with liberals more dominant in Manhattan than in the rest of the city. But the survey, a telephone poll of 1,273 adult city residents that was conducted May 10 to 14 and that has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, indicates that the distinctions go far beyond political ideology. They include everything from family size and personal income to attitudes on sex education and homosexuality.
"I think most of our people are hard-working people -- some are working two jobs just to pay the mortgage," said the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman. "They are far more basic in their thinking, rather than philosophical or ideological as sometimes occurs among dilettantes in Manhattan."
 
Religious Differences
 The poll found that 25 percent of the people surveyed in Manhattan said they had no religious affiliation. In the four boroughs outside Manhattan, only 9 percent said that.
"Everybody attends church in my neighborhood," said Carole Bionda, a resident of Huguenot, on Staten Island's south shore, who was of those surveyed. "One of the nice things about it is that they all get involved. There is always something doing at the church. I don't think you'd find that in Manhattan."
Manhattanites were victims of crime less often than people in the other boroughs. Only 20 percent of Manhattan residents surveyed said they or a member of their immediate family had been victims of a crime in the last year; 29 percent of the respondents from the boroughs outside Manhattan said they or their family members had been crime victims.
Manhattanites were also much likelier to have a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian and less likely to say they were satisfied with the public schools, even though a smaller proportion of Manhattan residents have children of school age, the survey found.
People in Manhattan were also much likelier to live alone and were much less likely to identify themselves as Catholic and slightly less likely to identify themselves as Protestant. They were better educated and had higher incomes.
For some civic boosters outside Manhattan the results confirmed distinctions that they often seem simultaneously to resent and celebrate.
 
Two Attitudes
 Frank J. Macchiarola, the dean of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a former city Schools Chancellor, contends that there are two distinct mindsets in New York: Manhattan and outer borough.
"What sets the two New Yorks apart?" Mr. Macchiarola asked in an article in the current issue of the City Journal, a quarterly devoted to public-policy issues and published by the Manhattan Institute.
"Most Manhattanites live in buildings owned by someone else, while the single-family home is the norm for outer-borough New Yorkers," he wrote. "Manhattanites usually have professional jobs; men wear white shirts and ties and carry briefcases. Outer-borough New Yorkers are more likely to work with their hands. Some outer-borough New Yorkers do work in those fancy midtown office buildings, but at night they can hardly wait to get home to Queens or Brooklyn."
Mr. Macchiarola, a Brooklyn native, contends that the cultural differences among the boroughs help explain much of the political and social tension in New York, particularly the recent squabbling over sexual issues at the Board of Education.
Peter D. Salins, a professor of planning at Hunter College, said the root of the distinctions was deceptively simple. "The rest of New York is like America, and Manhattan is not," he said.
The strains between Manhattan and the rest of the city have grown worse in recent years, Mr. Salins contended, in part because the predominantly white and upper-middle-class sections of Manhattan have expanded. "As Manhattan gets more and more distilled to its cosmopolitan soul and the rest of the city remains ordinary, the contrasts get sharper," he said.
 
Neighborhoods, Not Boroughs
 Of course, such broad generalizations blur obvious distinctions within Manhattan and within the other boroughs, as well as between each. Even Mr. Macchiarola notes that people who live in neighborhoods like Harlem and Washington Heights may share cultural values more with people in working-class Brooklyn neighborhoods like Sunset Park or Bedford-Stuyvesant than with people on the Upper East Side.
And conversely, he writes, residents of Brooklyn Heights or Riverdale may have more in common with Manhattanites than they do with other Brooklyn or Bronx residents.
Some Manhattanites rejected any broad generalizations about their borough as simplistic. "Manhattan, like other boroughs in this city, is unbelievably diverse," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. "Between some people in Manhattan and some people in the other boroughs, there are some differences in how some people live. But they are being grossly overcharacterized. I think this kind of labeling really only gets you so far."
Richard C. Wade, a professor of urban history at the City University Graduate Center, said that most of the boroughs are as large as many states. "It's important that people don't see it as Manhattan versus the outer boroughs," Mr. Wade said. "The Bronx is an outer borough. Staten Island is an outer borough. And the two places could not be less alike."
But the survey indicated that at least in general terms, there are substantial social, cultural and economic distinctions between most people in Manhattan and most people in the rest of the city -- differences that may help explain the boroughs' distinctive political cultures.
For example, 52 percent of the Manhattan respondents said they had graduated from college, while 28 percent of those in the other boroughs said they had. There was hardly any statistical difference in the age of the boroughs' residents. But 20 percent of Manhattanites said they earned more than $75,000 a year, compared with only 8 percent of those in the boroughs outside Manhattan.
A much smaller proportion of Manhattan residents identified themselves as Catholic; 27 percent of Manhattan respondents said they were Catholic, compared with 46 percent of those in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Slightly more Manhattan residents said they were Jewish than in the other boroughs and slightly fewer said they were Protestant.
There were also proportionately more whites in Manhattan than in any other borough except Staten Island. Of those surveyed, 59 percent of the Manhattanites were white and 18 percent were black. In the other boroughs, 51 percent of the respondents were white and 28 percent were black.
Nearly half, or 49 percent, of the white Manhattan respondents said they approved of the way Mayor David N. Dinkins is doing his job. Only 21 percent of white residents of the other boroughs said they approved of the Mayor's performance.
Moreover, Manhattanites of all racial and ethnic backgrounds were far more favorably disposed toward Mr. Dinkins, who has lived in the borough for most of his adult life and who is a former president of the borough.
The Mayor and his chief rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, are in a statistical tie citywide, according to the survey.
In Manhattan, though, Mr. Dinkins was far ahead of Mr. Giuliani, 61 percent to 28 percent, according to the poll. Mr. Giuliani was rated ahead of the Mayor outside Manhattan, 49 percent to 40 percent.
Manhattanites were also much more liberal on the sexual and religious issues that have dominated the Board of Education. They were far more supportive of distributing condoms in high schools to curb AIDS and teaching respect for homosexuals than were respondents from the boroughs outside Manhattan, the survey found.
Some New Yorkers argued that self-selection was at the heart of the differences. "People are attracted to Manhattan because they like to be near people with similar cultural values," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Center for Urban Research at New York University.
"The problem is that the culture of Manhattan is so tolerant that what has become the norm in Manhattan represents unacceptable social behavior in other parts of the city," he said.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Excerpts From Allied Communique on Bosnia

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Following are experts from a communique on Bosnia released today on steps to be taken in Bosnia after consultations by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his counterparts from Britain, Russia, France and Spain.
1. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. We will continue providing humanitarian assistance to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and will insist that all parties allow humanitarian aid to pass without hindrance.
2. SANCTIONS. The economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against Serbia and Montenegro must be rigorously enforced by all members of the U.N. until the necessary conditions set out in Security Council Resolution 820, including the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops from territories occupied by force, are met for lifting the sanctions.
3. SEALING BORDERS. We note the pledge of the Belgrade authorities to close the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan. We are watching to see if the border closure is effective. Although the primary responsibility for enforcing this step belongs to Belgrade, we can assist, for instance by placing monitors on the borders or providing technical expertise or conducting aerial surveillance. . . .
4. SAFE AREAS. The concept of "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as France and others have proposed, could make a valuable contribution. We will work to secure early adoption of the new U.N Security Council resolution now under discussion. The United Kingdom and France along with other nations already have forces serving with UNPROFOR in "safe areas." Troops from other countries, including Spain and Canada, are playing an important role on the ground. The Russian Federation is considering making forces available in Bosnia in addition to its forces presently in Croatia. The United States is prepared to meet its commitment to help protect UNPROFOR forces in the event they are attacked and request such action. . . .
5. NO-FLY ZONE. The no-fly zone should continue to be enforced in Bosnia.
6. WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL. We support the rapid establishment of the War Crimes Tribunal, so that those guilty of atrocities may be brought to justice.
7. DURABLE PEACE. Negotiated settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, building on the Vance-Owen process and intensified international cooperation and effort, is the way a durable peace can be established. France, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States will assist and actively participate in a continued political process to this end. To the extent that the parties decide to implement promptly mutually agreed provisions of the Vance-Owen plan, this is to be encouraged.
8. CENTRAL BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. We are deeply concerned about the fighting between Bosnian, Croatian and Bosnian Government forces and the related "ethnic cleansing," and we agree that Croatia should be put on notice that assistance to Bosnian Croatian forces engaged in these activities could result in the international community imposing sanctions on Croatia.
9. CONTAINMENT. We will cooperate closely to enhance efforts to contain the conflict and prevent the possibility that it will spill over into neighboring countries. . . .
10. FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA. It is essential that everyone in the region understands that aggression against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would have grave consequences. We will support an increase in the international presence there in consultation with the authorities in Skopje. The United States is considering a contribution to this effort.
11. KOSOVO. We favor an increase in the international monitoring presence in Kosovo. International standards of human rights should be strictly respected in the formerly autonomous region of Kosovo, although we do not support declarations of independence there.
12. CROATIA. The same considerations apply to the Serb-populated areas of Croatia. We will work for the renewal and strengthening of UNPROFOR's mandate. The Croatian Government and the local Serb authorities should maintain the cease-fire and constructively pursue their dialogue leading to settling practical, economic, and, eventually, political problems between them.
13. FURTHER MEASURES. We will keep open options for new and tougher measures, none of which is prejudged or excluded from consideration.

HEADLINE: Wait Till Next Year, Casino Advocates Say

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 22

 BODY:
The campaign to legalize casino gambling in Connecticut's largest cities ended with a whimper on Friday, scuttled without even a vote by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s hard-line opposition and hard-ball tactics. But people on both sides of the issue say that Mr. Weicker's victory planted the seeds for what could be an even wilder debate on casinos in 1994, an election year.
Officials at Mirage Resorts, which spent more than $1 million in advertising and lobbying this year, said they will be back to argue their case in the next legislative session, that begins in February. Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent, will be back too, in the last year of his four-year term. He has not said whether he will run again, but nearly all 151 members of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly will be up for re-election. 
 And with the Connecticut economy expected to still be limping, and with the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe's casino in Ledyard expecting record profits, legislators say that what Mr. Weicker did and did not do in Round 1 of the casino fight will hover over every moment of Round 2.
 
'Issues Are Still Here'
 "Weicker carried the day politically, there's no question about that, but at what cost?" said the State Senate President pro tem, John B. Larson, Democrat from East Hartford, in an interview today. "The issues are still here: what do we do about the structurally unemployed in Connecticut and urban blight?"
Mr. Larson announced his own candidacy for governor last month, shortly after he said his position had evolved on casinos: from opposition, to grudging acceptance of casinos as the only option for places like Bridgeport, where there may be no hope for anything better to provide jobs and economic development.
But a prominent casino supporter, Representative James A. Amann, Democrat from Milford, said today that he believed, given Mr. Weicker's performance this year, that casino legislation has no chance next year.
"The only hope for the parimutuel and gaming industry is to see who the next governor is," Mr. Amann said.
Some of the Governor's allies in the casino fight say that such talk could be exactly the kind of thing that could make Mr. Weicker run again.
"This could be a signal that Governor Weicker will run for re-election to preserve what he believes to be the right road for the state," said Senator Catherine W. Cook, Republican from Mystic. If Mr. Weicker does choose the casino fight as a justification for seeking a second term, she said, "I expect it could become a major part of the campaign."
Mr. Amann and other casino supporters say that one factor to be watched as the election year approaches is whether Mr. Weicker comes to be regarded as a hero who blocked casinos, or a hypocrite who single-handedly engineered perhaps the biggest gambling expansion in state history by signing a deal in January giving the Mashantucket Pequot tribe the right to operate slot machines in their casino.
In return for a monopoly, the tribe pledged to pay 25 percent of slot machine revenues to the state -- at least $100 million a year for the first two fiscal years. The state, in turn, promised to share most of the money with local governments. But if slot machines are ever legalized off the reservation, the tribe is released from its obligation. The agreement stunned pro-casino forces who had to reassure legislators, whose towns would get the Pequot money, that Las Vegas-run casinos would be just as generous in tax contributions.
Mr. Weicker then promised to veto any casino bill, which meant that both the House and Senate would need two-thirds of their members' support to override him. It was the impossibility of reaching the two-thirds margin that finally led casino supporters to withdraw the bill without a vote.
 
Fear of Jealousy
 Some lawmakers who support the Pequot agreement fear that jealousy of the tribe's success could be fanned during the election into a sort of quiet racism that would support off-reservation casinos or candidates pushing such casinos. Some also fear the money that could flood campaigns for those who support casino projects.
"Certainly, the casino people have lots of money to spend, and they could be putting their money into candidates -- that could have an impact," said Senator Judith G. Freedman, Republican from Westport, who opposes new casinos. But she said the public might turn against candidates who accept contributions from casino advocates.
"I got the feeling that the public was disgusted -- quite appalled that people could come in and spend this kind of money," she said, referring to the campaign for the casinos.
But observers of Connecticut's political scene said that if the face-off between Mr. Weicker and the Mirage's chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, has shown anything, it is that personality, clout and cunning can beat big-money lobbyists and slick advertising campaigns. Others say that Mr. Wynn's salesmanship should also not be underestimated.
"When you've got Steve Wynn involved, who I think is the P. T. Barnum of our century, it's going to be difficult to ignore," said Mr. Amann, the casino supporter.

HEADLINE: Asian Countries, in Shift, Weigh Defense Forum

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 22

 BODY:
Spurred by an arms race that is spreading from China to Indonesia, Japan and other Asian nations have warily begun talks to set up their own regional security forum, a fundamental change in defense policy for countries that have never been able to form alliances and have always relied on the United States to keep peace in the Pacific.
In a meeting here over the last few days, with the blessing and participation of the Clinton Administration, senior government officials from throughout the region met for the first time to talk about threats to the area's stability, from an outbreak of piracy in the South China Sea to the containment of North Korea and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. 
 But Asian officials said the new talk of cooperation was also being driven by growing distrust of China's growing economic power and the military buying spree it has touched off. Their fear is that Japan, rattled by China's action and fearful of North Korea's nuclear program, will drift toward rearmament itself.
Since World War II, Asian countries have relied on the United States to keep Asia's many powers in check. That approach was reinforced by the Bush Administration, which talked often of a "hub and spoke" series of alliances with America at the center, and saw little need for additional security structures. Now many Asian leaders are coming to the opposite conclusion.
 
'A Dramatic Departure'
 "What we are seeing now is a dramatic departure, really a revolution, in the way Asian countries have dealt with each other," said Chan Heng Chee, Singapore's former delegate to the United Nations and now the director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies here. "Until now, we have only cooperated with each other on economic matters. But perceptions of the changing nature of the American role is making us begin to think that we must change also."
Over the last two weeks, Winston Lord, the State Department's top official for Asia, has traveled to all of the region's major capitals to repeat the message that the Clinton Administration plans to remain "fully engaged" in the region. And William J. Perry, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, told South Korean and Japanese officials last week that troop reductions in Asia were unlikely to go much further than those already announced.
No one yet knows exactly what form the new Asian mutual security framework will take, or even whether it will move much beyond a forum for dialogue. The first meeting simply resulted in a series of declarations of concern, especially about the violence in Cambodia and the intransigence of North Korea.
"We're a long, long way from considering collective action," a participant said. Indonesia, for example, has said it is opposed to any agreement that would bind members to go to the defense of another.
 
Alliances Elude Region
 Asia has never had an alliance resembling NATO, or even a loose forum akin to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Southeast Asian Treaty Organization, set up in 1954 after the French defeat in Indochina, dissolved after about 20 years and was driven mostly by the United States, Australia and European powers.
With the distances across the Pacific so vast, and national interests so divergent, it was always assumed any move toward collective Asian security would fail. Even today many doubt whether the new initiatives will be able to surmount the lingering bitterness from wars past, the continuing suspicions of Japan, or any number of territorial disputes.
But the ideological divisions that once divided Asia along Communist and non-Communist lines, leading to the Korean and Vietnam wars, have effectively blurred into oblivion. Instead, the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, now say that the chief motive for assuring regional security is simply to protect the world's fastest-growing economies.
Asean is made of Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and was formed to accelerate economic progress and stability in the region.
At the meeting here in Singapore there was even preliminary talk about bringing two of the remaining Communist powers, China and Vietnam, into the security framework, though there were sharp differences over how. Money from the rest of capitalist Asia is pouring into factories and other investments in both Communist countries at such an astounding pace that many politicians and business executives are calling for mechanisms to defuse any security tensions before they could threaten profits.
But the Japanese and others are reluctant. "We want to hear what China has to say, but on the other hand China is still a totalitarian nation," a senior Japanese offiical noted recently. "It is not one of us."
 
On Arms Buying Spree
 In many ways, wealth has suddenly become as destabilizing as the threat of spreading Communism ever was. Suddenly able to afford just about anything in the world's weapons catalogues, countries throughout Asia have gone on an unparalleled arms buying spree over the last year, one that the rest of the world has been only too happy to feed.
The initiative for the new security forum came from an unlikely source: the Japanese. Looking for a non-threatening way to increase its regional political role, Tokyo suggested organizing regular top-level security conferences. The Bush Administration's enthusiasm for the idea, however, was only lukewarm, and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III angered Japanese officials when he spoke of maintaining the "hub and spokes" series of bilateral relationships, with the United States at the hub, but said nothing of regional security.
The Clinton Administration also believes in hubs and spokes, but sees much room for other security arrangments as well. That thinking has been reinforced as South Korea, Japan and the United States -- and more haltingly, China -- have worked together in recent months to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons project.
"It has been a critical experience for all of us, and it has changed the way we relate to each other," a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official said recently of North Korea's nuclear arms program.

HEADLINE: New U.N. Index Measures Nations' Quality of Life

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 20

 BODY:
The average Brazilian earns $4,718 a year, or slightly more than the $4,542 earned by the average Costa Rican. But who is really better off when the average Costa Rican lives longer, is better educated and enjoys cleaner water and better sanitation than a Brazilian?
The United Nations gives a clear answer. Its latest Human Development Index gives Costa Rica a score of .852 out of a possible 1.000, while Brazil gets only .730. 
 The index, published in a report this week by the United Nations Human Development Program, assigns Costa Rica a higher score because it has been more successful than Brazil at translating national wealth into higher living standards for its citizens, mainly by distributing it more evenly and spending it on projects that benefit more people.
Since 1990, Mahbub ul-Haq, an economist and former Pakistani Finance Minister who now works for the program, has been striving though the annual human development reports to remind the world that the real goal of development is not building impressive factories, dams and highways but insuring that individuals lead fuller lives and enjoy more choices.
The introduction of new industries often improves the living standards of people who work in them. But economic growth does not automatically translate into higher living standards, as many of the estimated one billion people in the world living below the poverty level know.
 
Index of Happiness
 Dr. Haq's Human Development Index can be viewed as a measure of human happiness based on life expectancy, educational standards and individual purchasing power. It shows what countries are doing to meet their people's basic needs: keeping them healthy, raising educational standards and helping them earn the income needed to make choices.
Among industrialized countries, Japan scores 0.983 and replaces Canada as the leading nation because of a surge in personal disposable income. Canada is rated second, followed by Norway, Switzerland and Sweden.
The United States lands in sixth place with 0.976, but the report observes a broad gap between the living standards of white Americans and those of other races.
Some developing countries, like Barbados and Uruguay, score higher than more-industrialized nations like Hungary, Bulgaria, Portugal and Poland. At the very bottom of the human development index are the poorest African countries, among them Somalia, Gambia, Mali, Guinea and Sierra Leone, where only a very few enjoy what wealth there is.
 
Income vs. Development
 This year's report shows no automatic link between a country's per-capita gross national product and its level of human development. Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Tanzania and Uruguay, for example, rank far higher in human development than they do in per capita income, suggesting that they are doing a good job "translating their income into the lives of their people."
But citizens of Algeria, Gabon, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates lead less satisfactory lives than their countries' per capita income suggests they should, indicating that their wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few or is being misspent.
The report also indicates that no country treats its women as well as its men, although such inequities are not figured into the human development index itself. When the ratings are adjusted for disparities between the sexes, some countries fall sharply. Japan drops from first to 17th place and Canada from second to 11th, because women in those countries, like women in most nations, have fewer job opportunities and lower earnings than men.
In the developing world, the greatest disparities between men and women are in jobs, health care, nutrition and education.
Levels of human development can vary from state to state or from region to region within one country. In India, for example, the score for the state of Uttar Pradesh is one-third lower than the national average. The rating for the Mexican state of Oaxaca is 20 percent below the national average.
 
'Trickle Down' Economics
 The notion that global development efforts should be more closely tailored to the needs of individual human beings did not originate with the United Nations Development Program, whose chief mission is promoting the transfer of technology to developing countries.
As far back as 1973, Robert McNamara, who was then president of the World Bank, argued against the concept that the fruits of industrial growth would automatically "trickle down" to the poorest sectors of society. At an annual meeting of the bank in Nairobi, he asserted that help must be funneled directly to the 800 million people across the globe who were estimated then to be living in absolute poverty. "They do not contribute to economic growth, nor do they benefit from it," he said.
In its 1990 World Development Report, the World Bank urged nations to assign a higher priority to health care and education for the poor so that impoverished citizens could capitalize on their own ability to work.
Dr. Haq's work has not been free of controversy. Earlier human development reports contained a "freedom index" ranking countries by the personal liberties of their citizens. Such ratings were strongly protested by developing countries, which were concerned that future aid would be linked to democratic reforms.
 
Benefitting Ordinary People
 Seizing on the collapse of Communism and an increase in the number of countries holding multiparty elections, the Human Development Report argues for a new strategy aimed at insuring that economic development benefits ordinary people, and not just governments and power elites.
"People today have an urge -- an impatient urge -- to participate in the events and processes that shape their lives," the report says. Properly harnessed, this urge can become "a source of tremendous vitality and innovation."
In a foreword to the report, the program's administrator, William Draper, argues that "many of today's struggles are more than struggles for access to political power."
"They are struggles for access to the ordinary opportunities of life -- land, water, work, living space and basic social services," he writes.
The report calls for a "people-centered world order" based on new principles. Security should be redefined as security for people rather than for states, and achieved through development instead of arms, the document suggests. Global military spending has declined by $240 billion since 1987, two million soldiers have been demobilized and defense industries are expected to reduce their work forces by one quarter by 1998.
 
Retooling Defense Budgets
 Such savings should be channeled into human development projects, the report says, including the retraining of those workers and the conversion of military industry.
The report also calls for more investment in education, deregulation of business and aid to small enterprises to reverse a trend in which economies keep expanding without creating new jobs.
Governments should promote efficiency in markets as a way of raising individual living standards, the report said, and power should be decentralized, especially in the developing world.
While a quarter or more of total government spending is in the hands of city or regional authorities in the most developed countries, the figure is 10 percent or less in the third world.
Western development aid should be overhauled so that it no longer reflects cold war priorities, the report says. Rather than funneling half of all direct assistance to Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines and El Salvador, for example, the United States should spread its aid more widely and put a new emphasis on advancing human development in the poorest countries, the document suggests.

HEADLINE: DIPLOMATS ARRIVE IN HAITI FOR TALKS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 22

 BODY:
In a push to finalize an agreement on deploying an international police force in Haiti, envoys of the Clinton Administration and the United Nations arrived here today for talks with the country's military leaders.
For two weeks, diplomats have described the planned deployment of about 500 foreign police officers in Haiti as a crucial final element to reaching a negotiated settlement to this country's political crisis, which began with a violent coup against the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September 1991. 
The drive to deploy the police force, led by the United Nations mediator for Haiti, Dante Caputo, and President Clinton's special adviser on Haitian affairs, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, has been repeatedly delayed, however, by negotiations with Father Aristide, many of whose supporters are opposed to any armed international presence in Haiti.
Diplomats also had to counter strong opposition by many of the exiled President's foes here in Haiti, who have campaigned against the deployment with strongly nationalist slogans recalling a 19-year American occupation earlier this century.
In an open letter to Father Aristide, his former planning minister, Renaud Bernadin, warned this week that the police force was offered by an American hand bathed in "the blood of the people," and was a poisoned pill aimed at giving President Aristide "the image of a national sell-out."
At the same time, a sworn opponent of Father Aristide, Marc Bazin, the country's de facto prime minister, denounced the planned deployment as part of a campaign by industrialized countries to subjugate Haiti rather than to restore democracy.
In face of this opposition, diplomats involved in seeking Father Aristide's return have warned of the high costs of rejecting the police deployment, which is intended to help end a climate of widespread violence, restore the Haitian police and set the stage for the formation of a new government that would lead to Father Aristide's return.
For Father Aristide, who diplomats say accepted the deployment only after repeatedly pushing for clarifications over its role, the implicit penalty of rejection would have been having Haiti shift from being a subject of high-priority international diplomacy to a country whose problems would soon be perceived as intractable and relatively minor in comparison with other world crises.
 
Haiti Faces New Sanctions
 For Haiti's military leaders and the civilian government they installed, however, diplomats say, the price of rejection of the plan would be harsh new economic sanctions, and the possibility of losing amnesty protections offered by President Aristide as part of the settlement.
For the Clinton Administration, which has committed itself to providing police and other personnel as well as large amounts of foreign aid under the United Nations-led effort, the cost of any failure could be high, particularly after repeated statements of confidence from Secretary of State Warren Christopher and others in Washington in recent weeks.
Even while diplomats have sought to reassure people here that the international police presence is not an armed intervention in disguise, as some have contended, there have been increasingly clear warnings of strong punitive actions should the deployment be rejected.
"There are limits to the patience of the new Administration and they are making it clear they will have to be respected here," said one diplomat who is close to the negotiations. "If not, they have made it clear that they are willing to impose some real pain."
Despite increasingly clear warnings, many Haitians have revealed a hard shell of skepticism about the international community's ability or willingness to impose a solution on a bitterly divided nation of stark class differences and weak institutions.
"Whether they want it to succeed or not, nobody here will take this thing seriously until it actually happens," said one former Government official. "There is a feeling that we have seen all of this before, from the good cop-bad cop diplomacy to the shuttle missions."

HEADLINE: Balance-Beam Politics: Giuliani's Second Try

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Time warp alert: Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for Mayor, was standing (looking like a G-man in a tidy dark suit), beneath a subway trestle late one night last week while several police officers swung their nightsticks, shuffled their shiny shoes and shouted over the roar of a passing train: "Heyya. Rudy. Anything for you! Yeah." and "Rudy! Hey! I gotta get your autograph for my kid!"
Mr. Giuliani, his wire-framed glasses glinting in the yellow pool of a street light, nodded warmly but continued an intense out-of-earshot discussion with a pallid assistant district attorney wearing a scruffy suit and (no kidding) a dark fedora.
 
A Thoroughly Modern Campaign
 New York. New York. Visuals from the 1930's notwithstanding, the scene beneath the train tracks was part of a thoroughly modern moment in a thoroughly modern mayoral campaign. 
 Behind the candidate, the Council of the Jewish Organizations of Borough Park was letting out, spilling hundreds of Hasidic men in drab suits and dark hats into the cool spring air while their wives -- who were segregated behind a screen during the meal and the address by Mr. Giuliani -- gathered up their skirts and pocketbooks and said their fond goodbyes.
Hours earlier, Mr. Giuliani had met with some of the city's most powerful Jewish business and religious leaders at a dinner in midtown.
And the next morning he would stand on the steps of City Hall -- on Mayor David N. Dinkins's doorstep, if you will -- to clasp hands with a dozen or so black Republicans and welcome their support. At other times last week the candidate ate kimchi and listened to a Korean tenor sing Italian opera, and did a "flying drop by," in the words of his communications director, Richard Bryers, at an event held by the Hispanic Federation.
"This is not an election about race," any staff member of the Giuliani campaign will tell you. It is, they say, a thoroughly modern campaign about bringing the city together.
But in New York, that does mean it's about race, and ethnicity, and cultural differences and even who marches with whom in city parades.
 
Lost by 2 Percentage Points
 Rudolph William Giuliani lost his bid for Mayor by two percentage points in 1989. The former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who had gone after such financial luminaries as Ivan Boesky, had turned down an offer from the Reagan Administration to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, and had sidestepped an approach to head the F.B.I., the jut-jawed tough guy whose record was described in New York magazine in 1987 as "probably unmatched in the distinguished history of the office," lost to the man he now hopes to unseat.
He now says he was ready to govern then, to balance a $30 billion budget and put together a team that could handle any crisis. But he was not ready, he conceded, for the quirky realities of campaigning in a city of more than seven million, for the pounding debates, the complexities and the balancing acts that every good New York City campaign entails.
"I didn't even really start running last time until August," Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday while driving from Brooklyn to Manhattan and one last late-night meeting with his political strategist, David Garth. Last time, he said, he did not make up his mind to run until some time in late March or early April. It took him another four or five months to get his team in place. This time, he said, he knew he would run on the evening of his narrow defeat, Nov. 7, 1989.
 
Already Running Hard
 So Memorial Day has not even come and gone yet, and Rudy Giuliani is already running hard. He quit his private law practice. He opened a second suite of offices at his campaign headquarters at 355 Lexington Avenue. He has a paid staff of 20 and scores of volunteers. He has more than $3 million in the bank, compared with the $200,000 he had raised by this time four years ago. He has issues advisers and ethnic advisers and media advisers and more. He even has hangers-on. Curtis Sliwa, the controversial head of the controversial Guardian Angels, follows in the candidate's wake, wearing his trademark windbreaker and red beret.
So oiled is this machine that Mr. Giuliani has even ordered posters aimed at Hispanic voters that are identical to those printed in English (RUDY!), with but one subtle yet significant change, the inverted exclamation point that appears in Spanish: RUDY!
At a midweek lunch in Manhattan, two of Mr. Giuliani's staff members complained about a headline in The New York Times that emphasized the results of a poll that showed a deep divide in voting preferences among black and white New Yorkers. They reiterated the campaign's basic point, that this is not a race about race and said that to depict it as such is needlessly inflammatory.
But moments later Mr. Bryers pointed to a chart printed alongside the poll results. It showed 48 percent of black Protestants backing Andrew Stein over Mr. Giuliani, whom the poll showed with 24 percent of that population's vote. "We can work with that," said Mr. Bryers, presumably indicating that if Mr. Stein were not to run, those were voters who could move to the Giuliani column.
The conversation turned to the difficulty some voters have with Mr. Giuliani's name, which spelled phonetically would be something like: JOO-lee-ah-nee. Kenneth Frydman, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary (who pronounces his name FREED-man), placed a notebook on the table. "We'd really rather have the pronouncer spelled like this," he said, then scribbled: "JEWLIANI."
In a city filled with neighborhoods, clubs and social groups that often define themselves by race, religion and ethnicity it is, perhaps, impossible to run a campaign in which the theme of race is absent.
Yet Mr. Giuliani tries. At business luncheons and fund-raising dinners he walks gingerly around the topic -- even when asked direct questions about it. His news releases speak of a "multiparty fusion movement" that proposes to be blind to partisan politics and issues of race, ethnicity and anything else that goes beyond the simple question of whether a candidate has enough of a moral compass to lead.
 
Three Basic Facts
 At stop after stop he tells his listeners that it does not matter if they are white or black, gay or straight. He says, instead, that New Yorkers' rights are basic rights built on three basic facts. "What matters," he said Thursday night at a fund-raiser in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, "is that we are human, that we are Americans and that we are New Yorkers. That is where we get our basic rights."
But first, a man in the front row had made the whole hall ring with laughter when, after the candidate ticked off the special-interest groups that he said wanted special treatment (blacks, gays, Jews, Hispanics, Pakistanis and on and on), the man yelled out: "Hey! Rudy! I'm Arab! You left us out!"
The candidate missed a beat and his already pale face went to a lighter shade of pale beneath his plastered-down dark hair, then he laughed, too, and shrugged as though to say, "See what I mean?"
It is a serious business, though, this business of not alienating anyone in a city in which no one likes to feel left out. Mr. Dinkins promised to bring everyone into an urban "mosaic" in which each group would have a place of its own honor.
That message still resonates. And it is one that Mr. Giuliani has adopted, using it now against its originator, subtly alluding to the racial and ethnic strife that has occasionally flared in Mr. Dinkins's tenure.
Since the mayor is black, the touchiness over the issue extends to the doors of Gracie Mansion, making it a delicate matter to raise without threat of a backfire. Mr. Giuliani's staffers grouse that when the Republican candidate attacked Mr. Dinkins for being bad at math, the Dinkins campaign responded that the comment was a barely veiled racial slur. The Giuliani staff vehemently denies that the remark had any such overtones and fires back that the Dinkins administration was intentionally quick on the draw.
 
Trying to Out-Dinkins Dinkins
 So Mr. Giuliani must try to out-Dinkins Mr. Dinkins. He made a step toward that goal Friday with his announcement that Susan D. Alter, a Democratic councilwoman from Brooklyn, had joined his ticket to run for City Council President.
Since Ms. Alter and her husband, Gilbert Klaperman, an influential rabbi from Long Island, were among the first prominent Jewish political figures to back Mr. Dinkins in 1989, the departure had to have hit particularly hard. "It was a beautiful hope," Ms. Alter said of Mr. Dinkins's promises of 1989. But now, she said, she places that hope with Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani has reached out, too, to Herman Badillo, a Democrat, whom he hopes to back as Comptroller. Mr. Badillo, however, is taking his time with that decision. Political fusion may work in news releases, but he is leery of burning his party bridges.
It is difficult, with all these pressures, to keep the voters' eyes on issues. It is also difficult to frame them for an audience that includes some of the most powerful and well-educated voters in the country.
At a luncheon Thursday, Mr. Giuliani spoke at length, and in detail, about the city's economic situation, its crime problems and the city schools. As the main speaker at a meeting of the Citizens Budget Commission at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, he faced an audience of stockbrokers, business leaders, economists and financiers.
Outlining a plan to reduce the city government's size, he made comparisons with the budget of 10 years ago and said the city needed to trim its personnel by 3 to 5 percent "across the board" through attrition in government jobs. "New York City has to get control of its expenditures," he said, then ticked off several examples of how to do so.
 
A Demanding Audience
 The speech was both smooth and professional. But his audience was hard. Several men chatted about Mr. Giuliani's performance and his proposals as they left. They were not kind.
"You don't freeze across the board," said a man wearing a perfectly tailored pin-striped suit and a pair of tortoise shell glasses. "You have to target your freezes. At least we have learned that."
Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, has learned how difficult it is to run for the top job in a city that includes voters who get their night's sleep on hot-air grates as well as the men and women who run some of the largest corporations in the world.
"Last time, I think I didn't really appreciate how hard it is," Mr. Giuliani said reflectively. "It's New York. It's a tough city."
He has learned, though, to start early and play tough. So from one stop to the next, from Hasidic neighborhoods to Hispanic festivals, black churches to Fifth Avenue cocktail parties with the city's WASP elite, he spreads his message and his name. As he quipped recently, "I'm like the movie trailer: 'Coming soon to your neighborhood -- maybe next week.' "
He has not formally announced his candidacy. That will come in time. Meanwhile, he is working on his slate, repeating his warnings that education is about "reading, writing, arithmetic and computer training," and reminding any New Yorker who will listen that this election is not about race. Really.

HEADLINE: How a Tax Change Could Help Small Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding Amar Bhide's article (Viewpoints, May 9), I agree with Government's inability to help small business. My experience shows how Government hurts but suggests how it could also help.
Back in, I think, 1981, the I.R.S. rules for paying estimated corporate taxes were changed to require acceleration of the prepayment of those estimated taxes. Formerly the rule for prepayment was something like "at least 80 percent of the next year's estimate, but no greater than you paid in the preceding year." It meant that a fast-track company with a low income base could defer its payments. This change was all part of a process to accelerate the payment of taxes. However, the change siphoned funds from all fast-track companies. 
 Consider an emerging company with zero or low income in one year and rapid growth the next. Under the changed rule, my own company (tripling in sales each year) had to prepay more than $1 million of taxes each year -- a direct reduction of the working capital we needed to expand the business.
Restoration of this procedure might well be one of the few things that Government could do to help emerging companies.

HEADLINE: Does Bond Buying Really Show Confidence?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Like President Clinton, Floyd Norris is incorrect on two counts when he reads the willingness to buy long-term bonds as "no better indication of confidence of a society in its industrial and financial system" (Market Watch, May 9). Two headlines in The New York Times that day -- "Confidence in Clinton Is Slipping Among Many Business Leaders" and "Three Decades of Dwindling Hope for Prosperity -- Monthly Surveys Mask a Deep Gloom" -- challenge his assessment. 
 Witness, good news on the economy, output or job creation causes bond market downturns and pulls down the equity markets because of fears of rising interest rates. In the 1980's, analysts and commentators began using the phrase "Good news is bad and bad news is good" to describe causes for market moves.
Mr. Norris implies that investors in long-term bonds hold them to maturity, hence their economic value. But surely the days of wealthy individuals and funds investing in 30-year bonds and "clipping coupons" are long gone. Today's underwriters typically re-engineer such bonds, stripping their principal and interest features, repackage them and/or use the bonds as trading vehicles.
Economists will quibble. But as your other headlines indicate and various Government surveys report, investor and consumer confidence on Wall Street and Main Street is worrisomely negative on the ability of companies to expand earnings and create jobs.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Have Different Balkan Aims

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"While Europe Stalls . . . " (editorial, May 12) states that it is a "mystery" why the governments of Western Europe are unwilling to take any action to assist the United States in the Bosnian crisis. I do not believe there is any mystery; the governments of Western Europe simply do not share a common interest with the Unites States in resolving this crisis.
The crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Without a central Yugoslav government to mediate disputes among Serbs, Croats and Muslims, civil war became virtually inevitable. This was particularly true in Bosnia, where more than half the population is composed of Serbs and Croats, but Muslims control the government. 
 Much of the blame for the collapse of Yugoslavia lies with the governments of Western Europe, principally Germany. The European Community, led by Germany, rushed headlong to accord recognition to the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia without any consideration to the bloody civil war that was the inevitable consequence of the breakup of Yugoslavia. It should not come as any mystery that the governments of Western Europe are now unwilling to remedy the disaster for which they are, in large measure, responsible.
What was the interest of the European Community in helping foster the disintegration of Yugoslavia? I believe it was simple economic self-interest. "East Europe's Low Wages Luring Manufacturers From West Europe"(front page, May 11), about the vast investments Western European manufacturers are making throughout Eastern Europe. Since the collapse of Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Croatia have followed in the paths of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as economic colonies of Western European (principally German) financial interests.
The only long-term solution to the Bosnia crisis is to re-establish a stable national government in Yugoslavia, and that is precisely what the European Community has no desire to see. Thus, Western Europe is content to do nothing or allow the United States alone to become militarily embroiled in the Bosnian civil war.
This does not mean the United States should give up efforts to end the Bosnian tragedy. However, our efforts should not focus narrowly on opposition to the Bosnian Serbs; the Bosnian Croats have demonstrated that Bosnian Serbs have no monopoly on the practice of "ethnic cleansing." Rather, our objective should be re-establishment of a stable, legitimate Yugoslav government recognized by all parties, capable of restoring law and order to the region.
Our ally in this should not be the European Community, but Russia. It is the one country in the world that has the power, influence and credibility to overcome the influence and fears of extreme Serbian nationalists, thereby bringing about a lasting solution to the Yugoslavia conflict.
The crisis in Bosnia and the conduct of the European Community in resisting efforts to resolve it may be the harbinger of a new era in America's relationship with Europe. With the end of the cold war, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become largely irrelevant. The principal concern for the United States is no longer Soviet military expansion, but economic competition. In this new global context, the expansion of Western European -- once again, principally German -- economic influence through Eastern Europe is cause for concern for the United States.
It may be time not merely for peaceful coexistence with Russia, but even outright alliance. Such an alliance would provide a valuable counterweight to expanding German economic influence in Eastern Europe and would enable the United States and Russia to accelerate the dismantling of the bloated military establishments largely responsible for sapping the economies of both.
The Bosnian crisis gives President Clinton an opportunity to consider a radical redirection of American foreign policy in the post-cold war era. It may also allow Mr. Clinton to solve the conundrum of having to deal with international crises while still remembering that "It's the economy, stupid."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Feeding Pigeons
 
Question: I live in a co-op on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. An elderly woman who rents in the building on the 18th floor throws a bag of bird seed from her window each morning; it lands on the roof of a five-story building. Each morning, pigeons swarm in the area awaiting their next meal. This is disturbing, since the birds leave their droppings on my window. I believe that this is also a health violation. 
 I contacted the management office. The woman was spoken to and a letter was sent to her. However, she continues her daily feeding. Management now says it is my responsibility.
I am sure that there is a law about throwing things out of your window. I would also think it would include feeding pigeons.
I would like to know what further actions can be taken to stop this woman. I also would appreciate it if you could inform me if is it my responsibility to act. . . . M. Landau, Manhattan
 
Answer: According to Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer, the building's property lease and house rules do not apply to nonpurchasing tenants if their apartments are rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.
Accordingly, he said, the building's ability to act in this case is severely limited.
Mr. Weinstein suggested that you might, however, be able to get the appropriate New York City department to take enforcement action against the violations of New York City law. In this case, the appropriate department would be the Department of Health. To complain, call (212) 442-1999.
"Technically, it is against the law," said Steven Matthews, a spokesman for the Department of Health. "It's considered to be creating a public health violation because it constitutes littering and creates the potential for attracting vermin."
 
Surcharges for Pets
 
Question: I live as a renting tenant in a stabilized apartment in a nonevict co-op building. Recently, the board sent everyone a letter regarding a pet policy that would require everyone to register their pets and would assess each pet owner a surcharge of $100 per dog to establish a special dog fund.
In addition, the letter set forth fines starting at $150 and increasing in increments of $50 for any dirtying around the perimeter of the building. Furthermore, the letter restricts our access to one entrance and exit of the building.
Is there any recourse available for senior citizens living in the building who would be forced to give up their pets?
More importantly, is this legal? . . . Victor E. Gramigna, Manhattan
 
Answer: No, it is not legal. According to Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the state Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, such surcharges and fee structures can be imposed on the co-op owners but not on the renters living in rent-regulated apartments.
"The tenants are either entitled to have pets, or they are not and that's stated in their lease," he said. "There can be no additional charges."
He added that if a dog were a nuisance, the only recourse for aggrieved residents would be to seek an eviction of the tenant who owned the animal.
 
Setting a Price Floor
 
Question: Recently, the board in my co-op rejected a buyer because they felt that the selling price of the apartment was too low. Assuming the buyer met all other criteria, wouldn't this be considered illegal interference between buyer and seller? . . . H. Troy, Manhattan
 
Answer: Maybe. According to Bruce D. Friedberg, a Manhattan lawyer, a board has to state why the buyer was rejected, and a rejection because the offer was too low cannot occur unless the board has amended its by-laws and set a minimum price on shares.
"Generally," he added, "they can only reject a buyer on financial or credit-type issues and residence issues, not a minimum price."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 6, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A response to a question in the Q & A column on May 23 about a co-op board's rejection of a potential buyer without explanation referred incorrectly to the board's obligations. A board is not obliged to give a reason for rejection.

HEADLINE: Hope and Violence as Cambodian Election Begins

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Sunday, May 23

 BODY:
After decades of oppression that have brought genocidal terror, wrenching poverty and a civil war, the future of Cambodia may finally be decided by the millions who have suffered quietly for so long and who are being invited today to vote.
As the voting began at 8 A.M., there were no reports of violence, although United Nations peacekeepers held to their prediction of attacks by the Khmer Rouge, the Maoist rebels who have threatened to sabotage the six-day election. United Nations military observers said there was fighting Saturday night between the rebels and Government soldiers in some areas of the northern countryside. 
 Here in the capital, voters turned out by the tens of thousands in an early morning drizzle for the chance to vote -- for most of Cambodia's 4.7 million registered voters, the first chance in their lives to pick their own government. Cambodians say it is a sign of good fortune when it rains on an important day.
Soy Sina, a retired tailor, lined up an hour and a half before the voting booths opened.
"I came early because I want peace to come very fast to Cambodia," she said, clutching the laminated United Nations voting card that displayed her photograph and signature. "I did not think it would be dangerous to vote because I knew the United Nations would protect us." Several feet away, a peacekeeping soldier from Ghana paced nervously, his hands tight around an M-16 rifle.
The threat that some voters would face violence was underscored on Saturday when two Chinese soldiers with the United Nations force were killed in an early morning raid in central Cambodia. The United Nations blamed the Khmer Rouge for the attack.
Elsewhere on the eve of the voting, at least one man died when the offices of an opposition political party were attacked with grenades in the central province of Kratie, and United Nations electoral officials renewed their warning that polling stations might become the targets of Khmer Rouge rockets.
"I want to vote," said Srei On, a 28-year-old farmer. "Everybody in my family wants to vote, even though we will be afraid." With her husband, Mrs. Srei On tries to grow rice and mangos on a plot of scrubby land in the central province of Kompong Cham, where the Khmer Rouge have stationed thousands of fighters and where the two Chinese peacekeepers were killed.
Twenty political parties are on the ballot to pick a 120-member national assembly, which will be charged with writing a new constitution. But the election is expected to come down to a contest between the governing Cambodian People's Party and the royalist opposition party founded by the nation's former monarch, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
If the governing party is victorious, it is likely to intensify its military campaign against the Khmer Rouge.
Prince Sihanouk, who at 70 is without doubt the most beloved figure in Cambodia, claims neutrality in the elections and has turned over leadership of the royalist party to his eldest son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 49. The party is known as Funcinpec, the French acronym for the National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia.
If the party wins the election, Prince Ranariddh is expected to ask his father to form a coalition government that might include the Khmer Rouge -- despite the movement's murderous past. When the Khmer Rouge controlled the Government from 1975 to 1979, more than one million Cambodians died from starvation, disease and execution as the Khmer Rouge tried to force Cambodia back to an agrarian "Year Zero."
 
Prince Sihanouk Returns
 At the urging of the United Nations, Prince Sihanouk returned home on Saturday from Beijing, where he maintains a home and where he is said to have been receiving medical treatment for several weeks.
"I am very happy to be with my people," he said on his arrival at Phnom Penh's international airport. "Really, they need me. I am very happy to be with them to support the electoral process, to support the new democracy."
United Nations peacekeepers say that while they predict violence during the six-day election that begins today, they still expect to be able to set up polling stations in at least 80 percent of the country. Most Cambodians live in the southern half of the country, which has been comparatively peaceful. The vote count is supposed to be completed by the end of next week.
"We have the minimum acceptable conditions for free and fair elections -- not the maximum, far from it," said Yasushi Akashi, the head of the 22,000-member, $2 billion peacekeeping force in Cambodia, on which the United Nations has staked its prestige. It is the biggest peacekeeping operation in United Nations history.
"But we can feel there is a deep and widespread aspiration among the Cambodian people for peace," Mr. Akashi said in a meeting on Saturday with reporters. "Cambodians must now try to become masters of their own country."
United Nations officials say that if the election is free and fair -- and if Cambodia's political parties live up to their promise to accept the results -- the nation's new masters will be the voters who, despite Khmer Rouge threats of violence, turn out to cast ballots this week.
 
Most Have Never Voted Before
 Most of the registered voters, indeed most of Cambodia's eight million people, are small farmers whose belongings rarely include much beyond a small patch of land, a house of sticks and palm leaves and perhaps a cow and a few chickens. They are among the poorest people on earth.
Most have never voted before, and until the United Nations arrived here as part of a 1991 peace treaty, they were largely unfamiliar with multiparty democracy or secret balloting. Most Cambodians are illiterate, so the logos of Cambodia's 20 political parties will be printed on the ballot.
The outcome is likely to come down to whether Cambodian voters accept the idea tht they enjoy a free choice -- an elusive concept among people whose survival has often depended on their absolute obedience to authority.
The village of Malua in the central province of Kompong Speu, about 40 miles southwest of Phnom Penh, is a sad collection of several dozen palm-leaf huts, the leaves cracked and faded from the unrelenting sun.
There, the villagers say without hesitation that they will vote for the Cambodian People's Party, the party of Prime Minister Hun Sen. It is difficult to know whether they are telling the truth or whether they feel that it is simply too dangerous to acknowledge that they support someone else.
The Cambodian People's Party has conducted a large-scale campaign of intimidation, often gathering voters together in small groups in the countryside to warn them that their ballots will not be secret and that they face retaliation if they vote against the governing party. In some provinces the party has been linked to the slayings of opposition leaders.
 
'They Saved Us'
 "Of course we will vote for the Cambodian People's Party," said Noy Hou, 38, who struggles to raise corn in the dry red soil of the village, and whose one-room home is decorated with a small calendar with photographs of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the party chairman, Chea Sim. "The People's Party is our party -- they saved us from the Khmer Rouge."
Her husband, Sat Seun, 40, leaning back on a frayed bamboo mat, said he believed the governing party's assertion that the royalists were in a secret alliance with the Khmer Rouge and would help return the Khmer Rouge to power in Cambodia. "I think Funcinpec and the Khmer Rouge are the same thing," he said.
At a Funcinpec office a few miles down the rutted dirt road from Malua, a party organizer, Han Sou Pheap, said that while many Cambodians supported the party, they dared not admit it.
"Only a few people will tell you the truth," said Mr. Han Sou Pheap, who said he had received several visits from armed Government soldiers who had threatened to burn down the office or spray it with gunfire unless he took down photographs of Prince Sihanouk.
Cambodia is a victim of geography, squeezed between two historically voracious, much larger neighbors, Vietnam and Thailand. It was colonized by France in the 19th century, and during World War II, its Vichy French administrators passed over the likeliest candidate for the throne and selected a teen-age prince, Norodom Sihanouk, to be the nation's new King.
 
Coup, Then Communist Victory
 Prince Sihanouk eventually won full independence for Cambodia and ruled the country until 1970, when he was overthrown in a coup led by his Prime Minister, Gen. Lon Nol. Cambodia became a battlefield as the Vietnam War spilled over the border, and in 1975 the Lon Nol Government, like the South Vietnamese Government, fell to Communist forces.
The Communist leader in Cambodia, Pol Pot of the Khmer Rouge, then launched a peasant revolution intended to turn this nation into a giant agricultural commune. He plunged Cambodia into a reign of terror from which its people have not recovered.
In 1979 the Khmer Rouge were overthrown by the Vietnamese Army, and Pol Pot and his forces fled back into the jungle, where they regrouped as insurgents and launched a civil war against the Government installed by Vietnam. That Government remains in power today, now led by Mr. Hun Sen, a Khmer Rouge commander who defected to Vietnam in the 1970's.
Pol Pot remains the supreme leader of the Khmer Rouge and is said to be living in jungle camps in western Cambodia. In 1991 the Khmer Rouge joined in the United Nations-brokered peace treaty for Cambodia but withdrew last year, asserting that thousands of Vietnamese troops remained in Cambodia.
The fear of what the elections may bring was most evident Saturday in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, the scene of almost continuous fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian Army since the treaty was signed in October 1991.
 
Violence Feared in Siem Reap
 The rattle of gunfire and the rumble of nighttime shelling have been routine for weeks. United Nations military officials say Siem Reap is one of the provinces most likely to be attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas during the voting. Peacekeeping troops assigned to the provincial capital, also called Siem Reap, stationed themselves on Saturday in makeshift bunkers in Buddhist temples, known as wats, which will be used as polling places.
Keng Borin, 28, an unemployed laborer in Siem Reap who is one of nearly 370,000 Cambodian refugees who returned home from border camps in Thailand over the last year under the auspices of the United Nations, wondered again what sort of country he had come home to.
"In Phnom Penh, people think there will be peace after the elections," he said. "In Siem Reap, everyone thinks that after the elections the fighting will begin again."
In the village of Somrong Year, on the outskirts of the city of Siem Reap, Yuit Sinni, 33, said she had abandoned her home in the city earlier this month because of the constant threat of Khmer Rouge attacks. "I do not sleep easily now because I am afraid the Khmer Rouge will come during elections," she said. "I will vote, for Hun Sen because he helped liberate us from Pol Pot and kept Pol Pot away."
In the southern Cambodian province of Kampot, unidentified gunmen ambushed a train on Saturday, killing three people.
But the graceful, tree-lined streets of the Cambodian capital were notably calm on the eve of the elections, though many of the capital's residents still feared violence. Hundreds of Buddhist monks and nuns, some from as far away as the United States, marched down a major thoroughfare, many clutching bundles of incense wrapped in jasmine garlands, while others held signs that read in Khmer, "Please, Peace Come to Cambodia."
Crowds lined the street to welcome the procession.

Although 20 parties will be on the ballot, the transition leading to Cambodia's elections has been dominated by a handful of politicians and rebel leaders:
 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the nation's monarch and titular head of state. He is believed to be ready to form a coalition government if Funcinpec, the party led by his son, is victorious in the election.
 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the United Front for an Independent, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia, known by the French acronym Funcinpec. The party has called for the creation of a coalition government that could include the Khmer Rouge. Its chief promise is an end to the 14-year civil war.
 
Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party, the newly created party of the Vietnamese-installed Government. It has suggested that it would use victory at the polls to destroy the Khmer Rouge once and for all.
 
Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge rebel movement, which presided over the deaths of more than a million people in a brutal restructuring of society in the 1970's. The Khmer Rouge have withdrawn from the peace process, are boycotting the election and have threatened to sabotage the voting with violence. (pg. 10)

HEADLINE: Clinton Jabs Democratic Critics Of His Budget and Tax Package

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STRATHAM, N.H., May 22

 BODY:
Striking back at Democratic Senators who have challenged his budget and tax package, President Clinton today accused them of protecting wealthy special interests and buckling under to "the big oil lobby."
Mr. Clinton's unusually sharp remarks against members of his own party, made in his weekly radio address, were directed at the centrist Democrats who have bolted from party ranks to try to revise the President's budget and tax package. 
 Two weeks after Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had allowed other issues to distract him from working on the economy, he strove today to keep the public's attention on his plan for revival. As his foreign policy team announced an international strategy to curb the killing in Bosnia, the President traveled to New Hampshire Technical College here to speak at commencement.
In his radio address on the economy, he did not mention any Senators by name, but his comments appeared directed mostly at Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, a state dominated by the oil industry. Mr. Boren has put forward a plan that would eliminate the energy tax proposed by Mr. Clinton and instead restrict the growth of welfare programs and health benefits to the poor and elderly.
 
'It's Simply Wrong'
 Mr. Boren's efforts have won praise from other centrist Democrats who fear that the "New Democrat" President has come to look like an old-style liberal. [Article, page 20.]
"It's simply wrong for a powerful interest to try and opt out of this program by asking the elderly and the working poor to contribute more so they can contribute less," Mr. Clinton said on the radio. "Making middle America pay more may be business as usual in Washington, but to the rest of the nation it must be unjust, unfair and unacceptable."
Declaring that he would not back down, Mr. Clinton added: "I regret that otherwise good and responsible legislators would even consider this proposal. But I will fight it."
Despite his comments promoting his economic plan, Mr. Clinton was repeatedly reminded of less weighty troubles that have dogged him in the last week -- from the abrupt dismissal of the longtime White House travel office to the expensive haircut he got on board Air Force One in Los Angeles the other day.
The plane carrying the press to the commencement speech -- the first trip out since everyone in the travel office was dismissed -- was stuck on the runway for two hours because of a fuel problem. And a sign displayed outside a shop here proclaimed: "Mr. President, Our Haircuts Cost $12."
And as he left the college, where he made a lower-key appeal for his energy tax, it was clear that not everyone bought Mr. Clinton's pitch that new taxes were vital to his economic plan.
He found himself in a heated exchange with a man who told him: "No more taxes. We're sick of taxes. We're taxed enough."
The President's response suggested he thought the man was a Republican: "You won't listen to the election. After the election, your Administration increased the deficit."
The man shot back: "You're a liar. Why don't you go back to Arkansas. Liar. You're a liar."
Mr. Clinton has rarely used language as pointed as that today against members of his own party. By his sharp tone, he demonstrated how seriously he is taking the Democratic threats to abandon his budget and tax plan -- and signaled his determination to aggressively fight efforts to weaken his proposal. The rival plan has also been endorsed by Ross Perot.
Mr. Clinton defended his plan in milder terms at the two-year, state-supported college, emphasizing the need for an energy tax.
Speaking to the 176 graduates and their friends and families under a tent at the school's 48th commencement, Mr. Clinton recalled the financially strapped people he met in New Hampshire during last year's campaign.
"Every day when I get up in the White House and go to the Oval Office to work," he told the students, "I think about the people I met here and people like them all over America whose quiet courage and determination inspires me to keep fighting to restore the middle class and the fundamental strength and purpose of this country."
The President's decision to step up his attack in his radio address came as Mr. Boren, a moderate who has been an ally on Capitol Hill, made clear that he was not reluctant to take on Mr. Clinton and press him to accept a bipartisan compromise.
 
Formula for 'Destruction'
 "I think that if this President were to get his wish of passing this budget right now, exactly like it is," Mr. Boren told The Washington Post on Friday, "it would be the surest formula for the destruction of the Democratic Party and any chance he has for re-election that I have ever seen."
Other Democrats who have endorsed Mr. Boren's compromise are Senators J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, and Bob Kerrey and J. James Exon, both of Nebraska.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said the President thought it was important to underscore that the Boren proposal would shift a greater tax burden to the elderly and working people. "Boren's plan would shift billions of dollars" from working people to rich people, she said, adding that Mr. Clinton "doesn't think that's fair."
Asked why the President was publicly criticizing influential members of his own party, Ms. Myers said, "That's part of the legislative process."
Taking aim at oil companies, Mr. Clinton asserted in the radio address: "Some of my opponents want to cut Social Security and tax credits to working families with incomes of under $30,000 just to get a tax cut for the rich. The big oil lobby is trying to wiggle out of its contribution to deficit reduction and force senior citizens barely above the poverty line to get lower Social Security benefits."
If his package fails, Mr. Clinton warned, "our new and carefully won credibility will crumble as a nation, and interest rates will start to rise again, squeezing out the investments we need to make to grow new jobs."
Mr. Clinton said he decided to deliver the commencement at this small technical college because during the primaries -- when his fortunes were in grave doubt -- a student there, Greg Fuller, asked him to speak this year as President. "And then he wrote me a letter to confirm the request," he said.
The President used the opportunity to promote technical colleges, saying that with their students who "work and study hard," the schools "are really on the cutting edge -- up and down -- of this economy."
After the speech, Mr. Clinton visited some of his old haunts in New Hampshire, including Vachon Restaurant in Manchester, where he ate a cheeseburger and french fries.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Steakhouse in Old Style, in Many Ways

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
STEAKHOUSES are making a comeback. Despite assertions that we are all eating lightly and resisting red meat, the shrines to beef are booming. Witness the recently opened Manhattan Steak House in Cedarhurst.
Diners expecting a big brassy spot complete with gruff waiters will be pleased by the intimate storefront. It soothes with carpeted floors, white tablecloths, creamy walls, subdued landscapes and old-fashioned fixtures with amber lights. Furthermore, the efficient waiters are paragons of amiability. 
 The Manhattan Steak House has more in common with the Big Apple than its name. Its owners, Marinko Glavan and Bruno Peros, worked together at the renowned Sparks Steak House on 46th Street before moving to the Island. They have brought big-city expertise and big-city prices to their new venture.
Long Islanders, lulled by recent recessionary price cutting, may gasp at entrees that begin at $21.50 and go as high as $26.95. Although prices for steak are comparable to those at other steakhouses, there is no inexpensive refuge like chicken, chopped steak or a steak sandwich on the menu.
Still, for diners with deep pockets and traditional tastes, the food is exceptional. A special of glistening, plump, bluepoint oysters on the half shell ($9.50) had veteran oyster eaters proclaiming them the oysters of a lifetime.
Other seafood sparklers were the shrimp cocktail consisting of four firm jumbos surrounding a spirited cocktail sauce, tender baked clams under a sprinkling of crunchy crumbs, tasty shrimp scampi and a special of tiny sweet scallops and crab meat broiled in lemon butter.
The menu's two salads, at $4.50 each, offer a more economical start to the meal. The mixed greens, highlighted with a few tomato wedges and tossed in a lush vinaigrette, were presented on a dinner-size plate.
Equally alluring were the sliced tomatoes and onions. It is not the traditional platter of alternating red and white thick disks paired with a sweet orange dressing, but a mosaic of sliced ruby beauties crowned with rings of red onion. It arrives with the house vinaigrette, or for $1.50 surcharge, a tangy Roquefort dressing sporting chunks of cheese.
Two salad specials also delivered: garlic-strewn roasted red peppers perched atop tomato slices and a plate holding a dozen perfectly cooked asparagus resting on a bed of romaine.
Predictably, steaks are king, and the prime sirloin, with its great beefy flavor and tasty crust, leads the pack. Tops in tenderness are the velvety filet mignon and the melt-in-the-mouth medallions of beef with a Bordelaise sauce rife with sliced mushrooms. The steak fromage with its cheese topping is only for diners with an unstinting love of Roquefort.
All meats were precisely cooked, including a thick center-cut veal chop and three double-rib lamb chops.
Lighter though not smaller was a substantial flaky swordfish steak. Broiled shrimp, six butterflied giants bathed in lemon butter, garlic and thyme, also brought smiles. The lone skimpy entree was a seafood special of four shrimp encircling a small lobster tail. Its price of $26.95 seemed excessive.
A la carte side dishes are not bountiful, either. The hash brown potatoes, spinach and broccoli arrive on saucer-size plates. The green vegetables were perfectly cooked, but underseasoned and boring.
Do not save room for dessert. The cheesecake was dry, and the chocolate mousse cake was commercial. Best one evening was a wedge of ripe Crenshaw melon.
The wine list, like the menu, offers few if any bargains. The 24 table-wine selections average $30 a bottle. The red-blooded 1988 Robert Mondavi cabernet sauvignon ($29) is perfection with steak, and a spirited 1991 Cakebread sauvignon blanc ($24), one of Napa's best white wines, marries well with seafood.

HEADLINE: Airport Takes Steps To Pacify Quaker Group

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of an episode nearly two months ago in which the management of the Westchester County Airport, apparently following a safety directive from the Federal Aviation Administration, clear-cut 10 acres of forest that had previously protected the Society of Friends Meetinghouse in Purchase from the sights and sounds of runway traffic, a meeting was held May 15 at the house to discuss possible landscaping solutions and inform Quakers and residents about future airport plans.
"There is no other issue that is more sensitive than the proposed modernization of this airport," said County Legislator Joseph M. Delfino, a Republican from White Plains. "We're going to have monthly meetings with the Transportation Department so that people can know in advance what will happen at the airport. People need to remember that no one is out to hurt anyone. It's not our intent to disrupt people's lives with the modernization of the airport." 
 He added: "We've got to be sensitive to people and achieve a compromise between running an airport for the economy of Westchester and how to minimize the impact on people. The airport will never go away, and it's a concern of all of us."
As part of an effort to mend fences -- literally and figuratively -- with the members of the Purchase Society of Friends, three officials met with about 35 Quakers and their neighbors at the Meetinghouse. The three were Joel Russell, the Westchester County Airport manager; DaniloMena, the acting commissioner of transportation, and Mr. Delfino.
 
Future Accountability
 Although armed with architectural drawings and artists' renderings of the proposed changes to the airport, the transportation representatives were given a polite but skeptical reception. Explanations were often drowned out by the roar of jets taking off and landing nearby, and many questions concerned environmental- impact issues and governmental accountability.
There are so many levels of government that something will go through the cracks, said Edith Read, an environmentalist for whom the Edith Read Nature Sanctuary in Rye was named. "It's important to have one person involved who is able to stop something going wrong. The public should be involved from the very beginning."
In response to a question about future accountability, Mr. Mena said: "In all honesty, we did not communicate with you soon enough and we feel badly about that. The engineers had come out and surveyed. This was not done arbitrarily, although it may seem to you that way. Every tree that was cut down was done under a permit. Representatives of New York City and New York State were there. Right now I think you're angry and annoyed and I don't blame you."
Mr. Mena added: "Our biggest mistake was that we did not consult with you earlier. Unfortunately, this particular action needed to be done. But there will be no expansion of the airport. We're limited to 692 acres."
 
A Landscaping Plan
 Since Quaker worship depends on a silent, contemplative atmosphere that has increasingly been disrupted by the sounds of airplanes flying overhead on Sunday mornings, a primary concern at the meeting was attaining a remedy that would restore some of the former tranquillity.
"This is an unusually quiet morning," said Jon Berry of Irvington. "It does seem like a lot more planes have been coming over our meeting on Sunday morning, and I worry about the life of the meeting if we can't hear people talk." Joel Russell, however, said a verbal request to change flight patterns for Sunday morning was made to the Federal Aviation Administration about two weeks ago.
An immediate priority for county government and the Quakers is coming up with a landscape design that will offer a barrier to the sights and sounds of the airport. "Our planning department is working feverishly to come up with a landscaping plan," said Mr. Delfino. "We want to do what's right. I want you to feel comfortable that we will do everything humanly possible to restore serenity and tranquillity to this house. I have a personal commitment to this house. We want to have a plan completed in four weeks, but nothing will be done and nothing will be touched until the Friends have their impact."
He added: "I will be on this every week; we're going to try to over-deliver. The planning department has put things aside to do this landscaping plan. We don't have open bank books to transfer 60-foot oaks from Florida, but we'll do everything possible. I would like to believe that if we do put a barrier up and if it is properly shrubbed, that the beauty of the area will be considerably improved. The county has a commitment to satisfying the immediate neighbors and Friends of the house."
 
'I'm Cautious About This'
 Some of those at the meeting were reassured by Mr. Delfino's promises. "I think we'll get our landscaping and our sound barriers," said Deborah Wood, a clerk of the Meeting. "I feel that the county legislators are acting in good faith in working to ameliorate the immediate situation and help prevent future situations."
But others were unconvinced by such assurances. "They say, 'Trust us,' " said Cathy Billone, whose house is next door to the Society of Friends Meetinghouse. "But when I went to planning meetings, they said they weren't going to cut down trees. Five weeks ago, I lived next to an airport and didn't know it because those trees were a buffer. Now I have five cracks in my kitchen floor from the impact of the noise. They're saying that they made a mistake, but their credibility is really shaky."
Added Quaker Fred Feucht, a resident of Pleasantville: "I'm cautious about this. We've been burned and I don't feel a great sense of trust, particularly with the Department of Transportation and airport management."
Similar skepticism was voiced by Marge Schlitt of Hastings-on-Hudson, a member of the Purchase meeting. "The county legislators are aware and sensitive," said Ms. Schlitt. "I'm not yet convinced that the airport administration is as sensitive or aware as they should be."
And for Quaker Dede Carlsten, the proceedings left her with guarded hope for the future. "Maybe they thought that we were buried under the gravestones," Mrs. Carlsten said. "Being a pacifist doesn't mean that we don't fight for what is right."

13TH GEN
Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?
By Neil Howe and Bill Strauss with Ian Williams.
Illustrated by R. J. Matson. 229 pp. New York:
Vintage Books. Paper, $10. 
 REVILED as apathetic, cynical and just plain dumb by both its elders and itself, the generation born between 1961 and 1981 has, understandably enough, an inferiority complex bordering on the pathological. But guess what? It's not their fault. So write the baby boomers Neil Howe and Bill Strauss in "13th Gen."
After all, how can you blame a generation weaned on Vietnam, Watergate, stagflation, oil embargoes, disco and Reaganomics for being just a trifle un inspired? Consider the statistics presented in "13th Gen": child poverty, employment, wages, home ownership, arrest records -- in every category, this generation, the 13th since the American Revolution, is doing worse than the generation that came before. Indeed, for the first time since the Civil War, the authors of "13th Gen" keep reminding us, young people are unlikely to surpass the affluence of their parents.
"13th Gen" seems to be intended as a nonfiction version of such twentysomething texts as the film "Slacker" and the novel "Generation X." Striking a self-consciously post-modern tone, the authors -- Mr. Howe is an economist and historian, Mr. Strauss is the director of a political satire troupe called Capitol Steps -- make their case by interpolating into their main text lots of charts and graphs, margin-ensconced tidbits, cartoons by The New York Observer's R. J. Matson, and even an intermittent dialogue with Ian Williams, a genuine member of the "13th gen" and a computer hacker, who surfs into the text from cyberspace.
But instead of coming across as an exciting hard-copy version of MTV designed to seduce the minuscule attention spans of suburbia's mall-hopping "13ers," this book's compendium of run-amok generalizations has all the flair and provocativeness of a social studies textbook. The authors have managed to capture the contrived glibness of post-modernism while missing just about all of its essential irony.
Actually, "13th Gen" isn't so much a book about this generation at all as a diatribe against the generation responsible for the breakdown of contemporary America into what the authors regard as a fragmented, polarized, chaotic society. All those parents who got divorced, encouraged "open" schooling and neglected their children while indulging themselves are the real villains.
Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss make sense when they decry previous generations for standing by and watching, and often cheering, as their leaders plunged the nation into a morass of "mounting budget deficits, unfunded benefit liabilities, dwindling savings rates, lackluster R & D, crumbling highways and deepening foreign import penetration." And they rightly point out that given those realities, it is unsurprising that 13ers feel powerless and resentful. But as the authors relentlessly attack the iniquitous "child-abusive culture" of the 1960's and 70's and exult in heaping insult after insult on their own generation -- they caricature baby boomers as countercultural, long-haired, sex-obsessed hedonists -- their real agenda begins to surface.
That agenda becomes clear in part of their wish list for how the 13th generation may influence the future: "13ers will reverse the frenzied and centrifugal cultural directions of their younger years. . . . They will clean up entertainment, de-diversify the culture, reinvent core symbols of national unity, reaffirm rituals of family and neighborhood bonding, and re-erect barriers to cushion communities from unwanted upheaval."
Sounds like some people are feeling just a mite threatened by the churning wake of what Douglas Coupland, the author of "Generation X," labeled "an accelerated culture." De-diversify the culture? Tell that to the women, immigrants, members of minority groups, lesbians, gay men and others whose laborious struggles were in part responsible for all that "unwanted upheaval." Technology keeps on chugging, the world keeps on shrinking, tensions keep on building and deceleration looks a long way off. It's awfully hard to see how a generation whose iconic symbols include punk skateboarders, tattooed and nose-ringed bike messengers and rebellious computer hackers is going to start slowing it all down.

HEADLINE: Remembering Irving Howe (1920-1993)

BYLINE: By Leon Wieseltier; Leon Wieseltier is the literary editor of The New Republic.

 BODY:
IT was a moody September morning in 1991, and we were walking down Madison Avenue, gossiping about books, when Irving Howe changed the subject. "Something happened to me in Paris that you might understand" was how he began the least likely conversation we ever had. "I was in the garden at the Rodin Museum. For a few minutes I was alone, sitting on a stone bench between two long hedges of roses. Pink roses. Suddenly I felt the most powerful feeling of peace, and I had the thought that death, if it means an absorption into a reality like the one that was before me, might be all right."
That was all. I mumbled something about the importance of such an experience, and said nothing more; illuminations are not occasions for criticism. But I was filled with gladness for my friend. He had recently recovered from a rattling period of physical infirmity; and during those months, when he fought his fear with the help of Haydn, and Proust, and the first tranquilizers of his otherwise urbane life, I had wondered whether his urbanity, his intellectual strictness, his decades of dialectic, had adequately prepared him for the times that humble the mind. I learned, that morning on Madison, that he was not unprepared. 
 I was not altogether surprised. Over the years of our friendship I discovered that Irving, who died May 5, was not just the god of rigor and reason that his admirers, the socialists and the secularists especially, made him out to be. He was, of course, a master controversialist, and fierce in his insistence on clarity in thought and in prose; and it did not make your own thinking and writing any easier to know that sooner or later Irving would have a view of it. For many people, he was the perfect representative of "the New York intellectuals" -- those brilliant critics of politics and culture who believed in many things in the course of their extraordinary lives but most of all believed in brains.
In truth, Irving was rather an imperfect representative of the breed. In politics, he was steadier, and had no craving for conversions; and in his later years this made him rather marginal, which was not much of an impediment for a man with a romantic view of marginality. (This almost never made him doctrinaire. Irving had a gift for feeling certain that you were wrong without feeling certain that he was right.) More important, it was Irving, in his unforgettable essay "The New York Intellectuals" in 1968, who warned of the limitations of brilliance, of the gladiatorial excesses of the metropolitan style of mind.
There was something unexpectedly concrete about the man and his work. He was intrigued by the utopian imagination, but he had a vivid sense of the facticity of life. He understood the importance of the common touch, even if he lacked it. He suspected things that dazzled. He liked ideas more than theories, reasonableness more than correctness. His tone, when he was interpreting a novel or analyzing a historical figure, was often provisional, gracious, patient with perplexity, collaborative. He was always in the middle of trying to get something right. He enjoyed admiring more than he enjoyed criticizing.
He was a great authority on radicalism, not least on the sources of its appeal, which were, in his case, a childhood in the Depression and a virtually European fascination with the career of ideas in politics. Yet he was, in a way, divided against himself, for his temperament was not at all radical. Irving had no weakness for totality, no innocence about revolution. All his life he proudly called himself a socialist, or more precisely a democratic socialist. (In 1954, he was the moving force behind the creation of the journal Dissent.) He was the terror, so to speak, of the Stalinist left. About the authoritarian tendencies of the New Left, and the shabbiness of many of its notions, nobody was more withering. He castigated his own congregation as naturally as he castigated the others. And so his congregation kept shrinking, and the honor of belonging to it kept growing.
I have an allergy to socialism myself, and so I was impressed by the infrequency with which our ideological difference amounted to a political difference. May his comrades at Dissent forgive me, but Irving struck me finally as a welfare-state liberal with a fluency in the Marxist tradition. I remember the evening -- it was early in the 1980's, at the height of the Reagan dizziness -- when he argued against the uncritical praise of the market on the ground that it missed what was valuable about the market, which was its amenability to reform. He despised those who refused to see the suffering that capitalism sometimes caused; but capitalism, he said, is an economic system that may be politically corrected. In recent years, after the collapse of state socialism in the big Soviet Union and all the little Soviet Unions under its sway, Irving interested himself in the possibility, conceptual and practical, of "market socialism." It looked to me like a contortion, but it was proof, if proof was still needed, that he was a man with his eyes open, and his heart.
What kept his eyes and his heart open, however, was not politics. It was literature. He loved nothing more. As a critic, Irving came to occupy a peculiar position. He was both anachronistic and urgent. In an era of literary theory, he was dead to literary theory; and yet you had to read him, because his humanism was sophisticated rather than sentimental. Irving's approach to poems and novels was part Matthew Arnold, part East Bronx. That is, he turned to literature to learn about life, but the life about which he most wished to learn was the hard and lumpy and common one. He despised proletarian art, and the ways in which populism and mass politics tortured the writer; but he had little patience for art's high priests. He preferred beauty to estheticism. Hardy, Sherwood Anderson, Faulkner: the writers about whom he wrote books (how magical still are the opening pages of his study of Hardy!) were masters of form who found in ordinary people difficulty and dignity enough. Irving's greatest thrill was high art that felt democratic. (And so he was devoted to the ballets of Balanchine.)
He had no illusions about the extent to which the world was changing and he was not; but no change struck Irving with greater force, and made him feel more like the end of the line, than the eclipse of Yiddish -- the language, the culture, the sensibility. I have never known anyone in whom the paradoxical Yiddish inflection, the cheerful grimness, the sunny decay of hope, survived so purely. For decades Irving threw himself into the task of rescue, editing and introducing and writing about what he made famous as the "world of our fathers." He was without nostalgia, but he was not without grief. I cannot count the number of breakfasts at Leo's on East 86th Street that were taken up with the disappearance of that world, with the decline of secular Jewishness.
AS a Jew, Irving felt almost like a man without contemporaries. All that remained as a foundation for Jewish identity, he would argue, was religion or nationalism, and he was excluded, by experience and by conviction, from both. I would argue that, as foundations for identity go, religion and nationalism are not bad; and then I would gently suggest to him that he was not as alienated from either Judaism or Israel as he thought. (About the philistinism of the American Jewish community, however, I offered no disagreement.) The Yom Kippur War left him fearing for Israel's safety, and he was passionately drawn into the great Jewish debate about the Palestinian question. His wife, Ilana, an Israeli woman of great cultivation, filled the apartment with Hebrew writings and sometimes with Hebrew writers. He even started to visit the synagogue on Yom Kippur -- not to find God, of course, but not many Jews visit the synagogue to find God.
Irving and God? Not a chance. And yet, when he wrote or lectured or just talked about the deeper and the more difficult themes, Irving was surrounded by the atmosphere of intellectual seriousness and intellectual tolerance that the rabbis describe as "for the sake of Heaven." He was, this skeptic and secularist and socialist, a great-souled man. And he was the man who, more than any American intellectual of his generation, by his work and by his example, conferred greatness upon the homeliest of qualities, the quality that transforms controversy into a search for the true and action into a search for the good, the quality that mattered most to Orwell and Silone, who were, we may now say, Irving's true company: the quality of decency. It is, in his absence, a quality more strained.

HEADLINE: Despite Doubts, U.N. to Support Balkan Strategy

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 23

 BODY:
The Security Council plans to approve the modest new Western strategy for containing the war in Bosnia this week, but diplomats said today that the vote would not remove obstacles like an inadequate number of peacekeeping troops or resistance from Serbs and Muslims.
The Council plans to adopt three resolutions endorsing the "step by step" approach to curbing the fighting, which was hammered out by the United States, Russia and key European allies on Saturday after months of indecision and discord. 
 The Council plans to approve resolutions calling for several thousand additional peacekeeping troops to be sent to protect and enlarge the six "safe havens" it has designated in Bosnia for besieged Muslim refugees, and for the threat of air strikes against the Serbs if they attack the enclaves again.
 
War Crimes Court Planned
 The Council wants to send up to 3,000 troops to insure that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia keeps his pledge to cut off all supplies to Bosnia's Serbs until they agree to halt their military campaign and sign an international peace plan. And it will set up a new 11-judge court to hear war crimes charges arising from the civil war.
President Alija Izetbegovic, the head of Bosnia's Muslim-led Government, bitterly rejected the allied agreement today, saying it made no provision for returning Muslim refugees to their homes. He called on his followers to use all available means to defend what was left of their country. [Page A6.]
His remarks raised the possibility that the outgunned Muslims might now breach the fragile cease-fire around the safe havens.
But the United Nations has not received a single firm promise from any country to supply any of the several thousand new troops that it says it will need for sealing the Bosnian border with Serbia and for the dangerous mission of guarding the safe havens. Requests have already been made to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, but those countries have given only ambiguous answers so far, officials here say.
The Clinton Administration has already said it will not send American ground troops, while Britain, France and Canada say they cannot afford to send any more peacekeepers to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In another obstacle, Mr. Milosevic and the Yugoslav Government, which is dominated by the Serbian republic, said last week that they would not allow the Security Council to station anyone along the border with Bosnia to monitor the embargo. Though Mr. Milosevic is viewed as the ideological sponsor of the Serbian campaign, he said the world would simply have to accept his pledge to cut off supplies of weapons, fuel and other vital goods until the Bosnian Serbs make peace.
About 9,000 troops are currently stationed in Bosnia. If only a token force is sent to the "safe havens" to deter Serbs from attacking, the United Nations thinks that it might need about 3,000 extra troops. But if the force is to defend these areas against ground attack, France has said a force of up to 40,000 soldiers might be required.
 
No Money for New Mission
 The United Nations has no money for such a deployment; no country has contributed to a special emergency peacekeeping fund recently set up for beginning new operations like those now planned in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
About 35 percent of the money the United Nations has requested from member states to cover the cost of the current force of more than 20,000 peacekeepers in republics of the former Yugoslavia has not been paid.
And United Nations reports show that Sadako Ogata, the High Commissioner for Refugees, who is coordinating all relief work in Bosnia, has received less than half the money she needs for helping millions of people who have been driven from their homes.
"The Security Council has already adopted 35 resolutions and issued 29 statements on Yugoslavia telling the United Nations what to do," the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said in exasperation over the weekend. "But I have no more money and no more troops."
 
Frustration at U.N.
 Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been so frustrated with the indecision of the West that his top aides were seriously contemplating recommending that the Security Council devise a new approach for ending the war before the United States and the Europeans drafted their strategy on Saturday.
The peace settlement previously negotiated by the United Nations and the European Community, known as the Vance-Owen plan, calls for dividing Bosnia into semi-autonomous provinces dominated by varying ethnic groups. It was accepted by the Muslims and Croats but was flatly rejected by the Serbs, who felt little pressure to abandon their dream of a "Greater Serbia."
The new allied strategy -- backed by Britain, France and Spain as well as by the United States and Russia -- is based on a belief that the allies should push ahead with whatever actions they can take to promote peace, provided that they are compatible with the basic principles of the peace plan drawn up by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and by Lord Owen of Britain.
Sending monitors to Serbia's border with Bosnia is seen as a step toward tightening the trade embargo that the Council has imposed on both countries in an effort to force the Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan.
 
Stopping 'Ethnic Cleansing'
 Similarly, defending and enlarging the Muslim safe havens is viewed as a step toward halting further "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and as an initial step toward trying to roll back Serbian territorial gains as called for by the Vance-Owen proposals. Under the Vance-Owen plan, Serbs would be dominant in 43 percent of Bosnia's territory, compared with the 70 percent they occupy now.
The new war crimes tribunal represents a further warning to all sides to halt "ethnic cleansing" and other atrocities.
By adopting all three resolutions in a single package this week, perhaps with some foreign ministers present, the Security Council hopes to impress all the parties to the Bosnian conflict that the Council members finally have a joint strategy, based on introducing the Vance-Owen proposals in a step-by-step fashion.
Before the embargo monitors can be sent to the Serbian border, diplomats say, the Russians will have to use their influence with Serbs to persuade the Government in Belgrade to agree to their deployment. Russia must also persuade Belgrade to let the monitors enforce their mission to turn back shipments of arms and all other goods, except for food and medicine, that they discover moving into Bosnia.
The hope is that the tight economic embargo against Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs will eventually force a change of heart and compel them to cooperate with the Vance-Owen proposals.

HEADLINE: At Elite Russian School, O Is for Openness

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KALININGRAD, Russia

 BODY:
When she went to school, Nina Vasilyevna recalled, nobody questioned the teacher. "Now," she said, "my third graders not only ask me about Moses and Stalin, they ask me about love. They even criticize my makeup."
Next door down, Olga Arkadyevna's history classroom was decorated with reproductions of Russian icons. In the next classroom, Robert Friel of Stoneham, Mass., was discussing "stream of consciousness" and Robert Frost with his 11th-grade English class. 
 Granted, this is not an average neighborhood school, and Kaliningrad is not an average Russian city.
 
Home to Space Program
 School No. 11 is one of scores of special schools set up in the Soviet era to give talented children intensive language and technical training. It was specifically developed to emphasize English, and English-language signs read "Toilet" or "Director's Office."
Kaliningrad, just north of Moscow, is home to Star City and much of the former Soviet Union's space program. Until recently the area was tightly closed to foreigners, but for School No. 11, that exclusiveness has only intensified the changes that have come over Russian education in the seven years since glasnost first wafted through.
Though the Russian Government still sets some basic requirements, state-ordered courses have given way to experimental programs and Marxist textbooks have given way to privately copied texts. Private schools have cropped up in every city, and entry into better schools has become so competitive that at School No. 11, for example, half the seniors pay for private tutoring before state exams.
This year's seniors -- 11th graders in the Russian school system -- were only 10 years old when Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power. For them it is already hard to believe that there was a time when talking about the czar was taboo, or when foreigners were not only exotic but potentially dangerous.
"My parents always tell me that the K.G.B. would have punished them if they talked to foreigners," said a senior in American-accented English, a girl who was preparing to enter the journalism school of Moscow State University. "Is that really true? Did they really follow you?"
To the students it seems a curious notion, now that one of the teachers is an American, American students visit regularly and eight graduating students are headed for a year in the United States. Classrooms on the fourth floor are wired for the American television program "Channel One," which includes news broadcasts.
Under pressure from students and parents, the elite school has also set up an extracurricular class in the basics of market economy.
Membership in the Komsomol, or Young Communist League, is no longer mandatory when students turn 14; indeed, the organization was abandoned at the school two years ago. There is still a Museum of Military Glory, but the ideological overlay is long gone, and the theme now is the heroism of their forebears, not the glory of Leninism.
"I remember my oldest daughter coming home from exams very sheepishly," Nina Vasilyevna recalled. " 'Mama,' she said, 'when they asked how I love Lenin, I said I loved him more than Mama -- but only a teensy bit more.' " She laughed, remembering a past that now seems almost quaint.
 
Teaching Children to Think
 Students range from 7 to 17. For the last two years, Miss Vasilyevna said, the lower grades have been taught according to a system worked out by Prof. Leonid V. Zankov in the 1970's but never formally adopted by the Soviet Education Ministry.
The fundamental principle of the Zankov system was almost antithetical to the old Government. Instead of learning by rote, children were actually taught to think for themselves. A problem in a third-grade arithmetic text, photocopied and neatly stapled, began, "Just imagine you have 10 apples."
Margarita V. Solomonovna, the deputy director and herself a graduate of School No. 11, said: "Zankov treats children as friends. They accepted it immediately. The harder part was to retrain the teachers. They were not used to kids thinking or challenging them.
 
Contributions From Parents
 "No," she said, "there has been no problem with discipline. On the contrary, there's a lot more respect now for teachers -- and for students. It's a much more creative situation."
Among other changes, parents have been drawn much closer to the schooling process. One parent, a successful local entrepreneur, contributed six television sets, another contributed furniture and others photocopied textbooks.
Waiting for her daughter to finish class, Vera Ivanovna thought of her own schooling. "We were beaten down," she said. "We avoided teachers. We never asked them questions. They were 'Authority'; they were always right."
"These kids are completely unfettered," she added, using a word heard many times that day -- raskrepo shchyonnyi -- literally, "de-serfed."
"We just wanted to get school over with," she said. "Now everyone wants to go to a prestigious institute, to Moscow State, to Imemo" -- the Institute of International Economic Relations. "This school is free for now, but everyone pays for tutoring. If they started charging for my daughter, I would pay, even though I can't afford it."
School No. 11 does not charge fees. Given the financial strictures of the Russian space program, on which most parents depend, not many parents could afford the tuition charged by some of the new private schools in Moscow, where tuition of 25,000 rubles a month -- about what a secondary-school teacher earns -- is not unknown.
 
'Hunger for Education'
 Entry into School No. 11 is prized. About 170 children applied this year for the lowest grades, and only 70 were accepted.
"There's a tremendous hunger for education here," said Mr. Friel, a teacher for 29 years in Stoneham who was the first American teacher sent to Russia under a Fulbright exchange program. "I suspect it has something to do with the threatened space program. Parents here want to make sure their kids pick up some transfer skills."
But if the parents wonder about their future, the students do not seem anxious. A poll last year found the pupils far more concerned about the fate of the world than about their own futures.
"My grandmother does nothing but complain about prices," one girl said. "I think they're normal." She plans to be a critic for one of the new newspapers, she said.
A group of teachers of English joined Mr. Friel. "Education used to be a system of taboos," said one. Another interjected: "Our whole life here was a system of taboos. Six years ago I was barred from going to Czechoslovakia because of what my husband does, and I didn't even know what he does. Last year, I took a group of students to Denver."

HEADLINE: MEDICINE SUFFERS AS FEWER DOCTORS DO GENERAL WORK

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
A growing shortage of doctors willing to practice general medicine has left some hospitals and health-maintenance organizations desperate for qualified candidates and, in the long term, stands as a major obstacle to overhauling the nation's health-care system.
Almost all changes under consideration include a central role for what used to be known as the family doctor -- today generally an internist or family practitioner -- who can save the system money by taking care of a wide variety of ailments on his own and referring patients for more costly specialty care or tests only when absolutely necessary.
 
Once a Cornerstone
 Although such primary-care doctors were once the cornerstone of American medicine, their numbers have dwindled as younger doctors have been drawn to specialty fields by money and the lure of new technology. So today, as more patients enroll in health-maintenance organizations or physician networks that rely heavily on general doctors to hold down costs, a rising demand is confronting a declining supply. 
 Health economists say that a medical system should have about 50 percent of its doctors practicing primary care, which includes family practice, internal medicine and pediatrics, and that is the mix now favored by most large H.M.O.'s. But the current percentage of primary-care doctors in the country is only about 33 percent, and, worse, it is falling.
In 1992, only 14.6 percent of medical students decided to go into general medicine, an all-time low. At that rate, the proportion of primary-care doctors will drop to 28 percent or less by 2010.
 
Striving for Balance
 "We should try to achieve a 50-50 balance as soon as possible, but we have a long way to go," said Dr. Robert Harmon, administrator of the United States Health Resources and Services Administration. "Even if medical schools started graduating 50 percent primary-care specialists today, it could still take us to beyond the year 2000 to achieve a good mix."
Already, "patients are not getting the right kind of attention from the right kind of doctors, and specialists are not getting enough patients in their specialty to keep their skills up," said Prof. Eli Ginzberg, a health economist at Columbia University.
Health economists say it will take a mixture of market forces and policy changes to fill the gap. The marketplace is already at work in some parts of the country, where hospitals and H.M.O.'s fighting to attract coveted generalists are dangling bonuses and salaries that top those for some specialists. It is hoped that money will draw doctors back into the field. The Government, too, is offering or considering various incentives like low-interest loans to such doctors as well as to the schools that train them. But few expect such enticements to fully staff primary-care clinics in the near future.
In the short term, health economists, including some of those advising President Clinton, have suggested various solutions, from relying on non-physicians like nurse practitioners or physicians assistants to retraining underemployed specialists, like neurosurgeons or cardiologists, to do front-line medicine.
In the long term, they say, medical schools and hospitals must be prodded to encourage more doctors to go into primary care, a field that has slipped to second-class status in a medical world increasingly focused on procedures and new technologies.
 
Career Choices Easily Understood
 "Everything in the current system conspires toward" an uneven division, Professor Ginzberg said. "Why shouldn't someone want to go into a specialty? You're admired by your peers. You can control your time and life better, and then, not unimportant, you make more money."
If there is a shortage of primary-care doctors, there are still plenty of young men and women who want to be some kind of doctor: the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington reported last week that applications for the 1993-94 school year will be an all-time high, surpassing the record of 42,621 set in 1974-75.
Many of the applicants said they thought the health-care changes proposed by the Clinton Administration would benefit society, but it remains to be seen whether those sentiments will mean more medical school graduates going into primary care.
As of this year, federally sponsored low-interest loans previously available to all medical students will be restricted to those who commit to practicing primary care. Some economists say the Government must go further, cutting off money to specialty training programs altogether.
"The Federal Government has to redirect subsidies to fields that people need rather than the fields that the teaching hospitals want," said Dr. Alain Enthoven, a Stanford University economist who is a principal architect of the health plan said to be favored by President Clinton.
Of the 600,000 doctors in the country fewer than 200,000 are in primary care, and of those some 40,000 are "general practitioners" who never completed residencies after medical school, widely considered an important precursor to good general practice. (General practitioners do one year of practical training after medical schools, compared with three or four for internists, family practitioners or pediatricians. Most specialists receive five to seven years' training after medical school.)
Faced with this shortage, health-maintenance organizations and hospitals around the country are offering internal-medicine and family-practice doctors bonuses and salaries almost double those paid five years ago.
Harvard Community Health Plan is looking for 40 general internists, said Dr. Thomas Inui, chairman of the new Department of Ambulatory Care and Preventive Medicine at Harvard University. "If 40 people who were qualified walked in the door today, they would be hired on the spot," he added.
The tight market has forced FHP, a large health-maintenance organization in the Southwest, to pay its generalists an annual salary of more than $100,000, more than it pays pulmonary specialists or rheumatologists.
Dr. Frank Marino, a family-practice doctor who now works for FHP, said that when he finished his residency two years ago he had more than 100 job offers, from virtually every part of the country.
 
Where the Needs Are Greatest
 Where H.M.O.'s have become common, as in Minnesota and Southern California, "they are having trouble finding primary-care providers, and you're experiencing what could be the future, right now," said Dr. William Straub, a senior policy analyst with the Jackson Hole Group, a research organization whose members have close ties to the Clinton Administration.
Kay W. Slayden, president of Jackson & Coker, a large medical-placement firm based in Atlanta, said that in addition to offering higher salaries for primary-care doctors, areas with the greatest unmet primary-care needs had begun requesting physician's assistants or nurse practitioners. Jackson & Coker this year started a placement service for these professionals in response to the growing demand.
Estimates differ about exactly how many primary-care doctors are needed in the United States, but the general sentiment is: more, and a lot more in rural areas and the inner cities where there are virtually no general doctors left.
In 1989, the Community Service Society of New York found that of the 701 doctors who claimed to provide primary care in New York's nine poorest neighborhoods only 28 met minimum standards for an effective primary-care practice; this included being affiliated with a hospital and having after-hour coverage.
"Not only was the picture real bleak, but there weren't signs that there was going to be a fresh infusion, there are no new doctors coming into the area," said David R. Jones, president of the society. "New York and other cities will have a particular problem in instituting managed care because of the absence of decent primary care in these neighborhoods."
Mr. Jones estimated that 500 primary-care doctors would be needed to care for the people who live in the nine survey areas alone.
In practice, the shortage of primary-care doctors is often masked in areas with large number of sub-specialists because they tend to round out their office hours by doing primary care. In some of the smaller specialties, like infectious diseases and endocrinology, doctors tend to maintain interest and expertise in general practice for years.
 
Too Much Reliance On Costly Data?
 But this is often not true in procedure-oriented fields, like cardiology and gastroenterology. And studies have shown that primary care dispensed by doctors who are mainly specialists is unnecessarily expensive since these doctors tend to order more tests and must refer patients to other doctors when their problems fall outside their relatively narrow range of knowledge.
"Many people who trained in cardiology or pulmonary begrudgingly do this general stuff," said Dr. Jack Resnick, president of Managed Health Inc., an H.M.O. on Long Island. "But many of those people are not adequately trained and do things the wrong way."
Dr. Resnick said that most health-maintenance organizations specifically prohibited specialists from doing general practice since "the two groups play very different roles."
As more patients enroll in managed care, experts predict that more and more specialists will find themselves unable to fill their time. And they hope that at least some will be interested in switching to primary care.
"We are going to need specialists to dedifferentiate, and I think we can create incentives, financial and otherwise, to encourage them to do so," said Dr. Inui of Harvard, adding that some transitions, like neurosurgeon to pediatrician, were "improbable."
But Dr. Harmon said that as salaries for generalists rose and specialty salaries fell because of oversupply, even unlikely switches would become at least thinkable: "I guarantee you that once the incomes of sub-specialists drop below general internists, these doctors will be quite happy to do general medicine."
Such switches are most plausible for doctors in the medical specialties like cardiology or pulmonary medicine, since they completed general medical training before narrowing their focus. Switching fields is more problematic for some surgical specialists, like neurosurgeons or ophthalmologists, who have highly specialized knowledge and little general training.
Health planners are also looking for ways to reverse the nose dive in the number of medical students who are interested in primary care. While educators say higher salaries will help somewhat, they say the values of the medical world will have to change.
Fifteen years ago, relatively few medical school graduates went into fields like radiology and anesthesiology since medical school deans actively discouraged these "no patient contact" specialties. But in recent years, the balance has flipped, so that these and other specialties have been the rule.
Dr. Larsen of FHP said that when his daughter, a fourth-year medical student at the University of California at Irvine, decided to go into family practice, an oncology professor said to her: "What a waste; you're too sharp."
 
More Exposure To 'Front Line'
 With a bit of government urging, many medical schools are now offering students more exposure to front-line medicine and offering a more positive image of primary care. As at Harvard, they are creating departments specifically devoted to outpatient medicine, affiliating with outpatient clinics in the community and urging students to spend time with practicing doctors treating sore throats and sprained knees as well as learning how magnetic resonance imaging works or doing genetic research in the laboratory.
Still, this is not always easy in the huge referral hospital generally connected with medical schools, where rare tumors often outnumber sore throats and sprains. In such hospitals "you're much more likely to hear a dissertation about what cement to use in hip replacements than how to diagnose a hurting shoulder," Dr. Resnick said.
The Government, long reluctant to intervene in academia, now seems poised to use its financial muscle to force teaching hospitals to respond.
Medicare contributes $5.5 billion to hospitals to subsidize medical education, the Department of Veterans Affairs spends $600 million and the Department of Defense $280 million. Some health economists, like Dr. En thoven, have suggested that this money should be withheld not only from specialty training programs but also from academic hospitals that do not produce at least a 50-50 split in training slots.
"So far, there has been no significant weighting towards primary care in directing funding," Dr. Harmon said. "But now that is certainly under consideration."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
On Washington High Wire, Clinton Loses His Sure Step

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The White House is a strange place. Politicians who move in often seem to lose track of how the public feels. But that was not supposed to happen to Bill Clinton and his band of MTV-bred advisers with their quicksilver reflexes.
During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton was hailed by friend and foe as a rare, natural politician who would never lose the populist touch. But now the biggest question consuming Washington, and particularly Democrats, is this: How could such a political thoroughbred seem to keep stumbling out of the starting gate in a race for which he seemed to have been bred? 
 From the first week of the new Administration, Clinton supporters have been waiting for this young White House to turn a corner and build some consistent momentum toward its main objective of healing the economy.
After the flap over homosexuals in the military dominated the first two weeks, officials said they would turn the corner. After the flap over the abortive nomination of Zoe Baird as Attorney General, officials said they would turn the corner. After the failure of Mr. Clinton's stimulus package, officials said there would be a little shake-up of the White House staff, but now they would really turn the corner.
But after last week's White House news was dominated by the President's pricey haircut, a revolt among Democrats on taxes, more groping for a workable policy on Bosnia and the messy dismissal of the White House travel office amid accusations of cronyism, many Democratic supporters of Mr. Clinton are beginning to whisper the previously unwhisperable: What if this White House never turns the corner? What if the real problem is not focus, or staff, or organizational charts, but somehow the President himself?
No Democratic lawmakers want to say it aloud for fear of adding to Mr. Clinton's travails. But several have expressed the view that last week's performance by the White House was scary, because of the way it crystallized everything that seems to be wrong: a loss of political judgment, a lack of strategic vision and a White House that now seems much closer to Hollywood than a town called Hope.
Still, Democratic lawmakers believe there is no question that Mr. Clinton will regain the momentum he had in the campaign if he can get his economic package through Congress reasonably intact in the coming few weeks and that many missteps of the early months could be forgotten. Mr. Clinton had a record of learning from his mistakes as Governor of Arkansas, and even his gleeful Republican opponents do not yet dare write him off.
 
Almost Typecasting
 But what many Clinton supporters -- members of Congress, staff members and party workers who truly want to see him succeed -- say is troubling them is that they see a President who is coming perilously close this early in his term to being typecast in a way that will only reinforce his troubles.
President Gerald R. Ford may have been the best athlete ever to occupy the Oval Office, but after repeatedly tripping, he was labeled as a stumbler. After that, every misstep he made, which would have been ignored with any other President, became news and reinforced the stereotype.
Once President Jimmy Carter was labeled as someone who was weak in his handling of the Soviet Union and Iran and could easily be swayed, an attack by a bunny rabbit on his canoe became big news and reinforced the stereotype.
 
Different Focuses
 The same thing seems to be starting to happen to Mr. Clinton. On Saturday he went to New Hampshire to get back to his message of selling his budget. Some of that message did make the papers. But the news programs were also peppered by reports that the press plane hired by the new White House travel office broke down and almost failed to arrive in time for the President's speech. Beyond that, practically every sign alluding to Mr. Clinton's $200 coif by a Beverly Hills stylist, Cristophe, including one that said "Nice haircut, Bubba," made the papers.
The fate of the White House press plane would normally never be news; the President's latest haircut would normally never be news. But they become news, and crowd out other stories, when the perception has been created that they are somehow revealing of the real character of the President or the White House.
Coming on top of other problems, including the failure of Mr. Clinton's package to stimulate the economy and the revolt in his own party, they are. For what these incidents highlight are the two things that have been sorely missing from this White House from the very start: good sound political judgment and a strategic vision.
When the President suggested that his hair stylist give him a trim aboard Air Force One while the plane sat at Los Angeles International Airport, no adviser or the President himself seemed to recognize that if this story got out the same week he was trying to sell austerity and belt tightening to the American people, it could be very hurtful for him. When White House officials are asked these questions, they answer sheepishly, "No."
 
Blaming the Press
 It seemed little short of bizarre that Bill Clinton and his Hollywood friend Harry Thomason, who together understood and developed the powerful symbolism of the "candidate from Hope," were suddenly going blind and tone deaf to the symbolism of this very same President tying up traffic at the Los Angeles airport for 56 minutes while he had his locks shorn by Mr. Thomason's Beverly Hills coiffeur.
When the White House communications director, George Stephanopoulos, was asked to explain this, he blamed the press, saying, "There seems to be some sort of obsession with side issues." That reinforced the sense of a White House that had lost its political feel.
But this was not an isolated incident of political ineptitude. It came after three months of flip-flopping on how forceful to be on Bosnia, without ever explaining any of the shifts to the American people, including Saturday's agreement with Russia and three other countries.
The latest political miscue also followed Mr. Clinton's unusually maladroit performance at the White House correspondents' dinner, when he used an occasion normally reserved for a little self-deprecating humor to attack the conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, in ways that made him look mean-spirited.
 
Surprise at Revolt
 It also came after the President, who is considered a supreme politician, was confronted by a revolt by conservative Democrats over his budget package. The rebellion seems to have taken him at least partly by surprise and has left him on the defensive, trying to drum up support from the public by running against a faction of his own party.
Judgment also seemed to have been sorely lacking in the travel office fiasco. It may indeed turn out, as the White House has suggested, that the travel office was not being managed in a professional, or even honest, manner and that the staff deserved to be dismissed. But did it not occur to anyone that replacing that staff with a cousin of the President and a Little Rock travel agency might smack of conflict of interest and raise doubts about the White House's claim that it was making the change only to produce a cheaper, more efficient travel service for the press?
What made things worse was that, just as with the Baird appointment, when the White House saw that it was losing the public relations battle and its economic message was being drowned out by the travel office controversy, it nevertheless dragged the issue out for three full days.
Instead of quickly cutting its losses to get the press refocused on the budget, it tried to justify hiring the President's relative and favorite travel agency. Only on Friday night did the White House lance the boil and announce that it would not use the Little Rock agency.
"There is no strategic sense with this White House that things are inter-connected," said Norman Ornstein, Presidential scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "Everything is dealt with individually. What has been missing from the start is a sense that they have one overriding goal -- getting through the President's economic package -- and that everything they do and say must be subordinated to and integrated with that objective.
"Instead, you have welfare reform, campaign finance, health care, travel office, haircuts, all being treated separately. No one seems to be coordinating things."

HEADLINE: Anti-Tax Fervor Comes Rolling Down the Plains

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ELGIN, Okla., May 21

 BODY:
It should come as no surprise that two of the leaders of the revolt within President Clinton's own party against his economic package are Oklahomans: Senator David L. Boren and Representative Dave McCurdy.
Oklahoma voters were the first in the nation to impose term limits on their state legislators. In a rage after the oil-price collapse of the 1980's led to huge tax increases, they approved a new constitutional amendment: no state tax increases without a direct vote of the people, period. 
 And if any new tax out of Washington could provoke particular ire, it is an energy tax. Oklahoma, after all, is the only state that boasts a working oil rig on the grounds of its Capitol.
When the Democrats came together last year on a pledge to reinvigorate the economy, they took back the White House and maintained control of both houses of Congress, and there was much talk of finally breaking the gridlock in Washington.
 
Suspicion on the Deficit
 But here in a state where nearly two-thirds of the people still call themselves Democrats, there is ample evidence of intense pressure on elected officials to fight any tax increases. And there is deep skepticism that the proposed increases in the President's package will ever be used, as he pledges, to cut the deficit.
In Oklahoma, the basic mistrust that is common in many states has been fanned by a vigorous industry campaign against the energy tax. The campaign has included television commercials and full-page newspaper advertisements that say taxpayers will get socked "every time you drive your car, turn on the lights, wash your clothes and cook your meals." A cut-out message of opposition, with Senator Boren's address in Washington, was helpfully included.
To be sure, some Oklahoma Democrats argue that now is the time for loyalty to the party -- and for getting with the President's program.
"Somebody needs to send both Daves a telegram saying, 'Hey, we won in 1992,' " said Representative Mike Synar, a Muskogee Democrat.
 
'Let Clinton Be Clinton'
 But both men say that it is they who are being loyal to the "New Democrat" theme that President Clinton ran on, and that they really hope to expand the Democratic national base. President George Bush received 43 percent of the vote here in November, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Clinton and 23 percent for Ross Perot.
"In a sense we're saying, 'Let Clinton be Clinton,' " Senator Boren said today in Washington when he appeared as a phone-in guest on the Rush Limbaugh radio program. The Senator, who led a bipartisan group in offering an alternative deficit-cutting plan this week, told the talk-show host that Mr. Clinton had betrayed his roots by calling for $340 billion in tax increases.
Senator Boren said the President should have proposed to cut more spending: "Sometimes when you see a friend go astray, the best thing to do is tell the friend the truth.
 
McCurdy Tells of Pain
 Mr. McCurdy, who flirted with a Presidential run of his own before endorsing Mr. Clinton and campaigning in 36 states for him, said opposing him now was "the most painful thing I've had to do" in the Congress.
"But I hear it day in and day out," said Mr. McCurdy, who came to the football field in this southwest Oklahoma farming town today to address the 62-member graduating class at Elgin High School on a cloudless evening. "The phone rings off the hook not only from constituents, but from people around the country. They're just shocked at the apparent shift in position, the fact that what we campaigned for is not being shown."
Both Mr. Boren and Mr. McCurdy may be laboring to carve out belt-tightening positions as part of a bid for leadership positions in their party. But regardless of what other factors are at work, it is overwhelmingly clear in this town of about 1,000 people that in fighting the President on the tax increases, especially the energy tax, Mr. Boren and Mr. McCurdy are reflecting the will of constituents.
"I'm a Democrat, but I certainly don't feel like just because the President's a Democrat we have to go along with everything he wants," said Denese Sovo, an Elgin resident who works as a storage clerk at nearby Fort Sill.
Her friend, Jo Ann Leslie, the owner of a clothing store, agreed. "This is where the stuff is, after all," she said of the oil and gas that would be taxed.
There has been no final resolution in Washington on whether there will be an energy tax, and on whether such a tax would be imposed directly on the people who pull oil and gas out of the ground or, down the line, on people who buy energy at the gas-station pump or to heat their homes. But Ms. Leslie reflected what seems to be an article of faith here: any energy tax would be disproportionately bad for Oklahoma.
Industry leaders, saying higher energy costs would be a burden for everybody from manufacturers to farmers, have cited job losses of up to 11,000 in the state, a number of vague origin that seems to have stuck. One advertisement, apparently mocking the President's plan to tax energy based on its heat content measured in British thermal units, says the tax really stands for "Buy Thermal Underwear" or "Big Time Unemployment."
 
Argument Drowned Out
 Some economists in Oklahoma have suggested that the structure of the tax would actually encourage development of natural gas. The state has even more natural gas than oil, but the argument has been all but drowned out.
Although this part of the Red River Valley is outside Oklahoma's traditional oil patch, some people here have small "stripper wells" in their yards, with black drills that peck deep into the red dirt for a daily draw of barely a barrel of oil, worth about $20, not counting the cost of drawing it out.
"It's hardly enough to pay the electricity bills," said an overall-clad Leo L. Loiacano, who has two such wells. "The last thing we need is a tax on it."
There is a pervasive skepticism that any of the tax increases proposed by Mr. Clinton would be used to cut the deficit, despite his pledge to create a special trust fund. "They're going to see a heap of money sitting there," said Troy Pyle, a 29-year-old ranch hand. "They'll find a loophole. They'll spend it. It's always the way."
 
Remembering a Road?
 David Pearson, a counter clerk at the Elgin Co-op, a farm supply store on G Street, compared the trust fund talk to promises that Oklahomans had heard about the Oklahoma turnpike. "They were going to take the tolls off just as soon as we'd paid for it, he said, gesturing toward Route 44, the main road to Oklahoma City. "But I bet we've paid for it 60 or 70 times over, and the tolls are still there. It's all bull."
Other people said they were simply all taxed out. "We're not making a living anymore; we're living on what we make," said Frank Schettler, a farm-insurance salesman.
Suggestions for where to cut spending ranged from foreign aid to welfare.
"Here we read about him flying from the Oval Office to California to get his hair cut," James Mansel, a filling-station owner, said of the President. (The President was already in California to plug his economic package when he decided to get his hair cut; the controversy erupted last week when air traffic was held up at Los Angeles International airport while a hairdresser came aboard Air Force One.)
The chief problem that the President's program has run into in Oklahoma seems to be a widespread feeling that it is too heavy on tax increases and too short on spending cuts.
"The general perception a lot of people have is that we thought he was going to be a kind of conservative or moderate Democrat," said Larkin Warner, a professor of economics at Oklahoma State University. "But a lot of people here feel, well, what happened to that rhetoric about tightening up on welfare? What happened to a dollar in cuts for a dollar in taxes? They feel they're getting some signals now that it's not that way at all."

HEADLINE: Once Past Improving the Economy, Clinton's Mandate Is Unclear, Poll Takers Say

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. CHARLES, Ill., May 23

 BODY:
Rival poll takers in last fall's election agree that Bill Clinton was elected because of the faltering economy, but they find no similar consensus about what mandate the American people expect him to fulfill in office.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, told the American Association for Public Opinion Research here on Friday that the President's main difficulty with the public now was that "he's not breaking gridlock," the expectation when he was elected. "The most important thing is for him to have successes," Mr. Greenberg said. 
 Fred Steeper, head of Market Strategies of Ann Arbor, Mich., who was President George Bush's poll taker, said President Clinton's difficulties were not in the intractability of Washington but in his policy choices. "He's going back on his mandate to do something about the economy, in particular the deficit," Mr. Steeper said.
The contrasting conclusions were each based on vast amounts of election polling. Mr. Steeper said that in 1992 he conducted 11 national polls, 56 state polls and 54 focus groups, along with 7,000 continuous polling interviews in October alone. Mr. Greenberg said that from June to Labor Day he did one national poll a week, increasing it to three a week by October. Focus groups were done twice a week until Labor Day, and twice a night thereafter.
 
Different Uses of Polling
 The two poll takers gave different accounts of how their clients used polling early in their terms as President, as distinguished from their campaigns. Mr. Greenberg said he conducted monthly polls, met daily with political advisers and was at the White House every day. "I do meet on a regular basis with the President," he said.
Mr. Steeper said, "Only a couple of times in the first two years did we make a formal presentation at the White House." He said that the Bush White House had no one "thinking full time about political strategy" and that only three national polls were conducted in all of 1989.
Each scoffed at the use of polls as a basis for decisions on foreign policy. Asked how many questions he had asked about policy concerning Bosnia, Mr. Greenberg replied, "None." Mr. Steeper said no request for polling on the Persian Gulf war was made by Bush Administration officials.
Meeting at a resort hotel here at the association's 48th annual conference, the academic members of this group of poll takers, professors and market researchers were even less certain of the prescription the public wanted President Clinton to fill, although they attributed his election to the nation's sense of a faltering economy.
Diana C. Mutz, assistant professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said in a paper presented Saturday that mandates were historically forged in the aftermath of an election. She said Mr. Clinton had only a "mandate for nonspecific change by the time of his election" and had failed to move quickly to define one in its aftermath. Her paper was written with Kathy Cramer, a graduate student.
Another presentation challenged the poll takers' reliance on the reasons that people give for their voting choices.
Wendy M. Rahn, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said voters often don't know why they support a candidate and feel embarrassed to cite the "more emotional" reasons they do have. The result is often "a rationalization," rather than a true explanation, she said.
 
Some Campaign Insights
 Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Steeper also offered a variety of campaign insights. The Republican poll taker said Mr. Bush's greatest early problem was not his abandonment in 1990 of the campaign promise he made two years earlier to oppose new taxes. Indeed, Mr. Steeper argued, the public strongly favors tax increases combined with spending cuts, as last fall's budget agreement provided, over "no deficit plan at all," which was the only real alternative in Congress.
Mr. Bush's problem, Mr. Steeper said, was that 80 percent of the public said in the fall of 1991 that "the country is in a recession right now."
The "inflated approval ratings" as a result of the gulf war early in 1991 were a disservice, Mr. Steeper added, because they blinded the campaign to the economic issue for nearly a year.
Both poll takers agreed that Mr. Bush could have made more effective attacks on Mr. Clinton over his support of letting homosexuals serve openly in the armed services and over his record as Governor of Arkansas.
When the Bush campaign did turn to the Arkansas issue in late October, Mr. Greenberg said, "it took an enormous amount of resolve and a lot of people to persuade the candidate not to respond," and to continue talking about change, especially in welfare.

HEADLINE: Leader of Bosnia Denounces New Allied Plan to Limit Fighting

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 23

 BODY:
Angry and feeling betrayed by an American, Russian and European strategy aimed at curbing the fighting in this war-ravaged country, Bosnia's Muslim President today rejected the plan as "absolutely unacceptable."
The plan, announced in Washington on Saturday, effectively rules out international military intervention for the time being against the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of the country. 
 In an address to Bosnia's citizens this afternoon, President Alija Izetbegovic denounced the plan and called on the Bosnian people to use all available means to defend what was left of this country.
"We are not going to waste any more time on futile negotiations," he said.
 
Rejection of Vance-Owen Plan
 Attempts at international mediation of the conflict failed when the Bosnian Serbs rejected a plan drafted by Cyrus R. Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen, from the European Community. The plan, which had been accepted by Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, would have reorganized the republic into 10 semi-autonomous provinces on the basis of ethnicity and provided for the return of hundreds of thousands of Muslims driven from their homes.
The Clinton Administration supported arming the Muslims and carrying out air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, but retreated from that position in the face of Russian and European opposition. The plan announced on Saturday would rely on enhanced enforcement of United Nations economic sanctions to bring pressure against the Serbs and would guard six "safe havens" designated for Muslims.
President Izetbegovic's reaction was bitter. "If we hear correctly, the aggressor will not have to withdraw from the occupied territories," he said. "Our people who have been expelled will not be allowed to return to their homes."
The 13-month war in Bosnia has claimed well over 130,000 lives and driven more than two million people of all three ethnic groups from their homes.
The joint allied strategy calls for the United States to use air power if necessary to protect United Nations peacekeepers guarding Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa and Bihac. Mr. Izetbegovic today condemned the safe-haven concept as the equivalent of putting Bosnia's Muslims into reservations.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said just two weeks ago that establishing the havens would essentially mean putting Bosnian Muslims into ghettos and rubber-stamping the Serbian nationalists' practice of using terror to force Muslims from their homes, a policy known as "ethnic cleansing."
The Serb gunners above Sarajevo eased their artillery attacks on the Bosnian capital today after three days of intense shelling that left more than a dozen people dead and more than 100 wounded.
United Nations officials here said today that Saturday's artillery assaults on the city had left eight people dead in Serbian-held parts of the city. Nine others were reported dead in the areas of the city that came under Serbian attack.
Sarajevo radio reported today that the Serbian nationalists had continued their heavy artillery attack on the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj, which lies along a main highway, for the eighth day. Radio reports also said fighting continued near the Serbian-held town of Brcko, whose entire Muslim population was driven out last year.
In the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, a United Nations official said today, ethnic Croatian soldiers were evicting as many as 200 Muslims a day from apartments in an attempt to drive out thousands of refugees who sought shelter there over the last year. Some 100 to 200 Muslims in the Croatian-controlled half of Mostar were gathering in a makeshift shelters or hiding in abandoned buildings and the apartments of friends, United Nations officials said.
Saturday's statement by the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Spain warned Croatia that it would face economic sanctions if the Croatian Defense Council, the Zagreb-supported Croatian militia fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, did not cease its own "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims from areas it controls.
Mr. Christopher said on Saturday that the five countries' peace plan was intended to be a gradual, short-term measure to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia and not an effort to supersede the comprehensive Vance-Owen plan.
 
Balkan Update
 President Alija Izetbegovic of BOSNIA, speaking in SARAJEVO, rejected the new strategy for Bosnia backed by the United States and its allies, saying it rewarded Serbian aggression and would keep Muslims on "reservations" in United Nations safe havens.
At the UNITED NATIONS, diplomats said that the Security Council planned to approve the new strategy, but that the United Nations had not yet received the commitments of troops and money needed to make it work.
In WASHINGTON the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, said the plan amounted to writing off Bosnia as a state. He urged President Clinton to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.
Western officials said in Washington that the peacekeeping troops who are to protect the safe havens would be able to respond to localized attacks, but not to a determined Serbian assault.
In GENEVA, Balkan negotiators said they were relieved that the talks held by the United States ended with a resolve to pressure Serbs to accept the plan the negotiators had brokered.
In BELGRADE the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, called for direct talks between Serbs, Moslems and Croats to divide Bosnia into a confederation of three ethnic states.
Serbian gunners eased attacks on Sarajevo yesterday after three days of intense shelling that left more than a dozen people dead. Sarajevo radio reported that the Serbian nationalists had continued their heavy artillery attack on MAGLAJ, in the north. Radio reports also said fighting continued near the Serb-held town of BRCKO.
United Nations officials said Bosnian Croat troops were evicting as many as 200 Muslims a day in MOSTAR in a campaign to purge the city of 10,000 refugees who had arrived over the last year.
In the KOSOVO province of SERBIA, where ethnic Albanians make up a majority, gunmen ambushed a police van late Saturday, killing two officers. The province may be a flashpoint for widening the war.

New Study Turns Up Volume in the British Debate on Compact Disk Prices

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 23

 BODY:
Abba sang about it, and so did Pink Floyd, and now Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission is going to investigate it: money, and, more precisely, why Britain's record companies and retailers charge so much of it for compact disks.
The commission's investigation, which is expected to take about 10 months, will examine the marketing of recorded music in Britain for evidence of anti-competitive practices. The commission can recommend possible actions to the Trade and Industry Secretary. The study follows another investigation into the price of compact disks, which was conducted earlier this month by the National Heritage Committee of Parliament. 
 In announcing the latest study, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director general of fair trading, said that he had "not been satisfied" by the attempts to justify the prices of compact disks, which are "relatively high," compared with compact disk prices in the United States and compared with prices of cassettes.
 
 
Restricting Imports
 Sir Bryan said he was concerned that the record companies' use of copyright law to restrict imports of lower priced compact disks "may be frustrating competition."
The question at the heart of the matter is: Why do compact disks cost significantly more in Britain than in the United States?
For instance, the recent Dire Straits compact disk, "On the Night," is priced roughly the same at Tower Records in Piccadilly Circus and at Tower Records in Greenwich Village, but only because it is on sale at the London store. Eric Clapton's "Unplugged" is priced at $14.06, including tax, in New York and 12.69, or about $19.50, in London. The same price gap exists for Sting's "Ten Summoner's Tales."
In its study, the parliamentary committee found that five large record companies produce about 75 percent of all titles in Britain and distribute more than 85 percent of the titles. These companies, the committee said, "may or may not be monopolies, but they are undoubtedly dominant."
"They are each content that the market should bear prices well above the level costs alone would justify," it added.
The parliamentary commission found that on average, record companies charged British dealers 1.50 to 2 more, or about $2.25 to $3, than American dealers are charged.
The committee accused the major record companies and retailers of operating in effect, if not formally, as cartels, and called on the record companies, in particular, to reduce compact disk prices by at least $3.
The debate over compact disk prices, which has had considerable coverage in the press here, has been remarkable for Britain, a country where consumers are rarely moved to complain about anything.
The record companies attribute the difference in the prices between Britain and the United States largely to economies of scale.
 
 
U.S. Is No Comparison
 "Everything is cheaper in America," said Jeff Clark-Meads, director of communications at the British Phonographic Industry, which represents some 150 record companies. "Why are compact disks being singled out? Why not jeans? Why not food?"
Mr. Clark-Meads described as "childish" the parliamentary committee's contention that the record companies acted as a cartel and insisted that there were "no excessive profits" being made in compact disk sales. If record companies were forced to cut compact disk prices, he said, the smaller independent companies, "already hanging on by their fingertips," would be forced out of business.
The parliamentary committee also questioned the prices that record companies set for compact disks of back-catalogue jazz, classical and popular music, noting that these have few of the production costs of compact disks of new material.
 
'Profit Isn't a Dirty Word'
 "Profit isn't a dirty word," Mr. Clark-Meads said. "Something has to make a profit."
Testifying before the committee, Ed Bicknell, manager of Dire Straits -- the band that had a hit with "Money for Nothing" -- acknowledged that the independents might be hard-pressed to cut prices, but he asserted that the multinationals could afford to reduce their prices by about $1.50, to $3, "without too much headache." The major record companies, he contended, exaggerate the costs of manufacturing compact disks.
They also squander, through "profligacy," revenue that should be used to invest in new talent, said Elliot Rashman, manager of Simply Red, whose debut single was "Money's Too Tight to Mention."
Mr. Rashman said his band would lose money, at least in the short term, if compact disk prices went down. But he added "that is what my artist is prepared to accept because we also believe that more people will have access to what is the populist art."
Pop music may be a populist art, but not everyone sees the push for cheaper compact disks as a populist cause. Writing in The Independent newspaper, the columnist Simon Garfield dismissed the campaign as "absurd."
He was particularly perturbed that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was going to spend public money to investigate something "marginally less important" than the romance depicted in Tasters Choice advertisements. If it had to, Mr. Garfield mused, perhaps it would at least tackle "the truly important stuff," like "what becomes of the brokenhearted" and "who, exactly, put the bomp in the bomp-shoo-womp."

Berkeley Graduates Urged to Support Education

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., May 23

 BODY:
After a steel-band version of "Pomp and Circumstance," the California State Treasurer, Kathleen Brown, urged graduating law students on Saturday to "remember who you represent and be as generous to this state as it has been to you."
Elected in 1990, Ms. Brown is the daughter of one former California Governor and the sister of another. She has been the state's chief financial officer during what has been called the state's worst economic times since the Depression and is considered a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 1994. 
 "Today there are those who see the challenges of the state as insurmountable, who see the California state of mind as befuddled," Ms. Brown said. The state's social, economic and environmental problems "hardly justify a mind-set that says drop out or cut and run," she said.
In her commencement address, Ms. Brown said the state's financial problems were destroying California's public education system. The University of California's nine campuses face budget reductions for a fourth year in a row and officials are considering suspending several months of instruction next year to save money. Last month, the chancellor of Berkeley's campus threatened to resign over budget decisions.
"You should be the first to say, 'No, we are not going to sacrifice education to the short-term budget imperatives,' " Ms. Brown said. "The future of California is dependent on education. California is education, whether it be this university or an elementary school on the edge of some dusty town. What has been done to them is a travesty. Each of you has the power to make the personal commitment to support education with your time, your energy and with your money."
Ms. Brown spoke to 335 students of the 1993 class of Boalt Hall School of Law, in one of more than 50 ceremonies in Berkeley during the university's 125th commencement. A total of 8,000 degrees, including 5,400 bachelor's degrees, were conferred.
Ms. Brown, who graduated from Fordham University School of Law in 1985, told the hundreds of future lawyers that they "must enter the fray, be a player."
"Advancing a career in no way precludes advancing the world in which you live," she said.
The theme of remembering one's origins was echoed in another part of the campus at a special graduation ceremony for 215 Hispanic graduating students from all departments. The celebration was half in Spanish, half in English, and included dancers in Aztec costumes. Hanging across the stage, a white banner with red letters read, "Viva Cesar Chavez."
Recalling the contributions of Mr. Chavez, Carla Trujillo, master of ceremonies and a lecturer in the ethnic studies department, said the late union organizer would have been proud of the man who picked lettuce for 15 years and then received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Berkeley during the weekend.
"This is the kind of person the media should focus on instead of an Americano running around without his clothes on," said Ms. Trujillo, referring to a campus controversy overpublic nudity.
A student speaker, Selena Ortiz, a graduating sociology major, said that in her years at Berkeley the changing political atmosphere had meant that the term she used to refer to herself had gone from Hispanic to Mexicana to Latina, each making a different statement about identity.
"Regardless of what we call ourselves, fee increases have forced us to drop out of college and accept our dreams deferred," she said.
Other speakers at Berkeley's commencement were Mick Fleetwood of the rock group Fleetwood Mac, who spoke to graduates at the College of Letters and Science; the author Jessica Mitford, who spoke to mass communication graduates, and the Berkeley environmentalist David Brower, who spoke to environmental science graduates.
 
University of Virginia
About 20,000 family members and friends of the University of Virginia's class of 1993 gathered on the Charlottesville campus yesterday for the school's 164th commencement.
About 4,200 degrees were conferred at the main ceremony by the university's president, John T. Casteen 3d.
Afterward, several colleges held their own ceremonies. Julian Bond, the civil rights leader and a member of the history faculty, addressed graduates of the School of Law.
On Saturday, Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, delivered the class valediction address.
 
Brandeis University
Liv Ullmann, actress and good-will ambassador for Unicef, delivered the keynote address to the 933 graduates at Brandeis University's 42d commencement yesterday in Waltham, Mass.
Ms. Ullmann told the graduates that they were in charge of helping society understand the "new world order" and the horrors behind labels like "ethnic cleansing."
"You have inherited a world that desperately needs your leadership," she said. "You must trust and love."
Ms. Ullmann received an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Brandeis awarded 703 bachelor's degrees, 144 master's degrees and 86 Ph.D. degrees.
 
Mount Holyoke College
Judith Kurland, Commissioner of Health and Hospitals in Massachusetts and a Mount Holyoke alumna, delivered the main address to the 500 graduates yesterday at the 156th commencement of Mount Holyoke College, in South Hadley, Mass.
Ms. Kurland told the graduates to stand up for their opinions, to be strong women who "seek the public good, not the public applause."
Commissioner Kurland received an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Theodore R. Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Mount Holyoke, a women's college, awarded 496 Bachelor of Arts degrees and 4 master's degrees.
 
Colby College
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, presented the main address at Colby College's 172d commencement yesterday.
Colby conferred 480 degrees in ceremonies on the lawn of Miller Library on its Waterville, Me., campus.
In addition to Senator Dole, three people were awarded honorary degrees: Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations; David T. Kearns, retired chairman and chief executive officer of Xerox, and Brian P. Lamb, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of C-Span, the cable-satellite public affairs network.

Amherst College
Amherst College conferred 403 undergraduate degrees yesterday at the college's 172d commencement exercises on the Frost Library steps on the campus in Amherst, Mass.
On Saturday, Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, gave the keynote address to the 403 undergraduates on what is traditionally called Senior Class Day Exercises.
Mrs. Ogata spoke on the issue of refugees and was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws.
The college awarded seven other honorary degrees. They were presented to: Philip Gossett, dean, division of humanities, University of Chicago; Cokie Roberts, senior news analyst for National Public Radio; Philip Roth, novelist; John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Brookings Institution; John Fox Wieland, head of a large building company in the Southeast, and Thomas H. Wyman, former chairman of CBS.
 
Franklin and Marshall
Oscar Arias Sanchez, the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, addressed the 400 students receiving bachelor's degrees at Franklin and Marshall College's commencement ceremonies yesterday on the campus in Lancaster, Pa.
Mr. Sanchez, the former President of Costa Rica, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for devising a Central American peace plan, was awarded an honorary doctorate.
 
Tufts University
Tufts University held its 137th commencement yesterday in an outdoor ceremony on the university's academic quad on the main campus in Medford, Mass. The author Carlos Fuentes delivered the keynote address to 2084 graduates.
Mr. Fuentes spoke of the values of law and diplomacy and human rights. He urged the graduates to "begin a new, more human, more generous, more planetary history."
The university conferred 1,122 undergraduate and 962 graduate and professional degrees. Mr. Fuentes was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters.

HEADLINE: Hanoi to Admit Companies

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HANOI, May 23

 BODY:
Sev eral big United States companies Citibank, General Electric, Philip Morris and I.B.M. -- will soon receive licenses to open offices in Vietnam, Government officials said Friday.
Their applications are part of a growing wave of United States business interests in Vietnam despite a United States Government economic embargo. 
 The officials also confirmed a report in the Vietnam Investment Review, a business weekly, that the heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. had been granted a license to open an office in Hanoi.
Citibank would be the second United States bank authorized to open a representative office, after Bank of America. They join about 20 foreign banks represented in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon.
Vietnam, seeking to adapt its Communist economy to market principles, has welcomed United States businesses despite the embargo, which it hopes President Clinton will soon lift.
As a condition for dropping the sanctions, the United States has insisted on maximum Vietnamese cooperation in helping to close the files on missing United States servicemen from the Vietnam War.
Former President George Bush relaxed the embargo last year to allow United States companies to open offices, make contacts and sign contracts to go into effect if the ban was lifted. The embargo was imposed in 1964.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Rivals Face Apathy, Then Florio

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 23

 BODY:
After nearly six months of campaigning by Cary Edwards, James L. Wallwork and Christine Todd Whitman, the primary race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination has entered its final three weeks with a rush of radio and television advertisements, a stream of barbed exchanges and scant evidence that any of it has stirred the public's interest.
It may be nearing the end of a frustrating political season for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wallwork, who began their campaigns trying to overtake a huge lead in the polls by Mrs. Whitman but still trail her by double digits with just over two weeks before the June 8 primary. 
 Gov. Jim Florio is running unopposed for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
Staff members in Mr. Wallwork's and Mr. Edwards's campaigns have spoken privately in recent weeks about their frustrations and their candidates' frustrations over the inability to get their messages across and to cut into Mrs. Whitman's lead.
 
Theoretically, It Could Be a Race
 Adding to their concerns, Governor Florio has focused his attacks solely on Mrs. Whitman, making it clear that he expects to face her in November. These days, Mr. Florio never raises the names of Mr. Edwards or Mr. Wallwork.
Polling shows that there are enough undecided Republican voters to make the primary race a contest theoretically. And it is over the attention and votes of those people that the three major candidates for the Republican nomination are now fighting in the final weeks of the campaign.
Diane Walker, 45, a bookkeeper from Dunellen, is among that bloc of undecided Republican voters. Readily acknowledging that she had not followed the primary campaigns, she said she had not made up her mind about which Republican candidate, if any, she would vote for on June 8.
"I guess I feel it doesn't make that much difference at this point, unfortunately," Ms. Walker said last week.
Ordinarily, gubernatorial campaigns, even those for the primary, would attract more widespread public attention. But competing against such headline-grabbing events as the bombing of the World Trade Center and the heated debate over repeal of New Jersey's ban on semiautomatic weapons, this year's primary campaigns never caught the public's fancy, politicians and other experts say.
Mrs. Whitman has had much to do with setting the pace of the primary race, which she entered as the favorite on the strength of her near defeat of Senator Bill Bradley in 1990. Her campaign three years ago against Mr. Bradley, a Democrat, gave her the name recognition and political organization to become the acknowledged favorite in the race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.
And she has protected the lead by avoiding the media and, as much as possible, any venue that would place her alongside Mr. Edwards or Mr. Wallwork. In fact just about the only time she has appeared with the others has been at debates that were widely broadcast in the state.
"There is nobody in recent New Jersey political history who has had the advantage that she has had in the long lead time," said Neil Upmeyer, president of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues, a public policy organization based in Princeton. "She essentially won the Republican primary on General Election Day in 1990 when she almost beat Bill Bradley. She has been the presumed winner of the gubernatorial primary as long ago as that and it has been up to her opponents to dispel that image."
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a two-term Republican who was Mr. Florio's predecessor, says Republican voters have not been excited by much of what they have heard in the primary: clashes over the hiring of illegal immigrants by Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Edwards, embarrassing blunders like Mrs. Whitman's failing to vote in her local public school board election (the election ended in a tie and the school budget was defeated) and increasingly bitter attacks on each other.
"These are not the kinds of things that get people's juices going in a Republican election," said Mr. Kean. "I think the campaigns are too negative. I think what the public wants is a confrontation on the issues and that is not what they are getting."
Mr. Kean added that Mr. Florio, despite his lack of a primary opponent, still managed to distract attention from the Republicans.
"The early focus seemed to be totally on Florio and whether he could be re-elected," Mr. Kean said. "Instead of people focusing on the Republican primary, the story was: Has this Phoenix named Jim Florio been reborn politically or is it just a mirage? That made it more difficult for the Republicans to get their message out."
With time running out, television and radio ads are the only means left for Mr. Wallwork and Mr. Edwards to close the double-digit lead that Mrs. Whitman has enjoyed in a variety of polls since the official start of the primary season in January. And they have used those ads to pummel Mrs. Whitman over her wealth, her lack of experience in elected office and her campaign blunders.
The bumpy road to the nomination, coming after decades of electoral disappointments, has state Republican leaders fretting privately.
In the last 35 years, New Jersey voters have elected only three Republicans to statewide office: United States Senator Clifford P. Case, who served four terms between 1955 and 1979; Gov. William T. Cahill, who served one term from 1970 to 1974 but lost his re-election bid when he was defeated in a primary, and Mr. Kean, who left office in 1990 after two terms as perhaps the most popular governor in the state's history.
"Florio is the weakest Democratic gubernatorial candidate in a long time," said a senior official with the Republican State Committee, who insisted on anonymity. "But I hope that whoever our nominee is realizes that this guy is a tough fighter and has plenty of money. Only a fool ignores this guy as a campaigner."
Last week, the Republican Party began a $250,000 radio and television campaign attacking Mr. Florio's record $2.8 billion tax increase as well as the state's 9.1 percent unemployment rate.
Mr. Kean, who defeated Mr. Florio in the 1981 gubernatorial race by 1,797 votes out of nearly three million votes cast, also issued a warning about Mr. Florio's potential strength.
"Jim Florio is a tough guy and he won't always come after you above the belt," he said. "You have to be tough and you have to be ready if our candidate is going to be successful."

HEADLINE: Creditors Chip Away at Aga Khan's Legend

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 23

 BODY:
With his thoroughbred horses and luxury resort in Sardinia, with friends like Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat and his appetite for the best yachts, the Aga Khan has long been a symbol of wealth. In Italy, the country where he has concentrated much of his business, "ricco come l'Aga Khan" -- "rich as the Aga Khan" -- is an expression frequently heard.
But in a striking illustration of the severity of the recession afflicting Europeans and the fracturing of Italy's close-knit business establishment, even the Aga Khan has come unstuck. Creditor banks moved on Friday to seize the assets of his publicly traded Italian holding company after it missed a payment on its increasing debt. 
 For the Aga Khan, 57 -- the 49th hereditary leader of the world's 15 million Ismaili Muslims, followers of a branch of Shiite Islam, and a figure regarded by the faithful as a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed -- the banks' decision amounted to an extraordinary public humiliation.
He is a man with the discreet air that old money bestows, his personal wealth estimated at $1.4 billion. Just five years ago, his investments in the Costa Smeralda resort in Sardinia and in the Ciga hotel chain were being widely hailed as extremely shrewd.
"The Aga Khan has made a series of bad business decisions in recent years, plying investment into luxury hotels at a time when fewer and fewer people had the money to stay in them," said Isidoro Albertini, a veteran broker at the Milan Stock Exchange, where trading in the Aga Khan's companies was suspended on Friday. "And now he is paying the price."
The Aga Khan has made no comment on his troubles. He was unreachable today at his headquarters in Aiglemont, near Paris.
This Harvard-educated man has been unaccustomed to business setbacks. Dividing his time mainly between his French base, Italy and Switzerland, he has devoted much of his energy to improving the lot of the Ismailis, who are scattered through Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Shunning the glittering life of his father, Aly Khan, known to many in the West as Rita Hayworth third husband, the Aga Khan has combined the management of many orphanages, schools and hospitals in Asia and Africa with the quiet development of his business interests. Private enterprise, he has often said, is the best model for development in the third world.
A truly international man -- born in Switzerland, raised partly in Kenya, educated in America -- his undoing in Italy is thus a great surprise. It amounts to a cautionary tale in the vicissitudes of doing business in Europe at a time when recession has proved longer and far more severe than economists had predicted.
His misfortunes also underscore the particular difficulties of Italy, where the lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar in the last nine months amid severe political and economic disruption.
Even a year ago, there was little doubt that that the Aga Khan's problems would have been quietly resolved among the clubby Italian business elite. The Aga Khan's family had been legendary in Italy for years. But now, his close friend Mr. Agnelli has his own problems with corruption investigations at Fiat, and the discreet habit of mutual assistance that has characterized the upper echelons of Italian business has given way to a messy scramble to survive.
 
Italian Ventures
 In 1962, he first embarked on a major investment that led to the development of the then-deserted rocky northeast coast of Sardinia into the luxury resort that became known as the Costa Smeralda.
The resort was successful, earning the reputation of a millionaire's playground, and was followed by the acquisition of a Sardinian airline. But it was in the midst of the 1980's boom that the Aga Khan made his major Italian investment, buying the Ciga hotel chain.
Ciga is a special name in Italy, associated with luxury in much the same way as Tiffany's is in New York. Its jewels include the Danieli Hotel in Venice and the Grand in Rome.
Determined to build on this very special franchise, the Aga Khan embarked on an ambitious international expansion program, acquiring hotels like the Palace in Madrid. The company, which had 22 hotels when the Aga Khan bought it in 1985, now has 36 in six countries.
With the expansion, though, came increased debt. An ill-timed decision to invest heavily in existing Italian hotels at the time of the 1990 World Cup soccer tournament, plowing over $80 million into two Milan establishments alone, exacerbated the debt problem. By this year, Ciga's debts had soared to $680 million, about double its annual revenue.
At the same time, demand plunged amid the recession. Where business travelers had been willing to spend $300 or more a night for a hotel room, some now balked. An overvalued lira made a difficult situation worse, as many potential tourists decided over 1990-1992 that Italy had simply become too expensive.
Ciga, which had been profitable in the 80's, plunged into the red, losing $67 million in 1991, the last year for which figures are available. Trouble also emerged in Sardinia, where a project to develop a big new resort area was blocked when planning approval was withdrawn amid environmental objections.
 
Response Is Cautious
 The Aga Khan responded cautiously. He declined to put any of his own fortune into an attempt to shore up the businesses, seeking instead to sell all or part of the hotel chain. As pressure increased from creditor banks, negotiations began last year with a private Italian property and leisure group, Situr.
These talks appeared to have led to a sale, but Situr balked at the last minute, citing unspecified irregularities in Ciga's accounts. Ciga denied the allegations, but it was not the first time that the company's dealings had been questioned. During the 80's the Aga Khan sold personal assets to Ciga for $136 million in a deal that was widely questioned.
With no other prospective buyers emerging, and the cost of servicing Ciga's foreign-currency debt spiraling after a sharp devaluation of the lira last year, the banks' nervousness increased.
This culminated in the move on Friday by IMI Bank A.G. of Germany to seize the assets of Fimpar S.p.A., the Aga Khan's holding company that controls Ciga. IMI leads a consortium of 16 banks that has lent $100 million to Fimpar. It says Fimpar has failed to pay interest on the loan.
While a spokesman for Fimpar, Claudio Miorelli, sought to play down the bank's decision by saying that it was no more than a precautionary move while negotiations continued on a debt settlement, it was clear that the Aga Khan's fortunes in Italy have come full circle. He is now in a situation in which he may be obliged to sell his hotel assets in a depressed market or face bankruptcy.
The Aga Khan almost certainly remains, in his own right, a rich man. But the air of unrufflable wealth and patrician calm that surrounded him has been destroyed.

News vs. Intelligence: Business Week Aims to Make the Distinction in its New Campaign

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
MARKETERS of name-brand products are not the only ones seeking to build business by convincing the consumer that they are "adding value" to what they sell.
Business Week magazine, in a campaign that begins today, will assert to potential advertisers and readers that it goes "beyond news," all the way to providing "intelligence." 
 "The news is the raw material, and the intelligence is what you make of it," Cara Erickson, vice president and director of marketing at Business Week, said during an interview last week. "We're saying that news happens, but intelligence is created."
In pursuing that strategy, Business Week, a McGraw-Hill publication, joins an ever-lengthening list of consumer-product marketers that are striving to assure customers that the products they purvey are more than mere commodities. The efforts come in response to shoppers' growing love for lower-priced brands that they perceive to be at parity with premium-priced counterparts in quality and performance.
"News is like a commodity item," said Ted Chin, president and creative director at Ted Chin & Company in New York, which was awarded the Business Week account in December. "We enhance the news; we give it perspective, analysis."
"In packaged goods, we call it a consumer benefit," he added.
The benefit implicit in the campaign is that the "intelligence" found in Business Week is better than the "news" found in rival magazines. To dramatize that distinction, the campaign's print advertisements, television commercials, transit posters and telephone kiosk signs portray Business Week as, in the words of one print ad, the business publication that "goes beyond traditional news to provide timely, in-depth, action-oriented intelligence."
The campaign also plays shrewdly upon the fear of failure that is endemic to a sluggish, thuggish business climate. "Japan's economic giants are meeting to shore up their economy and you missed that plane to Tokyo," one television spot says. "There is, however, an alternative way to get on board."
In a second spot, an announcer says: "In a glaring faux pas, the White House neglects to include you in a sit-down on health care." Then, above a rendition of "Hail to the Chief" by an unseen saxophonist, the announcer continues: "We apologize on their behalf. And offer up an equally informative invitation."
In a crowded business-publication field, the campaign seeks to create "the big idea" that was absent from the magazine's previous advertising, Ms. Erickson said. Mr. Chin's agency was named to handle the Business Week account a month after Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss in New York, which had handled it for four years, resigned, citing "creative differences."
For about a year, the Margeotes campaign for Business Week had carried the theme "Profit by It." Ms. Erickson called that phrase limiting -- unable to address readers as well as advertisers.
Business Week plans to spend from $2 million to $2.5 million on the Chin campaign, a budget that Ms. Erickson characterized as "bigger than in the past." The initial print advertisement, based on the White House television commercial, appears today on the back page of the Business Day section of The New York Times.
The television spots will start running the week of June 21 during local breaks on stations in Chicago, New York and San Francisco; they will appear during programs like "Northern Exposure" on CBS and "Seinfeld" on NBC. Ms. Erickson described those shows as "the programming the media kids make plans to watch," referring to the young media buyers and planners at agencies.
Ms. Erickson said Business Week executives had not determined whether the "Beyond News. Intelligence" theme would be integrated into the magazine's circulation promotion campaign. That series of one- and two-minute television commercials, which invite viewers to call a toll-free telephone number to order Business Week subscriptions, is created in-house rather than by Mr. Chin's agency.

Some Investors Enjoy Yields in Double Digits

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Despite the rush by states, cities and communities to refinance old higher-interest-rate debt, there are still a few high-interest-rate bonds out there that are clearly keeping some holders very happy in this new era of lower interest rates.
In some instances the investors who bought bonds in the 1980's with coupons of 10 to 15 percent are going to continue to be pleased because the bond issuers are having trouble refinancing them. In other cases, the bonds may be refinanced soon but the issuers have taken longer to act than they could have, so the bondholders have had a few more years of high interest rates than they might have. 
 Maggie Ashby, of the corporate trust department of the Peoples Bank and Trust Company in Indianapolis, is the bearer of good news to the holders of $1.4 million of bonds sold in 1983 to build the 60-bed Hillcrest Estates nursing home in Liberty, Ind. The bank is the trustee for the 15 percent, 30-year tax-exempt bonds, which could have been called or redeemed in April of 1990.
That 15 percent is equivalent to a taxable yield of 21.7 percent at the current top tax rate of 31 percent and of 24.8 percent at the top tax rate of 39.6 percent President Clinton has proposed. That is three times the yield on the current 30-year Treasury bond.
 
Looking for Refinancing
 "We get calls all the time from bondholders wanting to know if they are going to be called," Ms. Ashby said. "And all the bondholders are very happy it has not been called."
"We are looking for refinancing now but I am not sure I can get it," Robert Rynard, the owner of the nursing home, said in an interview. "Nursing home refinancing is not easy and no one knows what is going to happen to Medicaid, and half of the patients are on Medicaid."
This was an allusion to the uncertainty about the health-care industry while the Clinton Administration develops its health-care program.
But there are not many nuggets left and as investment banks comb the lists of such high-interest-rate bonds looking for new refinancing business to underwrite and from whom to collect fees, more are disappearing.
 
$5 Billion Double-Digit Bonds
 According to the Bond Buyer, the municipal bond industry's newspaper, there are about $5 billion of bonds, based on the original issue value, out there paying double-digit interest rates that are eligible to be called or refunded. A call date, usually 10 years after the initial issue, allows the issuer to pay off the bond early if interest rates decline. The Bond Buyer estimates there are about $500 million of such issues in New York, including the state, the city and other issuers.
The $5 billion, while a big number, compares with $120.5 billion of new issues sold just last year to pay off higher-interest-rate debt and a total of existing municipal bonds of over $1 trillion.
The $13 million in bonds sold to finance the parking garage connected to the Gallery shopping mall in Philadelphia are also still paying 15 percent. But this nugget seems about to disappear, although the interest rate has been paid longer than could be expected.
The 25-year bonds, issued in 1982, could have been called and paid off in February 1992. But a new financing package was too difficult to put together because of the downgrading of Philadelphia's credit rating to junk, which is below investment grade.
 
New Bonds Sold
 In addition, Federal limits on tax-exempt issues established in the late 80's prevented the advanced refunding of this high-interest-rate issue. This has been done in many other instances by selling new bonds ahead of the call date and paying off the old bonds by establishing an escrow fund filled with Treasury securities bought with the proceeds from new, lower-interest-rate bonds.
David Seltzer, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers in Philadelphia, said the firm expected to lead a refinancing of the Gallery garage issue in the next several months. And he said the 15 percent interest rate, which should be cut to near 7 percent, would give them the chance to achieve some of the largest refinancing savings ever.
In New York, one of the larger issues still paying a double-digit coupon -- 11.5 percent -- was sold in 1981 through the New York State Dormitory Authority for the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. These bonds, due in 2009, were callable in July 1991, which means the bondholders have had about two years of grace. A spokeswoman for the hospital said last week that a refinancing was being worked on now.
But another $6 million issue, also sold through the Dormitory Authority, for a hospital project in Binghamton, is expected to continue paying 11.75 percent interest until the bonds, sold in July 1982, mature in September 2010. David Kuam, an assistant director of financial analysis at the Dormitory Authority, said the small size of the issue made it too small to refinance. "When you tack on the new issue costs, it gets too expensive," he said.

A Flock of 'What Ifs?' Comes Home to Roost

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
In the multicultural American theater, A. R. Gurney may be the last playwright who writes full time about that quaint old bird, the New England WASP. Maybe it's an unfashionable calling, but Mr. Gurney's view of his terrain is so objective that his plays often fill in the missing pieces of the fractured American social puzzle. When you meet the economically rarefied yet often emotionally disadvantaged characters in Gurney plays like "Love Letters" and "The Cocktail Hour," you remember just why the rest of the country has spent 25 or so years fleeing in the opposite direction.
Austin, the Boston banker at the center of "Later Life," Mr. Gurney's enjoyable new 80-minute comedy at Playwrights Horizons, is one of the playwright's saddest creations. (Or half-creations. In the Playbill, Mr. Gurney acknowledges a debt to Henry James, whose tale "The Beast in the Jungle" seems the play's point of departure.) A smart and genial preppie in late middle age, Austin rather resembles the President he voted for in the last election. He's likable and polite, and he puts in his time at the office, but what exactly is he doing with his life? His children grown, his marriage ended by divorce, he is an empty suit longing to breathe free. 
 "Later Life" tells what happens when Austin (Charles Kimbrough) is unexpectedly thrown together at a cocktail party with Ruth (Maureen Anderman), a woman he met as a serviceman one night in Capri 30-odd years ago. Still young, single and "relatively free and clear," the pair almost spent the night together. But Austin was seized by the premonition that "something terrible was going to happen" to him in later life and dismissed Ruth with a kiss rather than risk ensnaring her in his cloudy future.
Now later life is accelerating, and the plot question of Mr. Gurney's play is whether Austin and Ruth will seize the second chance for happiness they have been handed. But that question cannot be answered until they resolve the question that hangs over the decades separating their brief encounters: did something terrible ever happen to Austin? Apparently not. He has gone on to what he considers a lucky life, notwithstanding his divorce and his current need for Prozac. Ruth, by contrast, lost a child to leukemia and is now trying to flee her fourth marriage, to an abusive gambler in Las Vegas. It's almost as if she had been given the terrible future Austin once imagined for himself.
Or so it might seem. The drama in Mr. Gurney's plays can never take place on the surface because it is the very nature of his characters that their surface remains impeccably civilized while all hell breaks loose underneath. It is also typical of Mr. Gurney's writing that he strips down his reticent WASP's to the sound of laughter, not sentimental strings. "Later Life" is no exception, offering more than a few lines worthy of New Yorker cartoon captions.
Many of the funniest passages belong to Anthony Heald and Carole Shelley, two of our best comic actors, who are here given the delightful task of playing all the revelers who wander onto the high-rise terrace where Ruth and Austin are trying to have their quiet tete-a-tete. Although some of their roles are one-joke stereotypes that reveal the limits of Mr. Gurney's range -- a Route 128 computer nerd, an acerbic lesbian, a Jewish earth mother -- the performers' own range seems limitless. They are priceless as a transplanted Southern couple on a cultural self-improvement kick and as an elderly couple engaged in a take-no-prisoners war over their retirement plans. And they are also unexpectedly moving as two old friends who preside over the party: a Harvard professor's widow who is the hostess, and a prematurely retired Brandeis professor who has channeled all sorts of disturbing rage into his doomed effort to quit smoking.
True to form, Mr. Gurney sometimes uses the various interlopers to spell out his themes, a tic that mars most of his plays. There are far too many lines reminding the audience that a literal and figurative twilight (and autumn) is at hand, that vulgar Southern and Western new money has overtaken Eastern old money, and that it is now or never if Austin is to follow the example of many of the party guests and break out of his Brahmin rut. This congenital refusal to let the audience discover his plays' characters and themes for itself is in part what often reduces Mr. Gurney's Jamesian and Cheeveresque esthetic designs to facile boulevard comedy.
But Mr. Gurney's boulevard comedy is of a high order, at times achieving the luster of Philip Barry and S. N. Behrman even in this circumscribed one-act piece. "Later Life" has been directed in the appropriately elegant, old-school Broadway style by Don Scardino on a starry romantic set by Ben Edwards. Not the least of Mr. Scardino's accomplishments is to recruit his two lead players, both of whom seem to have been absent from the New York stage almost as long as their characters have been separated.
Ms. Anderman's throaty voice and reserved smile help make Ruth a mysterious, alluring heroine whom the audience roots for and yet, like the frustrated Austin, feels it can never really know. Mr. Kimbrough, who has spent the last five years spoofing a television anchor on the sitcom "Murphy Brown," brings to "Later Life" a deeper, darker incarnation of the stuffy men he played in the Stephen Sondheim musicals "Company" and "Sunday in the Park With George."
His Austin really is a Jamesian figure, desperate to break out of his genteel cage but constitutionally unequipped to do so. Even when he raises his voice in passion -- "If that's love, I know nothing about it," he says to Ruth about her husband's brutality -- he could be disputing a meal charge at a men's club. Mr. Kimbrough's well-meaning yet hopelessly limited Austin is so human and elegiac an embodiment of the anachronistic American ruling class that he may even earn the sympathy of audiences who lowered the curtain on George Bush.

HEADLINE: Rehabilitating Empire Blue Cross

 BODY:
The board of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, asleep as the company's financial fortunes plummeted, has finally taken a corrective step by firing Albert Cardone, its chief executive. Mr. Cardone's imperious demeanor and lavish corporate life style annoyed Albany legislators and enraged customers hit with double-digit premium hikes. Following a spate of embarrassing revelations, the board admitted that Mr. Cardone had to go to allow Empire to repair its reputation.
Dismissing Mr. Cardone won't by itself solve Empire's glaring problems: huge losses, poor customer service, and actual and threatened lawsuits with large corporate clients. Empire needs an overhaul, not a mere shuffling of the names atop the corporate tote board. 
 Empire, the largest nonprofit health insurer in the nation, covers more than eight million New Yorkers. The state requires Empire to insure any applicant and charge a community rate unrelated to the applicant's medical condition. (Commercial insurers, by contrast, offer discounts to lure healthy customers -- a practice known as cherry picking.) In return, the Legislature grants Empire tax-free status and substantial discounts on rates it pays for hospital services. Nevertheless, Empire racked up losses of about $250 million the last two years.
Empire says the cherry picking has left it with unhealthy, expensive-to-cover enrollees. It also blames the recession that's hit the insurance industry. An independent audit ordered by the State Legislature agreed that economic forces were the primary reasons for Empire's poor showing.
But they weren't the only reasons. Empire's community-rated clients account for only about 15 percent of its business; it has also lost huge amounts on large corporate clients, who are not charged community rates, and on its health maintenance organization. Some of its best corporate clients have left because of poor service.
The audit report charged that Empire's management is autocratic, hierarchical and "slow to react to the pace of change . . . neither organized nor managed to become a market leader in innovation or quality improvement." And a recent series in The Times exposed a pattern of managerial miscues, including dubious sweetheart contracts with corporate insiders.
Since the audit report, A.T.&T., a major client, accused Empire of fraudulently failing to pass along discounts it received on hospital bills; indeed, for the type of contract it had with A.T.&T., Empire may have taken advantage of discounts for which it was not eligible. And two weeks ago The Times reported that the Federal Government was threatening to cancel Empire's contract for processing Medicare claims because of poor performance.
The report and subsequent revelations jarred the board. After extensive interviews, an investigating committee unearthed low morale and complaints about Mr. Cardone's brusque, autocratic style. Mr. Cardone didn't cause most of Empire's problems. But without the trust of the public, state legislators or subordinates, he was clearly not the leader to rehabilitate the company. The board finally got the message.

HEADLINE: Spend $2,500, Save $10

BYLINE: By Al Gore; Al Gore, the Vice President, speaks today to Federal employees involved in performance reviews of Government work. This article is adapted from his remarks.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As Congress considers President Clinton's economic plan, the focus is on reducing the deficit, spending less and increasing investments that create jobs. But there's another deficit we're addressing as well, the trust deficit: a widespread belief Government simply can't be trusted to spend tax dollars wisely. To eliminate that credibility gap, we're working to develop a new customer-service contract with the American people that has a simple goal. We want to make the Government work better and cost less.
Since President Clinton asked me to lead the National Performance Review -- a six-month comprehensive study of every Government agency -- I've heard from thousands of Federal workers and private citizens. 
 Consider what the Federal Marshals Service of the Justice Department faced when it wanted to get the lawns mowed at houses it seized in drug cases. I heard about it from an employee of the Marshals Service in Atlanta. The department resells the houses and uses the money to finance the war on drugs. But to sell a house, you've got to keep it presentable and that means mowing the lawn. In Atlanta, they thought they'd hire a teen-ager for about $10 a lawn. But procurement regulations dictated that they had to do it competitively -- and, of course, kids don't write bid proposals. So they had to negotiate a contract with a large firm to mow all the lawns in the Atlanta region -- for $40 a lawn.
Another Federal employee came to me with a contraption called a steam trap that's used to take dirt and oil out of steam lines. It costs about $100. When it goes bad, it leaks about $50 worth of steam a week. A Federal engineer wanted to replace some leaky ones. The problem was, the central procurement office had been directed to buy in quantity to save money. So the office saved up all its requests for traps for a solid year. It bought every $100 steam trap for $90 and saved $10. While it waited, each leaky trap cost the taxpayers 50 weeks of steam. That came to $2,500 -- $2,500 to save $10.
An Interior Department employee told me how she used the frequent-flyer miles she earned on Government travel to get a free ticket for a Government trip. But the trip required that she stay over for a Saturday night. She did, staying with friends instead of incurring hotel costs. But when she returned the department refused to pay the extra per diem -- $38 -- even though she had saved it $331 by giving up her Saturday in exchange for a free ticket.
In 1989, an administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration admitted to The Wall Street Journal that his agency did not even monitor the results of the $2 billion it spent each year.
A Department of Transportation employee told me about a telephone device for the deaf that the agency purchased for her use. She could have bought it retail for $300. The department paid $600.
These stories demonstrate that Government has a lot of good people trapped in bad systems.
We need to move from an industrial-age Government to an information-age Government. We are working to change the very culture of our Government. We want a Government that measures performance and puts its customers first. We want to inject competition within Government and make Government more market-oriented. We want to empower communities to solve their own problems, give workers the power to make their own decisions and then hold them accountable for the results.
This fall, the National Performance Review will produce a report with specific suggestions for steps we can take immediately and for longer-term action to bring about real change. It's time we created a Government that can move on issues as small as a steam trap and as large as our future.

HEADLINE: Free-Trade Treaty May Widen Traffic In Drugs, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER with TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Cocaine smugglers working with Colombian drug cartels are starting to set up factories, warehouses and trucking companies in Mexico to exploit the flood of cross-border commerce expected under the North American Free Trade Agreement, United States intelligence and law-enforcement officials say.
The Mexican smugglers are buying and setting up the companies "as fronts for drug trafficking," said a report written by an intelligence officer at the United States Embassy in Mexico City. The phenomenon was confirmed by a senior United States official who oversees enforcement of anti-drug laws and who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name. 
 The cocaine traffickers "intend to maximize their legitimate business enterprises within the auspices of the new U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement," the report said. The report was released under the Freedom of Information Act to the National Security Archive, a private research group in Washington that seeks to declassify Government documents.
 
Taking Advantage of Exemption
 The document said traffickers had also started to buy manufacturing and assembly plants known as maquiladoras as fronts for drug shipments, the senior United States official said.
Under a program established in 1965, the maquiladoras have special tariff exemptions, and the goods they produce move in and out of the United States with minimal inspection.
"A lot of intelligence demonstrates the drug traffickers' ties to maquiladoras," the United States official said. "They are investing in these plants for shipments to the United States."
United States investigators said that they first noted the phenomenon 16 months ago and that the problem was growing; Mexican officials, who first heard of it six weeks ago from their United States counterparts, said they knew of only a few such cases.
The intelligence report, intended mainly as a warning, did not specify how widespread the problem was or which companies the smugglers were investing in. Law enforcement officials on both sides of the border said they did not know the scope of the threat.
"The free-trade agreement makes the United States more accessible and convenient for traffickers," said a United States official involved in fighting drug traffickers. "It gives these people better opportunities to smuggle drugs."
The trade agreement, which was signed in December by President Bush, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, awaits approval by Congress and by the legislatures of Mexico and Canada. Over the next 15 years, it would gradually eliminate tariffs on goods traded among the three nations and eventually allow Mexican truckers to drive their rigs anywhere in the United States and Canada.
A trade expert and two former United States trade negotiators said that while United States and Mexican officials had foreseen the possibility that drug traffickers would take advantage of the trade pact, the problem was not raised during the negotiations. In fact, the pact does not address law enforcement issues related to trade.
 
Why It Wasn't Talked About
 "This was in the 'too hot to handle' category," said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and co-author of a favorable book about the trade pact. "It's a painfully obvious problem."
The challenges facing customs inspectors are already daunting. Mexican smugglers working with the Medellin and Cali drug cartels in Colombia already ship 50 percent to 70 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, hauling roughly 200 tons a year over the border and pocketing billions of dollars in profit.
The maquiladoras have grown over the past decade into Mexico's most important source of foreign exchange after oil. More than 2,100 maquiladoras employ half a million workers to make components or finished products from materials that are allowed into Mexico duty-free. The products, from furniture and television sets to auto parts, are shipped back by truck or train, with duty payments only on the value added in Mexico.
 
Drugs Among the Electronics
 A senior Mexican law-enforcement official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said the United States officials' warning could "definitely" be well founded.
He said officials were investigating a report of a cocaine shipment hidden in electronics components, although he had not confirmed that any specific maquiladora was being used to smuggle drugs.
Since Mexico deregulated its trucking industry in 1989, each maquiladora has been allowed to operate its own truck fleet and set up its own trucking company. That alone might make them attractive to smugglers.
"The issue of the maquilas is a new one," the Mexican official said. "There is no hard evidence, but these guys are not stupid, and the path is very clear."
A senior Mexican customs official who, following the policy of the Finance Secretariat, also insisted on anonymity, said maquiladora commerce was treated deferentially on both sides of the border. He said that the United States Customs Service has the right to inspect maquiladora and shipments, but that such checks are rare.
"I think the controls will, naturally, get looser" under the free-trade pact, the Mexican customs official said.
Thus the accord is likely to complicate life for customs supervisors like Bill Lackey, in El Paso.
At Mr. Lackey's post on Friday, a line of tractor-trailers spewing diesel fumes stretched for a quarter of a mile across the Bridge of the Americas into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, waiting for inspections by the two officials on duty.
About 1,700 trucks cross the bridge over the Rio Grande each day, almost all from maquiladoras making textiles and electronic components. Inspections last as little as five minutes.
 
Conflicting Goals at Border
 "We understand they have to get in and get out," Mr. Lackey said. "That is their living. We respect each other. The people coming across understand our problems and adapt to that."
Customs officials are torn between the goals of stopping contraband and supporting commerce. Today "most trucks that go through customs go through almost unimpeded," said Mike Lane, the deputy customs commissioner at El Paso.
But he said 300 new inspectors and new surveillance gear at the 22 customs posts between the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico would help ferret out the smugglers.
Others familiar with the cocaine trade express doubts.
"The passage of Nafta will clearly put additional strain on customs at the borders," said Assistant United States Attorney Glenn MacTaggart, who prosecuted members of the so-called Juarez cartel, one of the Mexican syndicates cited in the intelligence report.
The Juarez cartel imported the biggest cocaine cache ever seized in the United States, a 21-ton supply found in 1989 in a warehouse near Los Angeles.
"If Nafta provides opportunity for legitimate businesses, it may clearly provide opportunities for illegitimate businessmen," Mr. MacTaggart said. "It's almost common sense."
Under the trade agreement, the export of Mexican products in Mexican trucks would vastly expand. Today, a tractor-trailer truck owned by a Mexican company cannot travel beyond a narrow commercial zone near the border, and trailers are transferred there to American haulers. If the pact is approved, a Mexican trucker will be able to travel to any point in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas by 1997, and anywhere in the United States and Canada by 2001.
Evidence suggests that tractor-trailers are becoming a vehicle of choice for Mexican drug smugglers. One truck that was halted in April 45 miles southeast of San Diego held eight tons of cocaine stuffed into cans of jalapeno peppers. American law-enforcement officials said they believed the cocaine belonged to a businessman who owns one of the biggest trucking companies in Mexico.
The cans of peppers were marked "La Comadre" -- The Godmother.

HEADLINE: Democrats Drop Donors' Session With President

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Democratic Party must have figured it had come up with an an offer no lobbyist could refuse. In invitations faxed and mailed all over the city last week, the party offered a weekend retreat, including a big breakfast with President Clinton, intimate briefings with senior White House officials and a gala dinner party.
The price: $15,000 a couple. Political action committees and deep-pocket corporate contributors were especially welcome. 
 But after discussions with the White House -- already smarting from a bad run of allegations of cronyism and misusing the perquisites of office -- the party canceled the breakfast with the President today after a reporter called to ask about Mr. Clinton's participation.
A party spokeswoman said the breakfast was abandoned to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
Some White House officials said they were not even aware of the party's plan to have the President attend the breakfast until it was brought to their attention.
The fund-raising scheme, which mimics an approach made popular by Republican Administrations, offers potential donors a chance to participate in a weekend of activity that includes a buffet dinner with Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, the breakfast with Mr. Clinton, and several briefings with senior Administration officials. The events are to be capped by a gala at the Washington Convention Center.
"I don't think in any way, shape or form that we are selling access to this President or this Administration at all," said Catherine Moore, the spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. "We're a political party that has to raise funds. We're doing all we can to increase our small donor base and broaden our donor base across the country."
Ms. Moore said senior officials would still participate because "there's a difference between access and briefings."
Still, invitations to the June fund-raising "retreat" have been raising the eyebrows of lobbyists and prominent Democrats here at a time when the Administration's campaign finance bill is headed for the Senate floor.
The idea of allowing contributors to sidle up to the President and his chief policy makers in less than formal ways is not new. The Bush Administration was criticized for offering special "issues briefings" for a fee.
And Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, while head of the Senate Finance committee, offered 200 Washington lobbyists and directors of political action committees the chance to have breakfast with him once a month if they contributed $10,000 each to his re-election campaign. He later canceled the practice after admitting that it was a "doozy" of a mistake.
But Clinton Administration officials have said they would set a higher moral tone. Mr. Clinton pointedly refused contributions from political action committees during his campaign, and he has frequently spoken of the need for political reform in Washington. The campaign finance overhaul measure now before the Senate has been presented as a drastic change from business-as-usual political fund-raising that will level the playing field for candidates.
Yet Mr. Clinton helped raise more than $3.5 million for his party at a star-studded dinner at Lincoln Center in New York earlier this month. And by specifically soliciting corporate contributions in the invitation to the June retreat, the party is leaving the door open for the kind of unrestricted donations that would be outlawed if the proposed rules are enacted.
"They shouldn't be doing it," said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause. "It's the same thing the Republicans did with Bush. You're holding up the notion that you're selling access to the President and the Cabinet and officials, depending on how much money you're prepared to give."
Mr. Wertheimer said ommon Cause, the public interest lobby, would push the Senate to amend the campaign finance bill submitted by the President to specifically bar the solicitation of money based on access to Federal officials.
White House officials said they were aware of the President's Dinner, scheduled for June 28, but not about the events surrounding it. The money raised goes to the Democratic Party and its candidates around the country, not just to the President.
 
Loopholes to Evade Limits
 The President's Dinner, used by both parties as a staple of their money-raising activities, has been the target of criticism before. Although individuals can buy a ticket to the dinner for $1,500, many corporations and other groups in the past have bought several tables, using loopholes in the campaign finance law to evade limits.
One common technique is for corporations to solicit contributions from employees, bundle them together and buy blocks of tickets. One of the chairmen of the dinner that Republicans held last year was James R. Elliott, an Illinois businessman who was sued by an employee who charged that he had been forced to buy tickets.
White House officials have said they will continue to abide by the rules as they now stand.
"We are working day and night to change the campaign finance system," one Administration official said. "The President has proposed soft-money reforms that will take literally tens of millions of dollars out of the party's coffers and restrict his own ability to raise money."
One Administration official said, "We're not going to unilaterally disarm by stopping our fund-raising while the Republicans who are blocking reform continue to raise money."
The weekend retreat will begin the night of June 27 with a buffet dinner at the Mayflower, a hotel a few blocks north of the White House that is the headquarters of the event. The invitation promises the attendance of "honored guests such as Mack McLarty or Bob Rubin," the chairman of the President's national economic council.
The participants will attend a briefing at the Old Executive Office Building, where much of the White House staff works. In the afternoon, ticket holders will join other top Administration officials for afternoon sessions at the Mayflower.
Listed as "suggested speakers" for the afternoon are Mr. Rubin; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers; Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director; Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Ira C. Magaziner, the manager of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform, who has emphasized the importance of keeping special interests at an arm's length.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides Propose Renewal of China's Favored Trade Status

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Top advisers to President Clinton recommended today that he renew China's favorable trade status, Government and human rights officials said this evening. But they said he should require that Beijing improve its human rights record before any further annual renewals are granted.
The President did not immediately endorse the recommendation but told his aides to brief Congress on Tuesday. 
 The effort by the White House is an attempt to make good on promises that Mr. Clinton made in the Presidential campaign, when he repeatedly accused the Bush Administration of failing to use trade as a lever to force China to improve its rights record.
 
Tariffs Would Rise Sharply
 The President could have canceled China's favorable trade status, but since taking office he has come under pressure from those who say continuing trade with China is the best way to improve conditions there and from business executives who quail at the thought of losing such a vast market.
If China lost its "most favored nation" trade status, tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States would rise from an average of 8 percent to about 40 percent.
Mr. Clinton can change course if members of Congress object to the plan, which would impose conditions by executive order rather than by law.
The plan would require substantial progress by Beijing on human rights issues, like a full accounting of the whereabouts of political prisoners. But it would not link renewals to progress on any single issue.
The most delicate issue currently arises in Tibet, where a demonstration today against Chinese rule became rowdy, leading the police to break up the rally with tear gas. [Page A3.]
The memorandum also says China must curb the spread of missile and nuclear-weapons technology and provide more access to its markets.
China agreed last year to limit its exports of ballistic missile technology, to protect foreign copyrights and trademarks and to lower tariffs on a broad range of goods.
The recommendation from Mr. Clinton's advisers suggests a softening of his final position in the Presidential campaign, which in turn was less stringent than his original stand.
In December 1991, at a debate in New Hampshire, he said China's access to the United States market should be closed entirely unless democratic changes were made by the end of 1992.
In his campaign manifesto last summer, Mr. Clinton wrote: "We believe that the Bush Administration erred by extending most-favored-nation trade status to the People's Republic of China before it achieved documented progress on human rights. We should not reward China with improved trade status when it has continued to trade goods made by prison labor and has failed to make sufficient progress on human rights since the Tiananmen Square massacre."
Since he assumed office, President Clinton has come under intense pressure from business and farm groups not to impose any conditions on China, which has one of the fastest growing economies. More than 300 large corporations and trade associations wrote him on May 12 urging an unconditional extension.
Under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974, China and other Communist countries may retain the favorable trade status only if they receive certification by the President that they allow emigration. China's status is to expire on July 3 unless President Clinton announces by June 3 that he intends to extend it.
Almost all of United States trading partners have the favorable trade status.
 
Threat of Retaliation
 Beijing has threatened to retaliate against United States exports if its trade status is canceled or if any conditions are imposed by legislation. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Chinese officials have been less critical of conditions imposed by executive order.
Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine and majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, have introduced legislation that would also require substantial overall progress on human rights, but both have said they would accept Presidential conditions instead. "What we want more than anything is a unified message from the President and the Congress," Ms. Pelosi said this evening.
Ms. Pelosi said she had spoken at noon today with Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, who did not present an Administration position. A spokeswoman for Senator Mitchell said the Senator had also spoken with Mr. Lord, who visited China this month but failed to win any clear concessions.
Mr. Lord is to brief the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees trade policy, on Tuesday morning. Michael Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Asia Watch, said a final announcement could come Thursday.
 
Possible Fight in Congress
 Today's decision does not solve the Administration's political troubles with China's trade status. Any member of the House of Representatives may force a floor vote within 60 days of a Presidential decision to extend the favorable trade status of a Communist country. To override the President, the House and Senate must both vote to cancel the decision.
In a recent interview, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York, said he planned to force such a vote in the House. But no one in the Senate has expressed any enthusiasm for such a move, making it unlikely President Clinton would lose.

HEADLINE: White House Asked Aid Of F.B.I. in Dismissals

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Amid concern in the White House last Friday over charges that cronyism lay behind the dismissal of seven travel aides, Clinton advisers summoned a senior official in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to a political strategy session and solicited a public statement from the agency backing their version of events.
By calling on the F.B.I. to help save the Administration from embarrassment, the White House appeared to be deviating from two decades of efforts to insulate the law-enforcement agency from even the appearance of Presidential manipulation. 
 It also put the bureau in the position of departing from what some F.B.I. officials said had been two long-standing practices: dealing with the White House only through the Justice Department to avoid the appearance that the bureau was being enlisted for political ends, and avoiding confirmations of the bureau's investigations. In the past, F.B.I. officials have been disciplined for disclosing investigations.
An Administration official said tonight that Attorney General Janet Reno had called the White House counsel, Bernard Nussbaum, today to complain about the White House not having gone through her office to deal with the F.B.I. statement. The official told of the complaint in confirming an account in the Tuesday issue of The Washington Post.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Nussbaum said that in his conversation with Ms. Reno he had "reaffirmed" that "it has been and remains the policy of the White House that any contact" with the F.B.I. would be made through the Attorney General's office. The original contact with the F.B.I. was made by the White House, he said, because officials there regarded the suspicion of improper acts in the travel office as a police matter.
The disclosure of the White House's interaction with the bureau came during questioning of George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, by reporters at today's news briefing.
 
'We've Got to Do Better'
 Mr. Stephanopoulos also acknowledged that President Clinton was "disappointed in what happened" last week, when the furor over the dismissal of the travel office staff and over the President's expensive haircut at Los Angeles International Airport diverted attention from his economic message. Mr. Stephanopoulos said the President "feels we've got to do better, and we will."
"What we saw last week isn't going to happen again," Mr. Stephanopoulos added. But he no sooner uttered those words than he found himself bombarded by questions about the links between the White House and the F.B.I. in the travel office dismissals.
John Collingwood, the bureau official who attended the White House meeting, said that no one had tried to manipulate the agency into backing the White House findings of mismanagement. "I'm very confident we followed our normal practice here," he said.
Nevertheless, he said he was "surprised" when Presidential aides on Friday took the highly unusual step of releasing an F.B.I. statement not intended for public release, confirming that a Federal inquiry was under way.
 
Political Strategy Session
 While the F.B.I. normally does not disclose investigations, he said, this particular statement was consistent with the bureau's policy of acknowledging some high-profile investigations if the facts have been disclosed by a credible source, in this case the White House.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said today that last Friday, Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, called Mr. Collingwood, the bureau's director of public affairs and Congressional relations, and asked him to meet in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office with Mr. Stephanopoulos; Ms. Myers; David Watkins, assistant to the President for management and administration, who supervised the travel office; Mr. Nussbaum and two members of his staff.
White House officials acknowledged that the meeting was a political strategy session on how to quell the furor over the abrupt dismissal of the travel office staff.
The F.B.I. official was asked to help draft a statement on Friday afternoon after several news organizations obtained a memorandum written by Mr. Clinton's cousin, Catherine Cornelius, less than a month after Mr. Clinton took office, proposing that the White House dismiss the seven career travel office employees and put her in charge.
The disclosure of the Cornelius memo had called into question the White House's claims that the members of the travel office staff were dismissed purely because of mismanagement and possible criminal behavior.
 
Possible Criminal Behavior
 Normally, bureau spokesmen neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, except in unusual cases when it has come to light independently. Some F.B.I. officials said privately last week that they were uncomfortable with the way their agency was being brought into a case with apparent political ramifications.
Nevertheless, bureau officials also said there appeared to have been adequate grounds to begin a preliminary criminal investigation, as the White House had claimed.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said the Clinton team had "talked to" the F.B.I. official about issuing a statement backing the White House claim of possible criminality. That claim was based on an earlier investigation of the office by the accounting firm of Peat Marwick. Mr. Stephanopoulos said no coercion had been involved, and that it was simply a discussion between the White House and the F.B.I. about what, if anything, the bureau would feel comfortable saying at that stage of the investigation.
 
Reno Met With Sessions

As the White House was releasing the bureau's statement last Friday, Ms. Reno and the F.B.I. Director, William S. Sessions, were meeting to discuss his future with the agency. Mr. Sessions has been under fire for months, and his job is currently under review by the Clinton Administration because of allegations of wrongdoing that were brought by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Sessions played no role in approving the bureau's statement about its investigation of the travel office.
Asked if he had been aware that it was not standard practice for the F.B.I. to confirm investigations, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "I'd have to check the standard practice."

HEADLINE: TIBETANS PROTEST CHINA'S IRON RULE

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 24

 BODY:
Hundreds of Tibetans protested against Chinese rule today in the most serious such demonstration in the last few years, American travelers said by telephone.
The authorities initially permitted the protest, but when it grew, they responded by firing barrages of tear gas at the protesters. The police detained at least nine foreigners briefly and warned all foreigners to stay off the streets on Tuesday because of concerns that the protests will continue. 
 The last major demonstration in Lhasa occurred in March 1989, when anti-Chinese rioting led the Government to impose martial law for 13 months.
The demonstration today, in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, reportedly began shortly after noon as a protest against inflation and the lifting of price controls on food. But by the late afternoon the slogans changed -- to "Chinese out of Tibet!" -- and the crowd grew.
By some accounts, scattered stones were thrown at Chinese police cars, but by and large the protest was peaceful. The police also responded with relative restraint, relying on tear gas grenades instead of live ammunition as they did in demonstrations in the 1980's.
 
Protesters Disperse
 The tear gas dispersed the demonstrators, but some told foreigners that the protests would resume on Tuesday. The American travelers, all Tibetan-speakers who spoke independently by telephone, said that the Chinese police were patrolling the streets with machine guns.
The demonstration presents a major challenge to the Chinese authorities. If they do not respond harshly, the protests could quickly spread because of the simmering hostility that many Tibetans feel toward the Chinese. Many experts believe that animosity has reached the point that protests will grow unless they are immediately countered with force and fear.
Yet a major crackdown on Tibetan protesters would stir protests from abroad at precisely the time when Chinese leaders are trying to be on their best behavior. President Clinton must decide within the next two weeks what kinds of human rights conditions to attach to China's trade status, and the International Olympic Committee will decide in September whether to allow Beijing to play host to the Summer Olympic Games in the year 2000.
The authorities did not release any information about the protests.
 
Report From American
 "It started as an economic protest, and so the Chinese didn't stop them," a 25-year-old American witness said. Like the others, he declined to be quoted by name for fear of being detained and expelled. "There were about 150 people to begin with," he added. "Lots of police were watching, but they didn't do much at first."
The protesters marched several miles to the other side of Lhasa, all the way to a Holiday Inn, where a delegation of European ambassadors stayed last week. The ambassadors suspended part of their program after learning that three Tibetans had been arrested for trying to contact them. The protesters may not have realized that the entire delegation left Lhasa on Sunday.
The American witnesses said that by about 6 P.M. there were 500 or 600 protesters, and that the mood became much more political. In addition to demanding that Chinese leave Tibet, the protesters accused the Chinese of corrupting young Tibetans.
In addition to firing tear gas, the police may have used their guns. A 20-year-old American woman said she had heard what she believed were gunshots, and she and another American said they had reliable information that one Tibet man was shot in the leg.
Tibet, a remote Himalayan region that China insists is an indivisible part of its territory, is overwhelmingly Buddhist, and the inhabitants revere the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader. China reasserted control over Tibet in 1950 -- after decades in which it was pretty much left to itself -- and on Sunday China commemorated the 42d anniversary of what it calls the "peaceful liberation" of Tibet.
Lhasa is 1,700 miles from Beijing, and reliable information is difficult to come by. No Western diplomats are based in Tibet, telephone connections are troublesome, and the authorities ban journalists based in Beijing from visiting the region.
An American woman reached by telephone said the police detained her for seven hours after she took photographs of the protesters. She said the police had confiscated her film but were polite and even friendly.

HEADLINE: Media Memo;
Struggling to Bring the Health-Care Debate Home to Readers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
There are many unknowns about the health-care proposal that President Clinton is to unveil next month, but one thing is certain: press coverage of it will be virtually endless after the secret Washington sessions end.
Less certain is whether all that coverage will be comprehensible. 
 The national health-care debate, perhaps as much as any news story in years, is testing journalism's ability to do its job, to explain to people why they should care. The issues are highly technical, and even the language of the discussion has been dictated in Washington by policy experts.
Journalists' ability to translate that debate effectively is likely to help determine the fate of efforts to change the health system. It could also set a standard for the news media in trying to explain an increasingly complex world.
 
What Does it Mean to Me?
 Around the nation, reporters and editors say they are struggling with how to bring the health-care debate home to readers. Like such difficult subjects as the economy or the savings and loan crisis, health policy almost defies simplification.
In interviews, editors said they were aware of the dangers in covering such a complicated issue.
"If you don't present the issues in ways that people can understand -- 'What does it mean to me?' -- your coverage is inadequate," said Clark Hoyt, chief of Knight-Ridder's Washington bureau.
But editors also said they felt compelled to keep up with the policy debate. "You have to cover the Washington maneuverings and cover them closely," said Norman C. Miller, national editor of The Los Angeles Times.
Mr. Miller and other news professionals said it was especially difficult right now to try to translate the topic into meaningful articles focused on individual problems and consumers because there was no specific plan.
 
From Country to Capitoal
 Americans put health care on the national agenda, motivated in large part by the reporting of such emotional subjects as people's fears of slipping through health-insurance cracks. And many major newspapers continue to try to show the impact of potential Washington decisions on individuals.
But as the debate moved from the country to the capital, readings of 10 major daily newspapers earlier this month showed that news coverage had centered less on the way decisions might affect people and more on policy battles, multibillion-dollar national price tags and political speculation about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton, the head of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform, would be able to pull it off.
In a detailed policy debate, news organizations have two jobs: to explain how decisions are made and to show how those decisions affect people. The difficult part for news organizations, as the debate grows in Washington, is to keep the policy coverage from overshadowing the "what does it mean to me" coverage.
 
'Media Can Sink This Ship'
 "If we continue to see the multi-billion-dollar stories and the horse-race stories, if that continues to dominate media coverage, then the media can sink this ship as surely as they brought it up," said Kevin Anderson, a spokesman for the Alliance for Health Reform, a nonpartisan group that provides education on health-care issues. Mr. Anderson is a reporter on leave from USA Today.
If the health-care debate seems too remote or too focused on reducing costs nationally, some who have studied the issue say, that could persuade people to cling to the status quo.
Robert J. Blendon, chairman of the department of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, recently reviewed news coverage of efforts by the Truman and Nixon Administrations to enact health plans. Then and now, he said, news organizations had difficulty focusing on the relatively simple questions people ask: Will there be a doctor in my town? How much will I have to pay? Will I have a choice about where I go for care?
Dr. Blendon said that too many reports presented a muddle of official proclamations and trial balloons, analysis of health-care systems and expert debate about cost as a percentage of gross national product. At the same time, he said, opponents of proposed health-care changes zeroed in on people's real interests. In paid advertisements, opponents raised questions like this one from an old advertising campaign: Do you want the Government between you and your doctor?
 
Focus on 'Keyhole' Reporting
 "The press gets it wrong in terms of addressing what people care about," Dr. Blendon said, "and the people who take out full-page ads get it right."
In an article published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Blendon argued that "in both historical cases, as well as the present day, the special interests found an inadvertent ally in the media" because news organizations were too often guilty of "neglecting the informational needs of the American public."
Mr. Anderson of the Alliance for Health Reform echoed the views of several journalists when he said he believed that reporters would cover the issue much more from a "what does it mean to the reader" perspective once the President makes his proposal public.
In the meantime though, he said, news accounts suffer because so many reporters are engaging in what he called "keyhole" reporting of what is going on behind the closed doors of the health task force. Major news organizations battle each other every week to report the latest leak.
In recent weeks, there have been some efforts to reduce the policy discussion to human terms. A Los Angeles Times article by Sara Fritz, for instance, approached the issue this way: "When Joan Ravenna had a heart attack a few years ago, she had to wait more than 20 hours before being examined by a cardiologist. As she remembers it, she could easily have died that day as a result of flaws in the system of 'managed care' that President Clinton is advocating for all Americans."
Much more of the coverage appears to be aimed at people who view health care as a policy question rather than a personal one. But, in interviews, journalists said that current coverage was not a fair sample of their work because there was no specific Clinton proposal to describe.
Even so, it is not clear that much of the media will be able to shift gears once the specifics are known. Even some of the nation's best newspapers have occasionally presented a mass of statistics and aggregate information that would be impenetrable to even the most informed reader.
For instance, Steve Sternberg in The Atlanta Constitution began a recent front-page article this way: "President Clinton's health-care reform plan hinges on a $1 trillion question: Can the Government cover 37 million uninsured Americans and enhance care for everyone else without adding $30 billion to $100 billion to the nation's annual $900 billion medical bill?"
Other reporting has become preoccupied with describing what the Clinton advisers are considering -- then afterward often reporting that they will not necessarily do that after all. Some Washington veterans say they sense a classic trial-balloon scenario, in which the Administration uses the press to test public reaction.
 
Balloons Floated, Then Popped
 The New York Times on May 11: "President Clinton's health-policy advisers have been developing plans to incorporate Medicare into a new health-care system, even as they have assured elderly people that no major changes were imminent."
USA Today on May 12: "White House health adviser Ira Magaziner said Tuesday, there's no plan to tinker with Medicare."
Some critics say news organizations have begun following the Washington doings as if the pressing national question were who's up and who's down. And they say the press often misses out on what kind of health care might be delivered in the neighborhood medical office.
Professor Blendon traced the media's institutional approach to the issue, in part, to the fact that health-care reporting is now largely the domain of political reporters who are used to seeing things from a Washington perspective.
But even health writers, he said, are often captives of the experts they interview. Mr. Magaziner, manager of the President's task force and therefore the current leading expert in residence, often uses jargon like "actuarially, you would get killed on your cost," when speaking publicly about the issue.

New CNN Channel Planned

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 24

 BODY:
Ted Turner said today that his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. was developing a new Cable News Network international news channel and a new entertainment channel that would offer classic films.
Speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit, Mr. Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting, said the CNN international channel might be marketed in the United States by the end of the year, and the movie channel in the "not-too-distant future." 
 "Those are two new channels we have on the drawing boards," Mr. Turner said. "Neither one of them have been approved by the board of directors yet."
He said the commercial-free movie channel would offer older M-G-M, Warner Brothers and RKO films and would compete with the American Movie Classics channel.
The CNN international channel will be about 80 percent different from CNN's domestic news network and will be marketed "to people who are more interested in international news," Mr. Turner said. It will offer more in-depth analysis than network news programs do, he said.
Mr. Turner also said he was open to future changes in the operating and ownership structure of Turner Broadcasting. But he declined to be specific about the future roles of Tele-Communications and Time-Warner Inc., which own 23 percent and 19 percent of Turner's equity, respectively.
Both companies have reportedly discussed splitting up Turner's assets between them. John Malone, chief executive of Tele-Communications, has said his company is "very interested in all of the assets of Turner Broadcasting."
Mr. Turner said it was unclear how the company's relationship with its two major shareholders might change. "That's impossible to read," he said. "They're both very ambitious companies, and they want to grow."

HEADLINE: A NEW PRESIDENT FOR CITY COLLEGE

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
The trustees of the City University of New York last night appointed a black anthropologist from an urban California campus as the next president of City College, long the jewel but now one of the most troubled of the university system's 21 campuses.
In selecting Dr. Yolanda T. Moses as City College's new president, the board chose a little-known vice president for academic affairs from California State University in Dominguez Hills, a largely black suburb of Los Angeles, who is known as a strong proponent of cultural diversity. 
 After a private 90-minute session, board members emerged to announce the appointment of Dr. Moses, echoing the earlier assessment of the search committee, that she was the best person for the job and would be familiar with many types of problems facing City College.
"We need someone who can deal with the rescuing and rehabilitating of the reputation of the school," said Dr. James L. de Jongh, chairman of the college's Faculty Senate and a member of the search committee. "I think she's the best person to deal with these things."
Chancellor Dr. W. Ann Reynolds said that Dr. Moses is a "teacher, scholar, administrator: she has done all three and done them extraordinarily well."
Dr. Moses, 46 years old, is to take over City College as it struggles with financial difficulties, faces a major reorganization and is still reeling from a controversy in which one of its department heads successfully sued the college for thwarting his First Amendment rights.
In a telephone interview last night, Dr. Moses said that she was well aware of the college's problems, and that her first move would be to "walk the halls, knock on doors and sit down and talk with different groups of people."
"I plan to do a whole lot of listening," she said.
The vote to appoint Dr. Moses, who is to take on the $119,000-a-year position beginning Aug. 1, was 12 to 1. One board member, Herman Badillo, objected to the appointment, saying he feared she would sacrifice scholarship at City College in her pursuit of diversity.
"I am very disturbed by many of Ms. Moses's ideas and philosophies," said Mr. Badillo, who is considering whether to run for City Comptroller.
Mr. Badillo said he was bothered by Dr. Moses's writings on cultural diversity in higher education, particularly a passage in one article he quoted as: "research is still more highly valued and rewarded by both the administration and faculty . . . that will have to change if cultural pluralism is to flourish."
Mr. Badillo said that passage indicated a willingness to drop standards for minority faculty, a mistake he said the college had made in hiring Dr. Leonard Jeffries.
 
'What Can I Do?'
 Mr. Badillo is one of four board members held liable by a Federal jury last week in the case of Dr. Jeffries, the head of the college's Black Studies Department. Dr. Jeffries sued the college when he was dismissed as a department head after a controversial speech in which he said, among other things, that rich Jews and the Mafia conspired to denigrate blacks in Hollywood movies.
After casting the only dissenting vote against Dr. Moses yesterday, Mr. Badillo left the board meeting saying the boardshould have taken more time to check Dr. Moses's credentials.
"What can I do?" he said. "It's over."
Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Murphy, and the head of the 11-member search committee, Calvin O. Pressley, also a trustee, said Mr. Badillo's misgivings had prompted them to consider Dr. Moses's qualifications more carefully.
But in the end, they said, they were even more convinced she was the right one to head City College.
"We think we have a winner here," said Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Pressley said the board was interested in cultural diversity, particularly because City College has a large minority student population. But he said that such diversity would not come at the expense of caring about academic excellence.
"Any person, especially Dr. Moses, who would come to City College would have to recognize our interest in making it the first-class institution it has been in the past, and hopefully will be in the future," he said. "She's committed to that."
Dr. Moses said that diversity and academic excellence enhanced each other.
She declined to discuss the Jeffries case because it is still under litigation.
The jury upheld Dr. Jeffries's contention that he had been denied his freedom of speech, and awarded him $400,000 in damages. The judge has yet to decide whether to reinstate him as a department head.
In addition to the aftermath of the Jeffries suit, Dr. Moses will face other difficulties. She will take over the college at a time when the university administration has proposed a restructuring of all its colleges, a move that many City College faculty and students fear will erode their school's standing as the premier academy in the system.
Dr. Moses said that as an administrator in a college system that has also been hard hit by state budget cuts, she will work hard to balance the financial realities with the fears of faculty members and students about educational standards.
"My role will be to get a balance of things and to look for ways to economize," she said. "But I also understand that this is the flagship of the whole university system. I respect that tradition. I promised the groups I met with at City that I would do everything I can to maintain that edge and to further the research and monetary goals of the college. You build on your strengths."
The college is also recovering from the incident in December 1991 in which nine students were trampled to death at a student-government-sponsored celebrity basketball game. Dr. Moses's predecessor, Dr. Bernard W. Harleston, resigned six months later.
A search committee made up of four board members, three faculty members, two students, one alumnus and the president of another CUNY college was formed shortly after.
Dr. Moses's selection by the search committee was first reported in yesterday's issue of in Newsday.
The search committee considered about 100 nominees for the job of president. They narrowed the list and in March four of them made visits to the campus. On May 16 trustees and the chancellor interviewed two of them, Dr. Moses and George Campbell Jr., a physicist.
In many regards, said Dr. de Jongh, Dr. Moses will find parallels at City College to her current campus. For example, the Cal State system has been one of the public college systems hit hardest by reductions in state financing.

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN HAITI SPURN POLICE PLAN

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 24

 BODY:
After two days of talks and a month of intense diplomatic pressure, Haiti's military authorities have rejected an American-backed United Nations plan to deploy an international police force here as part of a settlement of Haiti's long political crisis, diplomats said today.
The rejection was delivered to President Clinton's special adviser for Haitian affairs, Lawrence Pezzullo, and the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo. It came after American diplomats expressed strong confidence in recent days that army leaders would accept the return of the country's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 Diplomats said the rejection set the stage for new economic and other sanctions against Haiti, which would be aimed at the military leaders and their supporters among the country's small elite.
Under the plan for the negotiated return of Father Aristide, he had agreed to an amnesty for the military leaders in the September 1991 coup and the subsequent political violence that has claimed as many as 3,000 lives.
 
'No Other Choice'
 A proposal to deploy 500 international police officers, which has encountered resistance from both military leaders and some Aristide supporters, was intended to help end the violence and to create a climate for negotiations on a new government and a deadline for the exiled President's return.
With the rejection, diplomats here said Haiti's military authorities had called the bluff of the United Nations and Washington, which have warned of serious new sanctions if diplomacy fails.
"We told them that they had left no possibility for the international community to end this crisis but to impose sanctions," said a diplomat close to the discussions. "We don't want to do this, but it was made absolutely clear that at this point there is no other choice."
Another diplomat said, "There are two sides to this thing, naturally, but so far we have only heard the details of one of them" -- a large international aid package being prepared for Haiti in expectation of a settlement. "It's time to begin talking seriously about the pain," the diplomat said.
 
Punitive Measures Suggested
 Since shortly after the coup, which forced Father Aristide into exile, there has been a hemispheric embargo on Haiti, but it has failed to sway the military and their allies among the Haitian elite. At the same time, however, the embargo has wreaked severe long-term damage to Haiti's economy and caused added pain for the bulk of the population in what had already been the hemisphere's poorest country.
Some diplomats here mentioned several possible punitive measures, including the prosecution of army leaders who are widely believed to be involved in narcotics trafficking, the blocking of petroleum shipments and the freezing of financial assets of supporters of the coup.
Adding to the pressure for sanctions, diplomats close to the negotiations here have said the United Nations has recently indicated that it will withdraw from the diplomacy here in the absence of support for strong punitive measures that can persuade the Haitian Army to move toward a resolution.
The United Nations special mediator for Haiti, Mr. Caputo, a former Argentine Foreign Minister, has made six trips here in recent weeks to seek an international settlement.
 
Frustration Is Expressed
 With great expectations of a breakthrough, fed by confident assessments from American diplomats, expressions of frustration toward the United States were common among diplomats here today.
"For weeks, the Americans have been telling everyone that the army is in agreement, that everything is in place," one said. "Then we come down here and see that there is nothing to it, absolutely nothing.
"Washington has one more opportunity to show that it is serious about settling this thing in a multilateral fashion, through sanctions. Otherwise, everyone else is going to withdraw and this is going to become an American problem again, all by itself."
But another diplomat close to the talks said that Mr. Clinton's special representative, Mr. Pezzullo, had "spoken very strongly" in warning the army leaders today, leaving "no doubt about where the Americans stand."

HEADLINE: Contracts Renewed Despite an Inquiry

 BODY:
New York City's Office of Contracts has ordered the limited renewal of several disputed contracts to a South Bronx antipoverty agency headed by Ramon S. Velez while investigators look into allegations of malfeasance raised by City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
Ms. Holtzman had sought to block renewal of contracts totaling $1.6 million for Head Start and senior-citizen services from the Hunts Point Multi-Service Center, the flagship in Mr. Velez's South Bronx empire of social-service agencies and companies. 
 But Michael C. Rogers, director of the Office of Contracts, instructed her in a letter dated May 20 to approve those contracts and two others due to expire this fiscal year out of concern that an immediate halt would leave the community without an alternative source of social services.
The Comptroller's office expressed concern because the Office of Contracts had acknowledged the legitimacy of the objections and the office expected its legal staff to contact Mayor David N. Dinkins in coming days for a possible appeal. Under the City Charter, the Mayor can overrule the Comptroller and require the contracts to be registered or entered.
Ms. Holtzman said Mr. Velez had failed to disclose his chairmanship of several companies barred from bidding on Federal contracts after pleading guilty to bid-rigging in 1989.
Paul E. Bleifer, the lawyer for Hunts Point, said that the group had not engaged in financial irregularities and that Mr. Velez had complied with the city's disclosure requirements. Mr. Velez was not a defendant in the Federal case.

HEADLINE: Rural America Is Growing Slightly, Population Studies Show

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GETTYSBURG, Pa., May 20

 BODY:
Rural America, with its enticing vistas of fields, forests, buttes and mountains and its unenticing economy of failing farms, depleted mines and low-wage factories, hemorrhaged population throughout the 1980's. But new statistics for the early 1990's show that the countryside, at least for the moment, is holding its own again.
From one rural county to another, the changes documented by Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at Loyola University-Chicago, and Calvin Beale, a demographer at the Department of Agriculture in Washington, are slight but consistent. While only 47 percent of all rural counties in the United States gained population in the 1980's, two-thirds gained population from the spring of 1990, when the 1990 census was completed, to the spring of 1991. 
 Even more startling to demographers, Federal labor statistics show that in the fiscal year 1992, for the first time in 13 years, the unemployment rate in nonmetropolitan areas was lower than that for metropolitan areas. In rural areas the unemployment rate was 7.1 percent, and in metropolitan areas, 7.5 percent.
The reasons are many: a new factory here, a new retirement community there, a once-threatened farm turning solvent, the tentacles of urban growth beginning to touch once-empty spaces.
 
Tentative Rural Growth
 The new figures from Federal census surveys cover only one year, and because people are still leaving many rural areas -- particularly the Plains states and the Mississippi Delta -- demographers are not prepared to declare an end to the decline in rural population.
For most of the 20th century the exodus from farm and timber country has been a way of life. The notable exception was the 1970's, in what demographers call a "turnaround decade," when rural America grew faster than metropolitan America. That has not happened yet in the 1990's, but at least the rural population is growing, not shrinking.
In states as varied as Maine, Wisconsin, Missouri and Montana the numbers show rural population growth, often in counties that lost population in the 1980's. "In 33 states, nonmetropolitan gains were more widespread than during the 1980's," the study said. "Only seven states had fewer growing nonmetropolitan counties in 1990-91."
Commenting on reports of population growth in Aroostook County, a timber and potato-growing area that sprawls across the northern part of Maine, Dana Evans, a labor economist for the State of Maine, said: "It's true, it's there. But it's small."
State officials like Mr. Evans or Glenn Bobb, a Pennsylvania demographer, remain wary of the new numbers. And Mr. Johnson and Mr. Beale agree that, while the data may reflect the beginning of a new era of rural growth like the 1970's, they may also represent a momentary blip in a population curve that will continue downward.
 
Improving Job Picture
 But Mr. Beale, the dean of rural demography in America, said he suspects that something basic is changing. "The economic pictures in the rural areas was so poor from 1980 on," he said. "Three-quarters of the decade saw a combination of an exceptionally severe and long farm crisis with a general economic recession. What we see now, even though the country is having this in-and-out recession, is that the employment picture since 1990 has looked better in the nonmetro areas than in the metro areas."
The new population figures, the demographer said, reflect in part a desire by city dwellers to create a new place to provide respite from urban problems.
"There is this continuing tendency for urban America to want large chunks of rural America for urban playgrounds," Mr. Beale said. "Many of the growing rural areas are either within sprawling distance of metropolitan areas or else are being used as refuges or playgrounds for urban people, like western Montana."
In other areas, particularly the Ozark Mountains in Missouri and Arkansas, and the coastal areas of the Carolinas or the Great Lakes, the urban refugees are retired people seeking a bucolic life.
 
Defining a Rural Area
 Federal statisticians use a complex set of criteria to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan, or rural, areas. These include population density and the presence of an urban center with a population of at least 50,000. After every census, more and more counties on the fringes of metropolitan areas are redefined, going from rural to urban.
In 1980 there were 2,369 rural counties with a population of 53.6 million. After the 1990 census the number of rural counties dropped to 2,288, with a population of 52 million. In the past year these rural areas have gained 532,000 people, the new surveys show.
In a place like Adams County in south-central Pennsylvania, all the current trends seem to converge. The job base is not growing dramatically, but the printing plants and the dairy farms have all grown a little. And outsiders -- usually "white license plate" people from Maryland, fleeing the urban sprawl of Washington and Baltimore, keep coming.
 
New Jobs, Low Wages
 Adams County has added almost 1,000 homes a year since 1980, a pace that continued in 1991 and 1992. The buyers include airline pilots, computer specialists and consultants who can work at home, and retired military officers and Federal employees drawn to the orchards and rolling hills around the Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg.
New jobs also appeared in recent years, thanks to businesses like Arcata Graphics, a book-printing plant in Fairfield that started in 1976 and now employs 604 people, or the Knouse Food Cooperative, or the dairy farm owned by Richard Waybright, an Adams County commissioner who is the sixth generation of his family to live here.
But the people working in the new jobs -- many of which are entry-level, paying $15,000 to $18,000 a year -- are not likely to be the same as the people in the new houses, which sell for $200,000 or $300,000.
Richard H. Shmoyer, the county planning director, said those in the first group are likely to live in a trailer park, hoping to save enough money for a downpayment on a permanent home.
The other group tend to have better-paying jobs on the fringes of Washington or Baltimore, he said. Mr. Schmoyer and his wife moved here from Norristown, a small city west of Philadelphia, where he had worked as a planner. His wife now commutes 50 minutes a day to her job in Buckeystown, Md.
If Adams County combines some of the trends that may help revive rural America, it is not alone. In eastern Wisconsin, along the shores of Lake Michigan, Kewaunee and Manitowoc counties, which lost population in the 1980's, gained some back in 1990-91.
Mr. Johnson, the Loyola demographer, said Manitowoc County has some light manufacturing plants that seem to be supporting the slight increase in population. Kewaunee County, he said, sends commuters north to Door County, whose economy is based on recreation and shipbuilding.
"I think there are a lot of people in nonmetro areas who want to stay there," Mr. Johnson said. "But they have to have some chance of having a reasonable economic life."
Tracing the ebb and flow of rural migration since World War II, he said surplus labor in rural areas forced young people to leave in the 1950's and 60's. The population of rural areas rebounded in the 1970's when there were more economic opportunities, he said, then dropped again in the 80's, when agriculture was hard hit.
Now things are picking up again in rural areas, Mr. Johnson said. There are more jobs, and young couples who grew up in the area and prefer the pace of rural America, feel able to stay. "The wife works at some place like McDonald's, the husband in an industrial plant," he said. "Then those people don't leave."

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Clinton's Woes on Capitol Hill Spur Sharp Criticism of His Top Lobbyist

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
When President Clinton made Howard Paster his chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill, he turned to the ultimate Washington insider.
As a lobbyist for the United Automobile Workers, Mr. Paster had played a leading role in negotiating the loan bailout for the Chrysler Corporation. He kept Eastern Airlines flying a few more years by negotiating tax breaks for the carrier. And representing the oil industry, he helped soften environmental provisions in the 1991 Clean Air Act. 
 But as Mr. Clinton's woes have snowballed in Congress, and the Administration girds for a crucial vote in the House on its economic package this Thursday, Mr. Paster's reputation as a master deal-maker on Capitol Hill has suffered.
The 48-year-old lobbyist is being blamed by many Democrats for misreading Senate Republicans before they filibustered Mr. Clinton's economic stimulus package to death last month. He is said to have ignored conservative and moderate Democrats before their objections to tax increases in the President's budget proposal blossomed into open revolt. And restless freshman Democrats complain that his staff does not return telephone calls or follow through on requests for favors.
 
'A Turning Point'
 Critics say Mr. Paster's disdain for the Democratic conservatives has helped harden the battle lines in the Senate. They say David L. Boren of Oklahoma, the leading Senate Democrat opposing the proposed energy tax, became more aggressive after Mr. Paster underestimated the importance of a February letter by Mr. Boren and seven other Democrats asking the President to retreat from his strategy of stimulating the economy with a jobs bill before enacting tax increases and enforcing budget cuts.
"It was a turning point," Mr. Boren said recently. Asked for his opinion of Mr. Paster, the Senator said, "I am concerned that the President is getting bad advice that causes him to always be publicly perceived as being in an adversarial role with conservative and moderate Democrats."
Lawmakers said Mr. Paster, whose dry, cutting wit and straight-talking style are sometimes interpreted as confrontational, made a bad situation worse during a meeting with 55 moderate and conservative House members last week. According to participants, Mr. Paster might have smothered the rebellion in the House by simply promising to address their concerns with the President and promising better access to the White House. Instead, they said, he looked bored.
"Instead of acknowledging the concerns expressed, he rebutted the concerns that were raised," said Representative Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, one of the conservative Democrats who wants to put a cap on Social Security and Medicaid spending to guarantee that new taxes go to deficit reduction. "Paster doesn't empathize with us, so he doesn't act as an honest conduit to the President of our concerns."
 
Predicting a Victory
 For all the controversy generated around him and his President's economic package, Mr. Paster predicted the Administration would win a complete victory on the House floor on Thursday, when lawmakers vote on the President's economic program.
But Mr. Paster conceded that he has made some strategic errors lately. "It's fair to say that the fact the stimulus bill did not pass is my responsibility," he said. "I miscalculated over what it would take to negotiate a bill. The mistake I made was misreading what was going on in the Republican caucus."
Mr. Paster's capacity to take responsibility is not all that sets him apart from most officials his age in Washington. He does not play golf, he shies from publicity and the cocktail party circuit, and he belongs to no clubs. His office in the West Wing of the White House is mostly free of the political paraphernalia that decorate most Washington offices; the most distinctive decorations are the autographed baseballs and a bat. (He used to lobby for Major League Baseball.)
He shrugged off contentions that his background as a labor lobbyist made him insensitive to the ideas expressed by the conservative wing of the Democratic Party. "They have been heard," he said. "The problem arises because it is necessary in the process of governing to deal with all wings of the party."
 
'Completely Thankless Job'
 Mr. Paster's defenders say Washington is an unforgiving town, where political fortunes fall one week only to rise the next.
"I think Howard has a completely thankless job," said David Dreyer, a senior White House public affairs official and a former top aide to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. "When we score victories -- like family and medical leave or motor-voter -- the President gets the credit. But when things go awry, people who are reluctant to be critical of the President will be critical of the Congressional operation."
Mr. Paster won no public credit when he was the first senior Administration official to warn Mr. Clinton that the Zoe Baird nomination for Attorney General faced serious obstacles because of her hiring of two illegal aliens to do domestic chores.
Nor does he win many points by effectively keeping Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the often meddlesome chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, on the Administration reservation. "I love Howard Paster," said Mr. Dingell, who recommended Mr. Paster to President Clinton. "The President's problems are in the Senate, which has the same rules as the San Francisco Zoo. There's no way Paster can be blamed for that."
 
'Defeat Is an Orphan'
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said: "John Kennedy's phrase applies here: 'Victories have one hundred fathers, and defeat is an orphan.' He'll get blame that shouldn't apply, but over all, he will do very well."
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, credited Mr. Paster with easing passage of most taxes Mr. Clinton wanted through his panel by helping to convince Mr. Clinton to appeal to influential corporate leaders for support.
Still, Mr. Paster is beginning to draw comparisons to Frank Moore, the Carter Administration's chief Congressional liaison, who was faulted for neglecting to keep lawmakers informed and for failing to build bridges to Republicans. Some lawmakers are even beginning to express nostalgia for Kenneth M. Duberstein, President Ronald Reagan's lobbyist, who knew what buttons to press to attract the support of conservative Democrats for his Administration's tax cut and backing of the anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua.
"I'd call the Congressional-relations operation a disaster," said a senior House Democratic whip who spoke on condition he remain unnamed. "Paster's strategy is to deal with the old bulls and ignore the rank-and-file. His staff is young, not savvy, and stretched thin." The senior Democrat said Mr. Paster "has given faulty advice to the President" to ignore House Republicans and try to overpower conservative Democrats in the Senate.
A senior Treasury Department official complained that when the President was considering a compromise with Senate Republicans and Democrats and cut back the stimulus package, Mr. Paster gave him faulty advice not to bend.
Nicholas E. Calio, President Bush's chief lobbyist, was able to move little of his Administration's legislative agenda over the objections of a Democratic Congress. But he won high marks for reaching out to Democrats, especially Mr. Gephardt, and working the cloakrooms and marble stairwells like a candidate.
"Your job is to listen to everybody, and talk to everybody and feed information back," Mr. Calio said. "You shape the policy around the edges by determining what flies and what won't fly."
Democratic insurgents say unlike Mr. Calio, Mr. Paster acts like a proponent with an agenda. And when he ought to be doling out honey, they say, he doles out salt.
Several members said Representative Dave McCurdy, the conservative Oklahoma Democrat who is a leader of the House rebellion against Mr. Clinton's budget, could have been held in check had Mr. Paster granted his wish to become principal House sponsor of the Administration's national service bill. Instead, the Administration courted Representative William D. Ford of Michigan, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, by asking him to handle the bill, avoiding one set of problems but inviting another.
Only a week later, Mr. McCurdy was the first Congressional Democrat to sharply criticize the Administration, and Mr. Ford handed the sponsorship off to one of his subcommittee chairmen.

Prices on Long-Term Bills Climb

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Longer-term Treasury prices rose yesterday, but the price of shorter- term maturities fell and the rates on Treasury bills moved higher.
Worries about a move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates and the normal selling ahead of Treasury auctions contributed to the weak performance of shorter maturities. The Treasury is selling $41.5 billion of one-year bills and two- and five-year notes this week. 
 A fall in the price of gold and a drop in a key commodity index helped give some support to the Treasury bond, traders said. A report about the Fed taking a tougher stand on inflation might have also helped.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond due in February 2023 managed to drop below 7 percent during the day, but ended at 7 percent, down from 7.04 percent Friday. The price rose 15/32 to 10117/32 . Yesterday was the third day in the last trading week that the yield on the bond ended the day at 7 percent or higher.
 
Yield on Two-Year Notes
 But the prices of two- and three-year Treasury notes were off 4/32 and 5/32 respectively, while the yield on the two-year note rose to 4.18 percent from 4.11 percent Friday and the yield on the three-year note was up to 4.59 percent from 4.53 percent.
And at the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, the discount rates jumped to their highest levels since Jan. 11. The average discount rate on the three-month bill was 3.06 percent, up from 3.00 percent last week, and the average discount rate on the six-month bill was 3.19 percent, up from 3.10 percent.
While the bond market is still trading in a relatively narrow range, the top of that range, in terms of yields, appears to be moving a little higher. The tone of the entire bond market has been hurt recently as President Clinton's economic program has run into roadblocks in Congress.
And the Administration's handling of the dismissals of the employees of the White House travel office and the stories about the President's $200 haircut in Los Angeles last week added to the growing doubts about Mr. Clinton's effectiveness on Wall Street, traders and analysts said. The defection of key Democrats in the Senate on the proposed energy tax also added to doubts about the outlook for the the economic program.
"The market is more and more bearish on the Clinton Administration's ability to make substantial moves to fiscal restraint," said Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation, referring to the President's deficit reduction proposals.
 
Survey of 100 Fund Managers
 Michael Rosenberg, the manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch, said that the results of his most recent survey of 100 fund managers worldwide showed that "they are being more cautious toward the bond market."
The bond market spent much of yesterday focusing again on whether and when the Federal Reserve might move to raise short term interest rates.
The concern about the Fed has been around for the last week because the April inflation data was much higher than exected and the Fed's policy-making committee met last Tuesday.
A report in The Wall Street Journal that the Fed policy-making committee had voted last week in favor of a bias toward higher short term interest rates greeted traders in the moring and sent the prices of shorter- term maturities lower. A jump in short-term rates would have the greatest impact on Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes.
The new bias toward higher interest rates, if the Fed did adopt it, does not mean that interest rates will be raised immediately. But it does give the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, the authority to raise the target for the Federal funds rate without going back to the committee for approval between now the next policy committee meeting ealry this summer. The current target for the Fed funds rate, which is the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, is 3 percent.
 
Support From Gold Price Drop
 While these concerns were bringing down prices and raising yields across the board yesterday, the Treasury bond seemed to get some support from the drop in the price of gold, which fell $3.70, to $374.20 an ounce for June delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York. In addition, the Commodity Research Index of commodity prices, which is a closely watched inflation barometer, fell 2.28 points to 209.28. Both declines could have eased inflation concerns a little, at least for the day.
As for the Treasury this week, the Treasury will sell $15.75 billion in two-year notes today, $11 billion of five-year notes Wednesday and $14.75 billion of one-year bills Thursday. In the when-issued market the two-year note was at a yield of 4.23 percent yesterday, up from 4.17 percent Friday, and the five-year note was at 5.39 percent, up from 5.35 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Health Care Keeps Rank As Job Leader

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Even amid the steep job losses that have buffeted the New York City economy since 1989, the city's health care industry has grown rapidly, solidifying its position as the city's largest employer by far, according to a new Federal report.
But the explosive growth of the industry also underscores a problem for the city, experts say, as the skills and education demanded by health-care jobs outpace what New York's young workers have to offer. 
 The report, released yesterday, shows that the city's private hospitals and health-care organizations added 30,000 jobs since 1989 and now employ 278,000 people. Health care has eclipsed banks, real-estate concerns, corporate headquarters, publishing houses and other large employers, and the industry's growth is expected to continue for at least a decade.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said health-care jobs would continue expanding because the city's population was growing older and because the advance of medical technology was creating a need for more specialized workers.
Whatever changes eventually are enacted in President Clinton's overhaul of the health system, "the demand will be there" for health services, he said.
The growth of the health care industry has been particularly important to New York because it has provided jobs in neighborhoods and for ethnic groups that have otherwise been hardest hit by the recession, experts said.
"Health care has emerged as the new point of entry," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group representing 155 hospitals in the city, on Long Island and in Westchester County.
He said the industry, with jobs such as nurses, medical assistants and technicians, had in many ways supplanted garment manufacturing as a source of employment for recent immigrants. Often, he said, language skills and familiarity with other cultures are as much in demand among health care providers as the skills honed in nursing or medical school.
But Mr. Ehrenhalt maintained that the skill requirements for health care workers would become more and more rigorous, perhaps disqualifying even the recent immigrants. New technology, he said, is expected to make many entry-level jobs obsolete, while demanding more technical skills of workers.
 
Bleak Odds for Dropouts
 "The odds against high school dropouts are bleak now," he said. "They will be worse." Recent studies show that 31 percent of New York City's public high school students do not graduate.
A separate report yesterday -- on a survey of 300 of New York City's top corporate executives -- found that entry-level job requirements are growing far more rigorous across a spectrum of industries.
"Today's educational shortfalls could inhibit tomorrow's economic growth," said James J. Schiro , vice chairman of Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, which conducted the survey earlier this year. The executives in the study criticized New York City's public schools harshly.
Among the survey's findings were that over half the companies had increased their entry-level skill requirements over the last four years. More than half the executives also said that they would carry out policies over the next four years that would require most of their new entry-level employees to have four-year college degrees.
 
A Shift in Job Ranking
 After the health care industry, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, business services, wholesale trade, banking and social services, in that order, are the city's largest employers. In contrast, the Federal report said that in 1960, health care had not even made the top five, which then comprised wholesale trade, apparel manufacturing, publishing, restaurants and business services.
Among New York City's hospitals are some of the largest and most distinguished teaching institutions. At such hospitals as Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center and New York University Medical Center the city provides medical training for 15 percent of the nation's doctors, far more than any other city, according to Mr. Raske's group.
Expansion of the city's health care industry can be measured in more than employment. In a wave of new construction, which should provide a much needed boost for builders and trades people, several hospitals have begun expansion programs.
They include New York Hospital, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, the Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens, Kings County Medical Center and others. Collectively, the hospitals plan to spend $6 billion on construction over the next decade.
The industry's growth is expected to be sharpest among health care providers who work outside the hospitals. Mr. Ehrenhalt said that the segments of the industry that had grown fastest since 1979 were home health care organizations, independent clinics, nursing homes and specialized outpatient facilities, particularly those dealing with alcohol and drug addiction, kidney dialysis and AIDS.
Although no government projections are available for New York City, the report yesterday cited Federal estimates that several categories of health care employment -- home health aides, physical therapists, medical assistants, radiologic technicians -- would be among the fastest growing until at least the year 2005.
In its separate survey of executives, which it conducted for the New York Chamber of Commerce, Price Waterhouse said it found that four of five executives believed the public schools failed to give students basic math and reading skills and the ability to think critically.
In its survey results, Price Waterhouse ranked what the executives believed to be the 11 most important problems facing New York City over the next four years. Public education ranked second, behind public safety.

HEADLINE: Race for Nassau Executive Tests Party Shift

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 21

 BODY:
The campaign poster from Richard M. Nixon's 1972 re-election bid still hangs in the Republican Election Commissioner's office here. In Nassau County, isolated somehow from the doubt Mr. Nixon has since ignited in much of the rest of the country, the picture is a reminder of the Republican Party's traditional invincibility.
But this year, this Republican stronghold faces its toughest challenge in 25 years in the race for county executive. The machine that could always be counted on to turn out a Republican majority in local, state and national elections, to provide funds and field statewide candidates, appears to be in trouble. 
 Two Democrats, and possibly a third, are vying for the right to challenge County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, on the November ballot, and Mr. Gulotta himself is running on a platform of "fundamental and sweeping change."
 
Statewide Impact Seen
 Though Mr. Gulotta has spent the last 12 years in top leadership posts in Nassau County, six as County Executive and six as Hempstead Town Supervisor, his campaign advertisements mention neither his party nor his current office.
Such a disavowal would have been unthinkable in earlier years. But these are troubled days in Nassau. A lengthy recession and cuts in military spending have, overall, cost Long Island 100,000 jobs. The shrinking tax base forced the county into its third straight year of deficit, with Nassau borrowing $107 million to stay afloat last year and invoking widespread layoffs.
Suddenly, the county that promised the American dream could no longer afford to test the water at its beaches or do autopsies in time for religious burials.
At the same time, Mr. Gulotta came under fire from within his own party for hanging onto the perquisites of wealthier years. Though he had nine secretaries on staff at the height of last year's budget crisis, for example, Mr. Gulotta brought in a tenth.
A defeat for Mr. Gulotta, in the words of Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant, "would be a dagger through the heart of the Republican Party" in New York State. A victory against today's odds could catapult Mr. Gulotta to statewide prominence.
 
A Test of Democratic Gains
 Locally, this year's race will determine whether Democratic gains in recent Nassau County elections were quirks, or signaled underlying shifts in the balance of power.
In the last four years, three Democrats have been elected to the six-member Board of Supervisors, Nassau's legislative body, which was previously all-Republican. Last November, a Democrat, Doreen Banks, became County Clerk in an election that some considered a bellwether for the county executive's race.
Adding to the political uncertainty, the county is under court order to dissolve the Board of Supervisors by 1995 for a more representative County Legislature. The post of County Executive will remain, but it is not clear how it will be affected.
Though banking on voter discontent, the Democrats measure their purses in the tens of thousands of dollars, for a race that Mr. Gulotta estimates will cost upwards of $1.5 million. He already has collected more than $1 million.
The Democratic challengers for the four-year term are Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, who is probably best known for his opposition to the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and Benjamin Zwirn, the North Hempstead Town Supervisor.
While the Democrats are to nominate a candidate at a party convention on Thursday, party faithfuls have already rallied to Mr. Kessel's side. Mr. Zwirn has assiduously not courted regular party leaders.
Many Democrats resent Mr. Zwirn for even seeking the post, fearing that a Democratic primary on Sept. 14 would divert attention from the effort to unseat Mr. Gulotta. Whatever the outcome of the primary, Mr. Zwirn will run on the independent line in the general election.
A third Democratic possibility is Lewis J. Yevoli, the Oyster Bay Town Supervisor, who could deliver the traditionally Republican Oyster Bay and Italian votes. Mr. Yevoli has met with the candidates but says he has not yet made up his mind whether to run.
"One would say that the Republicans are in trouble, but countering that is that Democrats don't appear to be able to take control," lamented Bruce Nyman, a Democrat and the Long Beach Supervisor. "This is the best opportunity that we've ever had, and we're about to blow it."
Amid the infighting, the issues are hardly clear. Democrats, who six months ago planned to present their candidate as an agent of change, have been pre-empted by Mr. Gulotta. As one who knows the system from the inside, Mr. Gulotta argues, he is the most able to detect its problems and push for solutions.
 
Running on Experience
 Mr. Gulotta has drawn criticism for using his office to advance his political fortunes. Critics contend that he has used taxpayer-financed mailings to advance his personal messages among voters and has instructed his top administrators to praise him in speeches before civic groups, following a script that says, in part, "Tom's leadership and experience has helped to guide Nassau County through this turbulent economic period."
Mr. Gulotta defended the script as informational, not political. "I would say that's a fact," Mr. Gulotta said, when read the quote. "There was nothing political whatsoever in it."
Mr. Gulotta's greatest ally in the race, may be the Democrats' disunity and lack of organization.
Mr. Zwirn, in announcing his candidacy, blasted both Mr. Gulotta and Mr. Kessel. He called Mr. Gulotta "Taxing Tom," for his proposals to double the mortgage tax to 2 percent and to increase the county's share of property taxes by 26 percent. He branded Mr. Kessel "Rate-Hike Richie" for his steps to close Shoreham and the subsequent increase in the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity rates.
Mr. Kessel points to his involvement in closing Shoreham and his role as chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the agency responsible for decommissioning Shoreham, as his greatest achievement. He called Mr. Zwirn's charges "preposterous," adding that rate increases "would have been far greater" if Shoreham had been opened.
Mr. Zwirn is running on his record of cutting taxes and tightening government spending in North Hempstead, where he staged an upset in 1989 and then led a landslide that delivered a Democratic majority to the Town Board in 1991.
"I'm the only one of the candidates," Mr. Zwirm said in an interview, "who can stand up at a debate and say, 'Which of us has lowered taxes and cut spending?' "

At Yale, Honors for an Acting Chief

 BODY:
Howard R. Lamar, who served as acting president of Yale University over the last year and was generally seen as a stabilizing force on campus, conferred degrees yesterday on 1,219 undergraduates and about 2,000 graduate and professional students at the university's 292d commencement exercises in New Haven. Mr. Lamar, who will hand over his powers on July 1 to Richard C. Levin, now dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, received an honorary degree of doctor of laws.
A poignant moment in the proceedings came when an honorary degree of doctor of humane letters was announced for Arthur R. Ashe Jr., the tennis champion who died of AIDS. The degree was accepted by Alexandra Dell, a junior at Yale who was Mr. Ashe's goddaughter. The graduates stood in tribute to Mr. Ashe. 
 Among others receiving honorary degrees were Elena G. Bonner, the Soviet dissident and widow of Andrei Sakharov, the human rights activist; Rembert G. Weakland, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Milwaukee and a prominent leader of the church's liberal wing, and Alistair Cooke, journalist, commentator and former host of "Masterpiece Theater."
In keeping with a Yale tradition of protest, a plane circled the proceedings bearing the message, "Resign Loucks." Some students are upset at Vernon R. Loucks Jr., a Yale trustee who is also chairman and chief executive of Baxter International Inc., a medical products supplier which violated a Federal law against cooperating with the Arab economic boycott of Israel. Mr. Lamar has said he stands behind Mr. Loucks for his service to Yale.
As is Yale's custom, there was no commencement day speaker. During Class Day ceremonies Sunday, the actress Jodie Foster, who graduated from the university magna cum laude in 1985, urged graduating seniors to "be advocates for people who don't have a voice" and to combat "racism, sexism and homophobia."
 
Seton Hall University
 Seton Hall University conferred degrees on 1,142 undergraduates and 500 graduates yesterday in ceremonies at Byrne Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston gave the main address for the 136th commencement. Mr. Flynn, who has recently been nominated as Ambassador to the Vatican, spoke of the need for a new civil rights movement in America and urged the graduates to get involved in changing society. Mr. Flynn received an honorary degree of doctor of humanitarian service.
 
Yeshiva University
 Dr. Gershon Metzger, director general of Israel's Ministry of Science and Technology, delivered the main address yesterday at the 62d commencement of Yeshiva University. The commencement at Madison Square Garden, attended by 1,111 graduates, was the largest celebrated by the university this year.
Dr. Metzger spoke of recent political, social, economic and demographic changes throughout the world and said, "There is cause for guarded optimism as you look forward to your future careers."
Dr. Metzger, an alumnus of Yeshiva, received an honorary degree of doctor of science. Among the others receiving honorary degrees was Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York State Court of Appeals.
 
Johns Hopkins University
 President Richard von Weizsacker of Germany delivered the main commencement address yesterday at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. A total of 3,974 degrees were awarded at the school's 117th annual commencement.
After the main ceremony many of the university's divisions held their own diploma-awarding ceremonies. In an address before graduating seniors, the director Barry Levinson, who was born in Baltimore, talked about the chasm between the unalloyed hope of his generation in the 1960's and the complex problems of today.
"We were a promising generation," he said. "We had ideals and values. What went wrong is, it's easy to lose what's important today in this constantly cluttered world of media madness. We're told a thousand things we need, and we just get lost."
Robert S. Strauss, the Ambassador to the Soviet Union under President George Bush, delivered the main address yesterday at commencement ceremonies for the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. The school awarded 259 degrees at its 50th annual commencement, which was held at the First Baptist Church in Washington.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
General Mills Closing 31 of Its Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, May 24

 BODY:
General Mills Inc. said today that it would close 31 restaurants and revamp its manufacturing. It said it would take a $45 million to $50 million charge against after-tax earnings, or about 28 to 30 cents a share, as a result of the restructuring.
Twenty-seven of the restaurants to be closed are Red Lobsters; 4 are Olive Gardens. 
 Half are in economically depressed areas of Canada, which has been an unprofitable market over all. The remainder --mostly in Houston, Orlando and California -- have not been doing as well as the company had hoped.
General Mills currently operates 1,075 restaurants in North America, including 665 Red Lobsters and 405 Olive Gardens.
 
'An Effort to Stem Red Ink'
 General Mills' stock closed down $2 today, closing at $67.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the Kellogg Company's announcement that it expected lower second-quarter earnings pressured General Mills's stock.
Some of the moves had been expected, especially in Canada where General Mills has had problems for the past two years. "This is an effort to stem the red ink," said Bonnie Wittenberg, an analyst with Dain Bosworth.
General Mills currently operates 69 Red Lobsters and 23 Olive Garden restaurants in Canada.
General Mills estimated it would save about $15 million, or about 9 cents a share, in fiscal 1994, as a result of the changes. It said fourth-quarter operating performance remains on track as does fiscal 1993.
"General Mills' overall financial results, excluding unusual items, will represent another year of record sales, earnings and earnings per share," said Bruce Atwater, General Mills chairman.
The company had been expected to earn 72 cents a share in the quarter ending this month, according to analysts.
 
No Estimate on Job Loss
 General Mills had no estimate of how many workers will lose their jobs. Most of the cuts in the manufacturing resturcturing are expected in consumer foods, where General Mills is switching to high-performance work systems. It said the system, currently in 64 percent of its plants, has significantly increased productivity.
Employment in its restaurant group is expected to rise, despite the planned closings, a spokesman said.
"We will be opening 50 stores next year in each of our two divisions, Red Lobster and Olive Garden," said Peter Spokes.
Additional details of General Mills' restructuring are expected June 29 when the company reports its fourth- quarter earnings.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Sharp Gains As Short-Term Rates Climb

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply yesterday as rising short-term American interest rates attracted more money into dollar-denominated investments.
The dollar surged as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve might tighten short-term interest rates to protect against a resurgence of inflation. 
 The policy-making body of the Fed met last week, after the Government had reported a jump in April inflation. Previously, the Fed had maintained a neutral policy but many dealers thought the central bankers might have grown more cautious.
Despite widespread questions about rates, speculation about a tighter Fed policy was enough to push the dollar higher.
The dollar rallied at the expense of the mark, which sagged on continued expectations that the Bundesbank would cut German rates, making mark-denominated assets less attractive.
The mark also sank against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as investors sought a haven in the currencies of nations with stronger economies. The mark fell to a record low of 67.25 yen from 67.81 late on Friday.
Attempts by the United States and Japan to cool the yen's five-month surge lifted the dollar slightly, but gains were capped by persistent trade tensions, dealers said.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said recent comments by United States officials that have bolstered the yen were taken "grossly out of proportion." Specifically, he said, President Clinton was not urging a further appreciation of the yen.
The dollar rallied over one pfennig, to 1.6355 marks, in late New York trading, well above the 1.6250 marks of late Friday. Earlier in London, the dollar settled at 1.6380 marks, down from a 1.6430-mark peak, but well above Friday's 1.6268-mark finish.
In New York, the dollar rose to 110.60 yen in late dealings from 110.35 yen Friday. It closed in Tokyo at 110.58 yen, slightly above 110.52 yen Friday. The Australian dollar fell to 0.6932 cents, from 0.6953 cents, amid rumors that the Government is willing to accept a weaker currency.
The British pound settled at $1.5370 in New York, down from $1.5445 Friday. Earlier in London, the pound eased to $1.5355 from $1.5580 Friday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Tumble, Raising Doubts on the Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver prices tumbled from around a 32-month high yesterday amid heavy selling by investment funds.
Gold and platinum futures also sank, raising new doubts about the ability of the precious metals to continue a rally that began in March. 
 Silver for May delivery plunged 13.4 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $4.535 a troy ounce. The contract traded as high as $4.72 last week, the highest spot price for silver since Sept. 28, 1990, and nearly 34 percent above the March 8 low of $3.53.
June gold fell $3.70 on the Commodity Exchange, to $374.20 an ounce. On the Mercantile Exchange in New York, July platinum dropped $7.40, to $386 an ounce.
The declines followed reports that the Federal Reserve was leaning toward raising short-term interest rates in an effort to stifle inflation. The move would underscore the Fed's concern about inflationary pressures, which have been among the factors driving precious metals higher.
 
Correction Believed Due
 Investors normally turn to precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Higher interest rates would make borrowing money costlier, slowing industrial activity and curbing demand for silver and platinum, which have industrial uses.
"The potential for Fed tightening was a key factor," said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. She said the metals were due for a downward correction.
Lower commodity prices in general and a stronger dollar yesterday prompted additional selling, Ms. Raptopoulos said.
Silver and platinum fell more sharply than gold because they were more exaggeratedly high, said George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He said demand for gold out of Asia, another factor in the recent run-up, remained strong.
"Until now, people have been buying silver and platinum as a proxy for gold," he said. "I don't think that's a very good idea."
On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; orange juice futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mostly lower, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
Light crude oil for July delivery fell 16 cents on the Mercantile Exchange in New York, to $19.72 a barrel; June heating oil fell 0.54 cent, to 53.90 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline fell 0.47 cent, to 58.73 cents a gallon, and July natural gas sank 10.8 cents, to $2.009 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Going To Markets For $3 Billion

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced yesterday that it planned to raise up to $3 billion in the financial markets for corporate expenses that could include paying for higher-than-expected cutbacks in its work force.
The International Business Machines Corporation last year took a big charge against earnings to help pay for reducing its payroll by 25,000 workers this year. Earlier this year, the company acknowledged that the number would exceed 25,000, but has not been more precise. That, company officials say, is partly because work force decisions are increasingly left to the heads of its business divisions. 
 Industry analysts say the job cuts for the year could well exceed 40,000 and may go far higher, depending on how much emphasis the new chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., puts on paring costs further.
An I.B.M. spokesman, Rob Wilson, said that the new funds to be raised over the next nine months to a year would be used for "general corporate purposes." The extra cash, he added, would give I.B.M. "additional flexibility if more people than expected leave the company."
 
First Preferred Stock
 The I.B.M. financing plan includes an issue of $750 million in preferred stock, with the remainder long-term bonds. It is the first time I.B.M. has issued preferred stock. The timing of the borrowing program is an effort by I.B.M., like other companies, to lock in the current low interest rates. I.B.M.'s shares gained $1.375 yesterday, closing at $49.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Preparing financially for additional work force cuts is only prudent, analysts say. "I said the number would be more like 40,000 earlier this year, and I now think that number is too low," said Daniel Mandresh, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company.
The work force cutbacks will be mainly voluntarily, and the I.B.M. program gives workers considerable incentive to leave in the first half of the year. After June 30, the lump sum payments and extended medical benefits to departing workers are substantially reduced.
Separately, Mr. Gerstner picked another outsider to join his corporate staff, Abby Kohnstamm, a marketing executive at the American Express Company. Ms. Kohnstamm, 39, will become I.B.M.'s vice president of corporate marketing in charge of advertising, promotion and the company's many sponsorships.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Experts Ponder Cuban Epidemic

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
AMERICAN medical experts returning from Cuba have different theories about the nature of the epidemic that has struck there in recent months, affecting some 25,000 people.
The disease impairs vision and can damage peripheral nerves, causing symptoms like burning sensations in the legs. The underlying cause of the disease, all agree, is a nutritional deficiency, most probably resulting from changes in the diet caused by worsening economic problems in Cuba. 
 During their weeklong stay, the experts say, they met often with Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, to discuss their findings. President Castro is taking a deep interest in the mysterious epidemic.
But opinion is divided over the precise type of nutritional deficiency that is causing the disease. One group pinpoints a lack of thiamine, or vitamin B1. Another attributes the disease to a deficiency of folic acid combined with the drinking of methanol and natural cyanide in home-brewed rum.
The experts who have made themselves available for interviews on their return from Cuba are from Columbia University's medical school in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The Columbia doctors went under the auspices of Peace for Cuba, a nonprofit organization that has lobbied against the American trade embargo against Cuba. The California group went for Orbis International, a nonprofit organization that fights blindness throughout the world.
The Cuban Government also asked the Pan American Health Organization to send a team. One of the nine members of the Paho team, Dr. D. Carleton Gajdusek, left Cuba last weekend but was not available for comment and his office referred all calls to Paho. A spokesman for Paho said members of the team would discuss the epidemic and provide a more definitive assessment at a news conference later this week.
Last week Dr. Michio Hirano, one of the Columbia doctors, said the evidence pointed to a vitamin B1 deficiency known as Strachan syndrome as the cause of the Cuban epidemic. But Dr. Hirano, a neurologist, said yesterday that he had overstated the case for vitamin B1 deficiency. He and Dr. Norah Lincoff, a colleague who is training to be a neuro-ophthalmologist, said they believed the disease was more likely a result of a deficiency of a combination of B vitamins.
But Dr. Alfredo Sadun, an expert in optic nerve disease at the University of Southern California, said the cause was a lack of dietary folate combined with the ingestion of two toxins, methanol in home-brewed rum and cyanide in sugar cane. He said the disease was a variation of a rare but well described condition known mitochondrial optic neuropathy, or M.O.N., that had reached epidemic proportions because of recent changes in nutritional and drinking habits.
M.O.N. is usually a genetic disorder, and ordinarily does not damage both eyes at the same time. Dr. Sadun said he was speaking of a nongenetic variation caused by toxins like methanol and cyanide.
Dr. Lincoff disagreed, saying that Dr. Sadun lacked proof for such a diagnosis and that there was no evidence that the disease could result in loss of vision in both eyes simultaneously, as is happening in Cuba.
Not only the name of the disease but the number of those affected is in dispute. Cuban health officials have said that almost 26,000 people are afflicted. Dr. Sadun said he and other experts from Orbis and Paho told Mr. Castro in their daily meetings last week that the number was inflated because many cases had been misdiagnosed. Many of these individuals had other serious visual and neurological disorders.
Initially, predominantly adult men were afflicted. But in recent weeks, Cuban doctors diagnosed the condition in many women. Dr. Sadun said his team had determined that many recent cases could be attributed to malingering or hysteria. The group used tests that are standard in the United States for determining whether a person can see, he said, in order to diagnose the cases of malingering or hysteria.
On being told about the misdiagnoses, Dr. Sadun said, Mr. Castro "was extremely receptive to what should have been a very threatening comment."
"His eyes lit up," Dr. Sadun went on, "he slapped his hand and said, 'I knew it. That explains why the characteristics of the disease have shifted so much.' "
Mr. Castro's views toward the cause of the epidemic seem to have changed between the meeting that Dr. Hirano had on May 6 and the ones Dr. Sadun's team had last week. Earlier, Dr. Hirano said, Mr. Castro favored a viral cause.
Dr. Sadun said that many of the most powerful Cuban scientists were virologists because the Cuban Government has invested heavily in that field and in molecular biology.
Cuban virologists claim to have isolated a virus in a large number of cases, Dr. Sadun said, adding that the virus also turned up in controls, indicating to virologists on the team that the findings were probably a laboratory error.
Dr. Sadun said that when he explained "why it was unlikely to be a virus, Castro just smiled and seemed relaxed, instead of being upset."
Dr. Sadun said that the Orbis and Paho teams agreed to work as a team after they met in Miami and that they decided to start their investigation in Cuba on May 17.
That morning, five members of the Orbis and Paho teams went to Cuba's main eye hospital in Havana and spent six hours thoroughly examining four of the most severely affected patients to get a feel for the disease. The medical histories and findings were the same for all four.
That afternoon, the team went to a general hospital to examine patients with other types of neurological problems attributed to the disease. "Each patient had something different, none looked like any of the patients seen in the morning, and we were terribly confused," Dr. Sadun said.
That evening, the group told Mr. Castro they suspected that many cases had been misdiagnosed.
Last Tuesday morning, the team returned to the eye hospital to examine three milder cases. One had the disease, a second had another eye disorder and the third turned out to be a case of hysteria, Dr. Sadun said. That afternoon, the team examined patients who had both the eye and peripheral nerve forms of the disease.
That evening, the group agreed to the need for a strict definition of the syndrome, as is standard for purposes of epidemiologic investigations.
On Wednesday, the scientists came up with a definition that included six points based on their examinations of the most severely affected patients.
To qualify as a case, a patient had to meet one absolute and three other relative components.
The absolute was the presence in both eyes of a wedge-shaped defect in the portion of the optic nerve known as the macular-papular bundle.
Among the other components were these:
*Loss of vision in both eyes within a month.
*Loss of a certain amount of color vision.
*Loss of central vision.
*An unusual type of eye movement. When asked to follow a moving object, an individual normally moves the eyes smoothly. But the eyes of the afflicted Cubans resembled a cog-wheeling pattern in which movement lagged, then jumped forward to catch up in a slow-fast-slow-fast pattern.
The visiting scientists met that evening with 15 leading Cuban ophthalmologists and Mr. Castro to explain the case definition. Many of the Cuban doctors protested, saying that they knew of many patients who definitely had the disease but who did not conform to the new definition.
Mr. Castro stood up, Dr. Sadun recalled, and said: "I get the point. You can only include real cases and cannot afford to have any false positives."
About a year ago, the Cuban Government restricted the purchase of rum. Dr. Sadun said his team had learned from patients who were promised confidentiality that they drank two or three bottles of home-brewed rum a week.
The home-brewed beverages are made from sugar cane, which contains small amounts of cyanide, and variable amounts of methanol, which can damage the eye.
Dr. Sadun said that 11 home brews were being tested for methanol and other toxins. Epidemiologists have gone into the homes of affected Cubans to determine their daily living and cooking habits to determine whether some other toxin, like a cooking oil, might be involved.
Dr. Sadun said he believed that many Cubans suffered from folic-acid deficiency. "The bottom line," he said, is that the folic-acid deficiency "has brought them up to the threshold, and at least two toxins -- cyanide and methanol -- are knocking them over the threshold."
"It's a metabolic problem and you could probably fix the disease in one of three ways," Dr. Sadun said. These are by raising the folic acid, stopping exposure to cyanide or stopping the exposure to methanol.
At one point Mr. Castro asked the group what he should do about rum. Dr. Sadun said he suggested dropping the law and giving away rum at no cost to avoid home brewing. "That could be done," Mr. Castro replied. Dr. Sadun said he was joking. But Mr. Castro said, "It's not such a bad idea."

HEADLINE: School Computers Emulate Games To Capture the Attention of Pupils

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A NEW wave of innovative computer programs and interactive devices is about to hit the nation's schools, driven by a national desire to address education problems, rapidly falling prices of computer and video technology, and the keenness of software companies to invade the vast educational market.
Representatives from Sega and Nintendo, the computer games companies, joined Apple, Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics and luminaries from government and education at a conference convened in Washington this month by the National Academy of Sciences. Their purpose was to explore how the bright new technologies of computer entertainment and communication might be harnessed to enliven the nation's classrooms. 
 The blackboard and chalk have not yet succumbed to the video screen, but some powerful new technologies are bidding to invade the long unchallenged domain of the school textbook.
 
New Technology on Display
 Multimedia kits, which enable home computers to accompany the text on a compact disk with sound and video, are already in the stores. The scope of the technology was displayed in an elaborate project on Columbus prepared by Synapse Technologies Inc. of Los Angeles for I.B.M. A special search technique lets students follow the consequences of Columbus's discovery by tracking chosen topics through history up until the American Revolution. In addition, said Synapse's president, Robert Abel, students and teachers can add their ideas electronically to the information to produce reports or to enrich the database of ideas.
A more advanced technology is the animation system developed by the SimGraphics Engineering Corporation of South Pasadena, Calif., that allows a person to choreograph directly the movements of an animated figure on a screen.
Sensors attached to an actor's head and face feed into a workstation that directs a figure on the screen to duplicate the eyebrow, cheek, head, chin and lip movements of its human counterpart. For its next trick, the SimGraphics system wires a room with remote cameras and microphones and hides the actor. Members of the audience watching the screen see a cartoon figure that can carry on a conversation with them.
Steve Glenn, vice president of SimGraphics, said the system could be used for business presentations, for entertainment or for producing hours of animation cheaply. In education, the possibilities include the animation of teaching material, or the use of a cartoon character to personalize lessons.
 
'Virtual Reality' Devices
 Even better than watching a cartoon character, people can now get a feeling for entering the computer screen themselves using the assemblage of devices that produce what is known as "virtual reality." The user wears a helmet with earphones and a screen in front of each eye on which a computer projects images. A pair of wired up gloves transmits every motion to the computer, which moves objects correspondingly in the fictitious environment it projects onto the subject's screens.
"Using virtually reality in education could have a significant impact because it is an immersive environment that blocks outside distraction," said Dr. Christopher J. Dede of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "Research shows that learning by experience is better than learning by being told something."
"Imagine being in a 'virtual' physics lab where you can change how time passes or turn gravity on and off," he said. "You would learn from the experience and remember it better." Until recently, virtual reality equipment cost thousands of dollars. But several companies have announced virtual-reality visors for video games that will be available for less than $200 by the end of the year. Dr. Dede said these would be cheap enough to be adapted for education.
The first wave of computerization has had mixed results, with many of the devices used only for drill and test exercises, or sitting in the corners of classrooms for the occasional game or class project. Still, many education experts are willing to keep trying.
At the meeting they noted that outside school, many children now live in a technology-rich world of television, personal computers, video games and myriad electronic devices, while the traditional classroom has remained largely unchanged.
"Schools today are one of the few work places in our society that our grandparents would recognize easily," said Dr. David V. B. Britt, president of the Children's Television Workshop in New York City.
"Outside of school, even the low-level technology of television has already proved its effectiveness as an educator, for good and for things not so good," Dr. Britt said. "Evidence suggests that other technology can help, enabling children to be powerful learners, if designed to deal with specific education areas."
Joseph Smarr, a sixth grader at Urbana Middle School in Illinois, told a session that activities outside school were more interesting and challenging than inside. Video and computer game software grabs youngsters' attention and provides a sense of accomplishment often unmatched in school, he said.
"With games and entertainment, kids are active and making decisions every second," he said. "In school, you sit there and make a decision every half-hour."
Susan Harman of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a San Francisco market analysis concern, estimated that the educational technology market would grow 20 percent a year for the rest of the decade because of pressure for reform, improved technology, falling prices and a high birth rate creating more students.
More than 65 percent of homes with school-age children have video games, far more than personal computers, industry data show. The devices, which typically cost less than $100, are ubiquitous in homes of every economic group. Instead of associating educational technology only with computers and other expensive hardware, some experts said, why not also think of using the lower-tech devices already in so many homes and add educational value to them?
"We are certainly capable of delivering entertainment with a strong educational content," Douglas Glen, a vice president for Sega of America Inc., said at the meeting while demonstrating some of this company's popular game software, including the latest version of Sonic the Hedgehog.
"There are millions of video game systems in homes and we will soon be testing a system to deliver new software directly to the home via a cable television channel," Mr. Glen said, "We would like to put this infrastructure at the service of education, but what we haven't got is the content, which the educators have to bring to the table."
Perrin Kaplan, a spokeswoman for Nintendo of America Inc., said in a telephone interview that her company was moving into "edutainment" software to augment the traditional entertainment value of video games. The company's new "Mario Paint and Mouse" package, which includes a video painting program and mouse control device for less than $60, is a best seller that is being used in some schools to teach art and animation, she said. She said Nintendo had also licensed its popular Mario brothers characters to Software Toolworks Inc., of Novato, Calif., to produce the "Mario is Missing!" game, which teaches world geography and history.
"Our research in the past has shown that anything you call 'educational' doesn't move off the toy shelf," Ms. Kaplan said. "Nintendo is in the entertainment business and to the degree that we can entertain and have educational value in products that sell, we will do more."
 
New Perspective on Education
 Dr. Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said the view of looking at educational technology from the bottom up, as well as the top down, presented a new way of reaching children. "If we can combine the skills of the creators of the Mario brothers with those of people who understand education and cognitive science, and do it in a way that schools and homes can afford, this could be a major leap forward for education," he said.
But Dr. Press stressed, "Anyone who believes technology is a panacea for poor teaching, underfunded schools, poor community participation, the lack of discipline and all the other things that are wrong with education is making a big mistake.
"There are fundamental problems, such as underpaid teachers and school bureaucracies, that have to be addressed," he said. "But at the same time we have to find new ways of educating our children."

HEADLINE: Trade or Colonialism? Ruins May Give Answer

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
ON a limestone bluff overlooking the Euphrates in southeastern Turkey, a low mound spreads across several acres, blanketing the ruins of a settlement that bustled with life and trade in the late fourth millennium B.C. The ruins may tell a tale of how the world's first urban societies reached into the hinterlands for raw materials and thus started the earliest practice of colonialism.
Or it may turn out to be a somewhat different story. 
 The first archeological excavations at the Turkish site of Hacinebi Tepe, begun last summer, have yielded surprising results. A preliminary examination of the stones, mud brick, ceramics and other artifacts suggests that the local people at Hacinebi may well have been trading with their supposed Mesopotamian masters as equals.
If so, these new findings do more than provide additional evidence of the widespread Mesopotamian presence among their neighbors to the north; they also raise serious questions about the nature of that relationship. Were they really there as colonialists? Perhaps they were only merchants in a widening network of long-distance trade, asserting little or none of the political, military or economic dominance usually associated with colonialism. They might even have been there, in some cases, as refugees.
Dr. Gil J. Stein, an anthropologist at Northwestern University who is directing the excavations, said the discoveries at Hacinebi are "provoking us to think of ancient colonization in a dramatically different way."
Further research at Hacinebi, scheduled to resume next month, promises to be equally provocative. Although other sites of Mesopotamian trading outposts and presumed colonies have been sampled before, this is the first one known to be superimposed on an existing local community. There is a well-preserved layer of artifacts of the people who lived there for generations before the Mesopotamians arrived. Immediately above it is a layer of indigenous artifacts and architectural remains mingled with clear evidence of a Mesopotamian presence.
Dr. William Sumner, director of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, said this was the first opportunity for archeologists to investigate the role of the indigenous societies in these trading centers and determine their relationship with the foreigners.
Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an anthropologist at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in the colonialism of ancient civilizations, said: "This site has great potential. We will be seeing to what extent the enterprise was exploitative or more reciprocal, and seeing the social and economic impact it had on the locals."
A guiding hypothesis of ancient Mesopotamian studies has been that resource exploitation of foreign lands, not unlike modern colonialism, went hand in hand with the emergence of the first urban political states. This was happening in the midst of one of the most momentous transitions of antiquity, the beginning not just of history but also of civilization.
Some 700 miles down river from Hacinebi, in the years between 3500 and 3100 B.C., people living along the lower Euphrates and Tigris Rivers were cultivating the fertile plains with increasing success. Their irrigated fields were producing grain surpluses, and their flocks were shorn for a growing textile industry. People congregated in towns, notably Uruk, where they erected walls and imposing buildings and learned to keep account of their surpluses and industries by methods that would soon lead to writing, and so the beginning of history.
But these nascent city-states of southern Mesopotamia, in what is now Iraq, could not fill their need for metals and timber or their desire for semiprecious stones with which the elite could flaunt their rising status. For these goods, they had to look to the presumably less advanced but resource-rich societies on the plains and in the valleys of southwestern Iran and in the northern highlands of Syria and Turkey. Scholars described this outreach as the Uruk expansion.
Writing in next month's issue of American Anthropologist, Dr. Algaze compares Uruk's distant trading outposts to such modern examples as the Portuguese colony of Goa in India and the British colony of Hong Kong. The Uruk outposts, he said, "reflect a system of economic hegemony whereby early emergent states attempted to exploit less complex polities located well beyond the boundaries of their direct political control and that this system may be construed as imperialistic in both its extent and nature."
Recent excavations in the archeology of colonialism have revealed the ruins of several such Uruk outposts on major trade routes. One of the best documented is Godin Tepe, sitting astride the Khorasan Road, the most important east-west route crossing the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Settlers from the Uruk world appeared to have lived inside a fort that was surrounded by a local community. Their remains include some of the earliest evidence of beer and wine.
Since Godin Tepe must have existed far beyond Uruk's political control and presumably could not have survived for long without local acquiescence, archeologists have assumed this was not so much a colony as a trading post operated by Uruk merchants. One of the excavators, Dr. T. Cuyler Young Jr. of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, likened Godin to an early operation of the Hudson Bay Company, where merchants set up shop in remote places and bought and sold or traded goods with the indigenous population of Canada.
Archeologists think that Habuba Kabira had all the marks of a full-fledged colonial settlement. Situated on a bend of the upper Euphrates in Syria, just south of the Turkish border, this site appeared to be the hub of several nearby Uruk settlements. In the 1970's, German archeologists revealed Habuba Kabira to have been a fortified city with well-differentiated residential, industrial and administrative quarters apparently built as part of a single master plan. The architecture and artifacts leave no doubt that the inhabitants were colonists from southern Mesopotamia.
When Hacinebi was identified as a ruin from the period of Uruk expansion, archeologists saw it as an ideal site for addressing questions as to whether this was, in fact, an early form of colonialism.
The site occupies a strategic position. It is only a few miles north of the ancient east-west river crossing point at the town of Birecik. It is also on the main north-south riverine trade route, linking the copper mines of Anatolia with the Mesopotamian heartland to the south. In the colonial hypothesis, places like Hacinebi served as outposts for procuring resources or as transshipment points for materials destined for the Mesopotamian cities.
Digging there last summer, American and Turkish archeologists found a layer of buried ruins containing bowls, cooking pots and other ceramics that were all in the local Anatolian style. So there definitely had been a village at Hacinebi before the Mesopotamians came looking for copper and timber.
Moreover, Dr. Stein said, some of their artifacts could undermine the assumption by many scholars that Mesopotamian trade and colonization led to the emergence of complex societies in these resource-rich but relatively underdeveloped regions of Anatolia. A pendant made of soapstone, a product of southeast Iran, indicated that the villagers engaged in long-distance trade. Ruins of a monumental public building, the kind usually associated with more advanced urban centers, suggested that, as Dr. Stein said, these local people had evolved "a much more complex society than we've given them credit for up to now."
Immediately above the Anatolian village strata was a bed of beveled rim ceramics in the Mesopotamian style and the remnants of buildings on a raised stone terrace, an unmistakable change in architecture. Mesopotamian and Anatolian pottery are mixed together; in one place, the foreign pottery is found on one side of a wall and the local pottery on the other.
Dr. Stein said there are two ways of interpreting these findings. "One possibility is that a small group of Mesopotamians were living and trading inside the local settlement," he said. "Or perhaps the local people had come in close contact with the Mesopotamians and were emulating them."
Also uncovered at the site were chunks of bitumen, a tar substance that was widely used by the Uruk culture for sealing and waterproofing ceramic containers. Bitumen is rarely found outside ancient Mesopotamia, and Dr. Stein said its use as a sealant suggests that goods were being received at Hacinebi from the outside world.
The presence of embossed clay seals, Dr. Stein said, indicates that Hacinebi was somehow involved in administering the movement of goods. The seals were applied to the doors of storerooms and to ceramic storage jars to certify a transaction, mark the contents and prevent tampering. At least one of the seals was clearly stamped in the local manner, suggesting that local people, and not just Mesopotamians, participated in an official capacity in this trading system.
"Several lines of evidence suggest that existing models of the Uruk expansion may have underestimated the role of the local cultures," Dr. Stein said. "First, the locals were already relatively developed before contact with the Uruk culture. Second, they were not pawns in the trading system, but more or less equal partners. So you see, the classic colonial model doesn't really work."
In any event, the Uruk influence at Hacinebi lasted no more than 175 years, ending around 3100 B.C. Soon the Uruk culture would decline and be succeeded by the even more robust and innovative Sumerian civilization of the third millennium B.C.
Even before the Hacinebi discoveries, some scholars were taking shots at the hypothesis that the Uruk expansion was the manifestation of an early empire and its faraway colonies. Not the least of the problems with the hypothesis, according to Dr. Susan Pollock, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Binghamton, is the absence of trade goods in the archeological record.
In an article last year in The Journal of World Prehistory, Dr. Pollock dismissed possible explanations that the goods were perishable or that as objects of trade, they would not have remained at the trading posts. It is assumed that textiles might have been a staple of trade from Uruk to the hinterlands, and so would have decayed over time. But the trade goods moving back to Uruk were supposedly such nonperishable materials as metal and semiprecious stones.
True, copper was showing up in Mesopotamia about the time that Uruk styles were showing up at Hacinebi. But to Dr. Pollock it is "difficult to conceive of a situation in which the traders or colonists would not have taken advantage of the opportunities to exploit the situation for as much as they could get away with."
If they had skimmed off some exotic goods, where were they in the ruins? The place to look, Dr. Pollock said, was in graves at the Uruk outposts. But few graves have been found so far.
Even more emphatic in opposition is Dr. Gregory A. Johnson, an anthropologist at Hunter College in New York, who said the colonial hypothesis "simply doesn't hold water."
Scholars tend to forget, Dr. Johnson said, that this was a period of severe population decline in many southern Mesopotamian cities, including Ur, Eridu and Nippur. "When you're losing half your population, something nasty must be going on," he said, and the collapse could be behind the sudden appearance of Mesopotamian settlements in the highlands. It was not an empire expanding, he said, but disintegrating.
As a leading exponent of the idea that colonialism sprang almost inevitably from the rise of the first political states, Dr. Algaze is not backing down from his imperial interpretation of the Uruk expansion. Indeed, he has expanded his brief to show that similar expansionary dynamics had led four other early civilizations -- the Sumerians, Teotihuacan in Central Mexico, the Harappan culture in the Indus River basin of Pakistan and the predynastic Egyptians -- to reach out for resources and territory.
With theories hanging in the balance, archeologists will be awaiting this summer's excavations on the east bank of the Euphrates at Hacinebi.

Drawings: Seals and Local Participation in Trade
Seal impressions found on storage jars and chambers at Hacinebi suggest that local people, not just Mesopotamians, were active in the ancient trade system. The seals studied are from the period of the greatest contact with Mesopotamia, and both stamp seals and cylinder seals were in use. Dr. Gil Stein believes the locals adapted the artistic style of the Mesopotamians in some seal designs.

Map: Colonialists or Merchants?
Excavations at Hacinebi, Turkey, have identified the first outpost of the Uruk city-state known to have been superimposed on an existing community. Archeologists theorize that these Mesopotamians were perhaps not exploiting the less-advanced but resource-rich Anatolians, but rather co-existing and cooperating with them.

KELLOGG EXPECTS LOWER QUARTERLY EARNINGS

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company, the largest maker of cereals in the world, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings would fall short of the $168 million in profits in the corresponding period a year ago. Kellogg, which is based in Battle Creek, Mich., said it expected its second-quarter earnings to be 10 percent below those of the second quarter last year. The company will report its results in July. Analysts said Kellogg and other cereal producers have had difficulty raising prices because of sluggish worldwide economies. 
 Kellogg stock fell $2.75, to a new 52-week low of $53.875, in trading of almost 1.2 million shares yesterday. Shares of other cereal makers also fell: the Ralston Purina Company lost $1.25, to $46; General Mills Inc. fell $2, to $67.375; and the Quaker Oats Company lost $1.125, to $72.50.

HEADLINE: For True School Decentralization, Close Central Board of Ed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"A School System -- For the Kids" (editorial, May 15) and "Who Can Fix the City's Schools?" (May 18), on school governance in New York City, claim that what is needed is to go beyond mere "tinkering at the margins." Yet this is the tack you take. Few argue with the need to abandon the byzantine fashion we elect local school board members or to take steps to stem the patronage that eats away at the system. However, it is only by attacking the systemic waste of resources that we can hope to turn the future around for our children.
The bill in Albany representing the proposal put forth by Queens Borough President Claire Schulman and myself gives parents, principals and teachers more authority over the running of their institutions. It has the most sweeping anti-corruption package of any current proposal. It increases mayoral accountability through a commissioner of education, who would oversee budget issues, monitor compliance with mandates and negotiate labor contracts. 
 By eliminating the central Board of Education and drastically shrinking the duties of 110 Livingston Street, our proposal moves dollars and responsibility toward the classroom.
You reduce this effort to a borough power grab. Regional boards exist throughout the state. Our call for similar units in New York City would insure a mechanism for economical interdistrict cooperation. We believe transportation, capital planning and a few other educational services are best delivered at the borough level. Our plan works against the bureaucratic concentration and graft you warn against by capping expenses for all levels of the system.
Sure, real decentralization has risks -- risks synonymous with the promise and perils of democracy. No centralized structure can competently run a system of 1 million students. The time for thoughtful and radical action to make decentralization real is now.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances 14.95 on Moderate Volume

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday in relatively modest trading after a sharp drop on Friday.
But the winning stocks seemed to be concentrated among blue-chip issues like A.T.& T., I.B.M. and Disney. Indeed, on the New York Stock Exchange, losing stocks narrowly outnumbered winners 992 to 950. 
 Stock traders appeared to have already discounted a reported willingness by the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates. A rise in bond prices and a fall in gold prices kept traders firmly invested, at least for now, in stocks.
 
Gold Prices Drop
 While surging convincingly for much of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average failed to return to its record high of 3,523.28 and closed up 14.95 points, to 3,507.78. Other leading market indexes, except for the American Stock Exchange, closed up as well.
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the Federal Reserve Board voted early last week to lean toward higher short-term interest rates. What normally would have been viewed as hurting the stock and bond markets seems to have been interpreted by bond traders as a long-term positive by helping to fight inflation. When bonds firmed and gold prices fell, stocks rose.
Whatever the reasoning, the Dow fell into negative territory of about 5.5 points only fleetingly and traded as high as 22 points above the opening, to 3,513.59. Computerized trading did not appear to play as large a role yesterday as in sessions last week.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed up 0.80 point, to 247.07. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 198 million shares, well below the 273.2 million on Friday and the 279.5 million on Thursday, when the Dow hit a record high.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.16 points, to 448.00, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.40, to 694.69. The American Stock Exchange market value index, which reflects the Amex's higher proportion of gold stocks, fell 1.17, to 431.69.
Gold prices fell and gold stocks declined or remained unchanged. Gold spot contracts for June delivery declined $3.70, to $374.20 an ounce. Among gold stocks, Newmont Mining declined 1 3/8, to 50 3/4. Echo Bay Mines fell 3/8, to 11 3/4, and, as it has been for many of the sessions in the last several weeks, was the most-active stock on the American Stock Exchange, with volume of 2.75 million shares.
In Nasdaq trading, Tele-Communications was the most active stock, with 6.8 million shares changing hands. Shares of the nation's largest cable-television operator closed up 1 1/4, to 21 7/8.
Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting, whose Cable News Network is carried on many cable systems, said his company was developing plans for a new CNN foreign-news channel as well as a new entertainment channel emphasizing old movies.
The warrants and stock of Andrea Electronics were the biggest percentage losers on the American Stock Exchange. The stock closed down 11, to 75, after news reports noted the speculative frenzy that had driven its price as high as 103. Thinly traded, the company, which expects to offer a noise-cancellation systems, plans to increase its shares outstanding.
Kellogg, the cereal maker, fell 2 3/8, to 53 7/8, on relatively heavy volume of nearly a million shares. The decline followed Kellogg's announcement yesterday that it expected second-quarter earnings to be 10 percent lower than a year earlier because of a slump in its foreign markets.
American Online, which provides computer information services to consumers and businesses, saw its shares rise 2 1/4, to 36 1/2, on the expectation that Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, might buy it.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about Monday's stock trading referred incorrectly to securities of the Andrea Electronics Corporation. The only publicly traded Andrea securities are common shares and the shares that will be outstanding after the company completes a five-for-one stock split; there are no warrants.

HEADLINE: Belgrade Reneges on Verification Of Ban on Arming Bosnian Serbs

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 25

 BODY:
Serbian leaders told a Russian mediator today that they were not prepared to accept international monitors on their border with Bosnia and Herzegovina to verify their assertions that they were not supplying Bosnian Serb forces with weapons or other military supplies.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who a month ago said international observers would be welcome to confirm that his Government was enforcing an embargo on military aid to Bosnian Serbs, told Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, that there was now "no need" for them. 
 His remark confirmed a stiffening in Serbian attitudes in recent days that reflected their clear sense that they had won the war against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces, and that the feared American and European pressure against the Serbs had dissipated.
 
Reversal on Vance-Owen Plan
 Mr. Milosevic had endorsed the so-called Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia and had announced an embargo against the Bosnian Serbs when they refused to accept it. Those moves seemed to be made in part to persuade the West to lift the economic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, the two states that make up what is left officially of Yugoslavia.
On Monday, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, told Mr. Churkin that his side would never recognize the division of Bosnia into 10 semiautonomous regions as provided in the Vance-Owen plan.
Serbs will recognize only one Bosnian state, Dr. Karadzic said, the "Republika Srpska" that Bosnian Serbs have carved out of lands they now control in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "On this, we will not give up," he vowed.
The hardening of terms reflected the Serbs' general contempt for the plan announced by the United States, Russia and three European countries last weekend to contain the war, a plan Mr. Churkin came to Belgrade to explain to their leaders before making a brief trip to the restive Serbian province of Kosovo, which is more than 90 percent populated by ethnic Albanians.
 
Why the Change in Attitude?
 Mr. Milosevic said the plan was seen as proof that the international community had decided against military intervention in the Balkans, but officials made clear that what he really meant was that the Clinton Administration had backed off from the use of force. A few months ago, when they did not know what President Clinton's policy would be, Serbian officials were acting more contritely, and some said they were willing to compromise to find peace.
Now that it is clear that Mr. Clinton and America's European allies are not going to commit their military forces to a cruel war in the Balkans, the Serbs have abandoned such statements, dismissing the latest international admonitions to shape up or face "new and tougher measures" as empty saber-rattling.
The language of brute force is understood in a part of the world where Serbs, Croats and Muslims have intermittently slaughtered and intermingled with each other over centuries. But they also can read the plain language in the weekend declaration out of Washington that makes it clear that Americans and Europeans are simply not willing to risk their own lives and money to stop the fighting here.
Few Serbs would disagree with the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, who a few weeks ago complained that the Serbs had led the Western countries around by the nose for the last year, promising peace while continuing war, and little has changed today.
 
Peace Plan Regarded as Dead
 At the time Mr. Clinton was proposing to lift the arms embargo for the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces and selected air strikes against Serb positions, Mr. Milosevic persuaded Mr. Karadzic to support the so-called Vance-Owen peace plan. But the self-styled Bosnia Serb parliament, supported by an overwhelming majority of voters, again rejected the plan early this month, and now both Serbian leaders clearly regard the plan as a dead letter.
It may not have been just the threat of military force that made Mr. Milosevic waver briefly. The international economic embargo against Serbia is crushing the life out of its economy. There are now 1.5 million unemployed, about 50 percent of the labor force. As a cashier at the Hyatt Hotel mentioned the other day while counting a huge stack of 50,000-dinar bills, each now worth only about 16 cents, she wasn't worried about robbers, because skyrocketing inflation had made the money worth virtually nothing.
But even the ordinary Serbs who are the worst affected do not seem to object to the leaders whose war policies have brought misery upon them. Americans here are routinely accosted by people who blame Mr. Clinton for their deprivations.
"I don't think Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Karadzic lack anything," said Hamdija Jusuf Spahic, the Muslim Mufti of Belgrade, at the 300-year-old mosque here on Sunday, "but the poor, who are blameless, are suffering."
 
Radical Serbs Gain Strength
 The Mufti denounced Mr. Karadzic a criminal and the war as bestial, but like most ordinary people here he can do little to stop it. Instead, the radical Serb nationalists are gaining strength. Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who like President Milosevic is a former Communist, spent much of the last week touring Bosnian battlefields like a medieval sovereign and decorating Serb fighters with paramilitary titles and medals.
With ultranationalists like him and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb fighters, now in the ascendancy, Mr. Milosevic and President Dobrica Cosic of the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro have now retreated from earlier feints toward moderation.
"Anybody who suggested we make concessions to the U.N. now would have enormous difficulties, and we already do with our brothers over there," an adviser to Mr. Cosic said over the weekend, referring to the Bosnian Serbs.
The Yugoslav President objected to the continuation of the international sanctions in a meeting with Mr. Churkin here on Monday, and Dr. Karadzic even seemed to raise an obstacle to United Nations safety zones in Bosnia for the remaining Muslim refugees.
The self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament has rejected the presence of foreign military forces on Bosnian soil, Dr. Karadzic told the Tanyug press agency, implying that United Nations troop reinforcements to protect the refugees would be rejected just as resolutely as monitors would be kept from fanning out along the border.
 
Loss for the NATO Alliance>
 If the Bosnian Muslims are the big losers on the ground here, the NATO alliance and the United States are losers in a larger sense.
NATO officials in Belgium said before the latest international plan was issued that the alliance had failed to cope with the challenge of ethnic violence in the Balkans because the Bush and Clinton Administrations had not provided clear leadership. Both were undecided about what to do.
Faced with a decision between sending in American soldiers to fight and die in Bosnia or just watching while the slaughter of the Muslims continued, Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave mixed signals to the European allies, and got equally mixed signals back. In the end they compromised, agreeing to back European and other United Nations forces if they tried to contain the fighting along existing front lines and protect the Muslims in the five enclaves of territory left to them. But the United States would use only air power to protect the peacekeepers, and then only if they came under attack themselves and asked for help.
"Without a commitment of ground forces, without spending money and without spending lives, you're not going to play a role here," said a Western diplomat who believes international ineffectiveness will only prolong and further poison the Balkans conflict. "The only way this can be stopped is by strong outside intervention, and it's clear that it isn't going to happen."
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 In YUGOSLAVIA, the plan to contain the fighting in BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA that the West has agreed on, appeared to be viewed yesterday as world acceptance of a Bosnian Serb victory.
With the West backing away from a showdown, the question in ZAGREB, CROATIA, is whether the Croatian President will bide his time or renew attacks on Serbian-held territory in Croatia.
The latest plan to end fighting in Bosnia drew fire in BRUSSELS from some NATO allies who say its provisions for setting up safe areas for Muslim civilians would reward Serbian aggression. Foreign ministers discussed plans for more peacekeeping troops.
Serbs in CROATIA said they would boycott scheduled talks with the Croatian authorities on future relations until Croatian troops withdraw from disputed territory.

HEADLINE: Dental Care for Children Is Considered by Clinton

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton told consumer advocates today that she hoped the President's health plan would cover comprehensive dental care for children and some dental services for adults.
Mrs. Clinton said she hoped the plan would include coverage of "acute dental care for adults." Such care usually includes emergency care and services to control infection and bleeding and to relieve pain. 
 The study group on health care headed by Mrs. Clinton is recommending to the President that full dental care for children and partial coverage for adults be included, according to a briefing book prepared for Mrs. Clinton.
 
Balancing Pros and Cons
 But the President, who will have to weigh the costs of his proposals as well as their political appeal, has not made a final decision on dental benefits.
As work continues on President Clinton's health plan, the White House today identified 32 outside experts chosen to audit the proposal, amid indications of further delay in submitting it to Congress.
Mrs. Clinton described the Administration's thinking on dental care at a meeting with about 500 consumer advocates and health-care experts. The meeting was closed, but details were obtained tonight from people who attended the session and took notes.
In recent weeks, Administration officials have suggested that Mr. Clinton's plan will include some coverage of mental-health care, long-term care and prescription drugs. But Mr. Clinton might have to scale down some of his promises or defer coverage if he ultimately concludes that his proposals as a whole cost more than Congress, consumers and employers are willing to pay.
The White House has already said that Mr. Clinton will ask Congress to define a comprehensive package of medical benefits that must be provided to all Americans under public and private health insurance plans.
At today's meeting, Martha L. Liggett, general counsel of the American Association of Dental Schools, asked Mrs. Clinton whether the "mandatory package" would include dental care.
Ms. Liggett quoted Mrs. Clinton as saying: "I hope so. I hope it will include a children's program and acute dental care for adults."
 
Plight of the Poor
 A confidential briefing book prepared for Mrs. Clinton uses "children" to refer to people through the age of 17 or 18. The briefing book says that more than 90 percent of Americans have oral diseases like tooth decay, gum disease and oral cancer. The book says that poor people and members of minority groups are "particularly at risk" because they have no dental insurance or cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs of dental care.
Mrs. Clinton did not say how employers or the Government would pay for the dental health benefits.
Ms. Liggett of the dental schools' association welcomed Mrs. Clinton's comments today. "I'm delighted at the recognition that adults currently have no safety net for serious dental problems," she said. "It appears that Mrs. Clinton appreciates the need for acute dental coverage for adults. Without such coverage, poor people have to turn to emergency rooms of hospitals for oral health care."
While public health experts and dental colleges have urged that dental care be included in any national health plan, many practicing private dentists oppose this, saying it would disrupt a system that works well for most Americans. They call instead for separate programs to help poor people obtain dental care.
Dr. John S. Zapp, executive director of the American Dental Association, reacted cautiously to Mrs. Clinton's comments. "We would support a preventive dental health-care program for children and comprehensive coverage for all indigent people," he said. "But for the nonindigent adult population, we prefer the current private-sector benefits program, including private health insurance negotiated in the workplace, which has a good record of cost containment."
 
150 Million Lack Insurance
 The Government says that at least 150 million Americans have no dental insurance. From 90 million to 100 million people have private coverage, which has increasingly been offered by employers, but the coverage ranges from comprehensive to meager.
Americans spent $39 billion on dental care last year. That accounts for 5 percent of national health spending, as against 21 percent for doctors' services and 45 percent for hospital care, the Government says. Dental costs are rising, but not as fast as the overall cost of medical care.
The outside experts who will audit Mr. Clinton's health-care proposal are divided into three teams. One consists of lawyers analyzing possible legal problems in the plan. Another includes actuaries and accountants checking the cost. A third consists of executives who have experience slashing paper work and bureaucracy at hospitals and health maintenance organizations around the country.
In interviews today, several members of the legal audit team said the Administration appeared to have neglected legal issues in developing its proposals to revamp the nation's health-care system.
By contrast, Richard Ostuw, chairman of the cost audit team, gave the Administration high marks for its efforts to estimate the cost of proposed benefits. "Nobody can be totally confident about health-care cost projections, but the Administration has done a very thorough and professional job," he said.
 
Meeting Is Delayed
 With dozens of major decisions still to be made, Mr. Clinton had planned to meet Monday with his top advisers on economic and health policy. But the meeting was put off so White House officials could focus on the President's budget and tax package, scheduled for a vote this week in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Clinton originally said he would send Congress a detailed legislative proposal on health care by May 3, but he fell behind schedule. White House officials have been saying recently that the plan will be sent to Congress in mid-June, and Mrs. Clinton made a similar prediction on Saturday. But White House officials now say that the end of June looks more likely.
Many Administration officials want to wait until Congress has completed work on the President's budget and tax plans, the main vehicle for his efforts to revive the nation's economy, and the Senate is not expected to take up that legislation until late June.

HEADLINE: Guatemalan, Supported by Army, Disbands Congress and the Court

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, May 25

 BODY:
President Jorge Serrano Elias dissolved the Congress and the Supreme Court today and suspended constitutional rights in what appeared to be a military-backed effort to silence growing political and economic protests.
Mr. Serrano, a conservative former businessman whose two-year push to end the country's 32-year civil war has foundered in recent weeks, said he would rule temporarily by decree to stem a "breakdown in law and order." 
 Almost as Mr. Serrano announced the measures this morning in a broadcast address, the homes of the Attorney General and the presidents of the Congress and the Supreme Court were surrounded by security forces.
The Government's human rights ombudsman, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who has accused the armed forces of responsibility for political murders and kidnapping, told reporters he was going into hiding.
The capital remained tense after the announcement, but stores opened and people seemed to go on with their lives. Police officers took over the Congress and soldiers patrolled some streets.
Mr. Serrano said he would hold elections within 60 days for a national assembly to change unspecified elements of the constitution. He also promised to leave office as scheduled, in January 1996.
"I have decided to suspend the constitution temporarily and partly," he said. Later he added, "Today they will criticize me, but tomorrow the people of Guatamala will thank me."
The President's move interrupted seven years of democratic rule that had been plagued by intermittent political strife, a leftist insurgency and the continuing power of right-wing military officers. Before the inauguration of Mr. Serrano's predecessor, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, in 1986, the military had ruled almost continuously since 1954 when, with Washington's support, it ousted an elected leftist president.
 
Wielding an 'Iron Hand'
 In recent days, diplomats said, hard-line military officers have been taking a more active role in politics. In particular, they said, military leaders have pressed for a tougher line against labor union and student groups that have protested, sometimes violently, against economic austerity policies.
Apparently in response to military demands, Mr. Serrano said last week that he would apply an "iron hand" against protesters. On Friday the President formed a new riot squad of soldiers and police officers. But that same day, thousands of protesters marched peacefully through the capital, which buzzed with rumors of a military coup.
The chief military spokesman, Capt. Julio Yon Rivera, dismissed reports of a military role in the President's decision. He said military leaders supported Mr. Serrano because he is Commander in Chief.
Mr. Serrano's decisions today bore striking similarities to those taken in April 1992 by President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru, who suspended the constitution in the face of rising civil protests, military pressure and a far more serious threat from leftist guerrillas.
Though Mr. Fujimori assumed virtual dictatorial powers, he was praised by many Peruvians for acting decisively. His public support surged, and the United States and other countries eventually set aside their objections.
Like his Peruvian counterpart, Mr. Serrano justified his actions as necessary to "purge the state of all its forms of corruption with which you and I are totally fed up."
Mr. Serrano did not explain how he would do this. For the moment, officials said, the Government was suspending freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
 
Criticism From Abroad
 At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Serrano said he hoped the international community would support him. Instead, his actions were criticized by other Latin American governments and by Spain, which has long sought an end to Guatemala's war.
The Clinton Administration was also sharply critical.
"This illegitimate course of action threatens to place Guatemala outside the democratic community of nations," the White House said in a statement. "We strongly condemn such efforts to resolve Guatemala's problems through non-democratic means."
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, telephoned President Serrano this morning to urge him to reverse course.
 
Criticism From Within
 Opposition political leaders, human rights advocates and the Indian leader Rigoberta Menchu, winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, all assailed Mr. Serrano in blistering terms. "The entire world is repudiating what is really a coup d'etat in Guatemala," Miss Menchu said.
"There is a whole corrupt political tradition in this country," said Labor Minister Mario Solorzano, who joined other Social Democrats in a mass resignation. "But the way to resolve it is not a constitutional step backward," he added.
Guatemala's Ambassador to Washington, Edmundo Mulet, also resigned.
Manuel Conde Orellana, the Government's chief representative in its stalled talks with the leftist rebels, told reporters that the Government had been paralyzed by cocaine traffickers who had increasingly used Guatemala as a transshipment point between Colombia and Mexico.
But according to diplomats and drug-enforcement officials, that corruption has centered in the police and security forces, which did not seem to be affected by today's steps.
What seemed to have been the more immediate concern were the growing street protests. Their focus has been on economic measures like increases in bus fares, but the marchers on Friday also chanted loudly for Mr. Serrano's resignation.

HEADLINE: Savings Estimate Lowered

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced yesterday that savings from the Treasury's decision to shift more of its borrowing to shorter-term, lower interest rate notes and bills would save less than expected.
In the President's budget, the Office and Management and Budget had assumed a savings of $16.4 billion over the five fiscal years through 1998. But the O.M.B said in a statement that the savings were now estimated to be $10.8 billion, less than two thirds of the original goal. 
The Treasury announced its borrowing shift May 5. After the announcement, Administration and Congressional officials indicated that the savings would be only one-third to two-thirds of the $16.4 billion goal.
One reason for the lower savings is that the Treasury, which is cutting its 30-year bond sales by about 40 percent, is not shifting all this borrowing to three-month and six-month Treasury bills, which have the lowest interest rates. Instead, the borrowing will be shifted to three-year notes and two-year notes and Treasury bills.
The Congressional Budget Office's forecast of savings is much lower, at $6.4 billion, or more than a third of the original estimate. The main reason for the difference is the C.B.O.'s assumption that without the Treasury borrowing shift, annual sales of 30-year bonds would have stayed at $37 billion, which was the current rate. The O.M.B. assumed that these sales would have increased to $49 billion by 1988.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Russia's Technology Tag Sale

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 24

 BODY:
Standing amid the largest exhibit yet of technology developed by the former Soviet Union, Sergei P. Gavrilov, the head of marketing for the Distant Radiocommunication Scientific Research Institute of Moscow, struggled to formulate a sales pitch for the radar system displayed on the wall behind him.
After intently pondering a question about the advantages his product might have over its Western counterparts, Mr. Gavrilov finally answered. "Basically," he said, "we're competing on price." 
 As it increases its efforts to attract Western investment and customers to the vast network of research laboratories and factories that once supported the Soviet military, Russia seems to be adopting a bargain-basement approach.
In displaying their wares, the Russians are looking for customers to buy ready-made products, or distributors to sell them in the West or companies willing to license any variety of technologies for manufacture abroad.
 
Fruits of Cold War
 On display here this week in a huge convention hall are the fruits of hundreds of billions of dollars and decades worth of work, Soviet industry's contribution to the cold war. There are designs for aircraft, highly advanced techniques for manufacturing artificial diamonds, mockups of nuclear power generators for ships, optical equipment, highly reliable valves and all kinds of electronic sensors. Formerly the guts of the nation's military hardware and software, they are now for sale -- but, the show's Russian organizers stressed, for peaceful purposes only.
The Main Department for Rocket Space Technology, once dedicated to building the missiles that might have been sent raining down on the United States, came here to peddle not just the latest in satellite thruster technology, but refrigerators, irons and ice cream makers.
The Chief Directorate of Ammunition and Special Chemistry offers special machinery to chop up unneeded ships, airplanes and missiles, as well as candy and baby-food production lines. Satellite sensors developed to detect missiles taking off are now being adapted to spot forest fires.
It is hard to say whether the Russians will make any sales to or attract any investment from the Western electronics companies, manufacturers, import-export companies, government representatives and venture capitalists invited to the show. The idea, the show's organizers said, was to take the wraps off technologies that had long been held as national secrets and to begin the process of marketing.
Then again, it was clear that the Russians had a long way to go in developing the Las Vegas-style pizazz that usually permeates trade shows. Instead of glamorous models handing out slick sales brochures, the Russians were represented by fidgety engineers smoking cigarettes in booths in an atmosphere that at times resembled a tag sale, with fishing rods propped next to the latest in plastic explosives.
Relatively few of the technologies and industrial processes that Russia is showing off are cutting-edge or offer significant improvements over what is already commercially available in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world.
 
Low Labor Costs

 
 But with Russia's low labor costs, and research and development costs that were borne by the Soviet Government before the collapse of Communism, the prices of the technology can often be well below those of similar products in the West.
Even with the price advantage, though, Russia is clearly having difficulty attracting the amount of Western interest it needs to support its beleaguered military-related industries -- which, like many of their Western counterparts, are now searching for a peacetime mission.
Russia, of course, is still selling arms outright to foreign purchasers in an effort to keep its huge arms industry afloat. But many factories and research centers, seeing little future in arms production, are converting from military to civilian output, using their skills and technologies to try to meet the needs of a wide range of industries as well as foreign governments.
With the Russian economy and the former Soviet trading bloc in shambles, the only hope for many of the enterprises to stay afloat is to develop markets in the West. And the Western business executives who came here to kick the tires of the former Soviet war machine said that even when a Russian product looks interesting, the risks and difficulties of doing business with a country in political and economic upheaval will often prove daunting, if not insurmountable.
"There's a lot of interesting technology with possible applications, but many of the real questions have yet to be answered," said James C. Brown of Harlow Associates, a company based in Reston, Va., that is seeking to become a middleman in deals between Russia and Western companies and governments.
Western executives said pricing information remained sketchy. They said there were great uncertainties about whether crucial technologies were really available to buy, and whether the Russian Government would approve all deals made by companies that are just beginning to move to private ownership.
 
Listening to Customers
 For all the problems, though, Western executives said their Russian counterparts were putting behind them their Soviet-era mentality, under which almost all technology was designed with its military applications in mind and with little regard for cost or commercial viability. Increasingly, they said, the Russians are learning to listen to what their potential customers want and to design products with a commercial market in mind.
"They're becoming businessmen very rapidly," Mr. Brown said.
Kvarz, a company that is part of the Institute of Electronic Measurements, has cracked the market in the United States for devices used to calibrate radio equipment with sales through an American distributor, and hopes to be able to expand its sales to the West. Indeed, said Valery V. Ruchkin, the technical director, the jobs of the company's 5,000 employees may depend on it.
Many of its products, he said, are half as expensive as similar Western goods. "We've had different economies, different standards of living, different salaries up to now, so maybe we can sell things cheaper," Mr. Ruchkin said.
But he said Russian workmanship and design should not be synonymous with inferior workmanship and design.
"Sometimes," Mr. Ruchkin said, displaying a budding capitalist's flair for unsubstantiated comparative marketing, "our standards are better than Hewlett-Packard."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 8.85 Points, to Close at 3,516.63

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
With little encouraging news on the economy, the stock market once again drifted into a tentative trading range yesterday, although most indexes rose modestly.
Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 closed up slightly. Volume on the Big Board was relatively light at 222.8 million shares, though heavier than Monday's 198 million shares. Gold, usually a siphoner of investments from stocks, soared in price but failed to pull up gold stocks, which rose only modestly. 
 The Dow closed up 8.85 points, to 3,516.63, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index closed up 0.63 point, to 247.70. Gaining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered losers 1,127 to 795.
 
Amex Sets Record High

 
 The Standard & Poor's 500, with a greater variety of stocks on several exchanges, was up 0.85 point, to 448.85. The Nasdaq composite index, reflecting smaller-capitalization and high-technology stocks, closed up 0.35 point, to 695.04. The American Stock Exchange market value index closed up 2.38 points, to 434.07, a record.
There seemed to have been little market reaction to the larger-than-expected decline in consumer confidence this month. Both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 dropped early in the session and then rose modestly through the rest of the day.
The Conference Board reported that its index of Americans' confidence in the economy dropped from 67.6 in April to 61.5 in May, the lowest since October. Analysts had expected a rating of about 65. The drop meant that consumer confidence was now at the same level as before President Clinton's election.
 
A.T.& T. Sets Pace

 
 The Dow was mostly lifted by just three stocks: A.T.& T., Alcoa and International Paper, with the latter two each rising 1 3/8 on no discernible news. The S.& P. 500 was lifted by a variety of stocks, led by A.T.& T., which hit a new high yesterday of 62 3/8 before closing at 62, up 1 1/2.
A.T.& T.'s rise followed several corporate developments, the most important of which was a new telecommunications alliance in Asia with Singapore Telecom and Kokusai Denshin Denwa, or KKD, Japan's largest international long-distance carrier.
The other significant corporate development seemed to center on Amax, which announced a merger with Cyprus Minerals for more than $1 billion, to form one of the world's largest mining companies with interests in copper, coal and gold. Amax closed up 4 1/8, to 22 3/4, while Cyprus Minerals closed down 1, to 26 5/8, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gold for June delivery rose sharply, by $4.50 to $378.70 an ounce. But gold stocks reacted only moderately. Newmont Mining rose 5/8, to 51 3/8, on the New York Stock Exchange and Echo Bay Mines rose 1/8, to 11 7/8, on the American Stock Exchange.
Only Dell Computer, reporting unexpectedly poor earnings, and Station Casino, a gambling stock in an initial public offering, provided any action yesterday in a lethargic market. Dell, the most active stock on any exchange with 13.16 million shares changing hands, closed down 7 3/8 points to 24 3/4 in Nasdaq trading, after reporting setbacks in its notebook computer products.
Station Casino, the second most active at 12.49 million shares, closed unchanged at 20 in Nasdaq trading. Boomtown Inc., like Station Casino a gambling stock, rose 3/4, to 29 1/4.

HEADLINE: Plan to Unclog Herald Square To Close Broadway for 2 Blocks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
After years of delays, New York City is now moving forward on an ambitious redesign of Herald Square that will permanently block off part of Broadway, which has stretched virtually uninterrupted from the northern Bronx to the tip of Manhattan since the early 1800's.
While the changes encompass only a small area, they will ripple throughout Manhattan as motorists accustomed to driving through Herald Square will be forced to take other routes. 
 Federal officials are expected to approve financing next week for the plan to unclog the square, the most congested and one of the most dangerous intersections in the city, by markedly enlarging its park space and sidewalks and by shifting the course of Broadway and Avenue of the Americas.
The project will close Broadway from 34th to 32d Streets, removing the venerable thoroughfare's diagonal line from the jumble of streets that converge there, and turning the pattern at the square into the kind of more manageable four-way grid that exists throughout the city where avenues meet streets.
"This is a tremendous leap forward," said Lucius J. Riccio, the city's transportation commissioner. "It is the greatest change since we went to one way on the avenues back in the 1940's and 1950's. We hope that by doing this we will create a little miracle on 34th Street that will attract more people and make the movement of those people work better."
The project, scheduled to be completed by 1995, reflects a growing interest among transportation officials around the world in reducing traffic in downtown areas by cordoning off streets and returning them to pedestrians. But some businesses around Herald Square oppose it, fearing that customers who drive to the neighborhood will be scared away.
Some motorists who frequent the area said they were skeptical that other southbound avenues would be able to handle the traffic that would be routed off Broadway. Even now, Seventh Avenue from Times Square to Madison Square Garden is often hopelessly overcrowded during the day, they said.
The square, named after The New York Herald newspaper, was last redesigned for traffic in the early years of the century, said Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the Transportation Department.
He said that the plan would cost $2.5 million for design and environmental studies, barricades, signs, traffic signals, sidewalks and curbs. That work would be coupled with at least $2 million in renovations to the park space at Herald Square and Greeley Square to the south by the 34th Street Partnership, a private group of neighborhood businesses.
The partnership will resurface the park space, essentially two 2,900-square-foot islands in the middle of the squares, with pink granite. It will build walls to block off the street, plant many more trees and shrubs, install benches and chairs and add food concession stands. Architects are also considering moving the statue of Horace Greeley to a more prominent spot.
After design plans for the traffic project are finished later this year, transportation officials will begin posting signs on Broadway north of 34th Street that will tell motorists that they cannot drive south through Herald Square and should instead use Ninth, Seventh or Fifth Avenues. All vehicles must turn off Broadway at 34th Street.
But buses and taxis will be able to continue south on two lanes that will be carved out of Avenue of the Americas, leaving four other lanes running north. The two lanes will run to 32d Street, where vehicles can turn east to return to Broadway.
 
'Return the Streets'
 The project will create 16,500 more square feet of pedestrian space in Herald Square. Traffic engineers estimate that it will also reduce by 6 percent the number of motor vehicle accidents in the square, to about 1,650 a year.
"We want to return the streets to their rightful owners, the pedestrians," Mr. Riccio said. "I am trying to get the department to redirect its policies toward using the public spaces for pedestrians."
He said the project had been under consideration since the early 1980's, but had been delayed because there was no financing until the Surface Transportation Act was passed by Congress in 1991.
Daniel A. Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership, said he supported the move to block off part of Broadway, on which traffic averages 5.1 miles per hour on weekdays. But he emphasized that some merchants in the neighborhood were wary of the plan, particularly Macy's, whose Herald Square department store is one of the world's largest.
"I think Broadway is responsible for most traffic problems we have in midtown," he said. "However, the people in my district also have other concerns. They are very fragile entities. We have got to treat these people with the utmost care. They are a great economic engine in the city."
Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for Macy's, declined to comment on the project.
 
Merchants and Cabbies
 Eytan Schwartz, 34, manager of Herald Parc Jewelers at 1313 Broadway on the square, assailed the project, saying that it was another example of the city's making policy without considering the effect on small businesses.
"Traffic is one of the reasons that we have any kind of business here," he said. "Any time the city blocks off some portion of Broadway for a parade, it ruins business for everyone in the area. It seems that the city is trying to look for as many reasons as possible to ruin business in midtown."
Some motorists were also critical. Jacques Sanon, a taxi driver, said the shift off Broadway would only worsen traffic on surrounding streets. "You've got Penn Station with a lot of people trying to get in and of there," he said. "I don't see how this will help. I can only see how it can hurt."
But city officials and some private traffic experts insisted that there was enough resilience in the Manhattan traffic grid. Herbert S. Levinson, a transportation consultant who has worked extensively in New York City, argued that the pessimism of the area's businesses was misguided.
"How many of their customers are actually driving down the street, as opposed to taking the subway or walking?" he asked. "The typical merchant's perception is that everyone must drive to a shop. My opinion is that most people come into the area by public transportation."
"My sense that is that it will work," he said. "It might not work the first day, but after a while, people will get acclimated to it."

Dollar Falls to New Low Against Japanese Yen

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The dollar fell to another record low against the Japanese yen today after the Treasury released a report on exchange rates that suggested the yen's rise could reduce the American trade deficit with Japan.
But at the same time, a senior Treasury official said that devaluing the dollar was not the route to increased American prosperity. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 109.35 yen, down sharply from 110.60 yen on Monday. The dollar's previous closing low in New York was 109.86 yen on April 22.
Also putting pressure on the dollar was a report today showing a decline in consumer confidence, which pointed to continued slow growth and less chance that the Federal Reserve would push up interest rates.
 
Treasury's Report
 The official, Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, steered clear of saying whether the yen should appreciate further, though he said the yen's rise should help reduce the Japanese trade surplus.
Appearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee today, Mr. Summers released the exchange-rate report, which said, "A decline versus the yen can be seen as a reflection of forces tending to limit and ultimately reverse Japan's widening trade surplus."
Some traders said that by suggesting a strong yen could help reduce Japan's trade surplus, the report appeared to be a veiled effort to push the yen higher. But Mr. Summers denied that.
Echoing recent statements made by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Mr. Summers said, "It is our firm conviction that there is no way to devalue yourself into prosperity."
Most economists say that devaluing a country's currency against those of other nations can give a short-term stimulus by increasing exports, but it makes foreign goods and foreign travel more expensive.
Mr. Summers told the banking subcommittee that Japan's economy was operating well below capacity and that its trade surplus continued to rise because of weak demand for imports.
Mr. Summer said Japan's $116 billion stimulus program should be expanded so that Japanese economic growth is fueled by domestic consumption rather than by exports.
The Treasury report also faulted China for manipulating its currency in a way that helped cause the Chinese trade surplus with the United States to swell to $18.3 billion last year from $12.7 billion in 1991.
"China's trade surplus with the United States is a very serious matter that must be addressed by Chinese action now," Mr. Summers said, noting that the Administration urged Beijing last month to remove its foreign exchange controls.

Dollar Falls Further
 TOKYO, Wednesday, May 26 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The dollar continued to hit new lows against the Japanese yen today, falling below 109 yen.
By late morning in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 108.80 yen, down sharply from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 110.56 yen. Currency traders said that the Bank of Japan tried without success to support the dollar when it approached 109 yen this morning.

Treasuries Volatile, Yet Change Little

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in a day of volatile trading. Instead of getting a lift from a good two-year note auction, the benchmark 30-year bond seemed to have been pulled lower by the sale.
The 30-year bond's yield closed unchanged at 7.00 percent, with the price inching up 1/32 . 
 Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, N.J., said the last few days seem to have been dominated by what are known as curve trades. These rest on the expectation that the spread, or difference, between the yields on short-term notes and long-term bonds will change.
Since the release in mid-May of surprisingly high inflation figures for April, there has been speculation that the Federal Reserve might have to raise short-term interest rates to curb rising prices. Because such a move would push up short-term rates, narrowing the spread between these and the rates on bonds, many financial professionals have been dealing in curve-flattening trades.
In this sort of dealing, the investor sells short-term notes and buys longer-term bonds because the bonds' prices are expected to do better.
 
Agile Footwork
 Mr. McCarthy said that speculators and traders had been selling the two-year notes in the when-issued or pre-auction market and buying bonds. Since the auction was announced last week, the spread between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond had narrowed -- on Monday to 282 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point -- down from 299 basis points.
But yesterday, Mr. McCarthy said, some investors decided to take part of their profits and also to cover short positions on two-year notes by buying them in the auction. This provided strong demand, with the yield 4.17 percent in the single-price auction. The coupon on the new two-year note is 4.125 percent. In the when-issued market, the yield on the new two-year note rose to 4.20 percent in late trading.
Combined with this buying, there was selling of 30-year bonds, which in part accounted for the drop in price after the auction results were reported early in the afternoon.
Trading was volatile all day. An early rise in the price of the 30-year bond that pushed the yield down to 6.97 percent was quickly wiped out about 10 A.M., traders said, after it appeared that a Treasury report on foreign-currency exchange favored a weaker dollar against the Japanese yen as a way to cut Japan's rising trade surplus with the United States.
The dollar reached a record low against the yen in the wake of the Treasury report. Comments in February by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that appeared to favor a weaker dollar started a slide that has sent the dollar lower and lower against the Japanese currency.
Yesterday, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, Lawrence Summers, told a Senate Banking subcommittee, where the report was released, that devaluing the dollar was not a way to promote prosperity in the United States.
 
Fewer Municipals?
 The prices of municipal bonds closed little changed yesterday, and there were some indications that the $6 billion in new issues expected this week may be reduced because of the volatility in the Treasury market.
One indication that some issuers are holding back came from the New York State Dormitory Authority, which is delaying the sale of about $700 million of refinancing bonds for the City University of New York.
In the largest tax-exempt issue of the day, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation sold $550 million in bonds in a negotiated deal led by Dillon, Read & Company. It was the first major bond sale by the Health and Hospitals Corporation since it gained the right to sell its own bonds last fall.
Mark C. Fasteau, a managing director at Dillon, Read, said there was good demand for the issue, especially for the bonds maturing in 2020, which are not insured. After repricing in the afternoon, the yield on these bonds was lowered to 6.36 percent from the initial yield of 6.42 percent. Mr. Fasteau said the yields on several other maturities were lowered by about 5 basis points. Other yields ranged from 4.55 percent on the five-year bond, 5.30 percent on the 10-year bond and 5.68 percent on the 20-year bond. All three are insured.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: The Bombing: Retracing the Steps -- A special report;
Fitting the Pieces of Terrorism -- Accounts Reconstruct Planning of Trade Center Explosion

 BODY:
The following article is based on reporting by Ralph Blumenthal, Robert Hanley, Alison Mitchell, Joseph B. Treaster and Mary B. W. Tabor and was written by Mr. Blumenthal.
At 4 A.M., in the early-morning chill of Feb. 26, a yellow Ryder rental van pulled into an all-night gas station on Kennedy Boulevard in Jersey City, tailed by a blue Honda sedan. 
 After fueling up -- $18 worth of gas for the van, about $13 for the car -- one of the passengers walked to a pay phone to make a call. Minutes later, they were joined by a man in a red car. The van driver paid for the gas with a $50 bill, giving the attendant a $2 tip. Then the motorcade drove off.
Something about the entourage stuck in the minds of several onlookers. But it was not until days later that they realized the van was the vehicle that investigators say carried the 1,200-pound bomb that exploded in the World Trade Center garage eight hours later, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000.
Now, three months after the bombing, that gas station rendezvous on a neon-lit urban strip has become a crucial tableau in the Federal conspiracy case. In the account of witnesses, it places several suspects together the very morning of the explosion, which law enforcement officials later called the most devastating terrorist assault on American soil. And it firmly ties those suspects to the van that one of the men later contended had already been stolen from him.
Indeed, with six suspects charged in the explosion and a seventh being held on lesser related charges, the account of what occurred at the gas station is considered so crucial that some witnesses have been hidden and placed under Federal protection. The suspects all maintain their innocence, and their supporters say they have been scapegoated because they are Arabs.
 
Inside but Not Invisible
 While the broad outlines of how investigators believe the bombing was carried out have already been reported, months of interviews with witnesses, investigators and associates of the suspects have produced a detailed account of the events leading up to the explosion -- beginning with the moment last September when investigators say Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, traveling on an Iraqi passport and using many aliases, arrived in New York and helped put the plot in high gear.
It is a tale that highlights the startling ease with which undocumented immigrants are able to enter New York, a story of how a small number of Arab immigrants used a string of false names and even false nationalities to elude identification, and yet drastically underestimated how memorable they would be to neighbors and onlookers.
Several mysteries of the bombing may have been deciphered. Investigators now say the absence of a warning call beforehand is recommended as a tactic to heighten the shock of terrorism in literature seized from one suspect. And the F.B.I. says it now believes that two brothers who gave crucial information about the bombing may have fled to Iraq.
But it is still not clear what blend of Palestinian grievance, Islamic militance or anti-Americanism may have finally motivated the attack on the 110-story twin towers, which dominate lower Manhattan and shine as a symbol of Western wealth and power.
And while investigators are tantalized by a possible Iraqi connection and have also found that tens of thousands of dollars were wired to some of the suspects from Iran, it is not known if the plot was directed from overseas. Indeed, investigators are still searching for Mr. Yousef and at least one other unidentified suspect.
Investigators say they have traced the first stirrings of the plot back to July, and say it accelerated rapidly when two men arrived in New York last September.
Arrivals
A Militant Circle
Grows and Moves
On any day at Kennedy International Airport, immigration officials corral 30 to 40 travelers carrying counterfeit travel documents or none at all, and making a desperate bid to get into America. Sept. 1, 1992 was no exception and on this late summer day, two of the day's offenders came in on Pakistan International Airlines flight 703 from Karachi. It was the moment, investigators now say, that put the bombing conspiracy in high gear.
Mohammad A. Ajaj, a 27-year-old Palestinian who would later be charged in the bombing conspiracy, immediately caught the attention of the authorities by using a crudely doctored Swedish passport in the name of Khurram Khan.
On closer examination, Mr. Ajaj had scarcely any clothes in his suitcases. But according to court documents, he did have a wide array of manuals on the use of knives, grenades, poisons and concealed weapons and the making of Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs and other explosives, including improvised bombs like the one that rocked the Trade Center. He was also carrying videotapes of suicide car bombings, guides to planting land mines and directions on how to forge documents.
Mr. Ajaj was taken into custody at the airport, pleaded guilty to using a false passport and served a six-month prison sentence. After a brief release, he was picked up again by immigration officials and has been indicted in the bombing conspiracy.
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was on the same flight, gave immigration authorities his own Iraqi passport, minus a valid visa, and he claimed political asylum, which entitled him to a series of hearings. The 100-person Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center was full, as usual, so Mr. Yousef was let go.
The tall 25-year-old vanished into the airport crowd. He surfaced shortly afterward among circles of Arab immigrants in New Jersey, where investigators say he became a catalyst for the plot.
 
Nosair Defense in Common
 Some of his associates had already coalesced as fund-raisers and protesters in the defense of El Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant who had been accused of assassinating Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Jewish militant, in 1990. Mr. Nosair was acquitted of murder but convicted on lesser charges.
As Mr. Yousef arrived last September the F.B.I. was already monitoring the group, and about 20 of them had been summoned by a grand jury looking into a Federal conspiracy case involving Mr. Nosair. Materials seized in 1990 from Mr. Nosair's files, investigators now say, shed light on the group that would later be charged in the Trade Center bombing. The imprisoned Mr. Nosair, through his family and lawyers, has denied any connection to the blast.
In Jersey City, Mr. Yousef quickly started rooming with Mohammed A. Salameh, a Palestinian who had long overstayed his tourist visa and was drifting from job to job.
Acquaintances said Mr. Salameh put his passion into political causes like supporting the Afghan rebels and the defense of Mr. Nosair. He visited Mr. Nosair in Attica prison and received calls from him, officials say.
On July 23, several weeks before Mr. Yousef's arrival, Mr. Salameh made the first of four failed attempts to get a New Jersey driver's license. He finally switched his efforts to New York and received a license on Sept. 8, using as his address the Brooklyn apartment of Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny, Mr. Nosair's cousin.
 
Moving Every Few Months
 While the false Brooklyn address gave Mr. Salameh the semblance of permanency, he and Mr. Yousef began a pattern of moving every few months, using fabricated names and nationalities. Their quarters were meager apartments with little more than single mattresses. It is not even clear whether his own close associates knew Mr. Yousef's real name. Several said they knew him only as Rashid, and Federal wanted posters now list 11 aliases for him.
The men's hub was Jersey City, near the Al-Salam mosque, a third-floor religious center above a check cashing office and a Chinese restaurant. Middle Eastern immigrants congregated at the mosque, sometimes to witness the incendiary preachings of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a self-exiled Egyptian who advocates the overthrow of Egypt's secular Government.
Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef were friends with two other young men who would also be tied to the bombing. One was Nidal A. Ayyad, a 25-year-old chemical engineer and naturalized citizen with Palestinian roots whom Mr. Salameh had met at a Passaic mosque a year before. The other was Bilal Alkaisi, a 27-year-old teacher at a Brooklyn mosque and a taxi driver, who was taught the cab business by another Egyptian who would emerge as a suspect, Mahmud Abouhalima.
Mr. Abouhalima, 33, was an occasional driver of the sheik. Leaflets distributed in Arab communities also show that he had been named the local leader of Egypt's militant Islamic Group. He had also worked in a Brooklyn storefront that sent money and Islamic recruits to help fight the Soviet-backed Government in Afghanistan. Mr. Abouhalima, acquaintances say, even went to fight himself; his brother denies it.
 
Sharing Bank Accounts
 Some of the men, meanwhile, established interlocking financial ties. Mr. Ayyad and Mr. Salameh shared at least one bank account. Fingerprints later found inside a Newark safe-deposit box showed that Mr. Salameh and Mr. Alkaisi had access to it, according to an F.B.I. report. And investigators have found that close to $100,000 had been wired to several bank accounts linked to the suspects, some of the money from Iran.
It was in November that Mr. Salameh took a step that law enforcement officials later called a crucial milestone in the construction of the bomb.
On Nov. 30, according to a Federal complaint, Mr. Salameh appeared at A Space Station, a storage warehouse in Jersey City, using the name Kamal Ibraham. Attendants said he told them that he and some friends were starting a company and needed to rent a locker. On the contract, he scribbled the names of six associates who would use the 10-feet-square corrugated tin locker.
After the bombing, according to F.B.I. reports, agents found in the locker a virtual chemical factory: bottles of nitric acid, the propellant sodium azide and a poison, sodium cyanide; barrels and containers of sulfuric acid and urea. There was shotgun powder along with bottles, beakers, buckets, funnels, tubing and a fuse.
On New Year's Day, Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef moved yet again, to an apartment at 40 Pamrapo Avenue in Jersey City that Federal agents said became the bomb's testing ground. Mr. Salameh said he was a Turk named Alaa Mahrous, according to the landlord. He paid $1,100 in cash, which included a month's rent and a security deposit, and said he needed the apartment about a year.
Later, investigators found a corrosive powder-blue substance splashed over the walls and ceiling of the back bedroom.
On Jan. 24, while driving with Mr. Yousef at 2 A.M., Mr. Salameh crashed his car outside the Avenel, N.J., garden apartment complex of Mr. Abouhalima.
Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef were taken by ambulance to Rahway Hospital. Ambulance attendants recalled that neither man seemed seriously hurt. Mr. Salameh was released, but Mr. Yousef was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Jan. 29 -- gaining a postponement of his immigration hearing.
Preparations
Licenses, Vans
And Chemicals
By early February, the pace of events quickened.
Mr. Salameh prepared another move, telling his Pamrapo Avenue landlord that he and his roommate had found new jobs in Brooklyn and would be out by the end of the month.
On Feb. 15, Mr. Ayyad rented a red Oldsmobile sedan from the National Car Rental Company in Newark, listing the name "Salameh" as an additional driver. One week later, on the afternoon of Feb. 23, Mr. Salameh and another man later identified in a Federal criminal complaint as Mr. Ayyad appeared in the red car at a Ryder truck rental office on Kennedy Boulevard in Jersey City. Mr. Ayyad, through his lawyer, has said that he was not at the rental agency.
The two men looked at various trucks, recalled Patrick J. Galasso, the operator of the Ryder agency, and settled on an Econoline van for $220 a week or $59 a day, with 100 free miles and then 25 cents a mile. Mr. Salameh, who did not have a credit card, deposited four $100 bills.
Two days before the bombing, Mr. Salameh was still being taught how to drive the van, according to court papers citing an F.B.I. "confidential informant" who did the teaching. Federal authorities say they are now searching for the informer and his brother. They say the two men are missing and may be in Iraq. One of the two, according to an investigator, is Musab Yasin, an Iraqi who taught engineering and briefly shared an apartment with Mr. Salameh.
On Thursday, Feb. 25, the day before the bombing, Mr. Salameh made another trip to the storage locker, this time with another, unidentified companion who said he was from Israel, witnesses later reported. The F.B.I. is now searching for him. The two men described themselves as business partners who were waiting for a shipment to come for their company.
 
Yellow Van and Hydrogen Tanks
 As the two men waited, a delivery of tanks of compressed hydrogen arrived for them from the AGL Welding Supply Company of Clifton, N.J. The attendant, citing rules against flammable substances, barred the delivery. At that, witnesses said, Mr. Salameh and his companion broke into rapid Arabic and asked to use the pay phone. The calls, investigators later determined, went to the desk of Mr. Ayyad at Allied-Signal Inc., in Morristown, N.J.
The men then asked to keep the tanks until they could be picked up. Minutes later, investigators have been told, a yellow Ryder van showed up and drove away with the tanks.
It was about 4 the next morning, on Feb. 26, that witnesses saw the yellow Ryder van appear at the gas station, followed closely by the blue Honda. Investigators say it was the last time the van was seen in one piece before its deadly mission.
The gas station had been robbed before, and one witness started watching closely. He saw two men in the van and three in the Honda. As he tried to peer into the van, the two men got out, the driver seeming to plant himself directly in front of a window, blocking the view.
The passenger then walked to a pay phone and made a call. A few minutes later a red car joined the others.
 
Suspects Identified in Van
 Shown F.B.I. photographs, witnesses later identified the driver of the van as Mr. Salameh and his passenger as Mr. Abouhalima. In an interview earlier this month from the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Mr. Abouhalima denied being at the gas station that morning.
Just over eight hours later, at 12:18 P.M., a huge explosion rocked a parking garage under the New York Vista Hotel in the Trade Center complex, knocking out power, sending tens of thousands of workers fleeing down smoke-darkened stairwells, and crippling lower Manhattan.
Four days after the bombing, a letter was received by The New York Times claiming responsibility in the name of the Liberation Army Fifth Battalion, and attributing the action to deep resentment of United States policy in the Middle East. The letter, investigators said, was tied to Mr. Ayyad through texts found on computer disks seized from his home.
The letter did not explain why the Trade Center was the target, but investigators now theorize it was selected both for its symbolism and for its easy accessibility.
Capture
A Lot of Trouble
For a $200 Refund
If the suspects had immediately fled to Kennedy Airport and out of the country, they might never have been found. In fact, Mr. Yousef did manage to disappear.
But less than two hours after the explosion, Mr. Salameh reappeared at the Ryder office, claiming his van had been stolen the night before from the parking lot of a Shop Rite supermarket, Mr. Galasso said. "He wanted to know what he should do about it," the Ryder agent recalled. "I told him if it was stolen last night, why was he not here last night? He said he was totally confused and didn't know what to do." Mr. Galasso told him to get a police report.
On Sunday, Feb. 28, Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef moved out of their apartment about midnight. In Manhattan, bomb specialists had already scored a crucial breakthrough, finding in the Trade Center wreckage that day a piece of twisted chassis with a vehicle identification number traceable to the Ryder company.
On Monday, Mr. Salameh was back at the Ryder office, saying it would take him three or four days to get the police report. In the meantime, he wanted his deposit back. "I said no, you have to show the truck was stolen," Mr. Galasso replied. "He got a little upset."
By Wednesday, March 3, the F.B.I. and Ryder had traced the van to Mr. Galasso's business. Visited by F.B.I. agents, he retrieved Mr. Salameh's rental contract.
It suddenly dawned on Mr. Galasso. "Don't tell me my van blew up the World Trade Center?"
The address on the rental contract, 17 Park Place, turned out to be the address of the Islamic Center in Jersey City.
 
Large Hidden Audience
 The next day, the F.B.I. returned with a video camera in a gym bag and an agent wired with a hidden recorder. They handed Mr. Galasso a sheet of paper drafted by prosecutors with questions for Mr. Salameh to fill out.
About 9:30 A.M., in a gloomy drizzle, Mr. Salameh entered the office. With agents posing as Ryder employees, he retold the story of the theft before the hidden camera and recorder. One agent, on the phone, relayed a running account to superiors, interspersing, "Did you hear that? Did you get that?"
The refund after Mr. Salameh's use of the truck -- with $17 a day insurance -- came to $154. But the F.B.I. agents had no change, only $200. They said they were awarding him $50 for some furniture he claimed to have lost and offered him $200 back.
Then, said Mr. Galasso, Mr. Salameh asked, "Could you give me my gas money back?"
They gave him $200 and Mr. Salameh, still protesting over the money, filled out the paperwork and left.
For a moment, Mr. Galasso recalled, Mr. Salameh stood outside on the porch, looking out, his hands folded calmly. Beyond, a small army of F.B.I agents lay concealed in cars, stores and doorways. Mr. Salameh walked out of the car lot toward a bus stop. Suddenly agents seemed to pounce from every direction. They tackled Mr. Salameh and wrestled him into a waiting car that sped off.

Chart: Crime: The Suspects So Far In The World Trade Center Bombing
 
Mohammad Ahmad Ajaj (MO-hah-mahd AH-mahd ah-ZHAZH), 27, a Palestinian born in Jerusalem.
Arrested Sept. 1 after he tried to enter Kennedy Airport with a forged passport and a suitcase of bombing manuals, on same flight as Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. Charged in the World Trade Center bombing, though he was in Federal prison serving a six-month sentence for passport violations at the time. Considered by Israel to be a "minor follower" of the Palestine Liberation Organization; he says he was tortured in Israel.
 
 Mahmud Abouhalima (MAH-mood ah-bah-hoo-LEE-mah), 33, Egyptian-born cab driver.
Arrested March 10 in Egypt, interrogated and returned to United States for prosecution; investigators say he is a "key figure" in the bombing. Says he was tortured during interrogation by Egyptian officials. Immigrated from Egypt to Germany in 1985, then to New York where he obtained residency as a farm worker. Was a part-time driver for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, served as the local emir of the fundamentalist group Gama'a al- Islamiya, and raised money for Afghan rebels until 1991; said he split with Sheik Rahman in disagreement. Moved last year to Avenel, N.J., with his German-born wife and four children. Says he knows the other bombing suspects, but denies any involvement in the attack.
 
 Bilall Alkaisi (bih-LALL alk-EYE-see), 27, a Brooklyn salesman and mosque teacher of Palestinian descent.
Turned himself in to F.B.I. agents on March 24. Shared an apartment, a bank account and a Newark safe deposit box with Mohammed A. Salameh. Name appeared on a credit card found in the possession of Nidal A. Ayyad.
 
 Nidal A. Ayyad (nih-DAHL ah-YAHD), 25, chemical engineer and Rutgers University graduate, naturalized American citizen born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents.
Investigators say calls made from a Jersey City storage locker, where they believe the bomb was made, were traced to his desk at Allied-Signal Inc. in Morristown, N.J. They also say a letter to The New York Times claiming credit for the bombing has been traced to his personal computer and printer. Went with Mr. Salameh to rent the yellow Ryder van believed to have carried the bomb into the Trade Center garage. His business card was found on Mr. Salameh when Mr. Salameh was arrested. Lived with his wife, mother and brother in Maplewood, N.J.
 
 Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny (EE-bra-him el-ZHAH-brah-nee), 24, Egyptian-born civil engineer.
Charged with hindering the search of his apartment in connection with bombing investigation and carrying forged passports, including one for his relative, El Sayyid A. Nosair. Mr. Nosair was acquitted in the 1990 murder of radical Rabbi Meri Kahane, but imprisoned on a related conviction. Lives at the Brooklyn address listed on Mr. Salameh's drivers license. Investigators say that they found traces of chemicals, like those used in the bomb, on his clothes. His lawyers insist the chemicals are found in his work. Held without bail, though never formally linked to the bombing.
 
 Mohammed A. Salameh, (sah-LEM-mah), 25, a Jordanian construction worker of Palestinian descent.
The first suspect arrested. Entered the United States in 1988 on a tourist visa and stayed after it expired. Shared apartments with Mr. Alkaisi and Mr. Yousef and bank accounts with Mr. Alkaisi and Mr. Ayyad. Rented the Jersey City storage locker where investigators say the bomb was made and the van they say carried the bomb into the Trade Center garage. Mr. Salameh says that the locker was for a business venture and that the van was stolen from him. Attended Jersey City mosque where Sheik Abdel Rahman preached.
 
 Ramzi Ahmed Yousef (RAM-zee AH-med YOO-sef), 25.
Known to friends as Rashid. Worked as a taxi driver and shared Jersey City apartments with Mr. Salameh and Mr. Alkaisi. Arrived in the United States on Sept. 1, on the same flight as Mr. Ajaj. Carried an Iraqi passport and an array of forged documents. His fingerprints were found inside Mr. Ajaj's bombing manuals. Court papers say Mr. Yousef was seen driving with Mr. Salameh in the yellow Ryder rental van used in the bombing. Worshipped at Mr. Abdel Rahman's mosque. Disappeared days after the bombing.

HEADLINE: Boys Predominate in a Contest, Fueling Complaint of Test Bias

 BODY:
Three out of five semifinalists for the National Merit Scholarships this year were boys, an advocacy group reports today, even though well over half of the high school seniors taking the qualifying test were girls.
The group, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing in Cambridge, Mass., says it has been compiling lists of semifinalists for seven years and has found little change in the ratio of boys to girls among semifinalists, despite a growing chorus of complaints that standardized tests are biased against girls. 
 Though no one has analyzed the list of scholarship winners, the National Merit Corporation, the private group that organizes the scholarships, says the sexual breakdown is usually similar to that of the semifinalists.
This year's analysis found that of the 15,850 semifinalists, 61 percent are boys and 35 percent are girls. (The sex of the remaining 4 percent cannot be determined from their names.) Boys outnumber girls in every state.
 
Arguments Over Test
 The National Merit semifinalists are chosen from their scores on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, which critics have long accused of being biased against girls. Although girls get higher grades on average than boys in both high school and college, they score 50 to 60 points lower on the P.S.A.T.
"The P.S.A.T. is not an appropriate indicator of how a student has done in high school or how a student will do in college," said Cinthia Schuman, executive director of the advocacy group. "It should not be part of the selection process for the National Merit Scholarships."
A spokeswoman for the National Merit Corporation said the organization had found no better way to screen high school students than the P.S.A.T., which is given to almost two million students a year.
"We are not convinced that the test is biased," said Elaine Detweiler, public information for the corporation. "It could be showing a disparity in academic preparation. If girls are getting better grades in home economics or things like that, they're not better prepared."
About 15,000 students nationwide are chosen as semifinalists for the prestigious scholarships, which can be either a onetime payment of $2,000 or a multiyear stipend of up to $2,000 a year. Those students then submit a full portfolio, including their S.A.T. scores, high school records, extracurricular records, a personal essay and recommendations, Ms. Detweiler said. Ninety percent are then chosen as finalists, and about 6,500 of those receive scholarships each year.

New School Honors the Premier of a German State

 BODY:
The New School For Social Research conferred degrees yesterday on graduates from the Eugene Lang College, the New School, the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science and the Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy.
The commencements for two other divisions of the school, the Parsons School of Design and the Mannes College of Music, were held earlier this month. 
 Kurt Hans Biedenkopf, the premier of the state of Saxony in Germany, gave the address for the school's 57th commencement, at Riverside Church in Manhattan, and received an honorary doctorate of laws.
A total of 163 bachelor's degrees, 279 master's degrees and 21 doctorates were conferred by the school.
Among the others honored at the ceremony were Gwendolyn Brooks, who in 1950 became the first black person to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, and Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a feminist literary scholar who retired early from a tenured position in Columbia University's English department last year, protesting what she said was bias against women.

CUNY
The Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York awarded 318 doctoral degrees and 44 master's degrees at its 29th annual commencement yesterday.
The main address was delivered by Felice N. Schwartz, founder and president of Catalyst, a national nonprofit organization that works to help women in business and professional life.
Among those receiving honorary degrees were Ms. Schwartz and the writer Ralph Ellison.

 Stevens Institute
Harold J. Raveche, president of Stevens Institute of Technology, conferred 850 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees at the university's 121st commencement exercises yesterday at the John A. Davis Memorial Athletic Field on the campus in Hoboken, N.J.
In a short speech Mr. Raveche challenged the Clinton Administration to establish a strategic economic and technology policy to bolster manufacturing jobs for the United States.
Honorary doctor of engineering degrees were awarded to Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta Corporation, and Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive of the Bell Atlantic Corporation.

Cooper Union
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, delivered the main address yesterday at Cooper Union's 134th commencement exercises. Ms. Messinger addressed 210 undergraduates and 23 graduates in the college's Great Hall.
She urged the students to "continue the great unfinished, perhaps never ending, task of realizing the democratic dream on which this school and this city were founded."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Rebound On Brisk Buying by Funds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Metals prices rebounded yesterday as commodity funds bought gold and silver futures aggressively, betting prices would go higher.
Platinum prices rose amid concern about violence in South Africa, the world's largest producer of the metal, analysts said. 
 Gold for delivery in June rose $4.50, to $378.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange after falling $3.70 on Monday. July silver rose 9.3 cents, to $4.643 an ounce, after falling 13.4 cents on Monday.
"The funds were good buyers of metal today," said George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Commodity funds invest billions worth of investors' money in commodities markets, often basing their decisions on a technical analysis of price movements.
"Chinese demand for gold still looks strong as well," Mr. Milling-Stanley said. China became the world's largest consumer of gold in 1992 as the country's economy surged. The Chinese are using new-found wealth to buy gold jewelry, a traditional hedge against inflation in the country.
Platinum for delivery in July rose $4.90, to 390.90 an ounce, on the Mercantile Exchange in New York. December palladium rose 25 cents, to $118.25 cents an ounce.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Confidence Is Waning

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's economic program isn't playing any better on Main Street than the President's $200 haircut, according to the latest consumer confidence poll.
Virtually all the post-election surge in optimism about the new Administration's ability to turn the economy around quickly has evaporated, the Conference Board survey for May showed. 
 Confidence in May plunged to the lowest level since October, the private research group said yesterday. And job worries are intensifying again despite few reports of major new layoffs and Labor Department data suggesting that job growth has picked up modestly in the last six months.
 
Index Drops to 61.5
 Only 13 percent of consumers think jobs will become more abundant six months from now, compared with 21.5 percent in January, the survey showed. The May percentage is the lowest reading in more than a year.
The Conference Board's overall consumer confidence index tumbled to 61.5 in May from 67.6 in April. The measure fell in every part of the country except the Southeast and more than reversed a 4-point gain last month.
"The consumer voted for change, no tax increases for the middle class, health-care reform," Allen I. Questrom, chairman of Federated Department Stores Inc., said in a recent interview. "What she sees now are all kinds of trial balloons: taxes not just for the wealthy, a B.T.U. tax, a V.A.T."
Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said, "The economy is just not getting off the ground."
What was striking about the survey results -- which confirmed equally downbeat surveys by the University of Michigan and ABC/Money magazine -- was that expectations for the future have now turned as gloomy as they were before the election. The Conference Board's expectations index plunged from 81.1 in April to 72.2 in May, a drop of nearly a third since December.
 
Losing Faith on Growth
 By contrast, perceptions of current economic conditions remain decidedly more sanguine than they were seven or eight months ago. The current conditions index, at 45.4 in May, was down only marginally from 47.2 in April and is still half again as high as last October.
The contrast between feelings about the future and the here and now suggests that while consumers can detect signs of slow expansion, they have all but lost faith that the President can do much to speed up job growth, one of the main sources of consumers' anxiety.
"Pessimists substantially outnumber optimists on this issue," Mr. Linden said. "Consumer confidence continues at levels that are historically associated with a weak economy."
The sharp deterioration in consumers' mood during the first four months of the Clinton Administration compares with growing faith in Reaganomics during Ronald Reagan's first spring in office -- even taking into account the surge in public sympathy after Mr. Reagan was shot.
Unless something happens to turn pessimism into panic, economists said, the gloom does not seem likely to bring about an outright drop in consumer spending. Consumers' mood is not the only thing that affects buying. Income is growing modestly, low mortgage rates are reviving home buying and car sales strengthened in mid-May.
 
Retail Sales Rise
 A survey by Johnson Redbook, issued yesterday, showed retail sales in the first three weeks in May 7 percent higher than a year ago and 9 percent higher than the corresponding period in April. But Ed Johnson, who conducts the weekly survey of 25 or so national retail chains, said, "It's not as weak as it looks because Memorial Day fell a week earlier last year."
In another sign that spending may be holding up better than spirits, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing homes rose a solid 2.7 percent in April, to an annual rate of 3.46 million. That was the first gain this year.

Low Interest Rates Help U.S. Vehicle Sales

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 25

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 18.4 percent in mid-May as consumers put aside fears of economic weakness and responded to low interest rates on financing, the auto makers said today.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.4 million for the period of May 11-20, up from 6.4 million in early May and up from 6.7 million for the same period a year earlier. 
 Sales of cars built in North American assembly plants reached 224,957, up 14.9 percent from a year earlier. Sales of light trucks, which include sport utilities, pickups and mini-vans, reached 170,641, up 23.4 percent. Total vehicle sales were 395,598, compared with 334,066 last year.
 
 
Two-Year Delay for Buyers
 "The recession delayed consumers' replacement plans by two years," said John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. "So low interest rates are irresistibly attractive."
Sean Cardeau, who sells Toyotas, Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles in Baton Rouge, La., said, "People are buying because of the low 6.5 percent financing rates." He also said Chevrolets were outselling foreign models because many buyers felt they should buy American.
The General Motors Corporation sold 101,606 domestically built cars, up 7.7 percent from a year earlier. All G.M. sales divisions except Oldsmobile showed an increase compared with last year. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 14.2 percent, to 59,140.

 The Ford Motor Company sold 57,306 cars, up 6 percent from a year earlier. Ford's light-truck sales rose 28.1 percent, to 58,579. It was only the third time that Ford had sold more light trucks than cars during a 10-day sales period, reflecting the growing popularity of light trucks.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that the Chrysler Corporation sold 25,900 cars, up 50.8 percent compared with last year. Ward's estimated light-truck sales of 42,100, up 22.8 percent. Chrysler reports sales only once a month.
The Honda Motor Company posted a 1.4 percent decline in sales of domestically built cars, to 12,554.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 14,109 cars, up 42.6 percent. Toyota's light-truck sales were 3,448, more than double the total from a year earlier.
The Nissan Motor Corporation sold 6,839 cars, more than double the total of a year earlier. Light-truck sales were 4,624, up 43.6 percent from last year.

Lenin's Tomb
The Last Days of the Soviet Empire
By David Remnick
Illustrated. 576 pages. Random House. $25. 
 It is winter 1991 in the Soviet Union. The spirit of the Moscow Spring of 1988 is gone. Mikhail S. Gorbachev is still leading the country, but the generals, the military-industrial complex, the Communist Party apparatus and the K.G.B. are demanding that he turn away from his reform-minded advisers, and he does so. Something is in the air. In the land of revolution, the modern counterrevolution that introduced perestroika and glasnost is about to eat its own children.
During a session of the Congress of People's Deputies that winter, David Remnick, a correspondent for The Washington Post, encounters Gorbachev on a stairway and blurts out, "Mikhail Sergeyevich, they say you are moving to the right." Gorbachev, his mouth clenched in "a pained, ironic grin," tells the reporter that the truth is he feels "as if I am going around in circles."
In "Lenin's Tomb," Mr. Remnick, now a staff writer for The New Yorker, has a great story to tell and he tells it brilliantly. During the four crucial years of counterrevolution, attempted coup and transition that led to the ascendancy of Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Remnick was present at the creation of the new Russia. The title of his book is metaphorical; it doesn't really cover the dictatorial reigns of Lenin and Stalin. Rather, it's about the disenchantment of many Russians with the theories and practices underlying Soviet Communism. Actually the subtitle, "The Last Days of the Soviet Empire," tells more about the book's contents.
The "riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma," as Winston Churchill described Russia in 1939, continues to be puzzling in 1993. But Mr. Remnick's book goes a long way toward answering the tantalizing question of why Americans and Europeans were once so enamored of Mr. Gorbachev and then, suddenly and surprisingly, discovered that he wasn't a man for all seasons in an unshackled Soviet Union. Mr. Remnick describes the Soviet breakup through the eyes of dissidents as well as of Stalinist stalwarts, and then supplies his own interpretations.
In a few straightforward lines that sum up the theme of "Lenin's Tomb," Mr. Remnick writes: "Once the regime eased up enough to permit a full-scale examination of the Soviet past, radical change was inevitable. Once the System showed itself for what it was and had been, it was doomed."
During the near-fictional high noon in the summer of 1991 for the two leading personalities in the book, Mr. Gorbachev was first restored by his rival, Mr. Yeltsin, and then discarded into the dustbin of history. How could this happen to the highly intelligent yet implacable leader of the counterrevolution? The answer that appears to emerge from Mr. Remnick's well-sourced book is that Mr. Gorbachev wanted to recreate Communism with a human face, a contradiction in terms that, given the record of seven decades of rigid state planning, could not work.
"In its way, Gorbachev's schematic view of the Soviet past was as ideologically driven -- though not nearly as pernicious -- as the old party version," Mr. Remnick explains. "To legitimize his plans for a liberalized socialism, Gorbachev and his generation in the party intelligentsia even created a new set of icons. They emphasized the 'late Lenin' of the less draconian New Economic Policy of the early 1920's; Khrushchev, as the initiator of the anti-Stalinist thaw; Yuri Andropov, as a general secretary of the party and technocratic reformer who 'died too soon'; and, perhaps most of all, Nikolai Bukharin, the relatively flexible Bolshevik ideologist who was executed by Stalin in the purges."
By contrast, Mr. Yeltsin had a better sense of what was really going on in the country. He and others detected that an attempted military coup was possible by anti-reformist elements; Mr. Gorbachev wouldn't believe it. Mr. Remnick is clearly a Yeltsin admirer. He writes, "Despite the Kremlin's best efforts, the history of Soviet politics will show it was Yeltsin -- vain, comic, clever, crude -- who accelerated the essential step in political reform: the shattering of the Communist Party monolith."
The high point of "Lenin's Tomb" is the attempted coup against Mr. Gorbachev, and Mr. Remnick delivers the details excitingly, including Mr. Yeltsin's courageous take-charge role in the face of the tanks and cannons.
There are a few minor shortcomings of style and substance. Mr. Remnick brings himself into the book a little too often, breaking the stride of his narrative and forgetting that he's an observer, not a participant in these momentous events. And though he touches upon it, he might well have placed more importance on the lingering significance of the tens of millions of casualties suffered by the Russians during the Great Patriotic War, as they call World War II, and the continuing effects of the cold war on the people and Government. These subjects have found an influential place in the works of Russian poets and novelists; some in fact are mentioned by the author.
In addition to talks with the major personalities in the Politburo, the most original contributions in "Lenin's Tomb" are the author's interviews with historical figures or their widows and children, both famous and little known, who somehow survived the Stalinist purges. For example, Mr. Remnick describes a visit with Yakov Rapoport, now 91 and the only survivor of the 1953 "doctors' plot." In that time of anti-Semitic paranoia at its worst, Stalin ordered the K.G.B. to kill prominent doctors, most of them Jews, who were accused of poisoning Kremlin leaders. Dr. Rapoport was let out of prison only after Stalin died later that year.
There are, literally, hundreds of such interviews with legislators, historians, militarists, nationalists, journalists and party apparatchiks. When future histories of these explosive years are written, Mr. Remnick's invaluable firsthand reports will have to be taken into account. They make "Lenin's Tomb" an engrossing and essential addition to the human and political literature of our time.

HEADLINE: Myopia at the White House;
Scrambled Ethics

 BODY:
After a week of one political blunder after another, a light bulb finally went on somewhere in the White House, and the Democratic National Committee canceled the White House fund-raising breakfast with President Clinton it was planning for lobbyists and other fat-cat contributors.
But the rest of the tawdry affair will proceed next month as planned. What possessed the party chairman, David Wilhelm, to schedule the event in the first place? And who in the White House approved a breakfast session so obviously destined to leave the populist-posing President with more egg on his face than on his plate? 
 The breakfast was just part of the package of privileges the D.N.C. began offering last week in an invitation faxed or mailed to lobbyists, big corporate donors and other Democratic high-rollers. So while participants will have to go elsewhere for their eggs and bacon, the $15,000-a-couple ticket will still buy a weekend of special briefings by senior Administration officials capped by a gala called "The President's Dinner."
Among possible "honored guests" and speakers when the "retreat" kicks off on June 27: Thomas McLarty, the White House chief of staff; Robert Rubin, head of the National Economic Council; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers; Leon Panetta, White House budget director; Mickey Kantor, U.S. Trade Representative, and Ira Magaziner, the manager of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform.
The invitation may be more subtle than the hard sell used by the Republicans three years ago for its "Inner Circle" program. Gone, for example, is the G.O.P.'s tacky checklist where contributors could choose the cabinet officer with whom they'd most like to rub elbows at dinner. But the Democrats' program is basically the same. Much as a spokesman for the D.N.C. denies it, the party is selling special access to the President and the Administration. Indeed, as Gwen Ifill reports in The Times today, the June festivities are the tip of a soiled iceberg. Now that it's in power, the party has been expanding its donor base and pampering old givers by offering them private access to top officials. So much for setting a higher moral tone.
The timing of this episode couldn't be worse. It can only undermine Mr. Clinton's moral authority just as his campaign finance reform package is before the Senate. It's a strong measure that would close some of the loopholes that now allow corporations and other groups to easily evade Federal contribution limits to maximize their political clout.
Opponents are trying to kill real reform by removing the public financing essential to reducing the influence of special interests and give challengers a chance. But the Administration's courting program for big donors suggests the bill needs to be made even stronger: by barring parties from soliciting money based on access to high officials.

HEADLINE: Will a Lower Tax Break Be Bad for the Appetite?

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 23

 BODY:
For the thousands of restaurant owners, food and equipment suppliers and others involved in food service who gathered here for the annual trade show sponsored by the National Restaurant Association, new equipment and products were not the hot topics.
"All everybody's talking about is the tax issue, the deductibility," said Ralph Brennan, the owner of Mr. B's Bistro in New Orleans, as he left his hotel to go to the show at the McCormick Place Convention Center. 
 And to prove it, the association hopes that by the time the huge four-day show closes on Wednesday, many of the 100,000 expected attendees will have signed a giant card to be sent to President Clinton. It asserts that portions of his tax plan would damage the industry.
Heading the list is the Administration's proposal to reduce the deduction for business meals from 80 percent to 50 percent. "Deductibility is our biggest fight," said Stephen Elmont, the new president of the association. "We estimate that it will cost 165,000 jobs and represent $4 billion in lost sales."
Unlike the proposed energy tax, though, this tax change has not yet generated much opposition or debate. "It's not an issue the politicians or the body politic is getting excited about," Mr. Elmont said. "It's perceived as an issue of fairness, of fat cats eating expensive lunches."
Mr. Elmont said research done for the restaurant association in 1989 showed that 25 million Americans purchased business meals that year, at an average cost of $9.56 a meal, and that 70 percent of the meals were bought by people with incomes of less than $50,000. "Often, the only way a salesman on the road can meet with a prospective account and build a relationship is over lunch in a restaurant," he said.
Stephen Odell, the president of Sugar Foods, makers of Sweet'n Low and other products, said, "People think it's about going to Le Cirque, but in reality, Main Street, America, does business by taking someone to lunch at Sizzler." The proposal to reduce the deduction is part of the overall Clinton tax package, which may be voted on by the House on Thursday and which is now being considered by the Senate Finance Committee. Lorraine Voles, deputy press secretary at the White House, said the proposal was seen by the Administration as a "pretty benign way to collect much-needed funds." Businesses would still get a deduction, she added.
The Clinton Administration estimates that the change in the deduction will raise $16 billion. Restaurant owners, though, argue that the figure is misleadingly high because it assumes that business people will continue to spend money in restaurants at the current rate.
Until 1986, 100 percent of business meals could be deducted from Federal income taxes. When the proposal was made to reduce it to 80 percent, there were also warnings of harm to the industry. Asked about the potential loss of jobs, Ms. Voles said, "You heard the same argument when it went from 100 percent to 80 percent, but it didn't happen."
Growth in the restaurant industry has slowed since 1986, but the reasons aren't clear. Mr. Elmont said overall industry sales grew 16 percent between 1980 and 1986, but only 4 percent in the six years since the tax change was made. "We created 700,000 fewer jobs in the last six years than in the prior six years, but it's hard to say whether it was due to the recession or the decrease in deductibility."
The deductibility provision does not appear to be something members of the House and Senate are ready to fight. "I know it's important for New York, and a lot of jobs in my constituency depend on it," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has already approved the President's tax package. "But it's awkward to give privileges to businessmen, to approve a giveaway for rich people at the taxpayer's expense, even though they spend money in restaurants and jobs depend on it."
Frank Richter, the general manager of the American Express Company for the Southern region, said the change would lead to job losses. "I've spoken to restaurateurs in my region who said they would have to close for lunch," he said.
Mr. Rangel said he understood that those who were most likely to be laid off were busboys and dishwashers -- many of them from minority groups -- and others who might not find other jobs. But, he added, the public does not see it that way.
Larry Jenkins, the food service product manager for Integrated Ingredients, a company that sells spices, yeast and other products to restaurants, said his business has not been the same since 1986, when the deduction was reduced.
Participants in the restaurant association show pointed out that other business expenses would still be fully deductible. "Why should the cost of advertising be 100 percent deductible as a business expense?" Mr. Elmont said. "Is the cost of a little clock a company sent me to convince me that cigarettes are O.K. more legitimate than the price of a business meal?"
Others mentioned loss of sales taxes to states, counties and cities if fewer people dined out. "I paid $880,000 in sales tax last year alone," said Jeremiah Tower, the owner of Stars, in San Francisco, who was here for the restaurant show. "Who is going to make up the difference? The last cut was a disaster. There was a noticeable drop in lunch business."
Some of those at the show complained that the National Restaurant Association had not been effective enough in presenting the issue to the public as a question of jobs, rather than as a matter of writing off fancy meals. But Mr. Elmont said: "We are encouraging people in the industry to talk to their representatives. We are going to unleash the nine million people in our industry."

HEADLINE: CRUCIAL BARGAINING BEGINS AS THAWING ON BUDGET IS SEEN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
With a critical House vote on President Clinton's budget imminent and perilously uncertain, the White House and conservative Democrats in Congress abruptly halted their sniping over the proposal's merits today and began talking up a deal.
By late today, it remained just talk. But for the first time, both sides seemed to agree that the proposal would be changed. The House wants to make at least a cursory effort to keep health-care spending from running up the deficit, and the Senate hopes to tone down at least part of a heavily debated energy tax. 
 Mr. Clinton's critics in both houses of Congress have demanded such changes as the price for supporting the President's five-year package of about $250 billion in new taxes and $250 billion in spending cuts, a package that some fear could cost them their seats.
 
Appeal to Public Urged
 Several leading Democrats urged Mr. Clinton to take to network television to raise public support for his proposals. There was some suggestion that the President would do that on Wednesday, the day before the scheduled vote in the House.
"I told him that I thought it was extremely important that he articulate this case more clearly to the American people -- that members of Congress will vote based upon what we're hearing from home," Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas, said after meeting with Mr. Clinton this morning. "I got the clear impression that the White House would take that advice very seriously."
Today's bargaining was clearly driven by fears that the Democratic Party was about to self-destruct, rejecting the first budget of its first President in 16 years.
 
White House Strategy Session
 After weeks of mild attempts to rouse passions for his program, so much so that committee chairmen in the House openly complained about the soft sell, Mr. Clinton warmed to the task today. He hauled scores of wavering Democrats to the White House to pat them on the back, and summoned House leaders for a strategy session.
The campaign in the House was more frenetic than the one in the Senate, but only because it is more urgent. The House Democratic whips, whose job it is to corral support for the White House, were telling their leaders today that they were still 5 to 10 votes short of the 217 votes needed to push the budget through. Only last week House leaders had expressed confidence that the budget would pass easily.
Most lawmakers expect all 176 Republicans to oppose Mr. Clinton's plan when the House votes on it. A shift of only 41 of the 256 Democrats and one independent would doom the package to defeat, and at least 45 Democrats were still listed as being against the proposal.
The President faces a terrible whipsaw in the House. Moderate and conservative Democrats from suburban and rural areas, egged on by voters, are telling him that he needs to cut spending further. Oil-state representatives, a small but critical bloc, want him to scrap the energy tax, whose $71 billion in revenue is roughly a quarter of the White House's entire tax program.
But urban Democrats, a big, liberal and influential constituency, are adamantly opposed to further cuts or caps on spending that would hurt their largely poor districts.
 
Foley Speaks of Confidence
 Nonetheless, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he was confident that the bill would pass. "There are a lot of efforts to divert attention here," the Washington Democrat said. "They do not want to see this economic program go forward, many people, because it is a program in the interests of the American people."
Leaders in all the Democratic camps were markedly more hopeful today than on Monday that a deal to end the squabble could be worked out. Their hopes rested on a compromise plan that purports to accomplish the impossible: to allow spending on health care and other mandatory programs to grow as needed but still force Congress and the White House to keep that growth from inflating the Federal deficit.
The author of the plan is Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, a quiet but influential Democrat on budget issues. The compromise plan is devilishly complex, but essentially, whenever spending on mandatory programs like Medicare and food stamps exceeds the levels spelled out in Mr. Clinton's five-year budget plan, it would require the Government to consider cutting spending in succeeding years.
But the President and Congress would have several options. They could make up the excess, immediately or over several years, by reducing spending anywhere in the budget. They could make up part of the excess through a prearranged tax surcharge. Or the President could recommend that he and Congress simply ignore the excess spending, as has been done in the past.
In the last-named case, Congress would have to approve the President's recommendation. In each case the effect would be that Congress and the White House would have to address the rising cost of mandatory programs in public and in detail, something Mr. Spratt said had been lacking in recent years.
Representative Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, an influential conservative Democrat, said today that he and his allies were negotiating the "fine print" of the compromise plan, and that he hoped it would defuse the standoff over Mr. Clinton's budget.
 
Positive Signs From Clinton
 As for Mr. Clinton and his allies, Mr. Spratt said tonight, "The House leadership is headed in this direction, and the White House seems to be at least looking at it."
Mr. Glickman said the President "seemed to be somewhat positively inclined to some form of entitlement control," but did not sign off on the proposal in his meeting with lawmakers today.
Oddly for everyone but politicians, the telling House vote will come not on Mr. Clinton's budget itself, but on the agenda for debating and voting on the measure, which the House Rules Committee will draft on Wednesday and the full House will consider on Thursday.
That rule, as the agenda is called, is expected to sharply limit debate and outlaw unfriendly amendments. Republicans and dissident Democrats want to throw the bill open to changes, but their only hope lies in defeating the rule -- and that is where the vote appears closest.
After the House comes the Senate, where Democratic unhappiness with the Clinton budget is even deeper and conservatives seem determined to unravel the compromise that the House was bolting together today. But even there, things seemed to be looking up for the White House.
In the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Clinton has seemed until now to have no more than 9 of the 11 votes he needs to get the tax, and his budget, to the Senate floor. Two swing-vote Democrats, Senators David L. Boren of Oklahoma and John B. Breaux of Louisiana, have publicly committed themselves to abolishing the energy tax, and Mr. Boren has threatened to tie the entire budget up in the Finance Committee unless the tax is largely replaced with more spending cuts.
But Mr. Breaux appeared to shy away from the fight today, putting off indefinitely his plan to unveil a gasoline tax as a replacement for Mr. Clinton's energy levy. For his part, Mr. Boren met for an hour today with the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and had nothing to say afterward.
A Clinton ally on the committee, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, was unusually cheery about the budget's committee prospects today, predicting flatly that Mr. Boren and Mr. Breaux would see the light and support Mr. Clinton's energy tax, with a few changes here and there. He also predicted that the Finance Committee would mollify Mr. Boren by making "real reductions" in the same mandatory spending programs that the House is seeking to preserve.
Asked about that, Mr. Moynihan replied, "Senator Baucus is right on both counts." Asked how reductions would be achieved, he said "you change the formulas" by which benefits are calculated.
"What we're talking about is Medicare and Medicaid," he said, but he declined to say how much money was at stake.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, another Democrat who supports further spending cuts in the Clinton budget, said he saw the elements of a White House legislative strategy beginning to emerge at long last: preserving mandatory programs in the House, cutting them deeply in the Senate, and splitting the difference when the final budget package goes to a House-Senate conference this summer.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about budget negotiations between Congress and the White House misstated the recent history of Democratic control of the Presidency. Bill Clinton is the party's first President in 12 years, not 16.

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Rose to $124 Billion in 1992

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Despite the sluggish economy, individuals, corporations and foundations contributed $124.3 billion to philanthropy in 1992, a 6.4 percent increase over the previous year.
Still, the showing was disappointing considering that the number of millionaires increased fourteenfold and the baby boom generation moved into the 35-to-64 age category, the prime age for charitable giving. The total giving for 1991 was $116.8 billion. 
 "Charitable giving is doing well, considering the economic climate, but lacks explosive growth," said Martin Grenzebach, chairman of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy, in announcing the findings yesterday of Giving U.S.A., a yearbook on philanthropy that is widely regarded as the most comprehensive survey in the field.
As usual, the largest sum came from individual donors; living donors contributed $101 billion, and bequests accounted for $8.1 billion.
 
Corporate Donations Fall
 Foundations, gaining from profitable investments in stocks, increased their contributions to nonprofit organizations in the arts, education and human service fields to $8.3 billion but giving by corporations continued to stagnate, hovering around $6 billion.
Giving to religion, always the largest recipient, amounted to $56.7 billion, or 45.6 percent of all giving. Education received $14 billion, slightly less than 1991. Giving to health totaled $10.2 billion and to human services, $11.5 billion. Giving to arts, culture and the humanities amounted to $9.3 billion. Groups involved in community development, civil rights and other public activities received $5 billion. Giving to environmental organizations rose to $3.1 billion, but giving to international affairs causes dropped to $1.7 billion, a decline of $40 million.
When adjusted for inflation, total giving represented a growth of 2.3 percent.
Giving to United Way organizations was clearly reduced after United Way of America's former president, William Aramony, was accused of mismanagement and excessive use of the organization's income. But the furor did not lead to a decline in giving to other nonprofit organizations, Giving U.S.A. reported.
United Way's own research, polling a random sampling of more than a thousand donors, showed the economy's decline was the major reason for the drop, and the Aramony controversy was the second. With less than one-half of United Way campaigns complete, results showed a 3.7 percent decline in giving.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND ALLIES TWIST ARMS IN BID FOR BUDGET VOTES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, May 27

 BODY:
On the eve of the most crucial Congressional vote of his Presidency so far, President Clinton, members of his Cabinet and loyalists in Congress spent Wednesday twisting the arms of dozens of Democratic lawmakers who were still not committed to voting for his budget.
By nightfall, vote-counters said they still did not have enough pledges of support to forge a majority in the House of Representatives, but they expressed optimism that a majority would be in hand by the time the vote was taken on this afternoon. 
 "On tough votes like this, the votes are rarely there till the zero hour," said a staff assistant who has had years of experience following close votes in the House.
 
Subject to Persuasion
 Mr. Clinton met Wednesday morning with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and spent the rest of the day calling particular representatives who House leaders had told him might be subject to persuasion. At a morning photo session, the President said he expected to win.
Mr. Clinton rejected the suggestion of some lawmakers that he give a televised nationwide address promoting his program. But the White House said the President would appear today for two hours on the "CBS This Morning" program, which starts at 7 A.M. Eastern time.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had lunch with the Texas delegation and managed to swing at least two important votes. Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, met Wednesday morning with a group of freshmen and then called other representatives.
In the Capitol about 30 Democratic whips, whose job it is to keep track of how their colleagues plan to vote, met every couple of hours to review where things stood.
 
Uphill Battle in Senate
 If the House passes the bill it will still face an uphill battle next month in the Senate, where party discipline is weaker.
The bill, the heart of the President's program to reduce the budget deficit, would raise taxes by about $250 billion and cut spending on benefit programs by about $100 billion over five years. Another $150 billion in spending reductions would come later, during the appropriations process, according to the President's plan, and would largely involve lower spending for the military and smaller interest payments as the deficit falls.
So far, Mr. Clinton has made some concessions, and the House Ways and Means Committee has made some changes. But the bill before the House contains the core of the President's proposals: much higher taxes on the wealthy, slightly higher taxes for corporations, a new tax on fuel and a tax cut for the working poor.
More than 70 percent of the tax increase would fall on families earning more than $100,000 a year, and more than 60 percent would come from those making more than $200,000.
With all the tax provisions in effect, families with incomes above $200,000 would owe an average of $1,935 a month more in taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those with incomes from $40,000 to $50,000 would owe only $23 a month more than now, and those with smaller incomes would have even less of a tax increase.
The Democrats uncommitted to the President's program generally objected aloud to the new tax on energy or complained that Mr. Clinton had offered too few spending cuts. But those were often smokescreens.
The real reason for much of the opposition, said a Democratic leader who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, was that many freshmen and others who feared they might lose their seats in the House were worried about voting for any tax increase, knowing it would make them vulnerable in re-election races.
The Democratic leadership in the House predicted victory. "When we have the vote tomorrow, we will have the votes," Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said after a Democratic caucus meeting on Wednesday. But by the day's end the leaders were still at least 20 votes shy of a majority.
One of the most vocal opponents to Mr. Clinton's budget outside Washington, Ross Perot, has scheduled several television appearances today and Friday. According to his office, he is to appear on the NBC program "Today" on this morning and on the ABC News program "Nightline" tonight. On Friday, he is to appear on four programs: "CBS This Morning," "Donahue," which is syndicated, "Talking With David Frost" on PBS and again on "Nightline."
Republicans had a rally Wednesday on the east lawn of the Capitol to make their opposition to higher taxes photogenic. But the excitement was entirely among the Democrats. And the issue by this point was no longer the substance of the measure, but party loyalty and loyalty to the President.
One of the main Democratic opponents, Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, said, "My gut is that they should pull the bill before it's too late."
Mr. McCurdy was an early Clinton supporter in the Presidential campaign. But he has seemed to have his nose out of joint since the President turned him down for a Cabinet seat and Mr. Foley removed him from his chairmanship of the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
 
Crucial Vote on the Rule
 The crucial vote will come not on the bill itself, but on a procedural resolution called the rule, which sets the terms for the debate and determines which amendments will be in order.
Republicans asked to be permitted to offer a variety of amendments, but they had no hope of being allowed to.
Talks continued throughout the day on proposals that would force the President and Congress to face the facts and respond if the deficit turned out to be higher in the years ahead than the Administration was now projecting.
Early today, a small band of lawmakers led by Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, reached an agreement with the the White House and the House leadership on a mechanism to curb spending through ceilings on benefit programs like Medicare and food stamps. "This is a major, significant change regarding the budget process," Mr. Stenholm was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.
On the other end of the seesaw from Mr. Stenholm was the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members adamantly opposed a spending ceiling.
Under a possible compromise had the support of the White House, if the deficit rose higher than expected because of increased spending or a decline in revenue, the President would have to propose action, and Congress would have to vote on it.
On Wednesday morning, according to one nose count, only 6 of the 21 Democratic representatives from Texas were committed to backing the President.
At his meeting with the Texas delegation, Secretary Bentsen, a former representative and senator from Texas, managed to swing at least two more important representatives into the President's camp: Jack Brooks, the senior member of the delegation and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and E. (Kika) de la Garza, chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
 
Warning of Economic Damage
 Mr. Bentsen reportedly said that the Administration would not be averse to making modifications in its proposed fuel tax when the measure reaches the Senate. He also argued, his spokesman said, that if the Clinton measure failed, interest rates would skyrocket and the economy would be seriously damaged.
The nerve center of the vote counting was the first-floor office of Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the chief Democratic whip. His lieutenants met there every couple of hours to compare notes.
One of Mr. Bonior's assistants, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, said recalcitrant Democrats were divided into four groups: leaning for, on the fence, leaning against and definitely against.
At each meeting, the names were called out one by one. The whip who had been assigned the representative whose name was called gave a progress report, and then others would often volunteer to try their hand at persuasion.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Best Friends Find It a Tough Role

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Harry Thomason says he and his wife are "fighting for the right to live in this country."
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason says she now empathizes with Bebe Rebozo, Bert Lance, Alfred Bloomingdale and others who have had bad experiences "being the President's best friend." 
 The same Hollywood team that packaged Bill Clinton as "The Man From Hope," the glossy biographical film that kicked off the campaign at the Democratic National Convention last summer, is now fighting back against accusations that they have smudged their longtime friend's populist image.
 
Calls to White House
 Even though some Clinton advisers are cringing, the creators of the sitcoms "Designing Women," "Evening Shade," and "Hearts Afire" are camped out at the Capital Hilton, defending themselves against criticism that they led the President astray by sending him to an expensive hairdresser named Cristophe of Beverly Hills.
There were also Mr. Thomason's calls to the White House on behalf of friends in the air-charter industry who felt they were getting shut out of bidding for White House travel business.
It has been a wild, wacky, stumbling, heart-wrenching week at the White House, where Mr. Thomason has a pass that allows him to roam freely and where he can be reached at an office in the East Wing by calling the White House switchboard.
Perhaps it is the inevitable coda of a year in which politics became suffused with a confessional talk-show sensibility and Hollywood production values that Washington would come to resemble a situation comedy that might be called "Designing Presidents."
Although some White House officials and Clinton strategists argued that talk-show appearances by the Thomasons this week could hurt the President by keeping a damaging story alive and preventing the White House from picking up the pieces of its message on the economy, the Thomasons decided to fight back Hollywood-style, guns and folksiness blazing.
"We don't think we are important people in Washington," Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason said, "but when someone says something scurrilous about us, we can stand on our lawn for a couple of days and say, 'No, we didn't do that.' "
Mr. Thomason agreed: "This is certainly not a publicity blitz. It's a right-to-live-in-this-country blitz."
Supporters of the Thomasons say the two are also furious at being tarred with the criticism that they are the Pied Pipers who have led the President and First Lady into being too cozy with Hollywood. Rather, friends of the Hollywood couple say the Thomasons have been warning the Clintons for the last eight months not to get too close to Hollywood.
Asked about his friend while jogging this morning, Mr. Clinton said: "He has no official role. He's just our friend."
Republicans, however, jumped in with extravagant praise for the Thomasons. As William Kristol, Republican analyst and former chief of staff to Dan Quayle, put it: "I encourage President Clinton to depend on them even more."
 
Criticism From Perot
 Mr. Clinton continues to be unconcerned with the appearance that he is too cozy with Hollywood, but Ross Perot was ready to put his spin on the situation in an interview on Tuesday with David Frost that will be shown Friday on the Public Broadcasting Service. "When you've got a different movie star in the White House every night," Mr. Perot said, "and you've got somebody up there from Hollywood pleading the case for the Dali Lama, the average hard working American in work clothes can't relate to that. He'd like for you to get back to business."
Indeed, just before he got his trim from Cristophe on Tuesday of last week, an incident that blew up when it was learned that planes had to circle the runway while the Beverly Hills hairmeister snipped, the President also had a "meet and greet" at the Los Angeles airport with some supporters from Hollywood and Los Angeles financial and political circles.
Quincy Jones, the music producer, and Dawn Steel, the movie producer, both got tours of Air Force One, and Cristophe said some important Democrats came in while he was clipping.
At a recent star-studded Democratic National Committee fund-raising event in New York, Mr. Clinton raised eyebrows when he ended up sitting next to Sharon Stone, who plays in steamy movies. When a seat next to the President ended up empty for the main course, a committee staff member ushered Ms. Stone, who was seated several tables away, to the Mr. Clinton's side.
Even some Hollywood big shots wondered about the political finesse of such a move. "The President looks like a groupie," one top producer said. "He shouldn't always see us when we want to see him."
But Barbra Streisand rejected the notion that the halo of stars around Mr. Clinton has become a distraction, telling The Los Angeles Times in an interview published this week that celebrities have unfairly been painted as air heads.
 
C-Span Devotee
 "My favorite show is the C-Span," she said. "That's what I watch: C-Span 1 and C-Span 2. When I'm not watching CNN."
For her part, Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason would not discuss conversations she has had with the Clintons. But she did indicate that she and her husband are not part of the new Hollywood crowd clamoring for access. "We don't go to the Emmys, we don't go to the Academy Awards, we never eat at Spago," said Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason, an Arkansas native who named her show "Evening Shade" at Hillary Rodham Clinton's suggestion. "We're outsiders in Hollywood and we're beaten up as insiders."
The Thomasons even distanced themselves from their friends in the White House, emphasizing that they do not get their hair cut by Cristophe.
"Cristophe has never cut our hair," Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason told ABC firmly.
But the Thomasons may also have added to their friend's image problems when they acquired, for the use of the First Family, a Western retreat, a lavish beach-front estate outside Santa Barbara, Calif.
The Hollywood elite who discovered Bill Clinton late in the game and who now fall all over each other trying to get invitations to the Lincoln Bedroom agree that the Thomasons were not part of their set. The Thomasons have been overshadowed as the new crowd vies for the title of Best Hollywood Friend.
"No one ever heard of them until the Bill connection," one top Hollywood producer said. "They were non-mainstream."
The Thomasons, who deftly incorporated the same romantic notion of small-town America into Mr. Clinton's biographical film that they ply on their Arkansas-based show, "Evening Shade," freely concede they are casting themselves as Capra-like heroes under siege by a corrupt and evil capital.
But at the same time that they painted themselves as just a couple of normal folks from Arkansas and Missouri, they also pointed out that with their whopping salaries, they would have no need to seek business from the White House.
"Given our salaries, setting our sights on the White House travel office would be the financial equivalent of us taking over someone's lemonade stand," Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason said. "It's ludicrous."
In an appearance with her husband today on the ABC program "Good Morning America," she called Washington -- with its echo chamber of reporters and Republicans -- "an incestuous insane asylum." She told USA Today that if she and her husband get this treatment, "then Mother Teresa better stay out of town."
Mr. Thomason's argument, repeated in interview after interview over the last two days, is that he did not engage in cronyism in appealing to the President and other White House officials on the issue of the White House travel office. Rather, he says, he was a whistle-blower who was trying to help clean up what he saw as mismanagement and prodigal spending in the White House travel office.
Appearing on the Fox Morning news show today, Mr. Thomason showed more Capraesque flair when he pushed the notion that Cristophe represented the American dream, a man who came here penniless and ended up a hairdresser to the stars. He said he would not feel embarrassed if he had introduced him to Mr. Clinton, because Cristophe "understands what it's like to be an American. I mean, he came over from Belgium, and so it's important to get him to participate."
But he made it clear he had not introduced Cristophe to the President. Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason did the honors during the campaign, suggesting to both the President and First Lady that the man who snips the hair of Markie Post, the star of "Hearts Afire," might do for them, as well. (Although she did not recommend they get a personal services contract with him when they got to the White House.)
Finally, Mr. Thomason suggested that reporters should focus on more important issues. In a comparison that might not thrill the White House, he said: "It's not right when you ask 70 questions about the holocaust in Waco and you ask 123 about the travel office. What's going on here?"

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Ways to Isolate Iran; Describes Leaders as Dangerous

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is preparing a broad new effort to weaken Iran by persuading reluctant allies to cut off loans, investment and arms sales to what American officials regard as a permanently hostile Government.
The plan, drafted as part of an intensive policy review, reflects a conclusion that Iran must be isolated if it is to be prevented from emerging as a substantial threat to Western interests. Thus, the plan rejects Reagan and Bush Administration policies that offered to reward Teheran for good behavior.
 
Abandoning a Balance
 Administration officials said the new approach aimed at denying Iran access to the money and weapons needed to complete a military resurgence. They said it was based on a decision that the United States and its allies should now treat Iran as harshly as it treats Iraq. 
 For much of the 1980's, the United States sought to play Iran and Iraq against one another. But with United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf war, the Administration has concluded that the wiser policy is "dual containment."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher hinted at the emerging shift earlier this year by denouncing Iran as an "international outlaw" and a "dangerous country" for its support of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. But the new policy is far more sweeping than Mr. Christopher indicated when he said the United States would seek to block loans to Iran by international organizations.
Administration officials say the isolation of Iran should end only if Teheran halts its support for terrorism, curtails its military buildup, stops its subversion of other governments and ends its quest for nuclear weapons.
 
Catalogue of Accusations
 Among the antagonistic activities that United States officials attribute to Iran is active support for efforts by the Hamas and Party of God organizations to use violence to disrupt the Mideast peace talks. The officials say Iran has also helped establish terrorist training camps in Lebanon and the Sudan, and has assisted groups trying to overthrow the Governments of Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia.
The United States already subjects Iran to stiff sanctions that prohibit military and most commercial ties. Administration officials said their new policy could succeed only if other countries change course.
Among the top priorities, Administration officials said, are efforts to convince Russia and China to cancel deals to provide Iran with weapons and nuclear reactors, and to persuade Japan, Germany and Britain to cut off loans.
None of those countries have shown any willingness to sever such lucrative ties, and Japan in particular has argued that commercial links can encourage moderate elements inside Iran. But while the United States once harbored similar hopes, Administration officials now regard all factions in the current leadership as bound to remain hostile toward the West.
While many deals between United States companies and Iran are already prohibited, the new policy would almost certainly lead the Administration to reject a request by the Boeing Company to sell 20 Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran, a deal worth more than $750 million, officials say.
The broad outlines of the new approach were described in a speech last week by Martin S. Indyk, the senior director for Middle East policy for the National Security Council, to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research group.
Mr. Indyk said bluntly, "If we fail in our efforts to modify Iranian behavior, five years from now Iran will be much more capable of posing a real threat to Israel and to Western interests in the Middle East."
The Iran review was one of several dozen studies requested by President Clinton shortly after he took office.
But the atmosphere surrounding it has been intensified by suspicions that Iran might have had a role in the World Trade Center bombing, Government officials say. Investigators have found that tens of thousands of dollars were wired from Iran to bank accounts held by suspects in the bombing.
 
No Help Likely for Rebels
 Final details of the plan await White House approval, officials say. But while Mr. Clinton made overtures to the main Iranian opposition group before he took office, his advisers said there was no chance that the new policy would involve closer ties with the group, the People's Mujahedeen.
The Administration has concluded that the Mujahedeen's ties to Iraq and its terrorist attacks against Americans in the 1970's makes it an unacceptable partner.
The officials also expressed little optimism that the organized resistance or other domestic unrest could force a significant change in the Iranian Government. They said they expected President Hashemi Rafsanjani to win re-election to a second four-year term in elections on June 11.
 
The Political Issues
 Administration officials also said the United States had rejected seeking an embargo on sales of Iranian oil. The rebels have called for such a ban, but the policy review concluded that it could not be enforced without imposing a military blockade, a step Mr. Clinton's advisers are unwilling to take.
In outlining the effort to isolate Iran, officials acknowledged that the task would be more difficult than the containment of Iraq, which carries the weight of United Nations sanctions.
In March, an initial United States attempt to isolate Teheran failed when the World Bank overrode Washington's objections and approved a $165 million loan to upgrade Iran's electrical power system. But officials who outlined the new policy said the United States intended to mount an aggressive effort to persuade other countries of the dangers Iran poses.
Administration officials have begun to argue that Iran, which has borrowed $25 billion in the last four years, is not a good investment. Teheran has already fallen $5 billion behind on its payments, and the Administration intends to warn countries that go ahead with sales of weapons and nuclear goods that they run the risk of not being paid.
Because of high inflation and unemployment, a senior Administration official said, Iran was "more vulnerable than it has been in the past or is likely to be in the future." But he repeated Mr. Indyk's warning that "this moment will not last long."
 
The Military Issues
 The Central Intelligence Agency has warned that Iran may acquire a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade. Its deals with Russia and China for nuclear reactors are regarded with uneasiness by some American analysts, who say the plants may be being used as a cover to acquire sensitive technology.
A simultaneous Iranian buildup of conventional forces has prompted similar concern. Officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency have said Teheran's $2 billion military spending spree may be merely an effort to rebuild forces depleted during its eight-year war with Iraq. But purchases of Russian submarines and a bid to buy top-of-the-line tanks have persuaded other officials that Iran seeks to become the dominant power in the Mideast.

HEADLINE: 3 Florio Foes Hold 2d G.O.P. Debate

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLMDEL, N.J. May 26

 BODY:
In the last statewide forum before New Jersey's primary election in two weeks, the three major candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination met in a televised debate tonight, jousting over policy, campaign bickering and who is best qualified to defeat Gov. Jim Florio in November.
The tone of the town-hall style debate -- members of the audience put questions to the candidates, Christine Todd Whitman, Cary Edwards and James L. Wallwork -- was a marked departure from the previous rancor-filled meetings involving the three Republicans. 
 Business people made up a majority of the audience, and that was reflected in a string of questions on automobile insurance reform, managed health care, unemployment, pollution legislation and sports betting.
Mr. Edwards, Mr. Wallwork and Mrs. Whitman tended to agree on many issues. On the question of restructuring the automobile insurance system, for example, each candidate favored changing the laws to reduce the number of lawsuits from vehicle accidents, offering more insurance options to reduce rates for some drivers, and easing regulations to encourage more companies to write automobile insurance in New Jersey.
The candidates still found the opportunity to lash out at one another.
A question about New Jersey's bleak unemployment rate, from a young woman who said she had recently lost her job, set up the most heated exchange of the evening.
Mrs. Whitman was giving her response to the question when Mr. Edwards cut her off.
"Christie, you don't understand, the girl doesn't have a job today," Mr. Edwards said.
"Can you offer her one?" Mrs. Whitman said.
"At least I have had a job in my life," replied Mr. Edwards, who has tried to paint Mrs. Whitman as a wealthy elitist who would be out of touch with the people as Governor.
 
'You Owe an Apology'
 Mrs. Whitman said in response, "I would ask for an apology for that, Cary, but I think that you owe an apology to every woman for saying last weekend that you resent having to run against a woman."
Mr. Edwards said he owed no apology to Mrs. Whitman. After the debate Mr. Edwards accused Ms. Whitman of "setting him up" over the issue, saying that she had misrepresented his comments from a weekend debate that involved only him and Mr. Wallwork.
As in a televised debate two weeks ago, the clash ended when Mr. Wallwork intervened, telling his rivals to calm down.
The debate was co-sponsored by chapters of the New Jersey Association of Women Business Owners and by New Jersey Network, the state-owned broadcasting system. It was broadcast live over the network's four televison channels and New Jersey cable systems, and over N.J.N. Radio, which serves central and southern New Jersey.
 
Most Important Face-Off
 The sponsors said 500 people paid $10 apiece to be part of the live audience at the Gov. Robert B. Meyner Reception Center on the grounds of the Garden State Arts Center. The questioners were selected in advance, based on questions they submitted along with their requests for tickets.
Michael Aron, a senior political correspondent for New Jersey Network, moderated the 90-minute debate.
Over the last four months, Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wallwork have engaged in at least half a dozen debates, but none more important than tonight's face-off.
It was the last of two mandatory debates for candidates who have qualified for public campaign financing in the primary -- the first was held on May 11 in Whippany -- but more important, it was the last chance for voters to make a side-by-side comparison of the three candidates before primary day, June 8.
 
Crowd Seems Uncommitted
 Each candidate had a contingent of supporters in the audience, but except for a consensus in favor of lower taxes, a majority of the crowd appeared to be uncommitted.
Sidney Israel, a Rumson, N.J., engineeer who attended the debate with his wife, Rhoda, said: "What we got from the Florio administration was a tremendous loss of jobs out of state and a huge increase in the cost of living. If I had a question for the candidates, it would be about improving the economy enough to level these things out."
Rhoda Israel was more pointed. "My concern is about programs to give tax money to private schools," she said. "I don't think we should cross that line." Mrs. Whitman, the leading Republican candidate, repeated her support for for tax-financed school vouchers payable to private schools, although with a test program first. Mr. Wallwork, a former state senator, said the voucher quesiton should be settled in a public referendum, while Mr. Edwards, a former state attorney general, held to his oppostion to voucher programs.
According to the State Election Law Enforcement Commission, Mr. Florio, Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Edwards each have qualified for the maximum $1.6 million in matching funds. Mr. Wallwork has qualified for $800,000 in matching funds, according to his campaign.
 
Media Push Beginning
 Mr. Florio is running unopposed in the primary and has not participated in any primary debates.
The televised N.J.N. debates and very expensive broadcast advertisements on television and radio stations in New Jersey, New York City and Philadelphia are important parts of the strategy for each campaign in the final days before the June 8 primary elections.
Mrs. Whitman began her media push last week with a series of television and radio broadcasts that portray her as the candidate for change. The advertisements do not mention either her Republican primary opponents or Mr. Florio.
Mr. Edwards also began his media blitz last week. He has split his attack between Mr. Florio, criticizing him over a record $2.8 billion tax increase, and Mrs. Whitman, panning her for not voting in school elections and for using a tax loophole to pay $47 in property taxes on 50 acres of land on her estate.
 
Wallwork Starting Blitz
 Mr. Wallwork intends to start an intensive broadcast campaign on Thursday that hammers away at Mrs. Whitman as a "liberal" who voted 17 times to raise taxes as a Somerset County Freeholder.
Mr. Wallwork's campaign said the ad would run on television stations and 31 radio stations.
"We are going to be spending $400,000 on media ads between now and the primary," said Cristyne Lategano, Mr. Wallwork's spokeswoman.
Despite Mr. Florio's lack of primary opposition, his campaign began running a 60-second advertisement on Tuesday that praises him as a leader who made tough choices during tough times, a heroic challenger to the National Rifle Association over the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons and an environmental challenger for cracking down on ocean dumping.
A would-be challenger to Mr. Florio for the Democratic nomination, John Budzash, was disqualified after the Democratic State Committee challenged his qualifying papers in court.
 
'I Still Don't Know'
 As the debate drew to a close tonight, many of the people who had attended waiting to be won over remained undecided.
One of them was Robin Simko, president of Professional Insurance Agents of New Jersey, who had hoped for coherent answers.
"Whitman said she was for tort reform, and that's good," she said, referring to new laws to reduce lawsuits over car accidents. "Wallwork is for opening up the system to competition. Edwards? He wasn't very clear. We need a lot of change in this state, and I have a lot of hope, but I still don't know who I should vote for."
Al Zecca, an Essex County employee, went to the debate hoping to hear about his key concern, streamlining state government by consolidating bureacracies. That question was asked during the evening, but the answers were too vague for Mr. Zecca. As Mr. Wallwork was speaking, he declared, "The first thing we have to do is dump Florio," and the applause that followed this Republican mantra of three years was so faint that Mr. Zecca cocked an eyebrow.
"See?" he said, "Nobody knows for sure. It could even be Florio again."

HEADLINE: Brazil Answers Inflation With Cabinet Shuffle

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York TimesSpecial to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 25

 BODY:
With Brazil's Army discreetly flexing its political muscles, President Itamar Franco is gambling on a Cabinet shuffle that one newsweekly here called "Itamar's last chance."
Unable to cut back inflation from its current level of 30 percent a month, Mr. Franco has pinned his hopes on Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 61, a former Sao Paulo senator who enjoys wide respect, from company boardrooms here in Brazil's industrial heartland to the headquarters of multilateral banks in Washington. 
 But, by moving from the Foreign Ministry to the Finance Ministry, Mr. Cardoso now confronts a daunting challenge of credibility: he is the fourth Finance Minister to serve during Mr. Franco's eight-month-old Government.
"If Fernando Henrique fails, Itamar may have to resign in advance," said Andre Lara Resende, a director of Fintec, an investment bank here. "Things are evolving very quickly."
Since assuming presidential powers last October from Fernando de Collor Mello, who was forced from office by an array of scandals, Mr. Franco has proved to be indecisive, business people here complain. Presidential elections are to be held in October 1994.
But several bankers and political scientists predict that if the new Finance Minister is unable to reduce inflation, strong pressure will mount for Mr. Franco to resign and for elections to be held sooner.
Brazil's largest denomination bill, the 500,000-cruzeiro note, is worth $10. Unemployment in Sao Paulo, Brazil's business capital, has hit 16 percent, or 1.2 million people.
With no relief in sight, Veja, Brazil's largest selling newsweekly, called the appointment of Mr. Cardoso as Finance Minister "the best news that the country has received since Fernando Collor's impeachment."
One Brazilian banker agreed: "It's a gamble that the Brazilian business community has to take very seriously. The fact that the military have started sending signals is very important."
Indeed, the quiet re-emergence of Brazil's military in politics is a measure of the weakness of Mr. Franco, Brazil's third civilian President since 21 years of military rule ended in 1985.
On May 18, the military high command met in Brasilia with Mr. Franco. After the meeting, a joint statement issued by the President's office warned, "Democracy cannot commit suicide." The following day, the President dismissed Luiza Erundina, a left-wing leader of the Workers Party, as Secretary of Federal Administration and named Romildo Canhim, a recently retired army general.

Apple Aims for Ex-Soviet States

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 26

 BODY:
Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would begin a new effort to compete head-on with the International Business Machines Corporation in Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
The lifting of cold war restrictions on exports of technology to the former Soviet Union has provided Apple and other personal computer companies with a potentially enormous market. 
 "Virtually every household in the newly independent states will know that Apple Macintosh is now within reach," Brian Keating, general manager for Apple Computer in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, said in a statement.
 
 
'1984 Redux'
 As part of an aggressive debut, a revised version of Apple's famous 1984 commercial will be shown on news programs throughout the former Soviet Union on Thursday.
Called "1984 Redux," the 60-second television ad says: "For more than 20 years, Europe, Asia, America -- the whole world -- all toiled under the dominance of one personal computer system. A system whose inflexibility discouraged independent thought and personal creativity. A system whose power went unchallenged. Until Apple created Macintosh. The right to choose. The right to think. The right to be an individual. Apple Computer now in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States."
While the former Soviet Union represents a potentially huge market, its economic weakness and instability have thwarted efforts to sell personal computers. Analysts say today's move by Apple, which has made previous efforts in the Soviet Union, is more a matter of laying the groundwork for a market that may develop in 5 or 10 years than something that will contribute to sales in the near future.
"It's evangelism," said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. "There is so much turmoil and the economy is so backward that the best anyone can do is go in as an evangelist now."
 
 
Economic Turmoil
 He said that Apple had tried to sell computers in the Soviet Union three years ago, and that John Sculley, the company's chairman and chief executive, had met with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and had given him a Macintosh. But the collapse of Communism and the resultant economic turmoil stalled Apple's efforts.
Charles Wolf, an analyst with First Boston, said the former Soviet Union was a very long-term proposition for Apple, but one worth pursuing.
"The two great opportunities clearly are the Soviet Union and China," he said. "The problem in both is that there's not an infrastructure to build a market. Consequently this is probably going to be a very slow build."

HEADLINE: France Is Selling 21 Big Companies

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 26

 BODY:
Making good on a campaign pledge, France's new conservative Government today announced a sweeping privatization program involving 21 big state-controlled companies, including Air France, Renault and the Elf Aquitaine oil giant.
The selloff is to begin on a company-by-company basis this fall, with the Government hoping to raise about $7.25 billion this year alone. In contrast to a similar program carried out between 1986 and 1988, no limit will be placed on the acquisition of shares by foreigners. 
 The order and timing of the privatizations will be announced next month, but the inclusion of Renault stirred immediate interest since it should accelerate the auto maker's eventual merger with privately owned Volvo of Sweden, which already owns 20 percent of the French company.
 
'Operating Flexibility'
 "Private ownership should be a net positive for Renault," said Jean-Claude Gruet, auto analyst for UBS Securities in New York. "This will mean operating flexibility for management, which will now be able to control costs without Government interference."
Renault, despite a deep slump in the European auto market, has managed to return to profitability through a mixture of radical cost-cutting, sharply improved quality, some inventive new models and the highly successful alliance with Volvo.
The company's net profit surged 84 percent in 1992, to 5.68 billion francs, or $1.03 billion, on sales of 179.45 billion francs. But in the first quarter of this year, profits slumped to 240 million francs, a 90 percent drop from the similar 1992 period.
Renault's sale value will obviously increase if it is accomplished as the European auto market is recovering.
Market analysts said they expected the Government to begin its program with those companies most certain to attract investors, among them the Banque Nationale de Paris.
While Banque National de Paris's profits have declined in the European recession, it still earned 2.17 billion francs, or $390 million, last year.
 But another well-known French banking company on the privatization list, Credit Lyonnais, will be less attractive to investors because of recent loan problems and losses stemming from the financing of Giancarlo Parretti's acquisition of Metro-Goldwin-Meyer, which the bank now owns.
Among those expected to look closely at the two banks are other large European banking companies that want to create pan-European institutions. Banque National de Paris has already swapped 10 percent of its stock with Dresdner Bank of Germany. And Credit Lyonnais has aggressively sought international acquisitions, including buying 50.01 percent of Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft in Germany last December.
All of the French banks, however, have found their expansion limited because state ownership has kept them from raising capital by selling stock.
Rhone-Poulenc S.A., the world's seventh-largest chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, is also expected to be among the first companies to be privatized.
Investors were disappointed by Rhone-Poulenc's 1992 results -- it had $15.4 billion in sales -- which the company said were hurt by the recession in Europe. But it is developing some promising new drugs, including Taxotere for ovarian cancer, said Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Drug Research.
Its American holdings include 68 percent of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a publicly traded drug maker, and Rhone-Poulenc Inc., a wholly owned chemicals company.
The French Government owns 43 percent of the 56.9 million Rhone shares outstanding, Government-controlled banks and insurance companies have 19 percent and 38 percent is publicly held.
As for Elf Aquitaine, it is considered a strong company with a tradition of technical proficiency that has enabled it to become a significant force in energy exploration in Africa and northern Europe. The company has been willing to take risks, putting much of its future exploration effort in Russia.
"It's a very good oil company," said Bernie Picchi, oil analyst for Kidder, Peabody. "It's had a terrific track record in finding oil and gas in West Africa, the Middle East and the North Sea."
It is also on the way to becoming a large force in distributing gasoline in eastern Germany by planning one of the largest refineries in Europe.
But some analysts are concerned that it is moving too aggressively. Frank Knuettel, an oil analyst at Prudential, said that while Elf looks attractive in the long term, it may not be moving as cautiously as it should.
 
Need for 'Decentralization'
 "The world economy is evolving," Edmond Alphandery, who took over as France's Economy Minister less than two months ago, said today. "We recognize that a modern and competitive economy depends on decentralization of management decision making."
But it is also no secret that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur sees the privatizations as the best way to raise tens of billions of dollars to reduce the budget deficit and revive economic growth. The conservative Government is in a hurry to show results before the scheduled presidential elections in 1995.
On Tuesday, Mr. Balladur announced plans to issue $7.25 billion worth of state bonds to stimulate employment and tide the Government over until the privatization revenues start to flow. Bond holders will then have the option of exchanging their bonds for shares in privatized companies.
The Paris Bourse barely reacted to today's news, with the CAC-40 index dropping just 0.66 point, or three-hundredths of a percent, to 1,890.43. But the Government hopes recent cuts in interest rates will encourage the French to shift some savings to the stock market in anticipation of the privatizations. Mr. Alphandery said a new poll showed 14 percent of the French would consider buying shares in privatized companies.
 
Criticized by Mitterrand
 President Francois Mitterrand, whose Socialist Party was swept out of office in general elections in late March, immediately raised objections to the privatization plan. His spokesman quoted him telling a Cabinet meeting before the announcement that "in the nation's interests" some companies should remain in state hands. Several of the concerns now to be privatized were nationalized soon after he took office in 1981.
Between 1986 and 1988, Mr. Mitterrand was able to slow the privatization program of the former Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, by refusing to sign a decree and forcing the Government to seek parliamentary approval. After only eight big privatizations, the program was cut short by a stock market collapse late in 1987 and the defeat of the conservatives in elections in 1988.
Mr. Balladur, however, who managed the last privatization as Economy Minister under Mr. Chirac, now plans first to send a bill to the parliament, where conservatives hold more than 80 percent of seats and quick approval is assured. Among the 21 companies named today are 12 that Mr. Chirac had listed for privatization when the conservatives were last in office.
Mr. Alphandery said that while in the late 1980's foreign ownership was limited to 20 percent of privatized companies, no such limit would apply this time. But he said the Government would retain what he called a "golden share" in some companies in order to influence key decisions.
Under the new law to be sent to the National Assembly in June, the Government will be required to approve any holdings larger than 5 percent in privatized companies in the health, security and military industries. It will also be able to name two nonvoting members to the boards of privatized companies, he added.
Mr. Alphandery, who disclosed no timetable for the sales, said that an independent privatization commission, which will probably be named late in June, will determine the market value of the companies. The first list of companies to be privatized will be announced shortly, he noted.
Many of those named today, among them Air France, Aerospatiale, Usinor-Sacilor, Credit Lyonnais and Groupe Bull, recorded heavy losses last year and may need restructuring before their shares can be floated. Even Mr. Alphandery acknowledged today that some companies were less than attractive.
The state will continue to control four large public utilities -- France Telecom, French Railways, Electricite de France and Gaz de France.

HEADLINE: Clinton Budget Strains At House's Short Leash

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Spring is here, the budget is on the House floor, and elected representatives are pontificating, cutting back-room deals, plying and being plied by lobbyists and angling for their hometowns.
Simply put, they are conducting the political equivalent of what any hog farmer would immediately identify as a good warm-weather roll in the slop. 
 A few hundred yards down the hall, in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats are narrowing their differences on campaign finance roughly as fast as wind erodes mountains. In the House, where President Clinton's own party is in a tug-of-war over his fiscal agenda, lawmakers are so many atoms in a heated vessel, combining and splitting and throwing off energy each time their political interests collide with those of their rivals.
"We've got 98 percent of what this damned thing is going to look like, so it's doable," Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, one of the House's more experienced and liberal Democrats, said of the budget negotiations.
But it is not done, the vote is hours away, and the pungent odor of deals being cut is in the air. "This," Mr. Frank said, "is what politics is all about."
The House is a rowdy place, thanks to the nation's founders. They deliberately made the House larger and more immediately answerable to the public than the more sedate and removed Senate. And so many Democrats who otherwise would cast a vote to help out the new fellow in the White House are looking out first for their own political interests and, by implication, those of the people who voted for them.
The strains are evident among freshmen Democrats. Many of them rode into office not so much on Mr. Clinton's coattails as on the back bumper of the populist movement that Ross Perot whipped up and Mr. Clinton attached himself to. Some replaced Republicans or come from nominally conservative districts. Some ran on platforms of opposing new taxes, and now they are being asked to approve $250 billion in new taxes.
Many are nervous, which is why the President took pains on Monday to invite the freshmen to the White House as a separate group for one of the backbone-strengthening sessions he has been conducting lately.
"President Clinton is asking us to go out on a limb, and he says 'Don't worry, I'll be out there with you,' " said Representative Jane Harman, a freshman Democrat from a comparatively conservative California district. "But the question that does at least cross my mind is whether the limb is going to break and fall off."
Ms. Harman backed Mr. Clinton's effort that failed earlier this spring to spend $19 billion on an economic stimulus package of jobs and public works projects, and she says she regards his budget as "a basically sound package." But she is not unhappy that more conservative Democrats are trying to saddle the budget plan with new restraints to limit the growth of the Federal deficit.
"My constituents are keenly interested in deficit reduction," she said. "We support change, as long as it's fair, and we'll take our portion of the pain. But we insist on real deficit reduction and spending cuts first."
Asked whether her constituents believe the budget offers that, she replied, "They're unsure."
Another freshman Democrat, Representative Scotty Baesler, replaced a Republican member who had ruled his central Kentucky district for 16 years, and he has been personally wooed by Mr. Clinton to back the budget. "But as of 7:29 P.M., I'm voting no," he said tonight.
Mr. Baesler said his tobacco-farming constituents were already bracing for a cigarette tax to finance Mr. Clinton's health-care plan, and he was unwilling to burden them further. Beyond that, he said he felt that the White House plan did not reflect the "political climate" in which he and many other freshman came to power.
"Ten or 15 I talked to," he said. "We all have the same views. We were elected saying Democrats need a little more conservative approach, not tax and spend. Me, I think we need to get the ratio of cuts to taxes much better than it is now."
 
Budget Cuts Worry Some
 Perhaps Mr. Clinton could ease the tax-and-spending fears of conservatives and moderates easily enough. But at the other end of the Democratic spectrum, equally answerable to their constituents, are lawmakers whose poor urban and rural districts are most dependent on Federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps that the new taxes are intended to finance in part.
Having already lost a chance at the jobs and other aid Mr. Clinton promised in his stimulus package, they are adamant that health-care and welfare spending not be restrained to placate the party's more comfortable elements. They are led by the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus, groups that have signaled before that they wanted more attention.
The President offered it today, calling in the Black Caucus to urge that they compromise with conservatives on a proposal to offset increases in health-care and welfare spending with cuts elsewhere in the budget. If they were much moved, it is not yet evident: the two sides were still at loggerheads as the House worked late into the night.
"Nobody is in love with this thing," Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, the caucus chairman, said of the budget proposal. "It's an ugly child in many respects. But we're working, because we have to do something."

HEADLINE: U.S. Blacks and Africans Seek Stronger Ties

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIBREVILLE, Gabon, May 26

 BODY:
"Africa is open for business," Mohammed Fall Ainina, the Mauritanian Ambassador to the United States, told a group of black Americans meeting here this week, "and the first people we're going to seek business from are you."
Mr. Ainina's remarks summed up an important goal of the second African/ African-American Summit: to encourage business between blacks on both continents. And increasingly, sponsors of the conference say, black Americans are beginning to compete with businesses from the former colonial powers of Europe. 
 To drive that point home, Mr. Ainina announced that Mauritania, a former French colony in West Africa, had granted an offshore fishing license to a group headed by Mervyn M. Dymally, a former Democratic Congressman from California, the first such contract granted to a black American. Just a few years ago such a deal would have been virtually unthinkable because France had a virtual lock on the economic life of its former possession.
The four-day conference, with nearly 1,000 Americans and about 3,500 Africans, was said to be the largest of its kind ever. Among Americans attending were the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young, Coretta Scott King, Louis Farrakhan, Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia and the actress Cicely Tyson.
The first such meeting, sponsored by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, head of the International Foundation for Educational Self-Help in Phoenix, was held two years ago in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Mr. Sullivan is best known for devising a code of conduct in 1977 for American corporations doing business in South Africa. He was also in the forefront of those who encouraged corporations to divest themselves of interests there.
But while many Americans at Abidjan said that the meeting there helped them connect emotionally with their ancestral homeland, many Africans at that meeting complained that it had accomplished little of substance. "Many of us who attended the Abidjan conference expected to come away with some solid financial commitments," said a Nigerian businessman, "but all they got was a lot of rhetoric from black preachers about returning to their roots. It was nice to hear, but it didn't put any money in our pockets."
Many here hope the Libreville meeting will go beyond fiery Afrocentric language, a point made in a speech by Mr. Jackson, who said African nations too often ignore black Americans when offering business opportunities. "We have to move to a level beyond romance, to finance, beyond causes, to contracts," he said.
Mr. Jackson noted that African nations often depend upon the 40-member Congressional Black Caucus to lobby for aid from the United States.
One of the best-attended meetings was a prayer breakfast featuring Mr. Farrakhan, the Black Muslim leader. Mr. Farrakhan, citing the example of Israel, said black Americans should also be able to form a country of their own on the African continent, and said he plans to ask African leaders to "carve out a territory for all people in the diaspora."
He said black Americans should also be granted dual citizenship by all African countries. "We want dual citizenship," he said, "and because we don't know where we came from, we want dual citizenship everywhere."
While Mr. Sullivan's concept has, by and large, run smoothly, it is not without critics. One question is why, as more African countries become multi-party democracies, the conference is being held in Gabon, which has been under the one-party rule of President Omar Bongo since 1967.
In September 1990, Gabon held its first multi-party elections, but they were marred by widespread violence and charges that the voting was rigged in favor of Mr. Bongo.
Makau Matua, head of the human rights project at the Harvard Law School, described Mr. Bongo as "one of the longest-serving despots that the continent has produced."
Asked about such criticism, Mr. Sullivan said: "I wouldn't say they're inaccurate. But that's a political judgment and I'm not a politican." Nonetheless, he added, "I'm encouraged that democratization will be coming."

HEADLINE: Florio Replaces Aide Who Left Amid Inquiry

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 26

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio appointed a new chief of staff who has both governmental and political credentials today to replace the longtime confidante who left the post in the midst of an investigation into possible improper steering of state bond business.
Richard L. Wright, an associate state treasurer, will preside over an administration buffeted by the resignation Tuesday of Joseph C. Salema, who has been subpoenaed in a multistate Federal investigation involving New Jersey Turnpike bonds. 
 In an interview, Mr. Wright, who immediately assumed the duties of chief of staff, said he intended no major shake-ups. "I don't think it will be any different from the way Joe did it," he said, which he said was largely a matter of "establishing a mood, establishing a theme, deciding what our goal is."
For Mr. Salema, the major goal was the political rehabilitation of Mr. Florio in the wake of the record tax increase he pushed through the Legislature in 1990, causing his popularity ratings to plummet.
The abrupt departure of Mr. Salema this week left a considerable vacuum in both the State House and the Governor's re-election campaign. In accepting Mr. Salema's resignation, Mr. Florio acquiesced to entreaties from aides to shield himself and his campaign from Republican attacks on Mr. Salema, whose bond company is at the center of an investigation into whether it improperly benefited from state bond deals.
 
Political Role Unclear
 Mr. Wright said in the interview that he was not sure how much of the political dimension of Mr. Salema's job he would inherit.
"I just don't know," he said. "My relationship with the Governor has been in the area of economic development, which is the absolute critical issue of our time."
That fits with the Governor's political agenda, which in addition to overcoming the onus of having raised taxes, is to take the state out of the economic doldrums that have plagued it for three years, with unemployment, at about 9 percent, a particular problem.
The new chief of staff also said he was not sure how he would divide political responsibilities with his former boss, Douglas Berman, now a consultant to the Florio campaign, at a salary of $25,000 a month.
The 50-year-old Mr. Wright has had a brief brush with an ethics inquiry of his own. As associate treasurer he took part in awarding a lease for space for a state agency in a building partly owned by a Camden County Democratic leader in the Legislature who was reprimanded for failing to properly disclose his interest in the building.
In a deposition before the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards, which held hearings into the leasing arrangement in May 1992, Mr. Wright said that he was unaware at the time the lease was signed in January 1992 that one owner of the building in Cherry Hill was Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant, then majority leader of the Assembly.
Mr. Wright testified that when he discovered the ownership interest, he inquired and found that there were no conflicts with state policy. No improprieties were found on Mr. Wright's part, but Gov. Florio subsequently issued an executive order barring the state from leasing from members of the Legislature.
In the interview today, Mr. Wright reiterated that he did not know of Mr. Bryant's involvement when the lease was negotiated.
Mr. Wright, a Princeton graduate who received a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley, worked as executive director of Amnesty International, as an aide in the United States Department of Energy and on the Presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968. He was the campaign manager for Carol Bellamy in her 1972 New York State Senate campaign and was director of development for the National Committee for an Effective Congress in 1976.

HEADLINE: Joseph Pulitzer Jr. Is Dead at 80; Publisher Was Avid Art Collector

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing Company and owner of one of the world's finest collections of modern art, died yesterday at his home in the Central West End of St. Louis. He was 80.
Mr. Pulitzer died of colon cancer, the publishing company said in a news release. 
 Tall, elegant and reserved, Mr. Pulitzer had, for the last seven years, served primarily as chairman of Pulitzer Publishing, which owns three newspapers, seven television stations and two radio stations. He had led Pulitzer Publishing and its flagship publication, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for 38 years, serving for 31 of those years as editor and publisher of the newspaper.
Mr. Pulitzer relinquished his positions with the paper in 1986 to devote his attention to the company, which went public that year. From 1955 to 1986, he served as chairman of the board of the Pulitzer Prizes, the highest awards in journalism, which were established by his grandfather.
 
Avid Collector of Art
 Though principally identified with journalism, Mr. Pulitzer was widely recognized for the art collection he began as a student at Harvard University, a collection that ultimately became one of the most important and generously shared in the world.
Art News magazine called Mr. Pulitzer's acquisitions "one of the most brilliant and comprehensive collections of modern art in the country," and John Russell of The New York Times described it as "one of the most discriminating" in the nation, saying it was "as remarkable for range as for quality."
Born on May 13, 1913, Mr. Pulitzer was baptized in the Episcopal Church as Joseph Pulitzer 3d, but he later adopted the junior designation, which his father had dropped after the death of the first Joseph Pulitzer.
Mr. Pulitzer graduated from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Mass., in 1932, and went on to earn his bachelor's degree in fine art from Harvard in 1936. His newspaper career began with a stint as a cub reporter for The San Francisco News in 1935, the summer before his senior year at Harvard. After graduating, he joined The Post-Dispatch news staff and helped cover the Roosevelt-Landon campaign of 1936.
 
'Illuminate Dark Places'
 Over the next 20 years, he worked in every department of the paper, including periods as editor of the daily magazine and editor of the Sunday rotogravure, or pictorial. In 1948, he became associate editor, a position he held until he became editor and publisher on the father's death in 1955.
In an editorial he wrote on the day he took over the paper, a week after his father's death, Mr. Pulitzer pledged that The Post-Dispatch would maintain its tradition as one of the nation's great crusading papers. "We will not only report the day's news but illuminate dark places, and, with a deep sense of responsibility, interpret these troublous times," he wrote.
At the time, besides the newspaper, Pulitzer holdings included only a radio and television station in St. Louis. But under Joseph Jr.'s guidance, the company bought The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson and The Southtown Economist in Chicago, six other television stations and another radio station.
In 1986, the Pulitzer company faced its greatest financial challenge. It had accrued a large debt, and a group of dissident relatives who owned stock in the privately owned company found a buyer, A. Alfred Taubman, a Michigan real estate developer, who offered $625 million for the company. The company successfully resisted the takeover bid, going public with the stock in order to offset its debt.
In 1989, the company faced another challenge when Ralph Ingersoll 2d began publishing The St. Louis Sun. Although that newspaper failed after only seven months, its presence spurred the staid Post-Dispatch to improve its coverage.
 
A Litany of Firsts
 During Mr. Pulitzer's tenure as editor, The Post-Dispatch won five Pulitzers, including prizes for commentary and editorial cartooning. In 1987, Mr. Pulitzer received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, citing his "extraordinary services to American journalism and letters."
The Post-Dispatch was one of the first newspapers in the country to oppose the war in Vietnam, and it was also one of the first to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the war.
It was also the first paper in the country to replace the old letter-press printing process with offset cold-type printing, which allowed high-quality color printing. "Color was of special interest to an art connoisseur like Mr. Pulitzer," the company's statement yesterday said, "and at his insistence The Post-Dispatch moved early into color publication."
 
Hobby Became a Passion
 Mr. Pulitzer's art collecting began simply enough in 1936 when as an undergraduate he bought Modigliani's "Elvira Resting at a Table." Three years later, at an auction in Lucerne, Switzerland, he bought "Bathers With a Turtle," by Matisse for $2,400, a piece that is now easily worth 10,000 times that amount.
Mr. Pulitzer's father had no enthusiasm for modern art and sometimes took his friends into his son's room to ridicule the purchases. "He was convinced that I had been fleeced by shrewd and unscrupulous New York dealers," Mr. Pulitzer said in a speech earlier this year.
Later, when his father realized the value of his collection and asked where he learned so much about art, Mr. Pulitzer told him that the knowledge had been acquired at Harvard and that the elder Pulitzer had footed the bill.
The Pulitzer Collection came to include 86 pieces, all of which were shown at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988. The collection could have included Picasso's seminal work "Demoiselles d'Avignon," but Mr. Pulitzer had bought it before World War II and then donated it to the Museum of Modern Art.
Mr. Pulitzer always insisted on anonymity when lending his works to museums.
His collection included Vuillard's "Self Portrait," and "Head of a Man" by Degas, one of Monet's "Water Lilies," as well as works by Braque, Picasso and Miro.
Mr. Pulitzer's first wife, Louise Vauclain, died in 1968. He married again in 1973, to the former Emily S. Rauh, who at the time was curator of the St. Louis Art Museum.
He is survived by his son, Joseph Pulitzer 4th; his half brother, Michael of St. Louis, two sisters, Kate Davis Quesada of Hobe Sound, Fla., and Elinor Hempelmann of Rochester, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Go to Vietnam Memorial Despite Protest

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The White House announced today that President Clinton would deliver remarks at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Monday, despite the risk that the visit could revive the debate over his draft record, which dogged his campaign.
Administration officials said the White House had received postcards from veterans as part of what the officials called an organized protest. The veterans charged that Mr. Clinton would "engage in hypocrisy" if he visited the memorial. 
 But the officials said it was important for the President to go forward with his plans for Memorial Day, which also include a breakfast with veterans and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery.
"He's aware of the protests, of course," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said: "He is the President of all the people. He believes it's important to show his respect for the veterans who served in all our wars, and that's exactly why he's going to go."
Some White House officials said Mr. Clinton had decided to make the visit to silence public doubts about his mettle as Commander in Chief and to divert attention from the controversies that had consumed the White House for several days.
 
Distractions Keep Mounting
 But as Mr. Clinton sought to make an all-out push in the House for his economic program today, the White House faced a fresh round of distractions: more assaults by Ross Perot, questions about Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, who suggested that the United States might have to retreat from its past leadership role, and even complaints by a New Hampshire news anchor, who said she had been asked to apply makeup to the President's face before she interviewed him.
Mr. Perot, in a television interview taped on Tuesday, attacked Mr. Clinton with relish about the dismissal of the White House travel staff and about the expensive haircut that the President got aboard Air Force One as the plane sat on the runway at Los Angeles International Airport last week.
"What we have here is a person who does not have the background or experience for the most difficult job in the world, which we, the American people, have elected him to fill," Mr. Perot said. "If you were interviewing him for your company, and you had a medium-sized company, you wouldn't consider giving him a job anywhere above middle management."
In an Interview for the PBS program "Talking with David Frost," Mr. Perot said the President was "still doing things the Arkansas way, like trying to give the travel business as a political payoff."
 
Leadership 'Undiminished'
 Asked to respond, Mr. Clinton said, "Well, we know he doesn't like my state, but he spent several million dollars to bad-mouth it last year, but that doesn't have much to do with America."
In another effort to tamp down potentially damaging comments, Secretary of State Warren Christopher distanced the Administration from Mr. Tarnoff's assertions about a weakened leadership role for this country. Mr. Tarnoff had spoken to reporters at a Tuesday lunch on background, a common Washington practice meaning they had agreed to identify him only as a senior official. No reporter from The New York Times attended the lunch, but the source of the remark became known around Washington within hours.
"I think the U.S. responsibility for leadership is undiminished in this new post-cold-war period," Mr. Christopher said in an interview today, adding that the aide's remarks were "inconsistent with my policy and the President's policy."
Ms. Myers also said that White House officials had apologized to Nanette Hansen, the anchorwoman of WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H.. She said she had been asked by a White House aide to apply the President's makeup because no make-up person was available.

HEADLINE: Old Tactics Shadow Ex-Florio Aide;
Revolving-Door Politics Lead to Enrichment, and a Liability

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
Those who have followed the rise to power of Jim Florio and his longtime lieutenant, Joseph C. Salema Jr., say clues to their considerable success were evident in their Camden County origins. There, they say, a pattern was established that the pair carried 35 miles up Interstate 295 to the capital in Trenton.
Mr. Florio, as the governor of New Jersey, has continued to pursue the liberal agenda and calculating, tough-minded political style that served him well as the Congressman representing the Camden area. 
 But in the case of Mr. Salema, the pattern was prospering at the intersection of business and politics. He has earned a small fortune in the arena where governments make choices that determine who gets public contracts worth millions of dollars. It is an arena where some say political judgment is paramount, others say raw political contacts.
For the second time in their political partnership, Mr. Salema has become a liability for Mr. Florio, who is locked in a difficult re-election campaign. On Tuesday, after weeks of pressure generated by a Federal investigation into possible paybacks by Wall Street investment bankers to obtain a larger share of public bond offerings, he resigned as Mr. Florio's chief of staff.
In the early 1980's while Mr. Florio was serving in Congress, Mr. Salema ran Mr. Florio's home district and helped bring into public service a cluster of Florio proteges who came to control most of the county government.
These self-styled reformers had brains and vitality. They mapped plans to modernize 19th-century water and sewer systems and other public works, and ordered the design of plants to meet new environmental standards.
But by 1984, Mr. Salema and another trusted lieutenant, Nicholas Rudi Jr., began cashing in on their political careers. They resigned from government to become partners in a management and financial consultant business that was quickly hired to advise county departments and agencies they had once ruled. The pair became wealthy, critics claimed, by using their ties to Mr. Florio to attract bond underwriters, lawyers and others who wanted to do business in Camden County.
Outside of being brought in as a partner in two real estate deals arranged by Consolidated Financial's partners, in which he made no investment of cash, Mr. Florio apparently did not personally benefit from their soaring success.
Mr. Salema and Mr. Rudi have declined to discuss their early days, having referred all questions to their lawyers. An aide said Mr. Florio did not want to comment further about his chief of staff's business dealings.
 
Political Loyalty, Financial Rewards
When the propriety of his proteges' activities was questioned, Mr. Florio returned their loyalty, saying they were smart, ambitious and broke no laws.
Mr. Salema and Mr. Rudi left government at a time when sky-high interest rates, which had discouraged bond offerings and created a huge backlog of financing needs, were starting to tumble from the levels of the early 1980's.The eventual decline also created a welcome opportunity to refinance existing bonds and thereby save localities millions of dollars in lower interest payments.
The intertwining of politics and public bond issues has been a powerful part of state government for years, with both Democrats and Republicans receiving millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Wall Street investment houses and politically connected law firms.
"Bond sales are the new political patronage," said Ed McCool, director of Common Cause of New Jersey, a good-government advocacy group.
Mr. Salema had first worked in 1972 for Mr. Florio, then a legislator making an unsuccessful attempt to win the First Congressional District, which embraces the broken port city of Camden across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Two years later, when Mr. Florio was elected to Congress, Mr. Salema managed the campaign.
 
A Reform Slate, New Political Muscle
By that time, the county Democratic machine was under the thrall of Angelo J. Errichetti, the street-tough and engaging Mayor of Camden, and James E. Joyce, the county Democratic leader. Local politics, Mr. Florio said later, was "a cesspool."
Mr. Florio, finding an ally in Lewis Katz, then the Democratic leader in Cherry Hill, a sprawing suburb outside Camden, offered a reform slate in the 1979 election that defeated the machine's candidates, emerging with political muscle stripped from the bosses.
Mr. Rudi, who worked in Bill Bradley's successful campaign for the United States Senate in 1978, entered the picture in 1980. He served as treasurer for Mr. Florio's first campaign for governor in 1981, a contest he narrowly lost to Thomas H. Kean, a Republican. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Rudi impressed Mr. Florio with his financial acumen and was installed as chief administrator and treasurer of Camden County.
From most accounts, the team was scandal-free. It operated a progressive administration that tried to grapple with Camden's dire social and economic problems and the burgeoning growth of the rest of the county.
"There was a feeling that while Jim Florio was building power in the suburbs he and his team never went after money for themselves," said the Rev. Michael Doyle, a Roman Catholic priest in a squalid ward of South Camden for the last 17 years.
Yet at the same time, Mr. Rudi looked upon government as a stepping stone to business success. "I was interested in developing contacts," he said about his public service career.
 
From Public Arena To Private Sector
That time came in 1984 when falling interest rates were encouraging many municipalities and public agencies to issue bonds to refinance debt or to raise capital for roads, bridges and other public works. Mr. Rudi opened a firm called Consolidated Financial Management, with Mr. Salema as half-owner.
Mr. Salema also left the government payroll, first as an executive in Mr. Katz's string of South Jersey banks, First Peoples, but in 1985 he joined Mr. Rudi as a full-time partner. They brought into the firm Brenda J. Bacon, a former county freeholder and a Florio protege, and Mr. Salema's sister, Roberta Acampora, who had previously been the county finance director.
In the meantime, another Florio political insider, Steven D. Weinstein resigned as chief county counsel and opened a Camden area branch of a prominent Philadelphia law firm, Blank Rome Comisky & McCauley, that was hoping to expand into counseling work in southern New Jersey.
By coincidence or design, Mr. Florio's inner circle now was in a position to take advantage of the building projects they had helped conceive as public servants and to share in the millions of dollars in fees and commissions associated with them.
Consolidated Financial Management was awarded contracts to serve as financial adviser to Camden County and the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority. And Mr. Weinstein's Philadelphia firm was appointed bond and special litigation counsel for the utilities authority, producing $600,000 for the firm in the next two years and spinning off contracts with other Democratic-controlled public agencies.
About the same time Mr. Weinstein's Philadelphia law firm became a big contributor to Mr. Florio's 1984 re-election fund with 45 of its lawyers giving a total of $25,870, according to published reports.
And the firm owned by Mr. Salema and Mr. Rudi was earning consulting fees that often amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"They feasted on the power, all these bright young hotshots who had kicked out the old regime and were now making millions from the new regime," said John Kolesar, former managing editor of The Camden Courier Post which in 1987 ran a series of articles on how revolving-door politics enriched the business partners.
 
Devising a Plan And Profiting Later
Those who watched them operate said that Mr. Rudi was a financial whiz who could package complicated deals and that Mr. Salema was a master of politics who could cut through official paperwork and make things happen fast.
Under Consolidated Financial Management's guidance, the Municipal Utilities Authority issued more than $1 billion in bonds to build water and sewer systems. Mr. Salema and Mr. Rudi picked up public clients in neighboring Gloucester and Burlington Counties, parts of which were within Mr. Florio's Congressional District. They also used their growing expertise, and political contacts established in Mr. Florio's 1991 gubernatorial race, to win no-bid contracts in northern New Jersey.
A look at how the partners profited from a plan they helped devise while still in county government, as recounted in The Courier-Post, is representative of how they operated.
In the early 1980's county officials began to lay the groundwork for several capital projects to address water, sewer and pollution-control needs. After Mr. Rudi and Mr. Salema left government, they were hired as financial advisers for several of the projects, including an innovative "trash-to-steam" resource-recovery plant. The Pollution Control Financing Authority, which the county created on their advice, issued $108 million in bonds needed to build the plant. Consolidated Financial Management received a fee of $176,000.
Meanwhile, a county freeholder who was a regular contributor to Mr. Florio's campaigns received an $80,000 retainer to negotiate a contract between the authority and the company chosen to operate the plant. The New York underwriting firm of Bear Stearns, which contributed $3,000 to a "better government" committee that Mr. Salema controlled, was tapped as the non-bid seller of the bonds, at a fee estimated at $1 million. The engineering firm hired without bids to design the plan, for a fee of some $500,000, donated $2,000 to the county Democrats and $2,500 to the same "better government" panel.
Reports of these dealings raised questions about Mr. Salema, who was kept in the background during Mr. Florio's 1989 race for governor. For the first time since 1974 he did not manage a Florio campaign.
 
A Distress Signal, Inner Circle Reunites
It didn't matter. Mr. Florio trounced the Republican candidate, James A. Courter, by a wide margin. By the dawn of 1990, Mr. Florio moved into the state house in Trenton. Mr. Salema and Mr. Rudi formed a new enterprise, Armacon Securities, licensed to buy new bond issues and resell them to the public.
But before it could get rolling in mid-1990 the Governor sent out a distress signal to Mr. Salema. The new administration had run into a political firestorm in its first months over a $2.8 billion tax package, and Mr. Florio wanted his former aide to take over the role of chief of staff.
Mr. Salema accepted the post, placing his assets in a blind trust, rejoining the Governor and Ms. Bacon, the Florio aide who had resigned her executive vice president's job with Consolidated Financial Management to become Mr. Florio's director of planning. The former business partners constituted the Governor's new inner circle, barely changed from the Congressional days.
Bonds issues boomed, a result of declining interest rates that made it good policy to refinance existing bonds at favorable rates.
In New Jersey the growth was explosive.
After averaging 300-plus issues from all sources in the years 1985-90, with total value of $3 billion to $4 billion, the numbers jumped to 539 issues with a value of $10.8 billion in 1991, and 623 issues with a value of $13.6 billion in 1992.
In that period, Consolidated Financial Management catapulted from nowhere to take the No. 1 ranking among the top consultants for state and municipal bonds in New Jersey, handling 98 issues representing more than $3 billion in value, according to Securities Data, a Wall Street research company.
Meanwhile, the late starter Armacon earned more than $1 million fees in 14 bond issues, a performance that Wall Street executives now say largely reflected efforts by established underwriting firms to sow good will with the smaller firm and its influential founders.
Mr. Weinstein, the lawyer friend of Mr. Rudi and Mr. Salema from the old days in Camden, complained that they were getting a raw deal in the attention being paid to Armacon.
"A great injustice is being done," he said in a telephone interview before Mr. Salema resigned. "It is just another disincentive for talented people to come into government, work hard, and then pay the price later by being labeled as trading on their political connections."

HEADLINE: Overstepped Bounds: An Empire Under Scrutiny -- A special report;
Fed Inquiry: An Arkansas Family

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
A powerful business empire with close links to the Clinton White House is under investigation by the Federal Reserve, an inquiry that has opened the fiercely private business group to unusual scrutiny.
The civil inquiry into holdings of the Stephens family of Arkansas has already uncovered information that could prove embarrassing to the family's companies, a White House lawyer and government regulators. 
 While there have been no suggestions that anyone -- at the White House or elsewhere -- has asked for special treatment in this case, the matter is clearly politically sensitive and has attracted the attention of top officials at the Fed, including the chairman, Alan Greenspan. And in the coming weeks, they must decide how vigorously to pursue the inquiry.
 
Family Control at Issue
 The issue in question is the extent of the family's control and ownership of two banks, the First National Bank in Stuttgart, Ark., and the Worthen Banking Corporation, the state's largest bank company, and whether the relationships violate laws to limit concentrations of financial power.
There are differences within the Fed on whether it was too quick to resolve one violation in the mildest way possible, as well as on how vigorously to pursue the questions that remain, according to officials at other agencies who asked not to be identified. None of the Fed's top officials have been appointed by the Clinton Administration.
The Fed has already determined that the Stephens holdings violate a Depression-era law that prohibits people who control securities firms from owning more than 50 percent of banks. The violation, which carries potential fines and the threat of embarrassing public disclosure, involves the family's ownership of more than half the shares of the bank in Stuttgart, a small but important corner of the sprawling Stephens financial empire.
Rather than levying a fine or bringing a formal enforcement action, the Fed has suggested that the bank become a state-chartered bank, according to the Stuttgart bank chairman, Harry Erwin, thus allowing it to avoid future Federal scrutiny. At a closed meeting three months ago, two members of the Fed's board of governors favored tougher enforcement, but Mr. Greenspan and four other members backed the milder course, according to officials at other agencies.
Interviews with bankers and former Stephens associates and documents show that representatives of Stephens Inc. and the Stuttgart bank failed to disclose to the Government the full extent of the family's ownership and control of the Stuttgart bank. These incomplete disclosures helped convince regulators that the family's holdings were permissible.
The incomplete disclosures also allowed the family to exercise control over the Stuttgart bank for more than a decade -- a relationship that allowed the securities firm and the Stephens family to profit from dealings with the bank, according to former officials of the bank.
William H. Kennedy 3d, now associate White House counsel and formerly a Little Rock lawyer who headed Hillary Rodham Clinton's law firm, filed one of the documents that gave incomplete information about the Stephens holdings in the bank in 1984. A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Kennedy would not comment on the Stephens case, or his role in it, because of the attorney-client privilege.
But David Knight, a lawyer with the Stephens firm, said that the family did not agree with the Fed's findings that it had more than 50 percent ownership in the Stuttgart bank, arguing that some of the family's trusts are independent and should not be counted.
 
Cooperating With Regulators
 Nonetheless, he said they and the bank were cooperating with regulators to resolve the matter. Mr. Knight also said that the omission of some of the Stephens bank holdings on the 1984 document stemmed from a legal "misunderstanding" of disclosure requirements by the lawyer handling the application. Mr. Knight said the Stephenses would have no other comment because of the pending inquiry.
As for Worthen, in which family members own more than a fourth of the stock, the Fed is trying to determine whether the Stephens Group, the family's holding company, exercises a controlling influence in the bank, according to Worthen officials. In addition, the Fed has subpoenaed stock trade records to see whether Stephens Inc., a brokerage firm, dominates the market for the bank's stock, an inquiry that could be complicated by a maze of offshore accounts, according to bankers.
Last March, the Fed approved Worthen's acquisition of another Arkansas bank despite reservations by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which has oversight for Arkansas and wanted any approval to await the completion of the inquiry, according to officials at other agencies.
 
The Empire
Big in Arkansas And Elsewhere
 The Stephens Group is at the center of a multibillion-dollar empire, including Stephens Inc., one of the largest brokerage firms outside New York City. The family-owned empire stretches to the Middle East and Asia, with holdings that include a waste incinerator in Massachusetts, the nation's largest nursing home operator, real estate developments in the Midwest and South, oil and gas, a savings and loan in New Mexico, an insurance company, a nationwide group of manufacturing companies and a management company for entertainers like Burt Reynolds.
The name Stephens is virtually synonymous with the economy of Arkansas, where the family owns a large chunk of more than a dozen banks, the most exclusive hotel in Little Rock and the building that houses Bill Clinton's Arkansas office.
Jackson T. Stephens, the laconic family patriarch, is comfortable amid national establishment institutions like the Augusta National golf club, where he is chairman of the Masters golf tournament. He owns an apartment in the Sea View hotel in Bal Harbour, Fla., an oceanfront watering hole for political heavyweights like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and the former Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. And for decades he has maintained close ties to Presidential administrations of both political parties.
But never has the nexus between the Stephenses and Washington been as tight as it is now. No group raised more money for the nascent Clinton Presidential campaign. The Worthen National Bank, whose ties to the Stephenses are part of the Fed investigation, lent more than $2 million to the campaign when it was on the ropes.
 
The Investigation
St. Louis Fed Initiates Inquiry
 It was an examination last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis of Worthen and its plans to expand that opened the door into the issue of Stephens holdings in the Stuttgart bank. The St. Louis Fed's report helped initiate a formal investigation by the Fed in Washington in an area where it has rarely employed its formal investigative powers.
For years, the Stephens family and officials at the Stuttgart bank promoted a public image of independence from the rest of the Stephens empire. Regulators, relying on these representations and disinclined to investigate, took the same view.
In fact, according to former bank officials and bank records, the bank's operations were quietly directed for more than a decade by W. R. Stephens, known as Witt, who along with his brother, Jackson, built the empire.
Not until March of this year, however, did the Fed decide that "Stephens family members and trust holdings violate the Glass-Steagall Act," the 1933 Federal law, according to Mr. Knight. He said family members and family trusts that control the brokerage firm, Stephens Inc., hold about two-thirds of the stock in the Stuttgart bank.
Family members and family trusts had owned more than half the Stuttgart bank's stock for more than a decade. A 1979 opinion by Bruce Heitz, a lawyer in the Memphis office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another Federal agency that regulates national banks, permitted the Stephens family to increase its holdings in the Stuttgart bank from 49 percent to more than 60 percent.
Mr. Heitz approved the increase in stock ownership because he believed that a family trust for two Stephens daughters that was buying 11 percent of the bank was independent, and that the two owners of the brokerage, Jackson Stephens and his older brother, Witt, while owning 49 percent of the bank's stock, did not try to dominate the bank.
 
Superiors Not Consulted
 That opinion, which Mr. Knight cited to demonstrate his clients' innocence, explains, in part, the Fed's reluctance to take sterner action. But the fact that Fed officials learned about the 1979 letter only recently, is "one of the reasons we have an investigation," said Joseph Coyne, a spokesman for the Fed, who would not comment further.
When Mr. Heitz issued his opinion in 1979, he did not consult his superiors in Washington or fellow regulators at the Fed, which has traditionally been the primary arbiter of the separation of brokerage and banking activities. In addition, he relied largely on information provided by the bank suggesting that the family did not exercise its controlling interest in the Stuttgart bank, according to documents and regulators.
But former officials of the bank suggest that the independence may not have been so real. Wayne Hampton, a Stuttgart rice farmer who served as a director of the bank during the 1970's, said in an interview that Witt Stephens had had him removed from the board. Mr. Hampton said that he, unlike other directors, had refused to support and donate money to a Stephens relative who was running for the Senate in 1978.
"Witt was the boss and I didn't support his nephew and I got my butt kicked off the board," he said.
 
Bank and Brokerage
Influence Reported In Bond Buying
 Mr. Hampton also said the Stephens securities firm controlled the buying of municipal bonds by the bank even though that was the legal responsibility of the bank's directors and no member of the Stephens family served on the board.
"All the board knew about bonds was that a list was sent to us from Little Rock," Mr. Hampton said, adding "we approved, but we had no discretion to choose which bonds to buy. I kind of resented it."
Stephens Inc. has long been the major underwriter and seller of municipal bonds in Arkansas. Competing regional securities firms, in complaints to a reporter and to municipal officials, said they were at a disadvantage because officials at Stephens-owned banks, have helped steer business in several Arkansas cities to the Stephens brokerage firm.
Other former officials of the Stuttgart bank, who asked not to be identified, supported Mr. Hampton's assertion. They also provided other details about Witt Stephens's control of the bank until his death in late 1991, control that sometimes worked to the benefit of the Stephenses and their brokerage firm at the expense of the bank and its customers, the former officials said.
According to these officials, Witt Stephens not only controlled the bank's purchases of bonds but also personally directed, usually by telephone, many of the bank's lending activities, including restrictions on the amount, type and location of loans the bank could make.
One former official recalled that Witt Stephens, after learning in 1988 that the bank had bought bonds from a rival financial institution, ended the practice even though the bank received better terms in its dealings with the third party than it was receiving from Stephens Inc.
Witt Stephens also earned commissions when the bank's trust department bought government bonds with the idle money it had to invest from municipal bonds it was handling for Stephens Inc., according to bankers. The tiny Stuttgart bank, with assets of around $120 million, handled as much as $200 million in Stephens-underwritten municipal bonds in its trust department.
Mr. Erwin, the bank's chairman, said he was unable to talk about the influence of Witt Stephens since he became chairman about the time of Witt's death.
A former Stuttgart bank official said that officials of the bank and Stephens Inc. were concerned that regulators might restrict the dealings between the bank and the brokerage firm. The Fed's first opportunity arose in 1984 when it reviewed an application by the Stephens and other stockholders to form a holding company, Investark Bankshares Inc., to acquire the Stuttgart bank
The application listed Stephens family holdings at 43 percent, when in fact they exceeded 60 percent, according to bankers, documents and Mr. Knight, the Stephens's lawyer. Records show the application was filed by Mr. Kennedy of the Rose firm. The holding company later disclosed in routine filings various Stephens stock holdings totaling well above 50 percent.
 
Issue Quietly Dropped
 An examination of the Stuttgart bank in 1991 by the Federal comptroller raised questions about the bank's ties to Stephens but the issue was quietly dropped, according to regulators and bankers, who say the handling of the 1991 examination is now part of the Fed inquiry.
The Stephenses first acquired stock in Worthen in 1983, after they were rebuffed from buying another Little Rock bank. Their application with the Fed to acquire the stock was handled by lawyers at the Rose firm, including Mr. Kennedy, according to public records. Because Worthen's stock is publicly traded, dealings between the bank and Stephens affiliates are subject to Federal disclosure.
In 1985, when Stephens Inc. underwrote a stock offering designed to help refinance the ailing bank, Worthen's dealings with the Rose firm, Stephens and Stephens' business partners took up several thousand words in the public offering circular.
The offering also said that the Comptroller of the Currency found that some of the transactions involving Stephens-related companies or foreign business associates violated banking laws.
A 1985 letter to Fed lawyers raising questions about the dealings between Stephens affiliates and Worthen received little attention within the Fed but now is receiving more attention in the current investigation.
Curt Bradbury, Worthen's chairman and president and formerly an official of Stephens Inc., denies that the Stephenses have a controlling influence in the bank. Worthen and Stephens Group Inc. have both told the Fed that the company and its subsidiaries "do not and will not exert control over the management or policies of Worthen," Mr. Bradbury said.

Treasury Issues Rally on Note Sale

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes shot higher yesterday afternoon after a surprisingly strong auction of five-year notes.
Traders said the rally, which sent the price of the 30-year bond up a point, was prompted by the strong demand for the 5-year note in the auction and in the trading that followed the announcement of the auction results around 2 P.M. 
 But traders said the jump in prices, which helped pull the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.92 percent from 7 percent Tuesday, did not signal a new direction for the market or indicate that the yield on the long bond was safely below 7 percent again. The yield broke above 7 percent last week and had held at 7 percent or above since Friday.
 
 
'Crazy Market'
 "We're still in a range," said Barbara L. Kenworthy, portfolio manager for taxable fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation. "All we have done is widen the range to 7.125 percent," she said, referring to the fact that the yield on the 30-year bond had popped over 7 percent several times recently.
But she also noted that while the market was stuck in a narrow range, it had remained volatile. "It has been a crazy market," she said, adding that some of the mood swings have been "to the moon."
The prices of other Treasury securities were also up sharply yesterday. The 10-year note rose 20/32 as the yield dropped to 6.08 percent from 6.16 percent. And the yield on the 2-year note auctioned Tuesday was also down sharply. The yield at the auction was 4.17 percent, but it rose to 4.2 percent by the close of trading Tuesday. Yesterday, the price of the new two-year note was up 5/32 as the yield fell to 4.14 percent.
Among the concerns of traders and investors are inflation, a threat that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates to curb rising prices, the performance of the Clinton Administration and the fate of the President's economic program.
Yesterday's durable-goods report for April, which showed no increase after a steep 3.7 percent drop in March, signaled that the economy is still growing sluggishly. If that picture is borne out in the data for May, that should help ease the inflationary fears created by the surprisingly sharp jumps in both the Producer and Consumer Price Indexes for April.
In trading yesterday, the durables report had only a marginal impact when it was released in the morning because traders and investors were waiting for the results of the five-year note auction in the afternoon.
 
 
House Vote
 But the problems in Washington are continuing. While the market was rallying yesterday, traders were talking about the vote in the House of Representatives on the President's economic program that is scheduled for today. Even if the President and the Democratic leadership in the House prevail in a close vote, the deficit reduction plan still faces problems in the Senate, both from Democrats and Republicans.
What happened in the Treasury auction yesterday is that many traders who bid for five-year notes did not get any or as many as they anticipated. Ronald Connors, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns & Company, said that showed that traders were still having problems with the new auction system the Treasury is testing.
Like the two-year note auction Tuesday, the five-year note sale is being conducted under the Treasury experiment with single-price auctions. In these auctions, all securities are awarded at one price and yield rather than the sliding scales in the other Treasury auctions. Prices and yield move in opposite directions, with the yield dropping as the price rises.
The five-year notes were auctioned at a single yield of 5.39 percent. But only 8 percent of the bids were at this level with the rest at a lower yield. Because the yield in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market was 5.4 percent to 5.41 percent at the time of the 1 P.M. bidding deadline, it was clear that a lot of dealers did not get the bonds they wanted.
"Everyone figured they would get their notes at 39 or 40," said Mr. Connors, using market shorthand for bids of 5.39 percent and 5.4 percent.
This left a lot of dealers short of what they needed and set off a scramble for the new notes after the auction. The buying was persistent enough to drive the yield all the way down to 5.29 percent by the close of trading in the when-issued market.
The buying of five-year notes set off buying across the board. As the price of the 30-year bond rose, it broke through some important trading levels, which set off more buying by speculators and investors.
Following are the results of the Treasury's five-year note auction yesterday:

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Orders Were Flat Last Month

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Too much inventory and too little enthusiasm for new investment spending seem to be taking some steam out of the nation's factories, a Government survey shows.
Orders for machinery, transportation equipment and other durable goods were flat in April, failing to recover from a sharp 3.7 percent drop in March, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. And shipments of durable goods actually fell 1.9 percent last month, a big drop. 
 That came as a surprise to economists and investors who had expected orders and shipments to bounce back. The evidence of a stalled economy helped support bond prices, which in turn sent stocks higher.
 
A Low-Gear Recovery
 "These numbers show the crosscurrents in the economic environment between companies' long-term commitment to becoming more competitive and companies' sitting on their hands until the final outcome of the tax battle," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Yesterday's report was the latest to show that the economic expansion is still stuck in low gear. The report dampened inflation fears a bit because it suggested that manufacturers would have trouble making price increases stick because of slack demand. But it stoked worries over production cuts and layoffs in coming months.
Indeed, the backlog of unfilled orders shrank for the second consecutive month, dropping to the lowest level in three and a half years.
"Orders are softening,"said Randall Eberts, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. "We have this inventory overhang, and it hasn't been reflected in production schedules yet. There's going to be an adjustment."
 
Working Off Inventory
 Retailers and distributors got stuck with extra inventories in March when bad weather kept consumers home. Even though retail sales have been perking along since then, the pileup is taking a while to work off.
But economists and executives said the weakness in orders did not point to renewed recession. Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods tend to gyrate from month to month, and preliminary readings are often revised substantially. More important, orders remain at a reasonably high level, 10.4 percent higher this winter and spring than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, April orders were mostly weak across the board. Orders for primary metals fell for the third straight month; orders for transportation equipment slipped for the second straight month, and for the first time in months, orders for computers and office equipment nose dived.
The only gains were reported by makers of military gear, aircraft and electronic components. But, as Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch pointed out, military orders are on a long-term decline and despite the April gain, aircraft orders are a lot weaker than they were a year earlier.
The shrinking military industry and ailing airlines are also hurting machine-tool makers, many of whom are in Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Their orders are also being hurt by the recession in Europe.
"We're seeing some spurts and sputters due to uncertainty about what's happening," said Mr. Eberts at the Cleveland Fed. "Also, Europe, one of our major customers, is still slowing down."
 
Business Orders Slip
 There were hints in the durables report that the mini-boom in business investment of the last several quarters may be cooling a bit. Business orders for capital goods from laptop computers to turbines edged up 1.2 percent, a paltry gain given the steep 10.8 percent decline in March. Excluding aircraft, orders for capital goods slipped 1.7 percent.
Still, the National Association of Manufacturers expects capital spending by industry to rise 7 or 8 percent this year.
"No matter what Washington does about taxes," Mr. Jasinowski said, "there's a long-term commitment to invest to make us more competitive."

Tax-Exempt Yields Jump But Taxables Are Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Average yields on tax-exempt money market funds were substantially higher in the latest period after a jump in all short-term interest rates, while the yields on taxable funds were down, according to the latest survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
Analysts at the Money Fund Report said investors probably believed that the Federal Reserve might be ready to raise short-term rates to stall inflation. The concern was strong enough last week to lower prices and consequently raise interest rates on the short end. 
 For the week ended Tuesday, yields on tax-exempt money market funds were up an average 14 basis points, as investors moved $780 million into the funds, bringing total assets to $102 billion. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Money managers held fast; the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in portfolios was unchanged at 48 for the third consecutive week.
IBC/Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt money market fund rose 15 basis points, to 2.18 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield up 14 basis points, to 2.15 percent. Analysts noted that for the last 30 days, the compounded yield was averaging 2.05 percent and the simple yield about 2.02 percent.
Excluding state and local taxes, the taxable-bond equivalent yield for the average seven-day yield for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is 3.03 percent and about 3.16 percent for investors in the 31 percent bracket.
The Money Fund Report said that among the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund led for the fourth time in five weeks, producing a yield of 2.86 percent.
 
Taxable Funds
 For the week ended yesterday, the assets of taxable money market funds fell $2.1 billion, to $486.6 billion, as institutional funds again represented most of the cash outflow. The assets of the institutional funds declined $1.8 billion, to $170.8 billion.
The average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios was unchanged at 64 for the second straight week.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund slipped a basis point, to 2.63 percent, with the seven-day simple yield down the same amount, to 2.59 percent. The compounded average yield over 30 days is 2.64 percent and 2.62 percent for a simple yield.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for the Money Fund Report, said there might be some small pickup in yields in the short run. "The only two things that could move interest rates higher over the long term," he added, "are if President Clinton's deficit-reducing package runs into trouble and inflation numbers start to form an inflationary trend."
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market fund provided the best return among general-purpose funds this week as it has over the last month, reporting a yield of 3.43 percent.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds, are offering an average yield of 2.52 percent to depositors.

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 26

 BODY:
Two Federal Reserve policy makers gave a mixed reading of the nation's economic health today and forecast no immediate acceleration in the sluggish pace of job growth.
But neither Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federarl Reserve, nor Robert D. McTeer Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who votes on the Fed's policy-setting committee, raised any flags that economic growth was in danger of faltering. 
 Mr. Greenspan said at a banking conference that the six-point slump in a consumer confidence index for May, to 61.5, reflected a slowdown in output from an unsustainably rapid pace late last year and was not a good indicator of future economic activity.
He said "exceptionally good" auto sales for mid-May countered the index's message that people were afraid to make significant financial commitments. Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks surged in mid-May to a 12.5 million annual rate from 11.1 million a year ago.
Mr. McTeer gave a similar reading of the economy, calling recent economic data mixed.
"The 50-miles-per-hour headwinds are probably down to 30 miles per hour," he said, adding, "I don't have the sense that the sustainability of the recovery is in danger."

HEADLINE: A Photo Center With a Huge Job Vacancy

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN

 BODY:
Although not wholly unexpected, Cornell Capa's announcement last week that he intended to step down as the director of the International Center of Photography in June 1994 took many people by surprise. The ebullient Mr. Capa, who founded the center in 1974 and has been as closely identified with it as Joseph Papp was with the New York Shakespeare Festival, recently turned 75, and he remains a seemingly tireless advocate for photography.
In an interview shortly before his announcement, though, Mr. Capa said he had grown weary of the administrative and fund-raising aspects of his job and was resigning to spend more time with his wife, Edie. 
 His departure will close another chapter in his own long and colorful career, which began in the 1930's in Paris, where he made prints for his brother, the celebrated photojournalist Robert Capa. But it also signals the beginning of what may be a difficult transition for the center, which must find a director resourceful enough to build on Mr. Capa's considerable achievements while moving the institution beyond his very long shadow. Indeed, it is a problem not unlike that faced by the Shakespeare Festival, which has gone through unsettled times since Papp's death.
Mr. Capa, however, is very much alive and is in every way the International Center of Photography's driving force. Under his leadership the center has grown into one of the foremost photography institutions in the country, if not the world. With a staff of 65 and an annual budget of $5.7 million, it offers major exhibitions both in its main building, a Georgian-style mansion on Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, and at I.C.P. Midtown, on the Avenue of the Americas at 43d Street. It attracts over 250,000 people a year to its programs and has built a permanent collection of more than 25,000 prints.
All in all, Mr. Capa seems to be leaving his successor a stable institution. The center has weathered the recession and has balanced its budget for the last 10 years. Moreover, it owns its main building outright and has a lease from the Eastman Kodak Company to rent its midtown space until 1999 for a dollar a year.
In some ways Mr. Capa is like a marvelous chef, with the center his ultimate souffle. "For 18 years I could do what I wanted," Mr. Capa said. "The shape of the programming, the exhibitions -- it's mine."
A very real question, though, is whether the next director will be able to keep this rich concoction on the rise. The center has no endowment and every year must raise nearly half its budget from corporate and individual sources, including American Express, Chase Manhattan Bank and Mobil.
The center also faces increased competition from other institutions in the city. When Mr. Capa began his venture, only the Museum of Modern Art, among the city's major museums, showed much interest in photography. But in recent months both the Whitney and the Guggenheim museums have begun to collect and exhibit photographs, joining the Modern and a revitalized program at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
"With glamorous institutions like the Met and the Guggenheim getting involved in photography," Mr. Capa said, the center faces heavy competition for attention and support. "We have to be as attractive as they are, and that's difficult. What is our niche?"
With Mr. Capa's departure, the center will have to confront questions about its very identity. The center presents an eclectic mix of exhibitions, but it has always given special emphasis to documentary and commercial photography. In the last two years it has exhibited Roman Vishniac's photographs of Jews in Eastern Europe before World War II and a retrospective of work by Dmitri Baltermants, the Russian photojournalist, as well as exhibits by the portraitist Yousuf Karsh, by Sheila Metzner and Joyce Tenneson, the fashion photographers, and by Lois Greenfield, the dance photographer.
This emphasis on presenting photography that does not fit into current definitions of art reflects Mr. Capa's own prejudices. "I don't like the gallery art of photography as I see it now," he said. "The photography I'm interested in is urgent. It's humanistic and concerned."
Nevertheless, other staff members have organized shows that feature work by a new generation of art photographers. "Special Collections," shown last year, included work by John Baldessari, Christian Boltanski and other well-known artists; "Commodity Image," at I.C.P. Midtown through July 18, presents photos by such 80's gallery stars as Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince and Barbara Kruger.
Exhibitions of this sort are more in keeping with shows put on by the Modern, the Met and the Whitney, which tend to view photography as part of contemporary art. Depending on one's point of view, I.C.P.'s eclectic programs can be seen as a celebration of photography's diversity or as a confused attempt to blend essentially incompatible directions in the field.
A basic question the center has never adequately addressed, though, is whether exhibitions are the most appropriate form in which to present journalistic or commercial photographs. Out of the context of magazine layouts and advertisements, they risk being seen simply as esthetic objects, with their social message obscured.
The immediate task facing the center is to find someone to fill Mr. Capa's capacious shoes. Many of the decisions in that process will fall to the board, which has been headed since 1989 by Jill Rose, a photography collector and the wife of Marshall Rose, the chairman of the New York Public Library. Not surprisingly, though, Mr. Capa himself will have a big say in choosing his successor. At its meeting last week the board formed a search committee, with Mr. Capa and Mrs. Rose among its members. A prime criterion in selecting a new director, Mr. Capa said, will be to find "someone who can operate by the seat of his or her pants, someone capable of showing us how to live in the new world" in which photography finds itself today.
Both Mr. Capa and Mrs. Rose expressed their determination to continue the center's focus on documentary photography. That emphasis, Mrs. Rose said, is "the concept that we began with and that sets us apart from other institutions."
In some ways the center can be seen as the ultimate proof of Mr. Capa's devotion to his brother. In 1954 Robert Capa was killed while on assignment in Vietnam. "From that day," Mr. Capa said, "I was haunted by the question of what happens to the work a photographer leaves behind, by how to make the work stay alive."
Born into a middle-class Budapest family, the brothers were remarkably close, to the point of sharing the same pseudonym. After following his brother to Paris in 1936 Mr. Capa dropped the family name, Friedmann, and adopted his brother's new last name, which was based on the name of the movie director Frank Capra.
Mr. Capa also followed his brother into photography, printing for him in Paris and New York, and then picking up a camera himself. He worked as a staff photographer for Life magazine from 1946 until 1954, when he joined Magnum, the photojournalists' cooperative. He continued to shoot assignments around the world until founding I.C.P. in 1974.
But the question of how to preserve the images of his brother and other photographers remained. In 1966 Mr. Capa set up the International Fund for Concerned Photography to promote the work of photojournalists and documentary photographers, and by the early 1970's he had begun to look for a permanent base for his activities in support of photography that is characterized, as he termed it, by a "concern for mankind."
When a landmark red-brick Fifth Avenue mansion built in 1915 for Willard Straight, the founder of The New Republic, became available in 1974, Mr. Capa was able to scrape together a down payment on the bargain-basement purchase price of $550,000.
The new institution opened that November amid a splash of publicity, including a Talk of the Town item in The New Yorker written by Jacqueline Onassis, whom Mr. Capa had photographed in the 1960's and described as "a very good neighbor." With that glitzy send-off, I.C.P. was well launched into the often tricky world of New York museums.
The thought that the center might now have to become an institution, with the stability and staidness that the term implies, does not sit well with Mr. Capa. "I'm afraid it may be true," he said. "But I'll do my best not to let it happen."
"We have to remain different," Mr. Capa added. "We are not just another museum." Whatever happens after he leaves, he said, he hopes the center will remain "an alternative something."

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
FROM an outsider's perspective, it would seem that the couple's children had done well. Their 30-year-old son was a manager in a high-technology firm. Their daughter, a 26-year-old lawyer who had recently become pregnant, had decided to take time away from practicing law until after her child was born. Both young adults were well educated and financially successful.
But in their parents' eyes, the children were failures. Their son had not married and was devoting his energies to his work. Their daughter was a disappointment because she'd temporarily given up her law practice to share more time with her family. Neither had followed the schedule or path their parents had envisioned for them. 
 The problem was not with what the young adults were doing with their lives but with how their choices differed from their parents' expectations. "Parents like this are holding an immense amount of responsibility for their children's behaviors as adults," said Dr. William S. Pollack, a psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., and instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
"It's a way of not letting go. Sometimes all the parents want is something good for their child, but they are too inflexible over what is good."
Parental expectations begin early. Parents who look into their newborn baby's eyes often see unbounded potential. They also see reflections of their own lives, a chance to correct old mistakes and to improve upon successes.
"We each have an assumed timetable for our children," said Dr. Nancy K. Schlossberg, a professor of counselor education at the University of Maryland at College Park. "But no child grows up according to her parents' timetable."
Those images change as parents note their children's true skills and interests. The son who was given a tiny bat and ball on his first birthday will never be good enough to play for the Yankees. The daughter who was supposed to follow in her father's footsteps as a physician is more interested in art.
Parents' aspirations for their children also change as they take into account the differences between the social and economic pressures they faced as young adults and those their children face. Today's young adults will probably marry and have children later than their parents did. They're less able to buy a house without help and more likely to come back to their parents' home to live.
Still, there are parents who stick to their own agendas for their children's lives.
"The more disappointed you are in your own life, no matter how objectively successful you are, the more you'll turn to your child to succeed where you couldn't," said Dr. Eleanor Bromberg, an associate professor of social work at Hunter College in Manhattan. "But it's never possible for a child to make up for the deficits in the parent's life."
A result of trying to live out a parent's unfulfilled dreams is usually frustration for both generations. But the reasons for viewing a child as a failure are not always that obvious. The transition to adulthood marks a change not only for adolescents but for their parents as well. It's difficult for some parents to step back from their children's lives, to allow them to choose their own course and to make mistakes.
For others, staying overly involved in their children's adult lives keeps them from facing how their own lives must change. It can be a way of denying the shift in their roles within the family, and a way of feeling needed. This attitude is most often seen in adults who view themselves primarily as parents. Allowing their children to grow up becomes a threat to their self-image.
Ironically, for some young adults, not succeeding in their parents' eyes can be a source of power rather than shame.
"If it's so important to you that your child do well, you need to look at whether that child can punish or rebel against you by not living up to your expectations," said Dr. Jerrold Lee Shapiro, an associate professor of counseling psychology at Santa Clara University in California, and the author of "The Measure of a Man: Becoming the Father You Wish Your Father Had Been" (1993, Delacorte Press, $22.95).
In these families, the young adults are trapped in the rebelliousness of early adolescence, desperately trying to assert their independence by rejecting their parents.
"Adulthood," Dr. Bromberg said, "is about renegotiating relationships."
 
Talking About Failure and Disappointment
 IT'S difficult to talk about feelings of failure, as if putting words to the emotions will make the situation worse. "You have to ask yourself what it means to you personally that your child is a disappointment," said Dr. Jerrold Lee Shapiro, an associate professor of counseling psychology at Santa Clara University in California. "Does it mean that you're a failure? Does it mean that what you've accomplished won't be passed on to the next generation?"
The answers to those questions are often a good way to begin a discussion with your family. Often, the parents have to broach the topic.
"If your children have made a bad decision about how to live their lives, they may be afraid that if they talk to you, they'll hear a lot of 'I told you so,' " said Dr. Sandra J. Eller, a psychologist and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center. "You have to resist the urge to rub your child's nose in the problem."
Here are some other things to keep in mind when talking to your children about these feelings:
Look for ways in which your children have met your aspirations for them.
These may not be obvious. A girl who was taught to be tenacious in the parents' hope that she would become a lawyer may use that quality to get work as a musician. While some parents may think of that as a failure, it's actually a sign of success, for it shows how, as an adult, she could apply her parents' values to her life.
Acknowledge your children's maturity.
Doing so is important, even if you disagree with some of the choices they've made. It helps avoid falling into parent-child roles that are no longer appropriate.
"Parents have to take responsibility for their own feelings of disappointment," Dr. Eller said. "There's often grieving that comes along with letting go of some of those dreams."
Keep your advice to yourself.
Young adults need to make their own choices and mistakes if they are to mature. "Listen respectfully," Dr. Eller said, "but leave your child to solve her problems in her own way. Don't rush in with solutions. Patient listening can be more helpful than giving advice."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at New Low vs. Yen; Gold and Silver Prices Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell to yet another record low against the Japanese yen yesterday as declining United States interest rates and fresh signs of a sluggish economy undermined the currency.
The dollar's slide came despite efforts by United States and Japanese officials to end speculation that the Clinton Administration is seeking an even stronger Japanese yen. 
 Gold and silver prices also declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery fell $3.40 an ounce, to settle at $375.30. Silver for July delivery lost 8 cents, to $4.563 an ounce.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 108.50 yen, down from 109.35 yen on Tuesday, although it traded yesterday as low as 108.42 yen. Its five-month decline gained momentum Tuesday after a Treasury report suggested that a stronger yen could reduce the United States trade deficit with Japan.
 
A Bid to Stop the Slide
Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, tried to arrest the plunge in the dollar by saying the United States was not seeking a stronger yen. But dealers were not convinced as the Federal Reserve failed to buy dollars to back up Mr. Summers's statements.
"The market believes that whatever the U.S. says in public, what it really wants is to see the yen higher," said Troy Bowler, chief economist at Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets in London.
Earlier yesterday in Tokyo, attempts by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar when it fell below 109 yen were foiled by matching sales by dealers. Two institutions alone sold $2 billion, Tokyo traders said. The dollar fell to 108.65 yen in Tokyo, from 110.56 yen Tuesday.
Dealers predicted the dollar could fall to 107.50 yen, an important resistance point, in the next few days.
The dollar also fell to 1.6283 German marks in late New York trading, from 1.6305 marks late Tuesday. The British pound settled at $1.5485 in New York, up from $1.5435 Tuesday.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Dollar Continues Fall
 TOKYO, Thursday, May 27 (Bloomberg Business News) -- The dollar continued its plunge against the yen here today, hitting a new low of 107.83 at midday, compared with an opening of 108.65 yen.
The dollar was being sold throughout Asia.
"We're into uncharted territory," said Paul Kammel, manager for corporate business on the currency trading desk at Westpac Bank in Sydney. "The market wants to take the dollar lower. Selling is coming from all quarters."

HEADLINE: Guatemala's Do-It-Yourself Coup

 BODY:
It's the latest fashion in Latin American authoritarianism, and it seems to be catching. Following the path marked out by President Alberto Fujimori of Peru 13 months ago, President Jorge Serrano of Guatemala enlisted the army Tuesday to help him abolish Congress, the courts and the Constitution. His purpose was to stifle criticism of his economic austerity policies.
Unless the hemisphere's democratic governments respond more effectively this time than they have in the past, Latin America's recent political gains could begin slipping away. 
 Guatemala's democracy, like Peru's, was badly flawed. In both countries a white elite dominates an Indian and mixed-race majority, powerful armies trample human rights and resist civilian control and corruptible courts mock the idea of impartial justice.
But in Guatemala as in Peru, yet another army-backed coup, combined with a clampdown on the press and other independent voices, makes a bad situation even worse. In Peru, escalating Shining Path terrorism and a badly discredited congressional opposition at least gave Mr. Fujimori a plausible pretext for betraying democracy. In Guatemala, Mr. Serrano can claim no such excuses.
The Clinton Administration, which quickly condemned the coup, should now move to halt Guatemala's $60 million in U.S. aid. Meanwhile, the Organization of American States is preparing for an emergency meeting. But that probably won't be enough to turn the tide. Similar moves after the Peruvian coup brought only a small concession, the election of a new constituent assembly. Mr. Serrano has already promised to take that step on his own.
The failure of hemisphere governments to restore democracy in Peru, and their even more glaring failure in Haiti, have encouraged authoritarians elsewhere. Guatemala's do-it-yourself coup is one obvious result. Military rumblings in oil-rich Venezuela, and now in Brazil, Latin America's largest and economically most important democracy, are further ominous signs.
Two years ago, at the high-water mark of Latin democratization, member countries of the Organization of American States pledged to take active steps to protect their proud democratic achievements. Without resolute and aggressive steps against Mr. Serrano's seizure of power, that pledge will be proved meaningless.

HEADLINE: Can the Democrats Govern?

 BODY:
A lot will be on the line when the House votes on President Clinton's budget, possibly as early as today. The fight is nominally over such economic issues as deficit reduction, tax hikes, Medicare cuts, subsidies for low-paid workers and investment in a high-tech future. But what's really at issue is the credibility of the Democrats as a governing party.
If, after regaining the White House from 12 years of Republican rule, the Democrats now split apart and let the new President's budget tumble, they will be portraying themselves as too disorganized to govern. In 1992 voters delivered a verdict on divided government. They put Democrats in charge of the White House and Congress to end gridlock and deliver action. 
 The vote is uncertain because some moderate and conservative Democrats are threatening to sabotage the budget over one myopic demand or another. Representatives from oil-producing states don't want higher energy taxes. Conservatives demand a smaller government -- which requires, they say, an ironclad ceiling on entitlement spending.
The Clinton plan, while hardly perfect, is the only proposal with a chance of majority support that would take a sizable chunk out of the deficit, protect the poor and invest in infrastructure and education. True, it's not the final step toward fiscal prudence; lots more will have to be done four or five years out. But it's a first, important step.
Two issues stand in the way of Democrats mustering a majority in favor of the Clinton plan. Oil-state lawmakers like Senator David Boren of Oklahoma demand that Mr. Clinton's energy tax, which applies to the heat content of fuels, be scrapped or at least substantially modified. Conservatives, led by Charles Stenholm of Texas, demand that government be further downsized, starting with a cap on entitlements -- the part of the budget that rises automatically without annual review and has been exploding out of control.
Neither of these issues need undermine Democratic solidarity. If Messrs. Boren and Stenholm and their friends truly want a deficit-reduction package, compromises are readily at hand.
Senator Boren and others charge that the B.T.U. tax that Mr. Clinton proposes, which would account for more than 25 percent of the $250 billion tax hike, would put U.S. businesses that use lots of energy to manufacture their products at a competitive disadvantage. A possible solution is to levy the tax also on imports while exempting U.S. exports, if that can be made consistent with trade rules.
On entitlements, Mr. Clinton wisely rejects a simple cap because it would trigger across-the-board cutbacks aimed at the elderly, poor and disabled who are the primary recipients of entitlement spending. It would also risk throwing the economy into deeper recession, because entitlement spending on welfare and unemployment insurance rises during economic downturns and helps maintain consumer purchasing power.
Mr. Clinton offers a sensible compromise: If entitlements run above target, he would propose compensating spending cuts and revenue hikes that Congress would have to consider. An even better answer would be for Congress to cut specific entitlement programs directly.
But the crux of today's vote is governance. The Democrats told voters they were ready to take over and function like a party. If they show today that they aren't, voters are unlikely to forget that next year.

HEADLINE: Dow, Up 23.53 Points, Sets Another Record

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A dip in interest rates helped the stock market surge yesterday, establishing a record high for the Dow Jones industrial average in heavy trading.
Analysts said stocks became a more attractive investment as prices for long-term Treasury bonds rose and their yields fell below 7 percent. 
 Gold, a traditional refuge in nervous economic conditions, fell after reports that Russia had more gold than traders had expected. Gold stocks closed mixed.
"There's a lot of cash around," said Bernard J. Spilko, managing director of Julius Baer Securities. "And bonds, baseball cards, art on the wall, and gold in a safety deposit box just aren't delivering, so equities become the place to be."
 
Several Indexes Advance
 The 30-stock Dow industrial average rose 23.53 points, to an all-time high of 3,540.16. But unlike last week, when the blue-chip stock index set a record high that the rest of the market failed to follow, other major indexes with a wider variety of stocks also advanced yesterday.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 4.59 points, to 453.44, approaching the March 10 record of 456.34. The Nasdaq composite index, led by high-technology stocks, rose a sharp 9.05 points to 704.09. The American Stock Exchange market value index, despite being weighted with gold stocks, rose 3.06 points to 437.13.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index also rose sharply 2.20 points to 249.90. Gaining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered losers by a two-to-one margin. Exchange volume totaled 278.8 million shares compared with Tuesday's 222.1 million.
The Dow was lifted by a wide variety of stocks, with 20 out of the 30 component stocks rising. The International Business Machines Corporation was the leading winner in the Dow and also the second most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with 4.05 million shares changing hands.
I.B.M. closed up 2 3/8, to 52 3/4, partly because of an analyst's remarks that investors saw as positive. Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch & Company said he expected as many as 70,000 layoffs by year's end, up from the 40,000 he previously estimated. He also said he thought that I.B.M.'s personal computer and disk-drive businesses were improving.
 
Intel Jumps 6 3/4 Points
 The Standard & Poor's 500 was led by Intel, which closed up 6 3/4, to 110 1/2, after another Merrill Lynch analyst raised his earnings estimates for the company.
The S.& P. 500 was moved by another high-technology stock, Motorola, which closed up 3 7/8, to 82 5/8. It rose on no discernible news, but may have risen in sympathy with I.B.M. and Microsoft, which rose 4, to 95 1/4, on favorable publicity about its new NT software.
But the major trading activity again centered on Spectrum Information Technologies, down 1 3/8, to 4, on volume of 13.6 million shares, as well as on Novell, down 2 3/8, to 29 7/8, on 13 million shares.
Spectrum's troubles stem from shareholder suits and other problems from the recent speculative frenzy about the company's stock. Analysts downgraded Novell's stock partly because its quarterly earnings only met their expectations rather than exceeded them. There were also doubts that its Netware 4.0 software would sell as briskly as expected.
American depositary receipts for shares of British Petroleum rose 5/8, to 58 3/8, after B.P. announced the sale of a consumer-products unit. It was the Big Board's most active issue, with volume of 10.47 million shares.

HEADLINE: Ruling Seen To Weaken Layoff Law

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
A Federal judge has ruled that the General Dynamics Corporation did not violate a Federal law requiring most employers to notify workers in advance of a mass layoff when it furloughed 3,000 workers in 1991 after the Navy canceled the $57 billion A-12 Avenger warplane program.
The ruling appears to reduce the protection for workers and widen a legal loophole that employers, particularly military contractors, may use to avoid issuing warning notices, legal and industry experts said yesterday. 
 Federal District Judge Jean C. Hamilton in St. Louis ruled on Monday that General Dynamics was not liable for an estimated $12 million in back-pay claims by 1,200 former employees, who had filed suit.
Even though General Dynamics executives knew the program was over budget and irrevocably delayed, the judge ruled that "in the unique context of defense contracting, a contractor exercising commercially reasonable business judgment would not necessarily conclude on the basis of this information that the A-12 contract would be cancelled."
 
'Creates a Larger Loophole'
 The ruling "does not bode well for defense workers," said Julie Hurwitz, director of the National Lawyers Guild's Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice in Detroit.
The group has monitored an estimated 100 cases filed since the Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act, known as the Warn Act, became law in 1989. The law requires employers to warn employees 60 days before a mass layoff instead of simply giving them severance pay. Companies are exempt if the warning would result in a business failure or if the layoff was not forseeable.
"It creates a larger loophole than had already existed for companies to get around giving notice," Ms. Hurwitz said. "It also reduces worker protection that the Warn Act had afforded."
The A-12 Avenger warplane program, the largest weapons program ever terminated by the Pentagon, ultimately cost General Dynamics and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation about 9,000 jobs.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which filed the suit against General Dynamics, settled a similar case out of court with McDonnell Douglas, said Stephen E. Tallent, a Washington lawyer for General Dynamics. Both military contractors still face suits, contending similar issues, filed by non-union employees.
 
Conditions for Military Contractor
 Mr. Tallent said the ruling clarifies under what conditions a military contractor must notify its employees of a probable layoff. "Otherwise, every time the Government barks, you would have to issue a warning notice," he said. "It would mean issuing them very frequently and most would be disregarded and a real one wouldn't be believed."
Forcing a military contractor to issue warning notices whenever a Congressional committee threatened to cut spending would have a harmful consequence, Mr. Tallent said. "Then you will lose the best part of your work force and when it turns out to be a false alarm, you haven't got the employees," he said.
Rod Tanner, a lawyer for the machinists union, said the union is considering whether to appeal the ruling. "We're disappointed," he said.
Lawrence Korb, a former Defense Department under secretary who was called as an expert witness by the machinists, said the ruling strips protection for employees of military contractors intended by the Warn Act. "It seems to me, if you're in the defense business, you don't have to comply," he said.

HEADLINE: Relax! There's Still Time To Shop for a Summer Camp

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

 BODY:
EVELYN LEE, 38, a single working mother in Stamford, Conn., depends on summer camp to occupy her two children every year. It wasn't until a few weeks ago, however, that she realized that "I had completely spaced out and forgotten to send in the camp applications."
Believing she had missed the deadline, she panicked. 
 Other parents may also assume that if it is May, then it is too late to get their children into summer camp.
But that is not true, especially if parents are willing to be flexible. After all, there are 8,500 day and overnight camps in this country, says the American Camping Association, a nonprofit organization that provides referrals to its accredited camps.
"There is such an enormous variety of camps, it's certainly not too late to find one suitable for your child," said Laurie Edelman, executive director of the New York section of the association.
Sally Ziegler, executive director of the Child Care Council of Westchester, a nonprofit child-care referral agency in White Plains, said that although two years ago "most camps were full by May," only a few of the 111 licensed day camps in Westchester County are full right now.
Several camp-referral experts said that camps seem to be filling up slowly this year, perhaps because of a weak economy. Parents may even find that space is still available in their camp of first choice, Ms. Edelman said, although they may not be able to get the weeks they want.
Because there are so many camps, Ms. Edelman suggested that parents limit their choices to four or five. "We recommend that parents don't consider 12 camps, since they will just get confused," she said.
To her great relief, Ms. Lee did not have to fret long about her memory lapse. Not long ago, her daughter, 14, and her son, 12, were accepted at their camps of choice.
Summer camp fees tend to be highest in the Northeast, industry experts said. Day camps in the New York area range from $75 to $400 a week; transportation and lunch are not always included. Overnight camps cost from $200 to $600 a week.
"Camp sounds expensive," Ms. Lee said, "but try keeping children busy on a day-to-day basis."
Agency and not-for-profit camps tend to be less expensive than private camps, since their fees are subsidized by donations. Low-cost camps include those sponsored by the Y.M.C.A., Girl Scouts and religious organizations. Some private camps offer scholarships based on the ability to pay. Although most financial aid may have been allocated for this year, Ms. Edelman said, parents who can't afford camp should still inquire about scholarships for this year or next.
Less expensive alternatives include town camps, usually reserved for resident children only. There are also a variety of short-term, specialty camps run by nature centers, zoos, historical societies and museums.
Since most day camps run from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., working parents should ask about the availability of extended hours. Camps that offer this service usually charge an extra fee.
The American Camping Association is still accepting requests for information about camp this summer and will continue to do so through August.
Based on a child's interests and needs, an association specialist will help parents determine what kind of camp is best and will suggest four or five possibilities. The specialist will notify each camp, and parents will receive camp packets at no charge. An A.C.A. specialist familiar with 250 accredited overnight and day camps in the Northeast is available at (800) 777-CAMP. For A.C.A. referrals in other parts of the country, the number is (800) 428-CAMP.
The national network of child-care resource and referral agencies also provides free information about local camps. Child Care Inc., a nonprofit agency in New York City, lists 2,000 camps in the New York metropolitan area; information is available at (212) 929-4999. The Child Care Council of Westchester, (914) 761-3456, makes referrals to day camps in Westchester. Child Care Aware, at (800) 424-2246, provides information on referral agencies nationwide.
Ideally, parents should plan now for the summer of 1994, Ms. Edelman said. "Make an appointment while camp is in session this year, to get an idea about how campers and counselors interact, who the children are, and what kind of supervision they receive," she added.
 
Camp Scouting
 THE American Camping Association publishes a "1993/94 Guide to Accredited Camps" that includes advice on how to select a camp. Copies, at $10.95 each, are available from the New York office: (800) 777-CAMP.
Included are key questions to ask a camp director:
How old are the counselors and how many children does each one supervise?
What activities are required? Do children have a choice of special activities?
How often do children take trips and what transportation is provided? Is there an extra charge for this?
What medical services are available at the camp and nearby?
Does the camp provide references of parents whose children have attended the camp?

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: A Victory Most Precious;
Breathlessly Narrow, Desperately Needed, Clinton's Triumph in the House Buys Time

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Standing on the burning deck, President Clinton sailed his ship to victory in the House of Representatives tonight. It was a harrowingly narrow victory, desperately needed after months of adversity, hard won.
It was not decisive, but the Administration gained time to prepare itself for other, harder battles ahead. 
 Perhaps the most important aspect of the week's performance by the Clinton legislative team, headed by the President himself, was its new-found single-mindedness. Awakened late to the danger faced by the economic plan upon which so much depends, the team did the analysis, deployed its troops and worked day and night, perhaps not with perfect skill but with enough. It was a far cry from the feckless performance that cost the Administration its stimulus package last month.
 
Momentum May Shift
 For a time at least, less will be heard from the chorus of critical voices comparing Mr. Clinton to the two other Democratic Presidents of the last 30 years, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, who left town with heads hanging.
If Mr. Clinton and his associates can repeat in the Senate what they did in the House this week -- prowling the corridors, cutting deals, working the phones -- they may actually get their tax and spending package. And if they can keep up the momentum, they may even have a chance of hitting big casino: carrying out an effective reform of the nation's faltering health-care system, which, as the President said this morning, would be one of the major legislative accomplishments of his generation.
To do either of those things, Mr. Clinton will need to continue repairing his bridges to the moderate and conservative Democrats who, having backed him last year because they considered him one of them, have come to see him this year as an apostate. As they did under President Ronald Reagan, who wooed them so effectively, they hold the balance in both houses and the country at large.
A very great deal was at stake as the clerk called the roll in the House this evening -- far more than usual on votes that wear that weary label, "pivotal." Representative David R. Obey, a dour Democrat from Wisconsin, said with pardonable hyperbole before the vote, "Life ends after today if this doesn't pass, in my view."
Had the first Democratic budget in a dozen years been rejected in the House, with the Democrats in control there more securely than in the Senate, with the rules more favorable to them than in the Senate, the smell of failure -- of yet another Presidency turning sour -- would have been overpowering. Mr. Clinton must have sensed that keenly, because he frantically called recalcitrant legislators almost to the last minute.
"This vote is about whether we as a nation can govern, whether we can eliminate the gridlock of the last 12 years," said Representative Bill Richardson, Democratof New Mexico, during the debate today.
But in fact it was about whether the Democrats can govern, given the dominant role in both the White House and Congress that they were awarded last November. The Clinton Administration's legislative, diplomatic, political and symbolic fumbles of the last four months have led many people -- including many who wish the Democrats well -- to doubt whether they had completely lost the knack of running things, and there is nothing more corrosive, nothing more self-perpetuating in Washington than a reputation for incompetence.
Ross Perot did what he could, in an interview taped on Tuesday, to sharpen that image of Mr. Clinton. He mocked the President's qualifications for the job, dismissing him as an out-of-touch "middle manager" who might get by in Arkansas but would never do in Washington.
In normal times, that might be dismissed as sour grapes from a man whom Mr. Clinton defeated. But the Texan's standing in the opinion polls has held up over the last six months while the President's has plummeted, with his approval rating dipping below 50 percent in a pair of national surveys only this week.
In the negotiations that ended early this morning and made House passage possible, the President conceded the point that Mr. Perot and the new Democrats have been making for weeks: that larger spending cuts and smaller tax increases were needed.
He accepted a new mechanism for checking increases in Medicare and other Federal programs, which may or may not work, dropped a request for more money for White House salaries and hinted, though not broadly enough for some, that the energy tax would be scaled back to make it acceptable to powerful Senators from oil-producing states.
 
Donning Common Clothes
 Mr. Clinton also did what he could during a two-hour question-and-answer session on CBS this morning to put his populist clothes back on. He ridiculed a suggestion that he had gone Hollywood, said he wore a cheap watch even if he got $200 haircuts from a tony Beverly Hills trimmer and tried hard to dissociate himself from the bungled changes in the White House travel office.
Addressing the issue that started many of the traditionalists among his supporters along the road to disenchantment, the President walked away from the homosexual pressure groups who are demanding that he keep his campaign promises of full integration of gay men and lesbians into the armed forces. He identified himself instead with the calls for compromise issued by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Representative Barney Frank, the openly homosexual Massachusetts liberal.
In fact, Mr. Clinton seemed eager to suggest that he had never much liked homosexuality as a way of life, anyway -- a suggestion that Mr. Frank said struck him as gratuitous.
The President has yet to show the country that he can get the stars out of his eyes. He has yet to demonstrate that he and his inexperienced White House staff can stop making silly mistakes and keep the nation's attention focused on the main chance.
He must still do a lot of careful negotiating, keeping the liberals reasonably happy while pacifying the conservatives. And he must persuade the country that the new taxes are fair, necessary and solidly committed to reducing the deficit.
Even as he crowed in victory in the White House Rose Garden late tonight, President Clinton was careful to fix his gaze not only on what had been won, but on what remained to be won.
"Tonight the House said yes to jobs, yes to lowering the deficit, yes to lower interest rates and yes to a brighter future," Mr. Clinton said. "Tomorrow, we go back to the Senate and back to the country.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT BACKS A GAY COMPROMISE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
President Clinton today endorsed a compromise on ending the ban on homosexuals in the military, emphasizing that the Government should not "appear to be endorsing a gay life style."
The President offered support for the approach of "don't ask, don't tell" -- the label given to a range of plans that would allow homosexuals to serve but leave limits on how open they could be about their sexuality. 
 "We almost have a compromise here," Mr. Clinton said in a nationally televised question-and-answer session with tourists this morning in the White House Rose Garden. "Most Americans believe if you don't ask and you don't say and you're not forced to confront it, people should be able to serve."
 
A Distancing Tactic
 The President's remarks on homosexuals in the military, which came in response to a question from a pastor who said he was worried about Christian values, seemed calculated to put some distance between himself and gay rights groups.
"We are trying to work this out so that our country does not -- I understand what you're saying -- so that our country does not appear to be endorsing a gay life style," he said. "But we accept people as people, and give them a chance to serve if they play by the rules."
Mr. Clinton's remarks came toward the end of two-hour appearance on "CBS This Morning" in which he probably endured the most aggressive questioning in such a forum on a variety of topics, including these:
*He confirmed that he would extend China's favorable trade status for one year to help that country's modernization drive. But he said any future renewal would depend on the China's making gains on human rights.
*He blamed reporters for making too much of the expensive haircut he got on Air Force One, delaying traffic at the Los Angeles International Airport. "I mean look, I wear a $40 watch," he said. "Do I look like the kind of guy that would go and sit on an airport? You know it was just a blow up." In jest, he added, "I'm glad they didn't find out about the manicure."
*He defended his aides' calling in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine accusations of mismanagement at the White House travel office, a move that was done without the knowledge of Attorney General Janet Reno. Mr. Clinton said that while there was no policy to alert the Attorney General on internal White House matters, he would do so in the future "because I trust her."
*He was unenthusiastic when asked whether the cost of abortion should be covered in a national health care package, saying no decision had been made. He said a broad package was essential rather than a limited one "that's not worth a nickel."
*He said it was "absolutely not true" that his Administration had become infatuated with Hollywood and celebrities. Questioning why the reporters focused on two meetings in the White House with celebrities, he said, "When my preacher from Arkansas stayed here, nobody wrote it up."
Mr. Clinton did not spell out any policy specifics. But his comments mark what some gay rights groups today called a retreat from his campaign pledge to fully overturn the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.
 
Different Meanings
 As for the issue of homosexuals in the military, proponents of "don't ask, don't tell" have used the term to mean different things.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, has argued for a policy in which the military would not ask members of the armed forces about their sexual orientation, and opposes their being open about their homosexuality, on or off duty.
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is open about his own homosexuality, has pressed for a far more lenient policy in which homosexuals could be open about their sexual orientation off duty but silent while on duty. But the various proposals are all based on a sense that Congress would not allow homosexuals to serve openly without restrictions.
At the Pentagon, where officials have until July 15 to deliver a proposal on the issue to the White House, officials said they were toying with language that is closer to Mr. Frank's recommendation. But they also said they were still trying to determine how to impose consistent regulations guiding the activities of servicemen and servicewomen on and off duty.
Mr. Frank, who angered many gay rights groups last week when he proposed a compromise, said he did not know if the President was accepting his proposal. But he, as did some homosexual groups, objected to Mr. Clinton's comments today on life style.
"It seemed to me somewhat gratuitous," he said. "One theory is that he is saying that as cover" so he can move ahead and press for allowing homosexuals in the military.
Speaking tonight on the Senate floor, Mr. Nunn commended the President, saying that he had "made it clear that any resolution of this debate should not appear to be endorsing any particular life style."
While he spoke only generally about Mr. Clinton's comments, the Senator flatly rejected Mr. Frank's proposal, asserting that permitting members of the armed forces to be open about their homosexuality off base would provide a "safe haven for homosexual conduct," leading to "a dramatic liberalization of military standards."
Today's remarks were the first in two months that Mr. Clinton has spoken extensively about homosexuals in the military, an issue that has dogged him since his election. Pentagon officials said the Administration had all but abandoned any consideration of separating troops by sexual orientation.
Although it had been clear that Defense Department officials and lawmakers were moving toward a consensus, some homosexual organizations criticized Mr. Clinton today for saying he was willing to accept some form of the "don't ask, don't tell" approach.
" 'Don't ask, don't tell' does not lift the ban, it simply reformulates it, and does so in an 'Alice in Wonderland' fashion," said Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service. "At its essence, it says that soldiers can continue to serve if they're gay so long as they pretend not to be gay."
While Mr. Clinton had toyed with addressing the nation on the eve of the House vote on his economic package, White House officials decided instead to accept a long-standing offer to appear today on "CBS This Morning."
Advisers to the President say he is often at his best taking questions from the public. But today he was often on the defensive.
In addressing the controversy over his haircut, he said he asked Secret Service agents whether "anybody would be held up or inconvenienced and I was told, 'No.' " He added: "I'd never do that. Not in 100 years. Not ever. I mean, I wasn't raised that way."
Mr. Clinton elaborated: "I think you've got to learn to laugh at things like that. You know, when little things get made big and big things get made little, you know, and you make a boner." He added that "if you didn't have a sense of humor in this business, you'd be grounded down to nothing pretty quick."

HEADLINE: Guatemalan's Power Grab Brings Street Protests

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, May 27

 BODY:
Demonstrators took to the streets for the first time today to protest President Jorge Serrano Elias's use of dictatorial powers, and the United States cut off most of its aid to Guatemala.
The protests were tentative and relatively small, but they seemed to raise tensions quickly after two days in which it was often difficult to tell from the city's movements that anything had changed. The appearance of hundreds of demonstrators outside the Supreme Court building that Mr. Serrano shut down on Tuesday was enough to draw scores of military policemen and several armored vehicles. 
 After a clandestine meeting today of about 70 legislators, leaders of the Congress, which Mr. Serrano also dissolved, issued an unusual call for military intervention. In a statement distributed by the human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church, the legislators appealed to the military "to assume its historic and patriotic role and reinstall the constitutional order."
But after two days in which the armed forces had seemed to keep to the shadows, military leaders instead offered their first public endorsement of Mr. Serrano's actions.
 
Hints of Corruption
 The congressional leaders also charged that Mr. Serrano had assumed authoritarian powers to avoid formal corruption charges.
In an interview this evening, the president of the Congress, Jose Lobo Dubon, cited reports that appeared just before Mr. Serrano's decree that while in office, he had acquired several ranches, a Mercedes-Benz, polo ponies, a 12-seat airplane and other properties. Mr. Serrano has denied any wrongdoing.
The country's military leaders, who had remained conspicuously in the shadows since Tuesday, showed no interest in the congressional statement. Rather, the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa, said the military would heed the President's orders.
In the face of rising public criticism, Mr. Serrano moved to restore a semblance of the old order by naming nine new justices to the Supreme Court, with his former Education Minister, Maria Luisa Beltranena, as its president.
The Government also said that newspapers could now circulate after the removal of all articles that it deemed "opinion." But only one of the country's major newspapers agreed to publish under the censorship, and at least several of its top editors resigned.
A spokesman for the President announced that while Mr. Serrano would not keep his promise on Tuesday to hold elections for a constituent assembly within 60 days, the elections would take place soon after that.
In a statement issued in Mexico City this afternoon, leaders of the rebel alliance, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, announced that they would abandon their peace talks with the Government until Mr. Serrano reversed himself.
The struggle today was largely confined to downtown Guatemala City, where a rally of court workers and a mass for a slain student turned into angry protests.
In the morning, about a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the court building, chanting slogans and waving signs. Lines of military policemen quickly marched out after them. Armored personnel carriers rushed into the plaza in front of the court, and as tear gas filled the air, the demonstrators scattered.
Hours later, hundreds more Guatemalans turned out for what was virtually a protest mass at the National Cathedral.
The cavernous colonial church, across the main plaza from the National Palace, erupted in applause as the crowd parted to let in Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Indian leader who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
Outside, the gathering turned more overtly political as most of the worshipers marched to the palace chanting for Mr. Serrano's resignation
"Our presence here is a clear message that we cannot be silenced or shut up," Miss Menchu said.
In Washington, the State Department's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, announced the suspension of all military aid and most economic support to Guatemala with more sharp words for the Serrano Government.
"We condemn this oppression of freedom in Guatemala and continuing censorship," he said. "These actions are a sign that Guatemala is on a dangerous course leading to further repression and further threats to democracy."
Mr. Boucher said the cutoff involved all military and police-training aid, economic development funds and cash support. Those programs were expected to be worth nearly $50 million this year.
Germany also announced it was freezing $78 million in aid.

HEADLINE: RENEWAL BACKED FOR CHINA TRADE

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he would renew China's favorable trade status for one year to help its modernization efforts, but he suggested that any future renewal would depend on China's making progress on human rights.
Administration officials had recommended Monday that Mr. Clinton steer such a middle course between groups pressing for trade sanctions as a lever to force change in China and business's demands not to encumber trade with this huge, fast-growing country. 
 In response to a question on a televised "town meeting" at the White House today, Mr. Clinton said: "I want to support modernization in China, and it's a great opportunity for America there. But I want to make it clear to them that there has to be some progress on human rights and the use of prison labor."
 
Carrot and a Stick
 But even as he offered China a carrot, Mr. Clinton made sure to talk tough, saying, "I think they will appreciate the gesture I'm making, but I hope they understand that the United States just can't turn its back on the abuse of lots of people."
A White House official said the President would issue a formal executive order on Friday that will condition renewal of China's favorable status beyond June 1994 on significant progress in several specific areas.
Mr. Clinton's position is a softening of his approach during last year's campaign, in which he argued that President Bush was wrong to extend China's favorable trade status without first demanding improvements in its human rights record.
In recent months, the President has faced immense pressures from businesses that feared being closed out of China's huge market. The Chinese Government has threatened to retaliate.
 
Sought Renewal
 China's government has eagerly sought renewal of its most-favored- nation trading status because without it tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the United States would soar to about 40 percent from an average of 8 percent.
Some of the President's advisers have told him that extending China's favored status was an important way to improve its economic conditions and to promote its transition from Communism to a market economy.
One official involved in formulating the policy said that some of the Administration's economic officials, fearing the possibility of retaliation, had pushed for renewing China's favorable status without conditions.
Some members of Congress criticized the President's decision, saying they preferred immediate revocation of China's favored status.
Gerald B. Solomon, a New York Republican, said he was disappointed by the renewal of China's status for one year "because the Chinese regime has done nothing in the last year to warrant the extension -- blatant violations of basic human rights continue unabated." He said he would push for legislation to revoke China's most-favored-nation status.
 
Capitol Hill Favorable
 But the predominant sentiment on Capitol Hill was a willingness to go along with the President's move because he had said any further extensions would be contingent upon China's improving its human rights record.
Mr. Clinton's move seemed largely in line with legislation introduced by the Senate Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who wants China's favored trade status conditioned on progress on human rights, removing trade barriers and limiting China's arms sales.
Mr. Clinton said today that he wanted to negotiate directly with China about its arms sales and its trade disputes with Washington. Administration officials say they are concerned about China's sale of missiles to Pakistan, adding that the executive order would involve provisions calling on China to stop its nuclear proliferation.
In his campaign manifesto, Mr. Clinton chided President Bush for renewing China's favorable status "before it achieved documented progress on human rights." Human rights groups said they were eager to see the details of the President's executive order. Curt Goering, acting executive director of Amnesty International in the United States, said the Administration should demand that detainees be allowed to see their lawyers and relatives and that commissions be established to investigate allegations of torture.
Michael Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Asia Watch, said it was important that the Administration make sure that China's compliance with the announced conditions be verifiable.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: Families;
$1.3 Billion Aims to Keep Families Intact

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Despite a debate that led to a freeze on most automatic spending programs, the budget approved today by the House of Representatives includes a big new cash program for states to help them keep children out of foster care.
Under the program, state child-welfare agencies would get Federal aid to help them keep families intact rather than placing children in foster care. 
 The family preservation program would cost $1.3 billion over the next five years, rising sharply from $60 million next year until 1998, when it would provide $600 million. From then on, the program would continue to increase in line with future inflation.
The money would be spent to pay for intensive counseling and therapy for children and their parents, either when a child is on the verge of being removed from his or her home, or when a child in temporary foster care is about to be returned home.
 
Aim of Program
 The goal is to counteract the problems caused by an explosive growth in foster care over the past decade.
"For the first time, this program looks to see if you can have early intervention to keep families together," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, a leading proponent of the measure.
While the Federal Government spends billions of dollars each year matching state payments for foster care, little Federal aid has been aimed at keeping families intact. A similar bill passed the House and the Senate last year as part of a tax and urban aid program, but it was vetoed by President George Bush after the election.
The program's likely enactment this year could have a profound influence on local decisions about removing children from families in crisis.
The program has strong support in the Clinton Administration from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, who advocated the program as chairwoman of the nonprofit Children's Defense Fund, and from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who sponsored the Senate version of the legislation that was vetoed.
 
Flaws Seen in Bill
 But the new program has raised concerns from some child welfare professionals. They argue that it will encourage the child protection system to leave children in abusive or neglectful homes when they should be put into foster care or placed for adoption.
"Our concern is that the kids whose families can't be preserved are left out of this bill, and they have the most serious problems," said Mary Beth Seader of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group representing private nonprofit adoption agencies. "Not every family can be saved."
"Family preservation programs have been studied, and there is no proof that they work," she said.
Republicans in the House, who fought to have automatic spending reduced in the bill that was considered today, attacked the plan to include this new program when there are already six automatic-spending programs devoted to child welfare. Entitlement programs, as they are known, are those whose financing, once set into law, continues automatically without annual Congressional action.
 
Gains for New York State
 New York State would be a major beneficiary of the new program because its funds are apportioned to the states on the basis of how many children in each state receive food stamp benefits. According to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, New York State would get 7.7 percent of the total Federal money.
Last year, New York State for the first time put a cap on the amount it would spend on foster care, and New York City set aside up to 5 percent of its foster-care budget for a program in which social workers intervene in families to keep children from being placed in foster care.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET;
A Deficit-Cutting Scorecard

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
To Republicans, President Clinton's economic package is the largest tax increase in history. Democrats insist it is the biggest deficit cut.
Inevitably, both sides are wrong. And right. 
 The Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper in such matters, estimates that the package will increase taxes by $270 billion over five years. That appears to make it larger than the 1982 tax increase, which raised $215 billion in new taxes over five years under President Ronald Reagan.
But if inflation is factored in, the Clinton package raises taxes less.
Viewed another way, the Clinton package would raise taxes in its fifth year by slightly more than 0.9 percent of gross domestic product. The Reagan tax increase ends up being larger because it increased taxes in its fifth year by 1.3 percent of gross domestic product. The Reagan tax increase followed the 1981 tax cut, which slashed taxes each year by 5.5 percent of the gross domestic product.
The deficit debate is murkier. The Congressional Budget Office says it cannot estimate the size of the package exactly because parts of it are not before Congress.
The White House estimates that over five years it will cut the deficit by $500 billion, $350 billion of which was voted on today. According to the Congressional Budget Office, President Bush's budget accord of 1990 would have cut the deficit by $496 billion over five years. But if inflation is factored in, Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction package ends up being slightly smaller.

HEADLINE: Christopher Reaffirms Leading U.S. Role in World

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, May 27

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that despite the Government's fiscal difficulties, the United States would continue to take the lead in international affairs.
Mr. Christopher made his comments in the wake of questions that arose when Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal budget deficit would force the United States to be more judicious in deciding when to assume a leadership role in international crises. 
 The Administration immediately disavowed Mr. Tarnoff's comments. But the concern over their possible repercussions is apparently great enough to cause Mr. Christopher's speechwriters to redraft remarks he delivered to an students and faculty at the University of Minnesota today. While the main theme of the speech remained the need to provide aid to Russia, Mr. Christopher devoted more time to the determination of the United States to remain in the forefront in world affairs.
"I think our need to lead, our determination to lead is not constrained by our resources," Mr. Christopher said in a brief interview here. "I think that where we need to lead, where our vital interests are threatened, we will find the resources to accomplish that."
In the speech, sponsored by the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, Mr. Christopher repeated what he said in a television interview this week: that the United States would at times act unilaterally, and at other times try to mobilize multinational efforts.
 
'Must Be More Engaged'
 Such consideration, he said, would depend on the perception of vital American interests rather than on the country's financial resources. That was the major difference between his view and the one expressed by Mr. Tarnoff, Mr. Christopher said.
"Some say -- and I'm sure you've heard this said -- that our nation is on a course of decline, that we can no long afford to lead," Mr. Christopher told an audience of about 1,200 that overflowed a concert hall on the college campus. "And certainly, it is true that the United States faces many challenges unlike our nation has ever felt before in our history. But to me, that means that we must be more engaged internationally, not less; more ardent in the promotion of democracy, not less; and more inspired in our leadership, not less."
Mr. Tarnoff's remarks came after Russia and the European allies rejected an American plan to aid the Bosnian Government and the Administration declined to act alone. Today Mr. Christopher called the war in Bosnia a "quagmire" and a "morass" and said the United States would not act unilaterally there.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton's Question-and-Answer Session in the Rose Garden

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's meeting today in the White House Rose Garden as transcribed by Federal News Service. The moderators were Harry Smith and Paula Zahn of "CBS This Morning."
PRESIDENT CLINTON There was an agreement made last night that I had been supporting for a good long while, sponsored by the conservative Democrats, essentially to put a mechanism in the budget to force us every year to make the budget cuts that we say we're making in this five-year budget; that is, it's obviously very hard to predict what will happen in every year for the next five years. 
 If you had to do a family budget for five years, it might not be possible, or a business budget or a farm budget. So these numbers are as good as we can make them. But this amendment actually says that every year, if we miss the deficit reduction target, the President has to bring in a plan to meet it and the Congress has to vote on it. And if they want to change it some, they can, but we've got to meet the deficit reduction target. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	MS. ZAHN What happens if you don't get this through in the House today?
A. We keep working until we get a budget through. The real problem is -- I think that there are two problems. One is that the details of the plan have been lost in the rhetoric. The second is that a lot of the Republicans who might otherwise want to vote with us got into a position where they said they wouldn't vote for any tax.
Over 60 percent of this money, of the tax money, over 60 percent comes from people with incomes over $200,000. Seventy-four percent of it comes from people with incomes over $100,000, people whose taxes went down in the 80's while their incomes went up. People with incomes under $30,000 are protected even from the B.T.U. tax. And next year, people in the middle will pay about a dollar, and it goes to $7 a month and then about $15 month. I think that -- but a lot of -- we have to get all of our votes apparently from the Democrats this time. I hope it won't happen anymore.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
'What Went Wrong?'
 MR. SMITH I just want to see a raise of hands this morning -- and don't be intimidated just because you're in the Rose Garden. . . . Do you feel like there's been a gap between the promises of the campaign and the performance thus far? If you think so, raise your hand. So a lot of folks feel that way. What went wrong?
A. First of all, I don't know that anything went wrong except I'm glad nobody found out about the manicure I got in California. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	What went wrong was I was not able to keep the public focus on the issues that we're working on after I gave the State of the Union address, even though that's what we kept doing. Now, look, we've been here four months and look what's happened in four months. They give you a four-year term. Look what's happened in four months.
We had a major foreign policy challenge in Russia right after I got in office. If Yeltsin had gotten beat in Russia and a militant regime had returned, we would have had to turn around with the defense budget. A lot of bad things could have happened to America. The United States went to work, organized the rest of the world, supported Yeltsin. He won the election. We're back on track there making this world a safer place. That's my No. 1 job. I think that's pretty impressive.
The Congress passed a resolution committing to do a budget that reduced the deficit by $500 billion on time for the first time in 17 years. Congress passed the family leave bill they've been fooling around with for eight years to guarantee people some time off without losing their jobs. They passed the motor-voter bill they'd been fooling around with for years. No one now asks, Are we going to reduce the deficit? The question is, How much, and how? No one now asks, Are we ever going to do anything about health care? The question is, When, and exactly what are we going to do? I think that's a pretty good record for four months.

 	 	 		. . .	 	MS. ZAHN But the fact is, you've also had to do a lot of fighting with Democrats of your own party. And I think a lot of people were hoping with a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress that things were going to move more smoothly. Do you think issues like the haircut and the problems in the travel office have made it harder for you to get this economic plan through?
A. No. I think this economic plan is tough. I think it does, because if you publicize something like that -- and people don't know, for example, on the haircut, that I asked whether anybody would be held up or inconvenienced, and I was told no. I asked twice and I was told no. And I would never do that, not in 100 years, not ever.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Travel Office Dismissals
 MR. SMITH You know what? We need to talk about this -- travelgate. Who knew what when? And why was the F.B.I. called in? And why did you hire your cousin? And why did you have a firm from Arkansas take over this business? And --
A. First of all, let's get back to the beginning, O.K.? Let's talk about my cousin. She's about my fifth or sixth cousin who worked in the campaign and ran the travel operations. But we had a very efficient travel operation. Every operation of the White House was reviewed because I said I was going to cut the White House staff by 25 percent. That's not easy to do.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We found out that there were seven people working in the travel office, primarily to book travel for the press, and that the press was complaining that the cost was too high. So there were all of these recommendations made to change it. But nothing was done until an accounting firm came in and reviewed the operation and found serious management questions in terms of unaccounted-for funds and things like that. So then, the person in charge of that made the decision to replace them.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Relations With China
 Q. My name is Eleanor Philips. I'm from Tarzana, Calif. I've been going to China since 1980 -- seven or eight times. I've lived and worked in China for two years. I'm very concerned about what you're going to do with the . . . most favored nation.

 	 	 		. . .	 	MR. SMITH Is this a done deal, your decision on this?
A. I think it is a done deal for the next year. Let me explain the issue here. In order for a country to trade with us, they have to get what's called 'most favored nation status' in order to have big trade. China is a huge trading partner of ours. We have our, I think now, our second biggest trading deficit with China, just behind Japan. They've got one of the fastest growing economies in the world. They're moving away from Communism to market economics very quickly. They still put political prisoners in jail. They still, we think, have used prison labor to make products. And we have some other problems with them.
The issue is, should we revoke that or should we put conditions on it. I basically have decided to extend most favored nation status for a year because I want to support modernization in China. And it's a great opportunity for America there. But I want to make it clear to them that there has to be some progress on human rights and the use of prison labor. Our trade disputes and our disputes about arms sales, I'm going to take out of this issue and negotiate directly with them.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Health-Care Plan
 Q. My name is Dan Beeman. I'm from Springfield, Mo. . . . I work for a company that has less than 500 employees. I pay $50 a month for a health plan, a dental plan, life insurance. Our health plan is self insured. I am concerned -- I don't want to pay more money for health care individually. I'm concerned that my employer may be taxed and have to pay more money and I would receive less benefits than I'm receiving, as well as I want to keep my self-funded health plan. How would the change in health care, how would it affect me as an individual?
A. Well, let me say, first of all, one of the decisions that has not been finalized yet, at least in our original report, is to what extent any companies of any size should be able to, in effect, continue their self-insurance efforts. And that's a tough issue, because what we're trying to do is to get these pools of insurance big enough for small businesses to have affordable health care, because that's been a back-breaker for a lot of small businesses.
The requirement that they're working on in terms of financial contribution would not be a tax over and above what people are paying now. They're trying to hit the national average, maybe even a little below the national average of what employers are paying now. And many, many employers and employees in this country will actually save money if the health-care plan comes into effect. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Homosexuals in the Military
 Q. Mr. President, my name is Bill Roberts. I'm the senior Pastor at Christ Chapel in Woodbridge, Virginia. . . . Allow me to ask the question . . . about the issue of gays in the military, if I may. I'm concerned about the degradation of morality in our nation and our society in the military as a whole.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A. There are and always have been homosexuals in the military. The question is whether they should be kicked out, not because of what they do but because of who they are. My view is, people should be judged on their conduct. I have not called for any change in the Uniform Code of Conduct. I simply believe if people work hard, play by the rules and serve, they ought to be able to serve. That does not imply that the rest of the society agrees with the life style, but you just accept as a fact that there are in every country, and always have been, homosexuals who are capable of honoring their country, laying down their lives for their country, and serving. And they should be judged based on their behavior not their life style.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Most Americans believe if you don't ask and you don't say and you're not forced to confront it, people should be able to serve. Most Americans believe that the gay life style should not be promoted by the military or anybody else in this county. The issue is a narrow one: should you be able to acknowledge, if asked, that you are homosexual? And if you don't do anything wrong, should you be booted from the military?
We are trying to work this out so that our country does not -- I understand what you're saying -- so that our country does not appear to be endorsing a gay life style, but we accept people as people and give them a chance to serve if they play by the rules. I think that is the tough issue for us. And I think we're very close to resolving it here.
MS. ZAHN Could you be satisfied with 'Don't ask, don't tell, don't investigate?' Might that be where you might end up?
A. Well, we might end up that way as long as it doesn't lead to a whole range of deliberate outings. Do you know what I mean? We don't want to make it worse. I think we're very close to a compromise along those lines. And I think most Americans will agree when it works out that people are treated properly if they behave properly without the Government appearing to endorse a life style. I think that's what you're concerned about, and it's a legitimate concern. But I have to deal with people as people. And I've had so many people in the military come up to me and say that they have served with homosexuals who served bravely in Vietnam and other places, who were good people who did not violate any rules. It is them that I am trying to protect.

HEADLINE: Dow Hits New High but Other Indexes Lag

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose to another record yesterday, gaining 14.67 points to 3,554.83, but in contrast to Wednesday's record session, the rest of the market failed to follow.
Analysts said the market might have lacked direction because of the House of Representatives' scheduled vote on President Clinton's economic program. The budget plan passed, some five hours after the market closed, by a vote of 219 to 213. 
 Nonetheless, trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 300.8 million shares, compared with 274.2 million shares on Wednesday. Much of the trading, however, was concentrated in large companies like Chevron, Caterpillar and United Technologies, which are Dow component stocks.
 
 
Gold Shares Jump
 In another contrast to Wednesday's trading, gold prices and gold stocks rose sharply. Investors sought investments other than Government bonds, which still offer relatively low yields, and the dollar, which has dropped to a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen.
Gold for June delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange rose $6.10 an ounce, to $381.40, and gold stocks closed mostly higher. Newmont Mining rose 1 7/8, to 52 1/4, and Echo Bay Mines rose 7/8, to 12. Echo Bay was the most-active stock on the American Stock Exchange, as it has been in many recent sessions, with 2.43 million shares changing hands.
While the Dow rose, the Standard & Poor's 500, which has a greater variety of stocks, fell 1.03, to 452.41. The Nasdaq composite index, with more than 3,500 smaller-capitalization and high-technology stocks, gained 0.5 point, to 704.59.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.47 point, to 249.43, and losing stocks outnumbered winners on the Big Board by 998 to 923.
 The Dow was lifted mainly by two stocks, Chevron and Caterpillar. Chevron closed up 3 3/4, to 88 5/8, after announcing an ambitious restructuring program that impressed industry analysts.
Caterpillar, the maker of construction machinery, hit a new high of 73 before closing up 2 3/8, to 72 3/4. There was no discernible news to account for Caterpillar's rise, but many portfolio managers have bought cyclical stocks like Caterpillar, which could benefit from an economic recovery, as part of their investment strategy.
British Petroleum and Tele-Communications were the most noteworthy stocks yesterday in terms of trading volume. Trading remains high in British Petroleum shares, partly because of Triton Energy's Colombian oilfield project. British Petroleum is a partner in Triton. The company's American depositary receipts closed up 1/8, to 58 1/2. With 8.4 million A.D.R.'s changing hands, British Petroleum was the most-active stock yesterday on any exchange.
Tele-Communications, the cable television company, closed up 1/2, to 23 3/8 following upbeat and assertive remarks by its chairman, John C. Malone, at the company's annual meeting. Mr. Malone predicted "a bloodlet on both sides" over whether the television networks can charge cable operators to carry their programs. Capital Cities/ABC closed down 7 5/8, to 524 7/8, in light trading.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Press Japan On Broadening Imports

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
In an attempt to end criticism that it is selfishly trying to help only American companies, the Clinton Administration plans to take a new tack in trade talks and press Japan more than ever to increase imports from all countries and not just the United States, Administration officials said today.
The officials, who spoke on the condition that they would not be identified, said the change would be part of a new trade strategy toward Japan that is scheduled to be announced next week. They said they would try to enlist European countries in the effort. 
 In the past, European countries have described Washington as a selfish bully that had pressed Japan to increase its imports from the United States but not other countries.
Foreign officials have said the unilateral pressuring to open Japan to American goods and services, when backed by threats of retaliation, had violated international trade rules and sought to create improper favoritism for American companies.
 
Bringing International Pressure
 This time, an American official said, "While the talks will be bilateral, the focus will be multilateral."
Administration officials said they hoped to bring maximum international pressure on Japan before the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations met in Tokyo from July 7 through July 9. They planned to press Japan to agree to import more in specific sectors and to do more to stimulate its economy to end its slump -- a move that should increase its demand for imports.
Some American officials said they saw an opportunity to wrest concessions from Tokyo because Japanese officials were usually eager to minimize foreign disapproval -- and embarrassment -- when the world's spotlight was turned on them.
Under the new approach, the United States might press Japan to increase imports of certain goods by a specific amount, but those additional imports would not have to come from the United States.
"They won't be able to use the excuse that we're not going to import more widgets, because the widgets made in the United States aren't as good as those made in Japan," one official said. "Under this policy, Japan could always buy widgets from other countries."
 
Complaints About Pact
 In Washington's existing semiconductor agreement with Japan, Tokyo had promised to help insure that foreign-made computer chips would capture 20 percent of the Japanese market. While the accord was not limited to American chips, some foreign officials have complained that the pact was most beneficial to American producers.
"We have never said, 'Let's look at what's in the interests of the whole world," one American official said. "We said, 'What are the problem areas for us.' Obviously we'll look for areas where we're the most competitive."
American officials said all countries would benefit if Washington succeeded in its goal of pressing Japan to reduce its current account surplus to less than 2 percent of gross domestic product; it is now running at nearly 4 percent. Many economists predicted that Japan's surplus would exceed $150 billion this year, with its surplus with the United States representing about one-third of that.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Treasury Prices Fall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Short-term Treasury prices were hit hard yesterday amid more reports that the Federal Reserve had decided to set a policy biased toward raising short-term interest rates.
But the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was down only slightly and the yield was unchanged at 6.92 percent. Combined with the sharp rise in shorter-term yields, the gap between short- and long-term yields narrowed to its smallest spread of the year. 
 The price of the two-year Treasury note, which was auctioned Tuesday, was off 6/32 point as the yield jumped to 4.24 percent from 4.14 percent Wednesday. The yield at the auction was 4.17 percent.
The price of the new five-year note was also off sharply, falling 8/32 as the yield rose to 5.35 percent from 5.29 percent. The yield at the auction Wednesday was 5.39 percent, but it fell to 5.29 percent in a late rally that afternoon.
 
 
CNBC Report
 What hurt the shorter end was a report on CNBC that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was nearly unanimous when it decided May 18 to shift from neutral to biased toward raising short-term interest rates if inflation continues to rise. The decision gave the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, the authority to move on his own to raise short-term rates if there was a need to do so before the policy group met again in early July.
Although the Fed has not disclosed what it decided, it had been reported earlier this week that the Fed had voted in favor of a bias to higher interest rates. But the report of a near unanimity in the vote added to the conclusion in the market that the Fed could act quickly if inflation, which rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first four months of the year, did not subside.
The flattening, or narrowing, of the yield curve -- the spread between short-term and long-term yields - had been expected since April inflation reports came in higher than expected and talk began that the Fed, despite the sluggishness of the economy, might have to raise short-term rates to prove that it would resist rising prices.
But the sharp narrowing yesterday, with the spread dropping 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 268, was a little surprising. That was in part because traders said they would have expected the price and yield of the 30-year bond to suffer more, given two other events that affected trading.
 
 
Jump in Gold Price
 One event was a jump in the price of gold back over the $380 level, which some analysts took as a sign that expectations of higher inflation are taking hold. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the price of gold for June delivery rose $6.10, to close at $381.40 an ounce.
Another was the sharp drop in the dollar. It fell to another post-World War II low against the Japanese yen, closing at 107.20 yen to the dollar in New York, despite repeated intervention to support the dollar by the Federal Reserve. On the day, the dollar was down 1.2 percent against the yen and 1.5 percent against the German mark.
The decline in the dollar also has inflationary consequences because it makes imports more expensive. In addition, it appears that domestic car makers are raising prices under the cover of price increases that have been forced on the Japanese manufacturers because of the decline in the dollar.
"I was surprised that the market did not sell off across the board with the weaker dollar today," said Stephen Slifer, financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. "That is usually inflationary."
Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, said that it did not appear that debate in the House on President Clinton's economic and deficit reduction legislation had a big impact on the market yesterday. The package survived a key vote early in the afternoon while trading was still under way. The final vote, 219 to 213 in favor of the plan, came last night after the close of the market.
The President worked to gather support for the plan with a last- minute compromise that would include a form of spending caps on programs like Medicare. But because similar caps have been tried in the past -- and failed -- it is not clear if this will give the bond market any more confidence that the President's plan, which promises deficit reduction, will actually achieve it.

HEADLINE: PEROT VS. CLINTON: WAR OF THE WORDS

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 27

 BODY:
Ross Perot asserts that President Clinton does not have enough executive experience to handle "the toughest job in the world."
The President dismisses Mr. Perot as a political malcontent who "doesn't like my state." White House aides go even further, asserting that Mr. Perot, a Texan who made billions as a computer entrepreneur, is a man "desperate for attention." 
 The latest exchange comes as Mr. Clinton's ability to govern is being questioned in many quarters, particularly on Capitol Hill, where his economic plan faces crucial tests.
It also comes as Mr. Perot faces mounting criticism that he has been dictatorial in managing his organization, United We Stand America.
 
A Question of Experience
 Mr. Perot opened his new offensive on Tuesday in an interview with David Frost. He said that Mr. Clinton had enough executive experience to handle a "middle management" job in a medium-sized company but not enough for the White House.
This morning, on NBC's "Today," Mr. Perot continued his attack: "His background and experience didn't prepare him for the toughest job in the world. He's very bright. He has a high energy level. But right now he has a learning curve that's like a cliff."
The President, when asked Wednesday by reporters how he planned to deal with Mr. Perot's latest charges, at first quipped, "You deal with it." But when pressed, he added: "Well, we know he doesn't like my state. He spent several million dollars to bad-mouth it last year. But that doesn't have much to do with America."
In the first few months after the election, in which Mr. Perot ran third with 19 percent of the vote, he seemed to go out of his way to avoid attacking Mr. Clinton, saying the President deserved time to prove himself.
 
Verbal Cease-Fire Ends
 But about a month ago, Mr. Perot, who in the meantime had been working hard to build up his own political organization, apparently concluded that Mr. Clinton had been accorded more than enough time. He began to attack.
The President responded in kind.
Last Sunday at a rally in Kansas City, Mr. Perot began an all-out assault, saying the President had mishandled everything from economic policy to White House travel arrangements. He then spent 10 minutes of his 90-minute speech poking fun at the two-hour break Mr. Clinton had taken at the Los Angeles airport for a haircut.
Mr. Perot reiterated most of those charges this morning, adding: "When you're $4 trillion in debt, you cannot afford to make mistakes of the magnitude they are pushing for now. We have to be very careful not to do further damage to our country and our economy while they are getting organized, learning how to do the job."
While Mr. Clinton dismissed Mr. Perot yesterday as a malcontent, Paul Begala, a top Presidential adviser, accused Mr. Perot of being "desperate for attention," adding: "When he goes to a wedding, he wants to be the bride. When he goes to a funeral, he wants to be the corpse. He just wants to be the center of attention."

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Retaliation On Europe

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Following through on a public pledge last month, the Clinton Administration released regulations yesterday that would ban companies from nine European countries from bidding for Federal Government contracts for legal services, certain telephone service and other services.
The ban, which takes effect today, covers $29 billion a year worth of contracts andis in retaliation for new European Community rules that discourage sales of American telecommunications equipment there, said an American official who insisted on anonymity. But the actual effect of the sanctions is likely to be tiny because many of the services are highly local, like operating airport concessions. 
 European companies won an average of only $20 million a year worth of these contracts from 1989 through 1991, the official said.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, announced last month that the new regulations would be issued after negotiations with the European Community failed to resolve the dispute. Mr. Kantor made the announcement the same day that a nearly identical dispute over European rules on electrical power generation equipment was resolved.
Mr. Kantor had originally threatened in early February to bar European companies from $50 billion a year worth of contracts, of which the companies typically won only $45 million a year. The sanctions announced today were only half as large because of the settlement on power generation equipment.
 
American Move Is Condemned
 Sir Leon Brittan, the community's Commissioner for External Economic Affairs, nonetheless condemned the American move. "I greatly regret the U.S. decision," he said in a statement. "In view of the progress we have made, notably on public procurement, it is neither justified, wise nor necessary."
Sir Leon issued a thinly veiled threat that the community might retaliate, but stopped short of saying that it was willing to risk a broader confrontation by abandoning the 112-nation global free trade talks that began nearly seven years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
"We are not going to allow this issue to delay or frustrate the progress we are making in the Uruguay Round, nor let it poison the atmosphere, but the U.S. cannot expect us to ignore wholly unjustified action of this kind," he said.
There are 12 countries in the European Community. The American sanctions apply to only nine of them because Greece, Portugal and Spain have agreed to give American companies some access to their markets for telephone company equipment.
Utilities in the European Community buy about $20 billion a year worth of telecommunications equipment and an equal amount of power generation equipment.
The likelihood of actual counter-retaliation is unclear, because it would require the endorsement of 9 or 10 European countries, European officials said in recent interviews in Brussels. Germany, Britain and the Netherlands have all been reluctant in the past to endorse trade sanctions, although it is not clear where they stand this time.
The community's council of foreign ministers, which would make the final decision on any counter-retaliation, is next scheduled to meet on June 8. A European official who insisted on anonymity said that counter-retaliation was likely but not certain.
The dispute began several years ago when the European Community drafted new regulations for government purchases of telecommunications and electrical power generation equipment, to take effect on Jan. 1 of this year. The new rules, which replaced varying and more restrictive government procurement rules in each of the 12 member countries, allow European utilities to reject bids from non-European companies on two grounds: if less than half of the goods for the bid are made inside the community or if a European company submits a bid that is up to 3 percent more expensive.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative during the Bush Administration, announced in February 1992 that the United States would take action by the end of January 1993 if the rules took effect. Mr. Kantor ended up extending this deadline three times in an effort to strike a deal.

Pact Gains in Canada
 By Bloomberg Business News
 OTTAWA, May 27 -- The North American Free Trade Agreement cleared its first legislative hurdle today when Canada's House of Commons approved the pact's implementing legislation by a vote of 140 to 124. The bill now proceeds for a vote in Canada's Senate; the Conservative Government holds a majority in both the Commons and the Senate. Passage of similar legislation in Mexico and the United States is required before Canada puts the accord into force, the spokesman said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices for Platinum Reach 2-Year High as Metals Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices rose to a two-year high yesterday as precious metals soared in response to a weaker dollar, strong overseas buying and uncertainties over Russian supplies.
Platinum for July delivery surged $10.40 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $399.20 an ounce, the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since April 17, 1991, when the market settled at $402.80. July prices touched the psychologically important $400 level during the session. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, June gold rose $6.10 to $381.40 an ounce and July silver jumped 13.7 cents to $4.70 an ounce.
 
Rally Seen Building Momentum
 The decisive rise in metal prices after a week of back-and-forth action suggests the broad rally that began in mid-March has solidified, said James Steel, a metals analyst with Refco Inc., a New York brokerage.
He said platinum benefited from strong Japanese buying and from gains in the palladium market on worries that Russia, a major producer, cannot meet its normal delivery commitments for that metal.
Precious metals in general were supported by the dollar's weakness against major foreign currencies, which could have inflationary effects. Precious metals are traditional investment hedges against inflation.
Buying in the gold market erased Wednesday's losses as participants grew convinced that a rumored sharp increase in Russian gold reserves was exaggerated, Mr. Steel said.
The reversal from Wednesday's downturn also fueled buying, said Stephen W. Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "You keep looking for the corrections and they keep falling short of your expectations," he said. Those events reinforce the notion among investors that the rally in precious metals is solid, he said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Unchanged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged last week, the Government said today.
New applications for unemployment benefits totaled 340,000 for a second straight week, the Labor Department said. For the week that ended on May 8, the total was revised down to 337,000 from 344,000. 
 The four-week moving average of jobless claims fell by 1,500, to 339,750, the lowest since the period that ended Feb. 20, when it stood at 334,250. Analysts prefer the four-week average because it smoothes out weekly variations and more accurately reflects the labor situation.
The report also said that 25,468 applications were filed under a Federal emergency unemployment program during the week that ended on May 15, down from 25,826 the previous week. The emergency claims and individual state figures lag behind the overall total and the four-week moving average by one week.
Forty states and territories showed decreased claims during the week that ended on May 15, while 13 had increases.
California reported the largest decline, a drop of 5,782 that was attributed to fewer layoffs in agriculture.

Modest Proposals From Immodest Fans

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
"I will accept the job," said Bill Murray, who is also part-owner of the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League, "if you give me unlimited powers."
"Get serious," I told the comic actor. "If the job came with unlimited powers, I would take it myself." 
 He curled his lip and eyebrows simultaneously, a dangerous signal. I edged back into the maw of a GQ magazine cocktail party for Peter Richmond's tasty new book about Camden Yards, "Ballpark" (Simon & Schuster).
While my private search for a new Commissioner of Baseball has not exacty been the season of living dangerously, I've had to be alert. There are heady emotions out there. People really care about The Pastime. There have been so many letters and phone calls applying for, no, demanding, the job that I have been able to conduct only one more formal luncheon interview.
But first, the applications.
Charles Brocato of Staten Island submitted a thoughtful 11-page "revitalization" proposal stressing fair-play business practices. If Brocato doesn't get the job, his proposal will be sent to whoever does, including Jason B. Harris, a 27-year-old public relations executive from Chicago, whose 10-point plan includes youth leagues, more doubleheaders and a "Take In a Baseball Game While At Work" radio campaign.
Frank R. Badali of Middletown, N.J., has proposed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a former minor league player, as the next commissioner. Robert N. Sillars Jr. of Darien, Conn., has proposed the political pundit George Will, author of the baseball treatise, "Men at Work" (Macmillan, 1990).
Gerry Gold of Bethesda, Md., while recommending Felix Rohatyn as a resource, wisely did not link a prospective commissioner with his own radical plan; he would wrest control from "the current generation of owners . . . a national disgrace" and distribute 95 percent of the stock of major league clubs to the general public. Tod Parrott of Larchmont, N.Y., son of Harold, former traveling secretary of the Dodgers, is promoting the candidacy of his brother, Brian, a Portland, Ore., sports entrepeneur.
"Baseball needs a spiritual leader," maintains Rabbi Benjamin A. Kamin of The Temple, a Reform Jewish congregation in Cleveland. The rabbi's application arrived with various published Op-Ed pieces and the admission that he has been lobbying Milwaukee owner and Commissioner pro temp Bud Selig for months.
Even more aggressive than Rabbi Kamin was Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who thundered, "That job is mine. I've been preparing for it all my life."
Over the second glass of red wine at The Ballroom, a Manhattan tapas restaurant, Glasser modified that statement. The passion truly began, he said, when he was a 9-year-old Brooklyn Dodger fan and Jackie Robinson appeared at Ebbets Field.
"My generation of white kid grew up identifying with the struggle of a black man," Glasser said. "It was accessible, it was in prime time. It was an integration of the soul."
Does that mean Glasser would use the commissioner's platform for social engineering?
"The game may be a social instrument," he said, "but you can't approach it as a social engineer. You have to be pragmatic. Hey, in my job I deal with unions, negotiations, employees all the time. The first thing I'd want to do is convince the owners that they are a single employer, an economic entity, all dependent on each other. Their product is exciting competition.
"Next, what I call 'the fiction of loyalty' must be returned to the game. Players have to be loyal to their clubs and clubs have to be loyal to their fans and fans have to be loyal to their players. We can't go choosing sides every year. There has to be continuity. Long-term contracts. No jumping around from team to team. The worst traits of the owners have been transferred to the players, and the fans are losing interest.
"And let's not forget this is a kids' game. How do we make sure the kids are awake for the World Series? How do we keep the playoffs without allowing them to cheapen the long season?"
Reminded that he hadn't been called in to ask questions, Glasser, a quick, lively man of 55, submitted to the standard litmus questions of the search interview.
He said that he would allow Pete Rose into the Hall of Fame, since that honor is for performance, not character. He said he would like to investigate the amazing size of contemporary gloves, the vagaries of the strike zone and the possibility of eliminating artificial turf and the designated hitter. It would close the circle of his own education as a fan, he said, if the first woman player entered the major leagues during his time as commissioner.
Asked about his chances, I told him truthfully that Jim Bouton and Richard Ravitch were already on the short list, and that Bill Murray, although he would become an owner next month with the opening of the new independent minor Northern League, was also under serious consideration. After all, Baseball is an entertainment. Maybe it needs, for a change, a commissioner who admits he's a comedian.
Glasser bristled. "Baseball is a serious part of American culture. No one would say that ballet or opera is merely entertainment."

A Sample of Drawings From the Getty's Riches

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
The drawings collection at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., a selection from which has gone on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is one of the recent success stories in the museum world. A cynic might say the collection goes to show merely what great wads of money can buy. And to a point, that cynic would be right. Certainly no other museum and few private collectors could have afforded the array of pricey works that the Getty acquired since it began buying drawings a dozen years ago.
But there is money well spent and money merely spent, and this exhibition of 121 works proves that the world's richest museum, as it has inevitably come to be known, has distinguished itself above all in this department. 
 One drawing after another is of a quality to inspire envy among rival museums and awe among just about everyone else. The Getty may have paid extravagantly, but who would question the wisdom of buying a work as near to perfection as Raphael's "St. Paul Rending His Garments"? The same goes for a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger, acquired in one of the Chatsworth sales in London a decade ago, that gave such a lift to the Getty when it was just beginning to put its drawings collection together. It also goes for a dazzling Cezanne still-life watercolor bought 10 years ago for a price that today, considering the sum recently paid for a still-life painting by the artist, can seem like a bargain.
But more important, the Getty has acquired plenty of stellar drawings for comparatively moderate prices, works by artists like Pontormo and Parmigianino that are among the highlights of this exhibition. And it has ferreted out drawings that have been overlooked by less savvy buyers, as in the case of an Albrecht Altdorfer that was sold in 1985 at a London auction as the work of a lesser artist.
The credit for all this belongs to George R. Goldner, the Getty's curator of drawings (and since 1990, its curator of paintings, too). Mr. Goldner is nothing if not shrewd. He joined the Getty in 1979 as head of the department of photo archives, working in a windowless basement office pasting photographs onto white cards. But he was a scholar of Old Master drawings, and when a red chalk drawing by Rembrandt of a naked Cleopatra came up for sale at Christie's in London in 1981, he persuaded his superiors at the museum to buy it. J. Paul Getty himself had not collected drawings, and the nascent museum intended to acquire art only in those areas its founder had pursued: paintings, decorative arts and antiquities. But with a work as unimpeachable as the Rembrandt, Mr. Goldner came up with an offer the museum could hardly refuse.
The next year, drawings by Bernini, Fragonard, Goya, Ingres and Rubens joined the Rembrandt. And when John Walsh became director of the Getty in 1983, a department of drawings was officially established with Mr. Goldner as its head. Shortly after, Lee Hendrix was hired as an associate, and she brought a specialty in Northern art that complemented Mr. Goldner's strength in Italian art.
What they have done has proven to be something of an oddity in the museum world. Most museums acquire drawings, unlike paintings, to build a study collection, with works that demonstrate different techniques, works that relate to sculptures, paintings and prints in the museum, works by little-known and unknown artists. The Getty has turned out to be one of the few museums that collect drawings pretty much the way Henry Frick collected paintings: the emphasis is on amassing a comparatively few choice works by great artists. To be sure, the museum has made its share of speculative purchases, as in the case of the Altdorfer, although not all of them have turned out so fortunately. It has acquired examples by obscure artists, like Lucas van Uden and Jacopo Zucchi. And with Northern art in particular, it has occasionally bought lesser works to illustrate one or another point about the uses of drawing.
But the Getty has clearly been concerned with quality above all else. It has been helped along these lines by the fact that the 1980's, late though they may have seemed to begin collecting first-rate Old Masters, were in fact great years for such a pursuit. The Chatsworth sales in 1983 and 1987 and the sale of drawings from the collection of John Gaines in 1986 put many prime works on the market. A booming economy and a group of private collectors that included Ian Woodner, Leonardo Mondadori and Mr. Gaines, who were willing to pay top dollar for great drawings, further stimulated the market and inspired the sale of even more works, for which the Getty, almost alone among museums, had the money to compete. Others, notably the Art Institute of Chicago, acquired a large number of great drawings during the decade. But none bought more lavishly than the Getty.
This exhibition, organized by William M. Griswold, an assistant curator in the drawings department at the Metropolitan, in collaboration with Mr. Goldner and Ms. Hendrix, includes more than one-fourth of the nearly 400 works the Getty has accumulated so far. The show emphasizes breadth as much as quality, and with few exceptions (like some of the Northern drawings) the quality remains high. Raphael, Mantegna, Titian, Bassano, Piranesi, Martin Schongauer, Durer, Cranach, Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Watteau, Chardin, David and Ingres are all represented, and all of them by outstanding examples.
There is a Titian landscape, limpidly drawn and compellingly strange in its combination of a nude bather, a flock of sheep with goat and pig, two shepherds, the whole scene set against the backdrop of a burning city. There is a colored chalk drawing of feverish energy and flickering light depicting "Christ Driving the Money Changers From the Temple," by Titian's contemporary Bassano. By Schongauer is a gouache and watercolor study of peonies that is the epitome of precise draftsmanship and close observation. And by Watteau are two drawings, one of a group of musicians typical of the artist in its blending of physicality and nuance, the other a nude of unbelievable beauty characteristic in its exquisite eroticism.
The fanciest drawings are not always the most impressive. A landscape by Rembrandt that consists of precious few markings and makes cunning use of large stretches of the blank page turns out to be at least as memorable as the Cleopatra. A similarly understated and subtle rendition of a theatrical performance, by Francesco Guardi, holds its own in fast company, too. And so do drawings by relative lesser-knowns like Taddeo Zuccaro, whose red-and-black chalk sketches of figures exude a certain crazed energy, and like Girodet, whose highly finished "Phaedra Rejecting the Embraces of Theseus" is something else entirely. Don't miss any of them.
"Drawings From the J. Paul Getty Museum" remains on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Aug. 8. The show travels to the Royal Academy in London in October.

The Unconventional as a Convention

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
The small, wedge-shaped gallery at Storefront for Art and Architecture, which can resemble a nightmare torture chamber with sadistically contracting walls, is a poignant metaphor for the perennially pinched economic circumstances of this "alternative" downtown space. If the walls contracted one more inch, Storefront would be out on the street, and architecture would move another step closer to homelessness in the imperial city of real estate. No other New York gallery or museum has provided new architectural ideas with such stalwart shelter.
But the 90's have challenged the identity of alternative galleries. With the loosening of post-modernism's grip on the mainstream, and the weakening of the economy that supported it, the question arises: alternative to what? No one movement dominates architecture today. Theoretical "paper architecture," which once offered an alternative to conventional practice, has itself become a convention. Everything is an alternative on architecture's fragmented terrain. 
 "Discontinuous Spaces," a small show of recent work by the New York firm Smith-Miller & Hawkinson, tries to reckon with this changed configuration. Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson, the firm's principals, are not conventional commercial architects, but neither are they space cadets who think that to build is to compromise their artistic standards. Though the projects on view here -- a mix of commercial and residential designs and two large public works projects -- are designed to be built, they are conceptually sharp.
So is the show's installation. Working with the artist Silvia Kolbowski, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson has transformed Storefront's funky space into a pint-sized parody of a gallery at the Museum of Modern Art. Sloping plywood platforms straighten out the triangular floor into a more respectable rectangle. Bright overhead lighting, dazzling white walls, a gray painted floor and crisp modern graphics complete the clinical simulation, while the crumbling tin ceiling injects a hint of grunge. It's a downtown dream of uptown glory.
This kind of conceptual transposition is typical of Smith-Miller & Hawkinson's work. Many of their projects are intended to break down the barriers between dualisms like "uptown" and "downtown" by combining the visual forms that represent them. At times, their work can seem like word play, rather than design, especially in their collaborations with Barbara Kruger, a master of verbal visuals. They also want to erode architecture's conventional boundaries, as in two of the projects represented here: large, outdoor "art parks" for two American cities.
Working with Ms. Kruger and with the landscape architect Nicholas Quennell, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson seems to view architecture as a mediator between nature and culture. "The Textualized Landscape," shown here in models, is part of the team's master plan for a 160-acre park, now in construction, surrounding the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh. The words "picture this" are spelled out in jumbo (85-foot-tall) capital letters, variously executed in boulders, gravel, plantings, concrete and jets of sprayed mist. The picture we're asked to imagine could be a movie, shown on a giant outdoor screen (the plan provides seating for 2,500 people), or it could be a vision of nature projected on the mind's inner screen. Landscape is land transformed by the eye into a visual image.
"Unoccupied Territory," the team's entry in a 1989 competition to design a cultural park for Los Angeles, rethinks the idea of the urban park in a decentralized city. The concept here is recentralization; instead of following the competition's instructions to disperse built elements over the 60-acre site, this plan concentrates them in one corner. In the remaining acres, new landscaped areas are juxtaposed with terrain carved naturally by floods. It's Capability Brown in La-La Land: a post-modern, desert version of an artificially natural English garden.
Like the proverbial beauty who sports fake eyeglasses, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson seems to fear that people won't respect their minds. The team often accompanies its projects with elaborate texts, packed with more ideas than mere forms can easily convey. The most striking object in the show is a section from a metal canopy the firm designed to hang over the ticket counter at the new USAir Terminal at La Guardia. The wing-shaped form, designed in collaboration with Guy Nordenson of Ove Arup & Partners, floats within an airy skein of cables and glass panels. Whether or not travelers will grasp all the ideas behind it, this ethereal object nonetheless conveys a primal connection between flying and aspiration. It says, "Look up!"
Ascent is also a theme in a current project for the New Jersey Institute of Architecture in Newark. Asked to design a staircase in the open space between two existing campus buildings, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson has turned a simple circulation route into a place where people will want to linger. Made of steel and concrete, the stair will rise five stories in a gentle slope; broad steps at the top will provide informal seating. At once glamorous and severe, this is a theatrical design, like something Ziegfeld might have commissioned from Piranesi.
"Discontinuous Spaces" remains at Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare Street, at Lafayette Street, SoHo, through June 8. Laurie Hawkinson and Henry Smith-Miller are to give a lecture on their work at the Urban Center (457 Madison Avenue, at 51st Street) on Thursday at 6:30 P.M. Admission: $5.

American Dream Shrinks to a Nap

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Declining Fortunes
 The Withering of
 the American Dream
 By Katherine S. Newman
 257 pages. Basic Books. $23.
The message of "Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream," a new book by the anthropologist Katherine S. Newman, is a familiar one: namely that the middle class has been squeezed in recent years by the national economy and by Reagan-Bush economic policies; that a shrinking job market, rising housing costs, higher taxes and growing cost-of-living expenses have imperiled some of the most basic, optimistic assumptions of the American Dream. It's a message that was debated at length in last year's Presidential campaign, and a message examined in detail by Kevin Phillips's recent book, "Boiling Point: Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity." 
 Indeed, Ms. Newman appears to have taken as her jumping-off point one of Mr. Phillips's more casual observations: that Americans under the age of 35 are "in danger of being the first generation of Americans to suffer a lower standard of living than their parents" and "the first generation to receive -- or not receive -- much of their economic opportunity from family inheritance, not personal achievement."
What Ms. Newman proposes to do in "Declining Fortunes" is to examine these developments through the prism of a single suburban community. The community -- which she chooses to call Pleasanton -- is a small New Jersey town within commuting distance of New York City. She has changed the names of its residents to protect their privacy, and quotes them at length to illustrate her own ideas on the subject of the middle class's declining fortunes.
These ideas -- reiterated so many times as to bore the reader to distraction -- are neither new nor surprising. As Ms. Newman sees it, the postwar generation -- the generation that grew up with memories of the Depression and joined the work force during the booming 1950's -- benefited enormously from an upturn in the national economy, and from Government programs like the G.I. bill and low-interest mortgages, which swelled the ranks of the middle class. Successful members of this generation, says Ms. Newman, speak of their upward mobility in Horatio Alger terms of virtue and hard work, and tend to discount the role that large extra-personal forces had in shaping their prosperity. Their offspring -- members of the baby-boom generation -- have not been nearly as lucky.
Recession, unemployment, anemic rates of growth and higher living costs -- along with the sheer size of the baby-boom generation itself -- have combined, Ms. Newman argues, to make homeownership, "that essential piece of the American dream," harder and harder to achieve. Indeed, the unfortunate confluence of these developments, she says, effectively undermines the old article of faith that every generation will do better than the one that preceded it.
As seen through the lives of Pleasanton residents, this downturn in fortunes has led to disappointment and bitterness on the part of baby boomers and their younger siblings. It has also resulted, Ms. Newman reports, in changing patterns of living. Because financial security is increasingly elusive, baby boomers tend to marry later than their predecessors. They tend to have fewer children, and to have those children later. Women frequently continue working to supplement their husbands' incomes (here, Ms. Newman seriously underestimates the role that changing expectations and ambitions, wrought by the women's movement, have also played), though even with two incomes, baby-boom families find it more and more difficult to recreate their parents' standard of living.
As a consequence, there is a growing population of "boomerang" adults, that is, those who return home to live with their parents, and an increasing number of boomers who are forced to leave Pleasanton altogether for more inexpensive towns. This, in turn, Ms. Newman contends, leads to a dissolution of community, as outsiders -- many of them wealthy Asians -- move to Pleasanton, which in turn leads to growing resentments and racial tensions. The economic squeeze of the 1990's in general, adds Ms. Newman, has heightened feelings of prejudice toward both monied foreigners and the poor who benefit from welfare, as people from all income levels fight for bigger slices of a diminishing pie.
Having tossed off such unoriginal observations, Ms. Newman then switches gears and makes an impassioned appeal to members of the baby-boom generation to transcend their intergenerational differences (that is, the differences that separate the more idealistic boomers who grew up during the 1960's from the more pragmatic ones who came of age during the 80's) and unite as a political lobbying force.
"The baby-boom generation could become the most powerful political-interest group ever seen in the United States," Ms. Newman writes, pointing out that the elderly, a wealthy and well-organized population group, have long benefited from favorable governmental policies.
Although some of the interviews with Pleasanton residents succeed in giving the reader a highly personal sense of the consequences of America's economic problems, "Declining Fortunes" as a whole sheds little new light on the subject. Ms. Newman's prose is repetitious and long-winded, and it's put in the service of ideas that are banal, obvious or borrowed. Some of her generalizations are nothing more than shallow cliches. She solemnly declares that "without the boomers, we might never have seen the phenomenon of the Beatles, the Stones and the Grateful Dead, with their legions of followers now turning gray." And writing of one woman's desire to marry and have a family, she declares, "Edith's desire to settle into a 'Leave It to Beaver' life style was shared by virtually every other woman in Pleasanton."
This sort of silly attempt to make broad, anthropological generalizations undermines the intimacy of individual interviews in "Declining Fortunes," and it erases whatever positive feelings the reader might have had about this bloated, overly familiar book.

The Clinton Mystery

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
What has gone wrong with the Clinton Presidency? Can it be fixed? Or are we headed for another failure that will further erode public faith in the political system?
The questions are being asked -- astonishingly so, if you think how early it is. Four months into a new Administration, people who voted for it are wondering whether it can be saved. 
 Mr. Clinton has just won a big victory with House passage of his budget measure. That will raise morale in a bruised White House. But the doubts will not so easily go away.
It is the little things that hurt, as always in politics -- because they are a metaphor for larger worries. How could a man as smart as Bill Clinton tie up the Los Angeles Airport to get himself a $200 haircut? How could he be so oblivious to public reaction? Is there no one on his staff with the sense and the independence to tell him no?
Oblivious is the word, too, for the handling of the White House travel office affair. Put aside the cronyism charge being made by some in the press. Did no one on the Clinton staff understand how unfair it was to fire long-time employees as suspected wrongdoers without giving them a chance to defend themselves? Or how idiotic it would look to deny later that they had been fired?
The puzzle about this smart Administration is how it can be so oblivious to reality. And that goes much deeper than the attention-getting incidents of recent weeks.
A clue may lie in Mr. Clinton's campaign last year. It was a campaign of sweeping promises: sweeping and explicit. He did not just utter generalities about making America proud again. He said he would end welfare as we know it, end adult illiteracy within five years, give all Americans health care and pay for it out of cost controls, cut middle-class taxes, reduce the deficit. And so on.
Were those cynical promises by a candidate who knew how hard it would be to carry them out? To the contrary. Bill Clinton was part of a generation that rejected as an excuse the idea that things are hard to fix. It believed the country's problems stemmed from inept leadership, and believed it could solve them if it took power.
There is idealism in that view, but also dangerous naivete. The President is not a Galahad whose strength is as the strength of 10 if his heart is pure. Governing is hard work, the more so in a country whose Constitution divides power so it will be difficult to change things.
The President is the focus of the vast apparatus of modern communications. Americans look to him to solve all their problems. But the desire greatly outpaces the reality of Presidential power.
By all signs Bill Clinton believed in the Presidential myth when he took office. He seemed not to understand what it takes to govern: explaining, threatening, making friends, making enemies. Instead he wanted to be loved by everyone: which is not governing.
He has been a surprisingly uncommunicative President. He has talked a great deal: to this or that group just about every day. But he has hardly ever communicated a Big Idea to the public in a way that would sell it, not even his economic program.
It is a savage world for presidents these days, as those of us who criticize them ought to recognize.
The press is ravenous, ready to see scandal in a speck of dust. Its self-importance passes belief. Some kind of record may have been set this week, when a New Hampshire television anchor complained about being asked to put some makeup on President Clinton before interviewing him. Lese-majeste!
The talk show hosts are out there, spewing ignorance and hate. No rumor is too absurd or too invasive to repeat.
The Republican opposition is rigidly partisan, showing no willingness to face the economic mess that Republican Administrations created. And Mr. Clinton also has to worry about a midget Mussolini who claims he can make the trains run on time -- as long as you don't ask him how.
It is far too early to write Bill Clinton off. He is actually trying to deal with America's problems, unlike his predecessor, and he is famously resilient. But the realities of the Presidency are hard. If Mr. Clinton is going to recover from these first months, he had better add to his staff some people who understand political reality -- and show that he can deal with it himself.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Poll Gives Asian-Americans the Invisible Treatment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the last decade, the number of Asian-Americans in New York City more than doubled. As the fastest growing racial group in the city, Asian-Americans amount to nearly 10 percent of its population, affecting every segment of society and bringing new cultural and economic vitality to its neighborhoods. 
 I was dismayed to see that your May 19 front-page report on a New York Times/WCBS-TV poll of support for Mayor David N. Dinkins along racial lines excluded Asian-Americans. Furthermore, your article ignorantly claims that, according to the poll, "a preponderance of New Yorkers of all ethnic and racial groups say they believe conditions in the city are worse than they were four years ago."
Does this include Asian-Americans? How do Asian-Americans feel about living conditions? How does Mayor Dinkins fare among Asian-Americans? Does anyone care?
This blatant exclusion of Asian-Americans in a poll that claims to have included "all ethnic and racial groups in the city" reflects the attitudes of those decision makers who are often lethargic in responding to the needs of Asian-Americans because of that community's political marginality. It is disheartening to see Asian-Americans dismissed as insignificant. Your poll sends the message that all communities are not valued equally and that Asian-Americans do not have much say in policy making, though we share many concerns and interests with all other Americans.
Asian-Americans are beginning to realize that our needs are not articulated adequately, and that there are inequities in the sharing of public resources. More and more, we are organizing to mobilize our vote and unlock the potential for participating in decision making. In New York City, a collaboration of more than 20 Asian-American organizations plans to begin a nonpartisan, citywide voter-registration and education drive in the summer months to increase voter participation by Asian-Americans.
We no longer want to be at the mercy of the political majority and apart from making decisions that affect our daily lives.

HEADLINE: Mexico Wins, U.S. Workers Lose in Trade Pact

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ross Perot is dead right on the North American Free Trade Agreement. If Congress approves it, we will be deafened by the "giant sucking sound" of jobs moving from the United States to Mexico. 
 It is surprising that so many otherwise sensible public officials, such as Don E. Newquist, chairman of the International Trade Commission, in "Perot Is Dead Wrong on Nafta" (Op-Ed, May 10), put so much faith in the dozens of blue ribbon studies that conclude otherwise.
 Yet, these studies are based on flawed assumptions and simplistic economic models that render them useless, even dangerous for policy making. Virtually all depend on mathematical models that assume the United States economy will operate at full employment after the agreement is enacted.
A recent International Trade Commission survey of the leading studies, including its own, reports that the mathematical models omit key parts of the agreement because they were "hard to quantify." These include the rules-of-origin requirements in the computer, automotive and textile sectors. Yet, these three industries constitute a major component of United States-Mexican trade.
The International Trade Commission also reports that these models do not analyze the intellectual property protections in the trade agreement. Nor are these models able to calculate the effect of the trade agreement on important agricultural sectors, such as sugar. So large segments of United States-Mexican agricultural trade are omitted as well.
Most significant, the International Trade Commission reports that these economic models are unable to "incorporate potential increases in Mexican investment" resulting from the agreement. This is a huge gap, especially now that the Clinton Administration acknowledges that it is mainly an investment agreement.
The lure is simple -- lax Mexican regulations and $1.15 an hour wages. By the Mexican Government's estimates, investors gain roughly $15,000 for each United States job that is shifted to Mexico.
The most famous of these groups is the AmeriMex Maquiladora Fund, which is buying and relocating United States manufacturers where labor is 20 percent or more of production costs, and wages top $7 an hour. For such companies, labor costs largely determine competitiveness and where they put their facilities. By applying this yardstick nationally and by states to Census Bureau data on United States manufacturing, we can identify which industries and jobs are vulnerable to relocation to Mexico or low-wage Mexican competition.
More than 5.9 million United States production jobs in 75 distinct industries meet the AmeriMex investment and relocation criteria. Nationally, these jobs provide more than $138 billion of payroll. Under the trade agreement, most of these United States jobs would be at risk.
The trade agreement's most important feature is that it would make Mexico safe for foreign investors. It provides for quick payment at market prices of expropriated properties, protects the intellectual property rights of investors and allows foreigners to repatriate their profits. Disputes are to be handled by a new institution beyond the reach of Mexico's corrupt courts. And these investor protections are locked up in an international agreement beyond the reach of Mexico's politicians.
The trade agreement is Mexico's "Field of Dreams." If it is enacted, United States investors will come. Ross Perot is right.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: The Overview;
HOUSE GIVES NARROW APPROVAL TO CLINTON BUDGET PROPOSALS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The House of Representatives approved the heart of President Clinton's budget plan today, giving him the most crucial legislative and political victory of his young Presidency.
The vote, 219 to 213, was solidly along party lines, with 218 Democrats and an independent voting for the measure and only 38 Democrats defecting to join the 175 Republicans in opposition. [Roll-call, page A12.] 
 President Clinton went to the White House Rose Garden after the debate and declared, "Tonight, the House said no to gridlock, no to the status quo and no to the special interests who worked so very hard to frighten millions of Americans about this program."
 
Few Votes to Spare
 With nearly every seat taken on the House floor, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington closed the debate by declaring, "It will be remembered tonight what we do in this chamber."
Democratic leaders said the President had fewer than a half-dozen votes in reserve after the final tally -- Democrats who would have voted for the measure if it had meant the difference between victory and defeat.
An hour and a half before the vote, with a majority still uncertain, a letter was circulated threatening Democratic subcommittee chairmen with the loss of their positions if they voted against the measure. In the end, only 11 of 110 subcommittee chairmen, none of national stature, opposed the measure.
 
Basic Clinton Plan Survives
 "The last five votes were like pulling teeth," said Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a deputy whip.
After a debate that began in the morning and lasted well past the dinner hour, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, made a final pitch for the President's deficit-reduction program. His son had just graduated from college, Mr. Gephardt said, adding: "The gift I want to give him is to remove this dagger that's pointing at our economic heart. I want his future to be better than mine, as mine was better than my mother's and father's."
To lower the Federal budget deficit, the measure would raise the taxes of almost all Americans except the poor, and new steps would be taken to restrain spending.
Small changes were made, but by and large the bill that was approved contains what Mr. Clinton proposed in February: higher tax rates for wealthy individuals and all but the smallest corporations; a new tax on almost all forms of fuel; income taxes on a larger portion of the Social Security benefits of upper- and middle-income retirees; tax cuts for the working poor and near-poor, through an expanded earned-income credit; limits on spending for benefit programs like Medicare, and a freeze on total spending for all other Government programs after adjustments for inflation.
Almost two-thirds of the tax increases would be borne by families earning more than $200,000, and almost three-quarters would come from those with incomes above $100,000 -- about 6 percent of the American taxpaying public.
 
2 Houses, 2 Battles
 The legislation, called a reconciliation bill, is sure to be changed in the Senate, where the President has faced persistent trouble from his own party. But the nature of those changes is unclear, and no one can predict what the final bill will look like after the differences between the House and Senate are worked out.
Senators who oppose the proposed energy tax are especially influential, and the White House has already promised some concessions on it to gain support for Mr. Clinton's plan. In addition, party discipline in the Senate is more lax than it is in the House. The Senate Finance Committee could begin work on the legislation as early as next week, and a vote in the Senate could come before July 4.
But with the political future of the Clinton Presidency riding on today's vote, Administration officials set aside their worries about the Senate for the time being and concentrated on rounding up support in the House of Representatives. They said that if they failed to get the budget through the House, where the Democrats hold nearly a 3-to-2 majority, they could forget about health-care changes, welfare reform, a national service program and other Clinton initiatives.
The debate followed days of arm twisting by the President and his allies from the inside and furious lobbying from the outside. A few concessions were made to persuade the undecided, several of whom were brought around by an early-morning agreement to institute new budget procedures designed to control spending on benefit programs.
 
'A Nice Booster Shot'
 But the White House based its attack primarily on party loyalty, warning freshmen Democrats that if the budget plan failed, they would be held personally responsible for the damage to Mr. Clinton's Presidency.
With the early-evening nose counts showing a victory in hand, the mood in the White House today had been upbeat for the first time in days, if not weeks.
David Dreyer, an assistant to the President, called the House vote "a nice booster shot at a time when we need it."
Mark Gearan, the deputy chief of staff, said it was "hard to overestimate" the importance of the vote to Mr. Clinton and his Presidency.
The vote's political significance to Mr. Clinton pervaded the House debate. Pleading for support from his Democratic colleagues, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn said that a defeat for the President's plan would "cut him off at the knees early in his term, and we can't do that."
Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, said a defeat was deserved. "Candidate Clinton promised middle-income Americans a tax cut," he said. "President Clinton now wants to thrust upon middle-income Americans an enormous tax increase."
Mr. Michel continued: "Let's face it. The Clinton White House is out of touch. It's out of synch. It's out of ideas. It's out of excuses. And it's out of control."
Like many other Democrats, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin implored the House to "give the President a chance."
To such pleas, Representative Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, retorted: "Bill Clinton was elected on promises. A promise to cut the deficit. A promise to cut middle class taxes. Yes, Bill Clinton deserves a chance -- a chance to live up to his promises."
After a long day of lobbying that continued right up until the House vote, more than 40 members of the President's staff who had anxiously watched the close decision spilled onto the lawn in the Rose Garden to hear Mr. Clinton claim victory.
Standing on the West Wing portico flanked by Vice President Al Gore; Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Mr. Clinton praised members of the House for having the "courage and conviction" to make "hard choices."
 
G.O.P. Sees Election Leverage
 Outside the House chamber, Mr. Clinton's budget director, Leon E. Panetta, wearily accepted congratulations from friends.
"I've never seen Democrats working so hard to win a vote," said Mr. Panetta, a former Representative from California.
Republicans took some solace from defeat. Mr. Michel, the party leader, asserted, "It meant they had to squeeze everyone they possibly could."
The No. 2 Republican, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said he looked forward to the next election when Republicans would be able to accuse every Democrat of being one of the votes that swung the tide for a tax increase.
There was little pattern to the Democratic defectors except that they tended to be somewhat conservative and to have shaky seats politically.
Seven of 21 Texans voted against the bill, as did three of seven Democrats from New Jersey: Robert E. Andrews, Herbert C. Klein and Frank Pallone Jr.
 
With 1 Minute to Spare
 Democratic freshmen voted 51 to 11 to support the President. One who voted against him was Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan.
With 4 1/2 minutes to go in the 15 minutes allotted for the vote, the tally in favor of the measure was stuck at 210, eight shy of an absolute majority, the 218 votes needed if all 435 members voted. Democrats began applauding rhythmically. Gradually new votes were recorded on the electronic tally board -- 211, 212, 213 -- and with each one, a cheer went up. Finally, with a minute to go, the magic number, 218, was reached. Democrats began jumping for joy and hugging each other.
Among the last to come around for the President was Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, who as recently as Wednesday had said he would vote against the bill.
During the debates, Republicans stood firm against higher taxes, repeating their mantra from the 1980's that a sound economy depended on low taxes.
But Democrats said the Clinton plan represented a turn to new policies and away from the excesses of the 1980's.
The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, put the case this way: "This bill requires sacrifice. But the sacrifice is small compared to the price of continuing on our present course, risking our fiscal integrity and the standard of living for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren."
 
Biting (and Spitting) Bullets
 Mr. Rostenkowski, a master at manipulating legislation, was largely responsible for packaging the Clinton proposals to win the most possible support, and he was the main floor manager of the bill today. This was the first time he had presided with a Democrat in the White House, he told his colleagues, and that meant extra responsibility.
"There is no credible alternative," he asserted. "We have but one choice: to lead."
Biting the bullet was the favored Democratic metaphor. "Today is the day," said Al Swift of Washington. "This is the bullet."
Democrats maintained that their program to lower the deficit would keep interest rates down, leading to business expansion and more jobs. Republicans challenged that, returning time and again to the argument that higher taxes would increase unemployment.
"This bill," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican from Connecticut, "takes more money than has ever been taken at any one time from the sector that creates jobs."
In all, the bill would raise taxes by about $250 billion over five years and would lower the spending on automatic benefit programs by nearly $100 billion. The lawmakers also voted for the freeze in other programs, called discretionary spending, that would save about $100 billion over five years.
How much will actually be available for each of these discretionary programs will be decided later during the appropriations process, but much of the savings is sure to come from the military.
The rest of the total deficit reduction, which is projected to be nearly $500 billion over five years, would come from lower interest payments as the deficit falls.
Before passing the bill, the House rejected a Republican plan that would have contained no tax increases and much deeper cuts in spending than the Clinton program.
The vote, basically along party lines, was 295 to 138.
On a key procedural vote early in the day, the House adopted a resolution known as a rule, which set the terms for the debate. The vote was 236 to 194, with all but 19 Democrats in favor and all Republicans against.
In many respects, the emphasis lawmakers from both parties placed on reducing the budget deficit reflected the political influence of Ross Perot. But Mr. Perot's own proposals, including a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes, probably could not command 100 votes in the House.
Lobbying on the measure has been ferocious all month, especially from businesses and petroleum interests who oppose the fuel tax.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Sinks Against Yen Despite Fed's Moves

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The American dollar, falling all week against the Japanese yen, took a sharp plunge yesterday -- to the lowest level since World War II -- because the traders who buy and sell currencies seem convinced that the Clinton Administration wants a weak dollar to reduce the nation's trade deficit with Japan.
As the dollar fell to 107.20 yen in late New York trading from 108.50 on Wednesday, the Government tried to reverse this impression and stop the slide in the dollar's value. The Federal Reserve, for the second time this year, sold yen and bought dollars -- hoping that traders would follow its lead and that the demand for dollars would increase the dollar's value. A Treasury official helped that cause by denying the existence of a Clinton policy favoring a strong yen. 
 But the traders preferred their view that the Administration really wants a much smaller trade deficit with Japan, and one way to achieve this goal is through a weaker dollar, perhaps as weak as 100 yen. A weak dollar makes American goods less expensive in Japan, thus increasing exports, and Japanese goods more costly in the United States, thus reducing imports from Japan.
"The Fed's intervention this time was just a tap on the shoulder and not large enough to signify strenuous opposition to the slide or to muscle the market," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
Although the Federal Reserve intervened at least three times yesterday, currency traders concluded that the Fed lacked the determination of its efforts on April 27, when the dollar broke below 110 yen for the first time and the Fed repeatedly bought dollars and sold yen, temporarily reversing the slide.
The April intervention, in turn, was the first by the Fed since 1988. It was intended in part to quiet criticism from Japan about the rising value of the yen and the damage that might result to Japanese exports. During the Bush Administration, the dollar never fell in value below 120 yen.
"There is this general feeling that the Administration has been talking down the dollar vis-a-vis the yen, and for the foreseeable future, the pressure will be there for the yen to continue to appreciate in value," said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter.
The dollar also fell yesterday against European currencies, including the German mark. It was pushed down in part by reports earlier this week suggesting that the American economy might be weakening again. But the fall was only slight. Since President Clinton's inauguration, the dollar has remained strong against every major currency except the yen, and there the fall has been breathtaking at times, including this week. Since last Friday, the dollar's value has declined by nearly three yen.
 
Toward a Currency Crisis?
 "There is a cumulative process occurring, accumulating in the direction of a currency crisis," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston Inc. Mr. Jones and others also cited, as a reason for the dollar's slide against the yen yesterday, a growing optimism that Japan might be shaking off recession.
Some Japanese interest rates have risen recently, perhaps in anticipation of a strengthening economy. Whatever the reason, rising Japanese interest rates encourage people with dollars to sell them and purchase yen in order to buy Japanese securities. The performance yesterday was the week's highlight. The dollar fell to new lows after each of the Fed's first two interventions and, after the third attempt, it finally leveled off -- but without regaining lost ground. "The interventions were only symbolic," Mr. Sullivan said.
Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, tried yesterday to distance the Administration from the dollar's falling value. But his remarks failed to have an impact. "We certainly are not seeking and have no policy of promoting the appreciation of the yen," Mr. Summers told the Bloomberg News Service. "The market has moved too far, too fast."
 
A Different Tack
 But on Tuesday, Mr. Summers had taken a different tack. He said that the Administration in no way favored "a policy of trying to devalue your way into prosperity." Nevertheless, a Treasury report issued the same day recognized that a rising yen served as "a counterweight to the forces tending to increase Japan's" trade surplus. That linking a strong yen to a shrinking trade deficit is a theme that has been cited several times in recent months by Administration officials.
Until this week the dollar had generally stayed above 110 yen, after having fallen to that record-low level in April from 125 yen in January. The Federal Reserve rarely acknowledges its interventions, but traders said that the Fed clearly came into the market three times yesterday -- twice yesterday morning, when the dollar was still trading above 108 yen and once in the early afternoon when the rate was 107.4 yen.

Dollar Falls in Japan
 By Bloomberg Business News
 TOKYO, Friday, May 28 -- The dollar fell in Tokyo today, after its plunge in New York. In the afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 107.43 yen, down from 108.05 yen in Tokyo on Thursday, but slightly higher than the late New York quote of 107.20 yen.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the dollar's sharp decline against the Japanese yen referred incorrectly to the Federal Reserve's intervention in the currency markets on April 27. That intervention was the first since November 1989 in which the Federal Reserve sold yen to buy dollars.

Where an Arc Once Ruled
The General Services Administration has come up with a new and decidedly politically correct plan for the space surrounding 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. It involves the American sculptor Beverly Pepper and the Boston landscape architect Martha Schwartz, and the new scheme comes with the neighborhood seal of approval.
Four years have passed since the furor over Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc," the monumental steel sculpture that bisected the space in front of 26 Federal Plaza from 1981 to 1989. After a prolonged and heated artistic battle that involved the plaza's tenants and neighborhood residents, the 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long piece was proclaimed by the agency to have rendered the plaza unusable. In 1989 the work was dismantled and removed, an act that the artist said was tantamount to destroying it. 
 The new plans for the outdoor spaces surrounding the Government offices at 26 Federal Plaza are intended not to make waves. "We're not trying to be more conservative, but public art has changed since the 'Tilted Arc' days," said Dale Lanzone, the agency's director of arts and historical preservation. "These decisions are a public process now. I'm not saying we can please everyone, but it's not like driving a train into a wall."
Mr. Lanzone explained that art is commissioned by an 11-member panel, consisting of the project architect, five representatives of the arts and five members nominated by civic leaders like the Mayor or members of Congress, or by the occupants of the building where the art will be placed.
In two years, Mr. Lanzone said, Federal Plaza will be have "one large environmental piece" in the spot where "Tilted Arc" once was. It is being designed by Ms. Schwartz. The $1.4 million project is a combination of landscaping and repairs, since there was water damage to the plaza's pavement. "The plaza will be treated very much as a work of art, but it will be a usable space, the antithesis of Serra's treatment," Mr. Lanzone said.
Because of the site's turbulent history, Mr. Lanzoni said, the new design was submitted to the tenants of 26 Federal Plaza, which are all Federal agencies, and to neighborhood representatives. The agency decided not to commission a sculpture for the plaza because it was just "too sensitive to ask an artist to design a sculpture for the same place where 'Tilted Arc' was," he added.
 
Trees, Columns and Light
 For the west side of the building, which faces Broadway and has always been empty the agency has awarded a $355,000 commission to Ms. Pepper, whose site-specific environment will be on the terrace.
"I'm trying to bring landscape back into the city," Ms. Pepper said. Her design includes a series of 30 cast-iron columns, 36 feet high, in circles of three, which rise through a cluster of trees with seating areas. During the day, it will feel as though one is sitting in a parklike setting, she said. At night, fiber-optic lights will make each column appear as a vertical strip among the trees.
"This is a kind of romance about landscape," Ms. Pepper said. "In winter, the branches will resemble lacework." The artist, who lives in Todi, Italy, a medieval town near Perugia, said she likes the Italian tradition of people sitting on steps. "I'm not trying to invite controversy," she added, "but to create a landscape with sculpture set in an urban atmosphere."
 
A Friedrich for the Getty
 The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., reached into its deep pockets yet again last week and spent $3.6 million for "Walk at Dusk," a Romantic landscape painting by the German artist Caspar David Friedrich, at Christie's in London. The work, which depicts a man approaching a monolithic tomb by moonlight, is one of the last pictures painted by the artist before he died in 1835.
"The tomb actually existed; it wasn't something Friedrich invented," said George R. Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings. "It was a place where he would go to sketch."
Works by Friedrich rarely come up at auction, and almost none are in the United States. The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth is the only other American museum with a Friedrich in its collection. The Kimbell bought "A Mountain Peak With Drifting Clouds" from the Colnaghi gallery in London nine years ago.
Lord Poltimore, director of 19th-century Continental pictures at Christie's in London, said several American museums had shown considerable interest in this Friedrich. "It was a brave choice for the Getty," he said. "It shows it is breaking into new territory." Lord Poltimore added that the painting had originally been discovered in 1965, in the attic of a house owned by a German doctor known to Christie's only as H. Voith. Dr. Voith apparently sold the painting, and for a number of years it went into obscurity.
"In the 60's the opinion was the painting was by Karl Gustav Carcus, a contemporary and pupil of Friedrich," Lord Poltimore said. "But over the years, the scholars changed their minds. Now there is no doubt but that it is by Friedrich." When the painting surfaced again, its owner, an unidentified German collector, put it up for sale at Christie's. Lord Poltimore said the painting had never been on the open market before.
 
Big Spender
 In the last few years, the Getty has been a frequent buyer at the London painting auctions, and most of its purchases have set record prices. In December 1991, for example, the Getty bought Titian's "Venus and Adonis" at Christie's for $13.4 million, and last December, it bought Goya's "Bullfight Suerte de Varas," for $7.9 million at Sotheby's.
The $3.6 million the Getty paid for the Friedrich was another record for an artist; it exceeded the $2.3 million paid in 1987 for his "Winter Landscape" by the National Gallery in London at Christie's in Monaco. "We felt this was a fair price, and it fits our program well," Mr. Goldner said this week. "It's a good balance to our 19th-century works."
"It was a good moment to be buying a Friedrich," he added. "Were the German economy not so weak, there would have been big competition."
 
Millions for Americans
 American art is fetching seven-figure prices at auction this spring. Childe Hassam's "Room of Flowers," from 1894, sold for a record $5.5 million yesterday at Sotheby's in New York. The scene of a room crammed with furniture, paintings and flowers was bought by Richard Manoogian, a Detroit industrialist who is a major American collector. The seller was Arthur Altschul, the financier. The previous record for a Hassam was set in 1989 when "The Fourth of July," from 1916, sold for $3.1 million at Christie's in New York. Another big-ticket painting sold at Sotheby's was "Peonies," from 1897, by William Merritt Chase, which was bought for $3.9 million by Berry-Hill, the Manhattan gallery.
At the sale of American paintings, drawings and sculpture on Wednesday at Christie's in New York, Remington's "Wounded Bunkie," from 1896, a recently discovered cast of cavalrymen on horseback, was sold for $1.9 million to an unidentified American dealer. It was the only work that brought more than $1 million.
 
Losing a Deputy
 Perhaps there's room for only one Earl at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It's been eight months since Earl A. Powell 3d became the gallery's director. Now, Earl Roger Mandle, the gallery's deputy director, is leaving to become president of the 116-year-old Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. His new job takes effect in August.
"I've been at the National Gallery since July 1988, and I'm leaving for a great opportunity," Mr. Mandle said. "Education has always been my special interest, and there are a lot of artists in my family: my sister, my son and my daughter. So the move is a perfect one for me."
A spokeswoman for the museum said that no decision had been made about who would fill Mr. Mandle's position, but that the post would not be left vacant.

HEADLINE: A Lover Leaps to Join Her Slain Fiance in Death

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Shaleen Wadhwami and Hema Sakhrani met and fell in love at New York University, two successful children of immigrant families from India who seemed to have limitless futures. They planned to marry in July, a month before Mr. Wadhwami started medical school on a full scholarship, a courtship as well as budding careers that delighted their families and friends in the closely knit Indian communities of Queens and Long Island.
One man did not share their joy. Chandran Nathan, the police said, had an obsession with Ms. Sakhrani. Late Wednesday night, the police said, he went to the door of Mr. Wadhwami's home in Manhasset, L.I., carrying a semiautomatic rifle and fired 20 bullets at the young man, killing him as his parents slept upstairs. 
 Anguished, Ms. Sakhrani jumped to her death yesterday morning from the 16th-floor terrace of her family's apartment in Rego Park, Queens, the police said.
"We are all in such mourning," Mr. Wadhwami's father, Nari, said numbly yesterday afternoon as he and his wife, Sunita, left the apartment building of their son's fiance after consoling her family. "We cannot talk at all right now."
Mr. Nathan, a 35-year-old actuary for the City of New York, who is married, was arrested on Thursday near his home in Richmond Hill, Queens, and charged with the murder of the 20-year-old Mr. Wadhwami. He was arraigned yesterday in First District Court in Hempstead, L.I., and ordered held without bail.
Neighbors in Richmond Hill said Mr. Nathan was quiet and unfriendly. The neighbors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that he had reported people for building violations, including one person who had an illegal tenant in his basement and another who built a shed without a permit.
Mr. Nathan would also place notes on parked cars in front of his modest two-story home, signing them as an Emergency Medical Service paramedic who needed the space, one neighbor said.
Another neighbor said that he and his family heard two gunshots from Mr. Nathan's house around 3:45 A.M. on Tuesday.
"He is a very antisocial guy," said one man who lives two houses down. "He never speaks. A real mysterious guy."
A neighbor said that Mr. Nathan's wife had told another neighbor that she planned to go to the Philippines on Tuesday. She had said that she grew up there, he said.
Detective Lieut. Frank B. Guidice, the commander of the homicide squad for the Nassau County Police Department, said that Mr. Nathan, a friend of the Sakhranis who had known the young woman most of her life, had begun expressing an interest in Ms. Sakhrani on numerous occasions recently.
Mr. Nathan, who lives with his wife at 107-23 124th Street, became upset when he learned of her engagement, though he did not make any threats, even after meeting Mr. Wadhwami for the first time last week, Lieutenant Guidice said.
"He knew her most of her life," he said. "His interest developed into a romantic interest, and he actively pursued her. He had just learned of the engagement, and we believe that's what precipitated the killing."
The killing and the apparent suicide, and the jealousy that seemingly led to them, deeply shocked the middle-class communities of South Asians in Queens and Long Island, as well as those in the university and medical communities who knew the young couple. Friends, relatives and colleagues described both as warm, charming and intellectually precocious, models of immigrant success.
In the driveway outside Mr. Wadhwami's home in Manhasset, its bullet-pocked foyer visible through the front door, a family friend, Ram Kumar, described the deaths as a tragedy for both families and the entire community. Mr. Wadhwami and Ms. Sakhrani, both born in the United States, were comfortable in American society but remained rooted in their deeply religious Hindu culture, he said.
"They had the best of both worlds," he said as Mr. Wadhwami's brother, Deepak, and his wife, Renu, stood silently nearby, visibly shaken.
Later, Sham Bhatia, the father of Renu Wadhwami, said the family's tragedy came at what should have been a time of joy, as plans for the wedding in July neared completion. "The wedding dresses are all made," he said. "When I saw them, I had tears in my eyes."
At Ms. Sakhrani's home in Park City Estates, a complex of five brick apartment towers surrounding a verdant garden square, a stream of relatives and friends came to console her family, described as too distraught to speak about the deaths yesterday.
 
'A Perfect Couple'
 "Nobody knew something like this could happen," said Sheela Wanti, a friend of the Sakhranis and the Wadhwamis who lives in Floral Park, Queens. "Everybody knew them. He was very bright, the best intellect the community had seen in a long time. Together, they were a perfect couple."
Mr. Wadhwami, who went to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, studied economics and graduated cum laude at New York University in October 1992. A premed student and an Alumni Scholar, he received a scholarship to attend New York University Medical School starting in August, a spokesman for the university, Virgil Renzulli, said.
Ms. Sakhrani completed her junior year at the university this month. A chemistry major, she received a presidential scholarship, given by the university to students for academic success and community service in high school.
Awaiting medical school, Mr. Wadhwami worked as a research assistant at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, a part of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. Dr. Ira J. Goldberg, an associate professor at the college, described Mr. Wadhwami as "a thoughtful, serious and dedicated young man" and called his death "a loss for today and for the future."
According to the police reconstruction, Mr. Wadhwami was in his bedroom at his family's home on Bayview Avenue overlooking Manhasset Bay when the doorbell rang at 11:45 P.M. When he answered the door, he saw a man with a rifle who said nothing.
As he tried to close the door, the police said, the man fired through the door, then forced it open and continued to fire a barrage of at least 20 bullets. Mr. Wadhwami, who would have turned 21 yesterday, died in the hallway, struck 11 times in the torso.
Detectives from Nassau County arrested Mr. Nathan on the street near his home about noon on Thursday. They seized a semiautomatic rifle, but the lieutenant said they had not yet determined if it was the rifle used in the killing.
Detectives told Ms. Sakhrani and her family of the killing Thursday. "She was obviously very upset," Lieutenant Guidice said.
Yesterday morning, Ms. Sakhrani became even more distraught after reading a newspaper account of the killing, he said. She spoke with her brother before she jumped from the apartment's terrace, but Lieutenant Guidice declined to discuss any more details of what happened in the apartment, saying the family had been disturbed by the publicity and wanted to mourn privately.
Relatives said they would hold a funeral for Mr. Wadhwami and Ms. Sakhrani together on Monday.

HEADLINE: Tokyo, Outrageously Costly, Gets More So for Americans

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 28

 BODY:
Tokyo has long ranked as the world's most outrageously expensive city. American tourists loved to go home with tales of street vendors selling muskmelons for $100 apiece. Now, with a surge in the yen that has shaken Japan for the last three months and driven the American dollar to historic lows, the outrageous has turned to the ridiculous for anyone brave enough to measure prices in dollars.
So ridiculous that when President Clinton arrives here in five weeks for his first economic summit meeting, he won't have to summon a big-name hair stylist to Air Force One to run up a $200 tab. He can easily drop that much getting his hair styled in the Okura Hotel, where Presidents traditionally stay. 
 If political prudence induces him to settle for a quick trim and a shampoo, the hotel's barber said the other day that he could handle it for 11,500 yen, a mere $107.50 based on today's record high rate of around 107 yen. For the Japanese, of course, the price in yen has remained the same; only those paying in dollars suffer.
That includes Mr. Clinton, and Japanese officials clearly would not mind if his trip to Tokyo burns a hole in his pocket. After all, they say, isn't a rising yen what he wanted? On the airwaves and in the newspapers, where the soaring yen dominates the news, the Clinton Administration is portrayed as the chief villain in the latest round of endaka, the term for a rising yen.
Under the many conspiracy theories circulating here, the Clinton Administration has decided to cause the maximum pain to Japanese industry by driving up the price of its exports. The only problem is that the strategy has so far done nothing to narrow the trade gap between Japan and the United States; in fact, when Japan reports new trade figures in coming days, they are expected to show a huge jump from the previous few months.
But if the rising yen has yet to slice a chunk out of the trade numbers, it certainly has left a mark on the tens of thousands of Americans in Tokyo -- especially those who are paid in dollars. Over the last few months they have watched in horror as their salaries have dropped in value by roughly 15 percent.
At least it has made the math easier. Working out costs in dollars used to involve thinking in multiples of seven or eight. For example, a 10,000-yen note, which passes through the hands the way a $20 bill does in America, was actually worth somewhere from $66 to $80 in recent years. But that was with the yen flitting between 125 and 150 to the dollar.
"Now it's simple," said Kathleen A. Kriger, the general manager of Jardine Business Services here, which rents out furnished offices to foreign companies unable to afford regular Tokyo real estate costs. "There's no multiplication. To convert to dollars you just drop the last two digits. And you've spent a hundred dollars."
If classical economic theory meant much in this town, though, foreign-made goods should suddenly be cheaper -- 15 percent cheaper than they were a few months ago based on the rising yen.
But like everything in Japan, these things operate by Japanese logic, something Adam Smith never witnessed. Companies that buy their raw materials overseas go into marvelous contortions these days explaining why they have not dropped their prices in yen.
 
Energy Prices Stay High
 Japan's utilities, for example, which charge more for electricity than any other utilities in the world, have not passed on their savings from buying oil, which is priced in dollars. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has backed them up, saying they "do not have sufficient resources."
Prices of American-grown food have not dropped either. But a few companies are reacting to criticism that they are simply pocketing the difference: Tiffany's said the other day that it would shave a few yen from jewelry prices in hopes of drawing Japanese back into its stores.
Still, to make one's way through Tokyo these days is to feel that $100 bills are flying through your hands -- and all you did was meet someone for a quick lunch and took a 10-minute taxi ride back to the office.
And that's a cheap day. A bullet train ride to Kyoto, about the distance between New York and Washington, now runs $120. At Meidi-ya, a supermarket that caters to the affluent, a gift fruit basket, the kind you would send to a prospective client, runs $231. Taking clients out to a kaiseki dinner -- the traditional Buddhist meal of exquisitely presented sushi, sashimi and vegetables -- can run $230 to $400 a head, more if you drink.
All this has thrown something of a monkey wrench into President Clinton's strategy of making American business grow in Japan. While American-made goods should be cheaper here, the cost of doing business has caused many companies -- which often give their American employees in Japan a cost-of-living adjustment -- to think twice about sending more of their employees abroad.
No wonder. A few weeks ago a consulting firm that advises American companies on how to arrange compensation packages for their workers abroad concluded that to feed and house a family of four on a mid-level executive income would require roughly $110,000 a year in extra payments for housing and cost-of-living adjustments.
That was before the yen's run-up; now the figure would be closer to $125,000. The biggest component of that, of course, is housing. Unlike the Japanese, most expatriate senior executives live close to the center of Tokyo where a three-bedroom apartment can easily rent for 1 million yen a month, which at today's exchange is $9,345.79.
 
Big Japanese Salaries
 Hiring Japanese workers instead of Americans is not much of a solution. The other day the office head of an American electronics company, having a beer after work with a friend (three beers: 3,200 yen, or $29.90), confided that he had made a horrifying discovery. His Japanese deputy, already well paid in yen, was now making nearly twice as much in dollar terms as the American executive, who is paid in dollars.
"We can't pay him less; we'd lose him," the executive said. "And he doesn't even feel rich," he said, noting that his colleague stands for an hour on the train every morning to get to work.
In the meantime, Government officials here have begun lashing out. Yuji Tanahashi, the Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry, said that the problem was that the Administration's desires were "incomprehensible," a series of mixed signals to the markets.
"We cannot understand why they say that they welcome a stronger yen, and then deny their previous words," said Mr. Tanahashi, who contends that the yen's run-up, by making Japanese exports so expensive abroad, is going to choke off Japan's efforts to recover from its current economic downturn.
In fact, some things here have become cheaper. Because of the Japanese recession, property prices are still dropping, though from stratospheric heights. Prices of long-distance telephone calls and personal computers have all come down sharply, largely because of American-induced competition.
And the muskmelons? They are now $138, on the shelf next to the $185 box of perfectly formed, individually cushioned cherries. Cheapskates should go over one aisle, where a can of Spam costs $6.48.
It is almost enough to make you skip eating and drinking and just stretch out with the papers. But that can be costly, too. A Sunday issue of The New York Times now costs $42.91, three days late.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: Arm-Twisting;
When the President Rings, Mavericks Run for Cover

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The White House telephone operators can reach Boris N. Yeltsin or Queen Elizabeth II in a snap. But they could not find Representative Collin C. Peterson all Thursday afternoon.
He was hiding from the President in the House gym. 
 By his own account, the Minnesota Democrat preferred straining his biceps with barbells to telling President Clinton that he did not want to vote for the Administration's budget plan. Like a score of other lawmakers coming under the White House squeeze, Mr. Peterson agonized that his vote could sink the new President.
 
Last-Minute Switch
 But a junior lawmaker can only sweat it out so long. Mr. Peterson broke down to take Mr. Clinton's call in the final minutes before casting his vote on Thursday night, and then he changed his mind.
"The President said, 'I'm new on the job and I need your help,' " Mr. Peterson recalled. "He said, 'Give me a chance and I'll try to help you out with your problems.' "
Mr. Clinton clinched Mr. Peterson's vote when he promised to agree to reduce the energy tax, which the Minnesota lawmaker contends would hit farmers especially hard. Still, Mr. Peterson said his commitment was conditioned on the pledge that the final version of the legislation would have a very different energy tax when it is sent back to the House after votes by the Senate and a House-Senate conference committee .
"If we don't get changes, I'll vote no" on final passage, Mr. Peterson concluded. "I told him that."
 
Night of Deals
 Mr. Peterson's decision was one of a handful of last-minute switches that helped Mr. Clinton eke out his 219-to-213 victory. Backed by the House leadership, Mr. Clinton doled out heaps of sugar and salt to cook up deals.
Some conservative Democratic lawmakers said that in exchange for their votes, Mr. Clinton even agreed to remove some younger, inexperienced officials in the White House -- and to steer his Administration back to its original centrist course.
The intensity of the Administration lobbying was so fierce that some of the 38 Democrats who broke with their party have expressed fear that they may be punished by their leaders and the White House for years to come. One lawmaker said the daylong anxiety was punctuated by Ike Skelton of Missouri, a ranking 62-year-old member of the House, when he sprinted out of the Democratic cloakroom rather than take a call from the President to explain his opposition.
 
Political Whip Marks
 "I have the marks; I have been whipped," said Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania, who nevertheless voted with the Republicans.
After he reluctantly voted against the President, Representative Sam Coppersmith of Arizona slouched in an antique chair off the House floor. His body limp and his eyes bloodshot, he looked as if he had aged a decade in the last few hours. Recalling three phone calls from the President that day, he said: "I couldn't say no to the President, so I said: 'Mr. President, I can't say yes.' I didn't cast the vote with any pleasure."
In the final two days, Mr. Clinton bucked up two black Representatives from Texas who were worried that the energy tax would hurt their state. The two, Craig Washington and Eddie Bernice Johnson, won a pledge that sanctions on Haiti would be tightened to increase pressure on the military regime there.
Charlie Rose, the North Carolina Democrat who heads the House Agriculture Committee, was able to deliver another handful of votes from rural lawmakers by winning promises that the Administration would consider raising tariffs on imported peanut and tobacco products.
In the hours before dawn on Thursday, House leaders won the commitment of a few influential moderates and conservatives by agreeing to a new set of budget procedures meant to control spending on Social Security and other automatic benefit programs.
A group of female Representatives came up with their own campaign to twist the arms of more senior committee and subcommittee chairmen who were threatening to bolt the party. Exploiting a new Democratic caucus rule that had not been put to use before, the women distributed a petition that would have brought any dissenters before the caucus membership for a possible vote of no-confidence that would remove them from leadership positions.
House leaders noted that after the petition attracted more than 60 signatures, Representatives William J. Hughes of New Jersey and Bob Carr of Michigan dutifully fell in line rather than risk their subcommittee chairmanships.
But Mr. Clinton was still short, and at 4 P.M. House leaders discussed whether to delay the vote until after the Memorial Day recess. "They rolled the dice," said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, after concluding that a delay would be widely viewed as a defeat for the President and might cause a further erosion of votes. "This was a real slog."
As late as 7 P.M., less than two hours before the vote, the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, had only 213 firm votes, four short of what they needed to win. The White House thought that about five Democrats would change their votes at the last minute rather than embarrass the President, but some House leaders were not so sure.
The White House made a special effort to win over Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, a prominent member of the Democratic Party's conservative wing. He had publicly declared his opposition to the economic program and had openly criticized the Administration for veering left. House leaders had already written off Mr. McCurdy and advised Mr. Clinton against calling him.
But the President disagreed, in part because of his long friendship with the Oklahoma Democrat but also because he thought Mr. McCurdy could bring a few votes with him. Throughout Thursday, Mr. McCurdy received calls from Mr. Clinton; the White House chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. In each call Mr. McCurdy asked for reductions in the energy tax and sought pledges that the Administration would work for more spending cuts.
Working in tandem with Representatives Calvin M. Dooley of California, W. J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana and Jay Inslee of Washington State, Mr. McCurdy said, he won promises of more spending cuts to reduce the reliance on the energy tax. Mr. McCurdy and his allies struck their deal with the Administration 10 minutes after the voting began. Then, Mr. McCurdy recalled, "Billy Tauzin turned to me and said, 'Let's do it.' "
 
'A Near-Death Experience'
 Their votes put the President over the top.
"This Administration experienced a near-death experience," Mr. McCurdy said. "We couldn't afford to let him die."
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a chief deputy whip, attached himself to Missouri Representatives Harold L. Volkmer and Alan Wheat through the entire vote, pleading with them to vote yes. Both are loyal Democrats who wanted to help their party, but the letters from back home carried the mantra: cut spending, don't raise taxes.
Mr. Wheat is especially sensitive to political trends because he wants to run for the Senate seat that will be vacated by John C. Danforth, who is retiring. But he and Mr. Volkmer, voting in tandem to reinforce each other's courage, took the plunge together for the President.
But other members decided to look after their own political careers first. Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky had eked out a 1,373-vote victory in her Main Line district, a prosperous Philadelphia suburb that usually votes Republican.
"I got calls from half the Cabinet; I got calls from all the leadership, the President, the Vice President," she recalled. "I agonized."
She said she told Mr. Clinton, " 'Throughout the campaign, I pledged that I would not vote for an across-the-board tax.' I had to keep my promise. He understood. I could hear it in his voice."

Mr. McCurdy's vote for the economic package came after promises of more spending cuts. He prepared to leave Capitol Hill yesterday for Oklahoma. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)(pg. 7)

HEADLINE: NATO's Leadership Gap;
Washington's Seeming Confusion on Bosnia Throws Alliance Into Crisis of Relevance

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 28

 BODY:
Confused and ambivalent signals from Washington about handling the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have thrown the NATO alliance into its most serious crisis since the end of the cold war.
Critics in Washington and New York, but also in Brussels and Bonn, have begun to question whether an alliance designed to stave off the Soviet Union has any relevance to the prevention of the ethnic and national conflicts that have broken out in the ruins of the Communist empire and threaten to endanger the stability and security of Europe if they are not contained. 
 Diplomats here suggest that the alliance will continue to bicker ineffectually until the United States makes up its mind on what approach to pursue.
 
Failure to Agree
 The Clinton Administration did try, but failed, to get its European allies to agree to a policy of threatening Bosnian Serb forces with military strikes while allowing the Bosnian Muslims to rearm. The Europeans tried, but failed, to get the Americans to beef up United Nations peacekeeping forces on the ground to enforce a cease-fire.
In the view of many Europeans, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was too tentative when he came earlier this month to explain the American proposals, saying he was in a "listening mode." American diplomats suggest that he might have done better to send junior officials to take soundings first.
The result was an unsatisfying compromise announced by the United States, Russia, Britain France and Spain in Washington last Saturday, calling for "safe havens" for the Muslim refugees and American air power to protect whatever ground forces are eventually sent in to protect them.
Though every country involved in the compromise except Russia was a member of NATO, the 16 alliance defense ministers who met in Brussels on Wednesday could not even agree on a communique endorsing the plan.
France, often the most troublesome ally to the United States, has vigorously defended the compromise. But as Foreign Minister Alain Juppe explained in an article in Le Monde on Friday, its effectiveness depends on considerable military strengthening of the mandate of the United Nations forces that would defend the population inside the safety zones.
"The Russian Federation declared its readiness to provide troops in Bosnia," he wrote. "We have not yet been able to convince the United States to do the same." All the Administration has said it would do is to provide air cover if the United Nations forces -- not the refugees they will protect -- came under attack from the combatants.
Past crises in the trans-Atlantic relationship have nearly always resulted when the allies got the impression that the United States did not know what it wanted. Seldom has the impression of confusion in Washington been as strong as it has over the 14 months of the Bosnian crisis, in both the Bush and Clinton Administrations.
The last time the allies drifted this far apart was in the late 1970's and early 1980's over a NATO decision to deploy American medium-range nuclear missiles to counter equivalent Soviet ones. Uneasiness, particularly in Germany, about what seemed to be a confrontational approach by the Reagan Administration deepened the crisis, but the seeds had been sown in March 1978, when President Carter canceled a decision to deploy a neutron bomb he had earlier pressed the Germans and the other allies to accept.
Mr. Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, tried to get him to stick with his decision. "I still made my pitch to the effect that his decision, which involves a reversal of everything we have been doing for the last four months, will stamp him as weak and will be so construed elsewhere," Mr. Brzezinski wrote in "Power and Principle," his 1983 memoirs. "I made the point that leadership means making the decisions which the Europeans are not prepared to make."
 
Impression of Self-Doubt
 Ten years later, it still means that. But the Clinton Administration seems to be radiating self-doubt.
A speech last week by Assistant Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff that seemed to lower expectations of American leadership because of United States economic difficulties was later clarified by the White House and by Mr. Christopher, but the damage had been done. A German newspaper, Die Welt, suggested on Thursday that Mr. Christopher was a "product of the cold war" who was not up to the new challenges, and should be replaced.
Until it defines its role in the Balkans, NATO could continue to drift. Many who depend on it for their future security, in Eastern as well as Western Europe, hope that the Clinton Administration can find firm strategic ground soon.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: On Democratic Turf;
In St. Paul, Clinton Faithful Wince

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, May 28

 BODY:
When President Clinton's economic package narrowly passed the House on Thursday night, there may have been no one outside the White House more relieved than Thaddeus Austin, a real estate agent here.
It is not because Mr. Austin expects anything from the budget personally. In fact, he has been expecting higher taxes since Election Day. He figures an energy tax will hit Minnesotans especially hard, what with the harsh winters and long commutes. And besides, he, like many Americans, views the Federal budget as a bulbous enigma that the average citizen may not fully grasp no matter how many hours C-Span is on. 
 No, the reason he is relieved is that he has been waiting all his life for this moment when a President he voted for gets in and does something. For 12 years, as long as he has been eligible to vote, he has been on the losing side -- Carter, Mondale, Dukakis, even Anderson and Jackson in the primaries. Now things are different.
"I feel like I'm coming in from the wilderness," said Mr. Austin, who is 30 years old.
 
Educated Citizens
 There are lots of people like Mr. Austin in Merriam Park, a leafy, middle-class St. Paul neighborhood of geranium-flanked Victorian houses and literate residents who watch "MacNeil-Lehrer" and read The New Republic.
It is one of the scattered pockets of true Clinton support outside Arkansas, where people seem willing to forgive his $200 haircuts and travel-office missteps. St. Paul is a liberal city in a liberal state that voted for Mr. Clinton over Mr. Bush almost 3 to 1.
People here are frugal and progressive. They worry about the deficit and endangered species, see taxes as a civic duty and feel government has a responsibility to the disadvantaged. Even Republicans here are different. Many favor government-run health care or the right to an abortion. Merriam Park is, after all, the home of Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy.
Like nervous parents worried about the children they just sent off to college, this has been a tough semester for Democrats here. They watched their man stumble over the issues of Haitian refugees, homosexuals in the military, cabinet appointees and their nannies. They winced as he got sidetracked by haircuts and his travel staff and seemed a little too dazzled by the Hollywood types for their taste.
Then they watched him squeeze his budget package through a Democratic-controlled House. Now they are bracing for the real fight in the Senate, wondering what could go wrong next.
"It's been extremely painful," said Deborah Keenan, a writer and professor of poetry sitting with her family at a Dairy Queen here. "I can hardly bear it. I haven't given up yet. I don't think that he's a character disorder. But that's the last clinging hope."
In interviews before and after the House vote, more than 40 people who live or work in Merriam Park said they were impatient and frustrated with Congress, accusing it of grandstanding, and with Mr. Clinton, saying he'd made dumb mistakes and had lost his way.
Most people said he had not had time to prove himself, but they saw at least a glimmer of hope in the House vote.
"The guy is in an awful pickle," said Roger Westholter, who owns a shoe repair shop in Merriam Park. "I don't give up on him yet just 'cause he does a few stupid things. The guy just hardly got in there. Give the guy a chance. Look at Carter. He was a good man. He was smart. The poor guy couldn't do nothing. His own party is against him. It's too bad."
 
Annoyed With Trivia
 Many people were angry at the news media, saying it has emphasized the trivial. "What do I care if he got a $200 hair cut?" said Ken Schultz, an antique-furniture dealer. "That's his business."
After months of hearing the mantra of change, change, change, people here are still waiting to see some.
"He was given permission to do things people don't like but knew had to be done, and he's not doing it," Bill Oetting, a research biologist here, said. "When I hear him speak, he says the right things, and I think his intentions are good. But it's not happening."
Voters who thought that a bright Rhodes scholar would take care of everything are sitting up and taking notice.
"I'm beginning to think that nothing much is going to change," said Carol Kusnierek, a Merriam Park secretary. "I used to think his naivete was nice. Now I think we need somebody who can fight dirty."
 
Not Tough Enough?
 Her sentiments -- that Mr. Clinton does not seem to be tough enough -- were voiced over and over again, with Don Ladig, a transportation coordinator here, saying, "I want to see him get bloodied."
Mr. Ladig voted for Mr. Clinton but appears to be losing faith.
"I haven't seen him walk the talk," Mr. Ladig said. "I voted for a man I thought was a professional politician, an instinctive politician. But I haven't seen it. I've seen a bumbler."
"Even smart people make dumb mistakes," said his wife, Sherry, a bookstore clerk, as the two stood outside their Victorian frame house. "I'm willing to forgive him the little ones."
Still, her Midwestern pragmatism got the better of her when it came to one seeming mistake. "It's real dumb to have a $200 haircut and ask people to pay higher taxes," Mrs. Ladig said. "He seems a little too dazzled with the high life and Hollywood," a place as suspect as Washington to many Midwesterners.
"I picture him in this fairy tale castle, and he's wandering around and saying, 'What do I do first?' " said Mat Hollinshead, a business consultant.
Mr. Hollinshead was frustrated by the emphasis on homosexuals in the military in the first months of the Administration. He feels that was an unnecessary distraction that tripped up the Administration.
"Why did he have to do it so early?" he asked. "He knows how things work. I don't disagree with the idea. But why did he have to do it so soon? I just didn't see the need for that now. He was supposed to understand politics. He could have been in a better position now with the budget if he hadn't taken that on."
As for the budget, some people find it overwhelming -- and suspect Congress does, too. "It's hard to get your mind around that many millions," said Mrs. Kusnierek. "Can you comprehend all those zeroes? That doesn't mean anything to me. The deficit to me is kind of unreal."
If people knew anything about the budget -- and most people knew quite a bit -- they knew taxes would go up
Some people said they were willing to accept higher taxes combined with spending cuts, but seemed not to have imagined what their bill would be. Some figured that a few hundred dollars a year in higher income taxes would be worth the peace of mind of a lower deficit. Some people were resigned to it. Some seemed almost giddy, figuring they would not have to pay that much because most of the increase, they thought, would be aimed at the wealthy.
"We danced in the 80's," said Mr. Schultz, the antique-furniture dealer. "Now we have to pay."
While a few people here worried that the energy tax might lead to inflation, many others seemed to like the idea because they think it will get people to stop squandering energy resources. They felt especially good about a proposed energy credit for low-income families to offset higher energy prices.
But the conversations always returned to President Clinton and how he is doing. "Who would think that a man who played the media so well and came out of the rubble of the campaign would make the kind of mistakes he's made?" Ms. Keenan asked.
Many people accuse the Republicans in Congress of being sore losers and getting in the way. "We gave them people 12 years," Mr. Schultz said. "The Republicans should say: 'The ball's in your court. We don't agree with it. But we'll let you have it.' And if it don't work, you won't be President anymore."
Some say it could be a good thing that the young overachievers in the White House are learning their lessons now. "They're making mistakes," said Ferdinand Peters, a Merriam Park lawyer. "That shows they're human."
Mr. Hollinshead, another forgiving Democrat, said: "It's not just a new man learning the Presidency. It's a new generation learning the Presidency."

HEADLINE: Dockside Commerce and Industry;
In Fleet Week, Russians Raise Cash; Americans Talk Love

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
It has been 130 years since a Russian warship docked in New York City, so before steaming into town this week at the helm of his Russian destroyer, Comdr. Mikhail Soldatov said he tried to bone up with some background reading: Jack London, Mark Twain and James Fenimore Cooper.
Despite all the preparation, many aspects of life in New York City have surprised Commander Soldatov and his crew. Chief boatswain's mate Nikolai Nagut, for instance, said he was most impressed by New York drivers. "They are masters of the road, this way the cars move through the traffic," Mr. Nagut said. 
 The 400 Russians on the destroyer, the Bezuderzhny, and its accompanying oiler ship have joined some 7,300 American sailors for the United States Navy's sixth annual Fleet Week, when warships dock in New York City and American sailors deploy themselves throughout the city on thousands of search-and-enjoy missions.
 
A Good Time
 So far, everyone seems to be having a good time.
Many of the Russians, confined to their ships except for a few chaperoned excursions and apparently short on hard currency, have turned their destroyer's stern deck into a veritable bazaar, selling uniforms and insignias with good-natured enthusiasm to tourists. For their part, the Americans have been doing what sailors do when dockside -- sightseeing, drinking and proposing marriage to female bartenders.
"I've had a lot of them ask me to go back to their ship and sail away with them," said Heidi Snyder, the 18-year-old drink-pourer at the Olympic Bar, at 12th Avenue and 48th Street, just across from Pier 88, where the Bezuderzhny and the American aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are docked. She said "about 40" American sailors have told her that they have fallen in love with her since the fleet docked on Wednesday.
"I've had everything from marriage to will you have my kids? I've gotten it all," Ms. Snyder said.
More than a dozen American ships and the two Russian ships steamed into New York harbor to a 21-gun salute on Wednesday, and on Thursday evening there was a splendid assemblage of the two countries' naval officers -- white-shoed, epauleted and draped in gold braid -- under the ballroom chandeliers at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan.
"New York is a great Navy town," Adm. Henry H. Mauz, the commander in chief of the United States Atlantic fleet, said at the dinner. "New Yorkers seem to respond to sailors in uniform, like they evoke memories of Gene Kelly or something."
Vice Adm. Alekseyevich Poroshin, deputy commander of Russia's northern fleet, nibbling hors d'oeuvres, said through an interpreter that after researching naval records he had concluded that the last visit to New York waters by any Russian warship came in 1863, when three Russian ships docked to express Russian solidarity with the Union cause during the Civil War.
 
Sailors Meet the Mayor
 Admiral Poroshin's spokesman, Mikhail Borikov, said that besides the formal dinner, Russian officers and some sailors have met with Mayor David N. Dinkins, squared off against United States sailors in soccer and basketball games, and planned to see a Yankees game.
Mr. Borikov, who is not a man for chit-chat, summed up: "American hospitality has conquered the hearts of our sailors."
One teen-age sailor, Dmitri Vaneyev, who spoke with a visitor on the rear deck of the Bezuderzhny through an interpreter, said he found New York to be "a very impressive city."
 
Souvenirs and Cannons
 Dozens of other sailors, working in the shadow of the turret of the Bezuderzhny's 130-millimeter cannon, were selling bits of their uniforms to tourists.
"I walked on board and saw they were trading, so I joined in," said Alex Feldman, an Israeli tourist who bought a seaman's cotton shirt for $10. "Whatever they have -- their shoes, their shirts, their hats -- they'll sell you."
Mr. Feldman's nephew, Andy Feldman, drew out a brass belt buckle, stamped with hammer and sickle, newly purchased from a Russian sailor. "He wanted $5 but I got him down to $3," said Mr. Feldman, who lives in Brooklyn.
A Russian sailor approached and drew up his shirt to display a braided, mustard-colored service belt. Flashing five fingers into the air, twice, the sailor indicated he wanted $10 for the belt. Another sailor, pulling bits of uniforms and insignias from a shopping bag, sought to sell a Russian Navy watch, with a stem wind, for $30.
One likely reason the sailors were selling uniforms, a Navy spokesman said, was that Russian seamen, with their economy in crisis, earn as little as $25 a month. Base pay for an American sailor, in contrast, is $815 a month.
That differential gives American sailors more pocket money, which many, of course, have been spending on liquid spirits. Seaman Ira C. Gibbs, who works in the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy's print shop, bar-hopped his way through much of midtown during Fleet Week's first night. When he got up after just three hours sleep, he said he was eager to party some more.
But there were also new-age sailors, the fighting men and women who said they avoid not only strong drink but also high-cholesterol foods. For instance, Vernon L. Black of Pittsburgh, a third-class petty officer on the Kennedy, said he spent much of Thursday browsing through the New York City Public Library.
He said he was drawn in by a glimpse of the library's oil paintings. Once inside, he said, he got interested in the frieze work on the ceiling. "The way people do research in that library is unreal," he said.

HEADLINE: USX Must Pay $630 Million in Price-Fixing

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
In one of the largest antitrust judgments, a Federal court has ruled that the USX Corporation must pay roughly $630 million to several steel companies that brought a price-fixing suit against a former USX subsidiary, the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Company.
The decision Thursday by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, in Philadelphia, upheld a 1991 ruling that found the railroad had conspired from the 1950's to the early 80's to monopolize the docks in lower Lake Erie ports and had fixed prices for transporting and unloading iron ore. 
 "It really redresses genuine economic harm that the steel companies suffered over a number of years," said William M. Wycoff, a Pittsburgh-based lawyer who represented National Steel and Sharon Steel in the case. Other plaintiffs in the case include the Wheeling Pittsburgh Corporation and the LTV Corporation of Cleveland.
LTV, the nation's third-largest steel company, will get the largest share of the award, $458 million plus 8 percent annual interest from July 1989.
USX, the nation's largest steelmaker, sold its transporation business, including the Bessemer & Lake Erie, in 1988, but remains liable for the judgment. The railroad is now a subsidiary of Transtar, in which USX holds a 44 percent equity stake.
The company said yesterday that it would appeal Thursday's ruling to either the United States Supreme Court or to a full panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
USX said it expected that any award would be deductible for income tax purposes and that even though it expected to prevail on appeal it would reserve most of the award against the second-quarter results of its United States Steel Group. The stock of the United States Steel Group fell $2.625 yesterday, to $43, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The suits were filed in 1983 but the roots of the case date to the 1950's, when technology emerged to pelletize iron ore. That enabled the use of self-unloading vessels, which essentially operated their own conveyor belt systems to move iron ore off ships.
 
 
Plaintiffs' Contention
 This new technology would have represented a saving over the more traditional method of unloading ore with what were, in effect, large mechanized scoops. But the plaintiffs contended that the railroads, because of their near-monopoly position, did not lower their prices, which made investing in the new technology unwise.
Other railroads, including Conrail and Norfolk & Western settled their cases out of court earlier.
LTV, which plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection next month after seven years, said it would use the money from USX to help restore its pension plans. It has about $3 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.

HEADLINE: German Court Restricts Abortion, Angering Feminists and the East

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 28

 BODY:
Germany's highest court ruled today that the country's new liberal abortion law was unconstitutional. The court imposed interim restrictions that outraged feminists, especially those from eastern states, where abortion had been freely available for 20 years.
The Constitutional Court sent the issue back to Parliament, which passed the law last year making abortions legal in the first three months of pregnancy. But the court sought in the meantime to set compromise guidelines as it ruled on an issue that is as hotly debated here as in the United States. 
 It ruled that abortion was unconstitutional because it violates a constitutional provision requiring the state to protect human life. But at the same time, making use of its broad judicial prerogatives, the court said that women who undergo abortions in the first three months of pregnancy and their doctors should not be prosecuted even though the abortions are themselves illegal.
 
Insurance Won't Pay
 The legality issue is significant because as long as abortions are officially illegal, health insurance plans will not be allowed to pay for them and state-supported hospitals will stop performing them.
The court also ruled that a woman seeking an abortion must receive counseling that is not a "merely informational" recital of available options, but rather an active effort to dissuade her.
"The woman must be aware that the unborn child has its own right to life," the court said. "Abortion can only be considered in exceptional circumstances."
In practice, women who can afford to pay for abortions will continue to do so, and neither they nor their doctors will be punished if the abortion is performed in the first three months of pregnancy and if they have gone through the required counseling.
The court session was broadcast on national television. After the broadcast ended, protesters took to the streets in several German cities. Hundreds gathered in front of the historic Cologne Cathedral. At a spontaneous rally in Potsdam, one woman carried a sign reading, "This ruling is violence against women! I've had enough!"
Catholic bishops hailed the ruling and asserted in a statement, "The real winner is humanity."
Chancellor Helmut Kohl praised the court for having declared itself "clearly in favor of truly protecting unborn life." He said he expected all federal agencies to move swiftly toward full compliance.
Among the first attacks on the court ruling came from Regine Hildebrandt, minister for social affairs in the state of Brandenburg and one of the most popular politicians in eastern Germany. She denounced the ruling as "a return to the Middle Ages."
"This is a catastrophe," Mrs. Hildebrandt said as she and other angry female politicians left the courtroom in the western town of Karlsruhe. "This is just impossible at the end of the 20th century."
Many Catholic leaders endorsed the appeal to the Constitutional Court, and some lobbied behind the scenes for tighter restrictions. Only a few Protestant leaders, however, joined their call for a tighter restriction on abortion. Many oppose abortion but are not in favor of regulating it.
Almost half of western Germans are Catholics, while the percentage in the east is much smaller.
 
Law Must Fit Guidelines
 Rules announced by the court today are to take effect June 16. Parliament may pass a new abortion law thereafter, but it must fit within guidelines laid down by the court.
The ruling was likely not only to end a chapter in the German abortion debate, but also to intensify resentment felt by many easterners, who are seeing their social safety net weaken and the last remnants of East German life disappear.
From 1973 until its collapse in 1990, the East German state provided abortions without charge to all women who wanted them. Laws were stricter in West Germany, where abortion was allowed only if doctors certified that continued pregnancy would be harmful to the woman or her child, or if pregnancy was the result of a criminal assault.
The treaty of German unification signed in 1990 allowed existing abortion rules to remain in force until Parliament passed a new law for the whole country. Last year, after an emotional debate during which politicians from the east demanded that abortion rights not be curtailed, Parliament voted to legalize most abortions performed in the first three months of pregnancy. But 249 members of Parliament from Chancellor Kohl's ruling coalition, joined by the state government of largely Catholic Bavaria, challenged the law in court on the ground that it did not protect unborn life.
 
A 6-to-2 vote
 The court voted 6 to 2 for the new rules. Judges dressed in ceremonial red satin robes and pillbox hats listened as their chief, Ernst Gottfried Mahrenholz, read from the 183-page decision. Mr. Mahrenholz was one of the two dissenters, but the lone woman on the court, Karin Grasshof, voted with the majority. All the justices are from western Germany.
No easterners are on the court, nor is it expected that any will be appointed in the near future, because none have had careers in the west German system of law and members serve for 12 years. The Constitutional Court as an institution has generally been conservative.
The number of abortions performed in eastern and western Germany has been steadily declining. There were about 125,000 abortions here in 1991, the last year for which figures are available, in comparison with more than 180,000 in 1981.
Several influential feminists urged women to organize protests against the ruling.
Monica Wulf-Mathies, head of the German public employees' union and the country's most prominent female labor leader, encouraged members of her union to "show their indignation." She said the ruling showed that "men are not very sensitive to problems that face women."
 
Beyond Reach of Poor
 A senior member of Parliament, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, said the ruling effectively legalized abortion for women who could pay the costs, which range from about $200 to $650, but placed it beyond the reach of poorer women, especially the many who are unemployed in eastern states.
"If you have money you can have an abortion," Mrs. Weiczorek-Zeul said. "If you don't, then you have to find some quack."
While the decision announced today was a form of compromise, it imposes limitations on abortion that are among the tightest in Europe. Ireland maintains a complete ban, and Poland recently adopted a law that is almost as sweeping. Germany now joins Spain, Portugal and Italy as countries that impose some restrictions. Other European countries allow abortion virtually on request during the first three months of pregnancy.

HEADLINE: Once Off-Limits, Now Destinations With an Edge

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Declaring that tourism produces "a very big income," Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya proposed in a recent televised speech that his country encourage mass tourism. And Colonel Qaddafi is not alone in assuming that travel and tourism can aid struggling economies.
Destinations as diverse as Croatia and Peru are struggling to repair their war-torn tourist infrastructures. Egypt is cracking down on radical Islamic fundamentalists, and one reason officials give is that the terrorists' campaign is harming the country's $3 billion tourist industry, Egypt's largest source of foreign revenue. And the hope of luring tourists with hard currency is why China and Cuba are racing to build hotels, restaurants and other amenities of the travel trade. 
 Their view is supported in a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, a Brussels-based coalition of chief executives from more than 50 travel-related corporations in many countries.
 
 
It's Not Always Easy
 "A buoyant travel and tourism sector will employ more people" and create new jobs and careers faster than any other industry, said the report, compiled by a group of international economists. It added, "Unlike many industries, there are no lengthy time lags before new jobs, foreign exchange and extra purchasing power filter into the economy."
But luring tourists to trouble spots, or what they perceive to be trouble spots, is no simple matter.
For example, officials in Croatia and Slovenia, in what was formerly Yugoslavia, are eager to restore what had been a thriving tourist trade, but find foreigners confuse their areas with war-wracked Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"Slovenia and Croatia are both perfectly safe," said Rose Pace-Bogdanic, the senior vice president of Sterling Cruises and Tours of Austin, Tex. "They just suffer from an identity crisis."
She and Damir-Dodo Bogdanic, her Croatian-born husband, used to promote tours to all of Yugoslavia, until age-old hatreds between Serbs and Croats fragmented the country in 1990 and plunged it into civil war. Last year, Sterling began offering tour packages to the castles, mountains and beaches of Slovenia, which declared its independence in 1991. And later this year it plans to offer tours to Croatia, which has suffered far less damage than some other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Toward that end, Sterling opened a branch office last month in Ridgefield, N.J., staffed by a former executive of Yugotours International in Belgrade.
"Not everyone's going to rush out and go there on a tour," Mrs. Pace-Bogdanic said. "So we plan to start on a limited basis."
But some Americans are visiting Slovenia. "The view in North America may be that it's an unsafe place, but it's not as though you're traveling to Bosnia-Herzegovina," Scott Schnipper, an American traveler, said by telephone from London last week shortly before his departure. "It has a modern infrastructure and modern communications."
Cuba has an improving tourist climate, including hotels under construction, but is unlikely to rake in Americans' dollars so long as United States law bars most citizens from spending money there.
Nor have tourists been flocking to Libya so far, and Colonel Qaddafi sidestepped any mention of United Nations sanctions against Libya for harboring suspected terrorists -- sanctions that include a ban on travel to his country.
Another indication that Libya is unlikely to reap a tourist bonanza anytime soon, at least from English-speaking visitors, is the reluctance of Lonely Planet Publications to add a Libyan travel guide to its book list, which includes guides for such difficult or dangerous destinations as Iran, Myanmar, Yemen, Peru, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Bangladesh.
"Nobody's knocking down our door for a book on Libya," said Carolyn Miller, promotions manager for Lonely Planet in Oakland, Calif. "In fact, I don't think I ever heard of any tourist wanting to go there."
Other countries eager for tourism also have a lot to learn about visitors' expectations. In "Falling Off the Map," a book published this month by Alfred A. Knopf, a travel writer, Pico Iyer, notes that North Korea is building the world's largest tourist hotel, 105 stories high -- although few tourists visit the country, which remains one of the world's most regimented and closed societies.
Similarly, Vietnam is not most Americans' idea of a vacation paradise, even though Hanoi designated 1990 as the "Year of Tourism." That same year, it began to remodel all of its hotels. It still offers few other amenities for tourists, and visitors say the Vietnamese appear to have unrealistic expectations of what the tourist traffic will bear.
"What would be, at most, a three-star hotel by our standards, costs around $200 a night," said Dianne Yamamoto of Los Angeles, who recently returned from a 10-day trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. "It was an incredible visit, but you have to be prepared to rough it, because there's very little tourist infrastructure."
 In contrast to Vietnam, Egypt has well-developed tourism operations, and intrepid travelers continue to visit the Pyramids and cruise the Nile despite attacks by Islamic extremists.
"Reports of problems in Egypt affected our business," conceded Aza Hussein, operations manager for Naggar Tours in San Francisco, a wholesale travel operator specializing in Egypt. "But groups are still traveling there."
John Yee, a tour leader with Asian Discoveries, a travel agency in Kensington, Calif., branched out to take about 20 people to Egypt last month for 12 days. "Only two people in our group canceled for safety reasons," he said. "And they missed out on a great visit. Besides, there were no lines at tourist sites."
Few tourist destinations have been as devastated as Peru, which in the 1980's attracted tens of thousands of visitors to Inca sites like Machu Picchu and Cuzco. But a terrorist war that broke out in Ayacucho in 1980 spread through much of the nation, claiming an estimated 25,000 lives, and a cholera epidemic two years ago claimed another several thousand. Tourists stayed away in droves.
Now, with the founder of the Shining Path terrorists, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, serving a life sentence, officials in Ayacucho and Lima are eager to revive tourism. And that prospect may not be as farfetched as it sounds.
"The last couple of years you could have called me two days before Christmas, and I could have booked a room for you at the Machu Picchu Hotel de Turistas,," said Luis Vasquez, owner of M.I.L.A./Peru Tours in Wadsworth, Ill. "But it's already sold out for Christmas this year, and tourism to the rest of Peru has been picking up for the last few months."
Tourism is also rebounding in China following sharp declines after Government troops killed protesters around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. More than 300,000 Americans and 600,000 Japanese visit China each year, and Beijing hopes to raise those numbers significantly. Thus, it recently joined the Pacific Asia Travel Association, a San Francisco-based organization of airlines, cruise ships, hotels and tour operators from both the private and public sectors.
Michael Justice, a Los Angeles photographer who recently returned from China, said he had been uneasy about visiting the country after its suppression of protesters.
"But a visit isn't an endorsement," he said. "You go to see what's real in a country, before they put up lots of fast-food restaurants."
He added, "Besides, my mother was quite happy to see me leave Los Angeles for someplace safer."

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: The Outlook;
Will It Help or Harm? Economists Say Yes and Yes

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Deficit reduction is a two-edged sword, and now that the House of Representatives has approved higher taxes and reduced spending, economists are assessing whether the budget plan will help the economy by cutting interest rates or harm it by cutting jobs.
Their answer: a little of each. 
 A lot will depend on how the Senate decides to change the tax increases and spending cuts when it considers the bill next month.
The biggest unknown is what will happen to the proposed energy tax. Several economists recommended trimming that tax and making more spending cuts instead, as Republicans tried unsuccessfully to do in the House and will try again, with some Democratic support, in the Senate.
 
Threat of Inflation
 If the energy tax is not altered, some economists said, it would add a bit to inflation over the next few years, heightening concerns about prices and perhaps leading the Federal Reserve Board to tighten interest rates.
These economists also warned of a brief but noticeable drag on the economy this winter if, as the House bill dictates, personal income tax increases are made retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. That would force wealthier taxpayers to come up with a total of about $10 billion in 1993 taxes that would be due on April 15, just as their 1994 paychecks begin to shrink as the withholding of taxes takes effect.
"If it goes through this way, it is a double whammy on the economy at the end of this year and the beginning of next year," said Laurence Meyer, who owns a consulting company in St. Louis. "People are going to have to pay two years of taxes at once. And I suspect, given the weakness we are seeing in the economy right now, that the Congress and the Administration will be reluctant to do that."
While the economy would be held back by tax increases and spending cuts, the economists said, in the long run it would benefit from an end to the uncertainty that has clouded it and from a focused attack on the deficit.
"The deficit reduction is an important drag on the economy, and as it gets larger as years go by it becomes a heavier drag," said Donald H. Straszheim, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "Offsetting that is the benefit of lower interest rates associated with a more coherent fiscal policy and lower deficits."
 
Drag on Economy
 Mr. Meyer agreed. "Deficit reduction puts a drag on the economy in the near term; there is no way of escaping that," he said. "There never seems like a good time to do it."
The Administration, he said, forced by circumstance to take a disciplined approach to the deficit, has for the time being put the economy, and to some extent its own political fortunes, in the hands of the Federal Reserve Board.
John P. LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said in an interview that "on the face of it, huge tax increases and huge spending cuts spell contraction." The Fed, which has recently been hinting that its concerns about inflation are growing, will have to wait for the economic program to emerge in final form from the Senate before deciding what to do with monetary policy, he said. He said he was concerned about the prospect of "stagflation," in which inflation combines with economic stagnation.
But Robert F. Wescott, an economist at the WEFA Group in Philadelphia, said the mere presentation of the Clinton budget earlier this year drove down interest rates and that the Fed's role should not be exaggerated.
"The Fed controls short-term interest rates, and the markets control long-term interest rates," he said. "The action has been on the long end of the market since Clinton was elected."
His economic models suggest that the decline in interest rates earlier this year had the same effect as a $25 billion stimulus program.
Over all, he said, WEFA's models show "a slight plus" for the economy in 1993 and 1994, followed by a decline of perhaps half a percentage point in economic growth by 1996 and 1997, when military cuts are felt heavily and the energy tax is fully in place. By the end of the decade, the economy would be better off under the plan, he said.
For the short term, said Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch, the uncertainties over the final shape of the budget program are holding back businesses from making investments. But even after a budget is approved, there will be continuing uncertainty as businesses await details of the health-care program with its additional costs.
Mr. Straszheim said Merrill Lynch was forecasting long-term interest rates of 6.5 to 7 percent for the rest of this year, with "a pretty good chance" of lower rates next year.
 
Importance of Taking Action
 Roger Brinner, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economics consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., said his company's studies showed that an energy tax would be more harmful than either a value added tax, which is not being seriously considered, or bigger spending cuts, which are.
"The energy tax was clearly the worst," he said, asserting that it adds to inflation, reduces American competitiveness and does less to reduce the Federal deficit than any of the others.
Nevertheless, he said, continuing progress on the budget plan would be helpful almost regardless of what action is taken. "A definitive set of tax and spending plans, even if you don't like them, is better than worrying about what might be," he said. "Even though I am no big fan of the energy tax, I think it will be fixed in the Senate. Within two months the public's mind will be taken off speculation about what the Congress will do, and consumers and businesses will be back to their daily occupations."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Seldom has a national figure stirred so much wonder and speculation in the news media by saying things that most of the American public consider unremarkable.
In an April 6 speech in Austin, Tex., and several interviews since then, Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about the Golden Rule and the Ten Commandments and "common-sense truth." She borrowed the Presidential bully pulpit from her husband, and here is what she declared: 
 *That the United States, despite its wealth, was feeling an "undercurrent of discontent" and a collapse of community, of which urban violence and teen-agers' self-destruction were only the most dramatic symptoms.
*That the dying Lee Atwater, the impresario of bare-knuckled Republican campaigns, was right to warn of a "spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society."
*That national renewal could not be found simply by shoring up Government programs or relying on the marketplace but would require "an ethos of individual responsibility and caring," a society that "makes us feel that we are a part of something bigger than ourselves" and the reinvigoration of "intermediary institutions" like families, local communities and voluntary groups.
*That "there is no -- or should be no -- debate that our family structure is in trouble" or that "our children need the stability, the predictability of a family."
Sometimes Mrs. Clinton sounded like Vaclav Havel, sometimes like Martin Luther King Jr., and sometimes, well, like George Bush with his "vision thing" and a thousand points of light.
The media have blinked with astonishment, if not consternation. "She sounded as if she's discovered spiritual truths that eluded Buddha and Jesus," sniffed one columnist. Incoherent and didactic, sniffed others.
In her Austin speech and in the interviews that followed, Mrs. Clinton praised her father's insistence that compassion for wrongdoers is not incompatible with firm standards of right and wrong. She talked of her inextinguishable conviction that people can be evil, not just socially conditioned. She suggested that the nation had become too tolerant of deviant behavior.
But she also rested her vision of social renewal on, yes, the Golden Rule and a personal change of heart. She imagined that lots of individual acts could add up to a big change, beginning with something as simple as not telling a racist or sexist joke and building to a larger awareness of economic hardships and inequities.
Children, cover your ears.
In 1976, Jimmy Carter rattled the press by explaining that he actually listened for God's guidance when facing important decisions. Apparently unfamiliar with the processes of prayer that most Americans take for granted, some pundits wondered whether the Baptist Mr. Carter was having apparitions.
Their successors are showing no more familiarity with the weekly exhortations from a million American pulpits, exhortations about caring, searching for meaning, applying old values to new problems, transforming society, etc., etc. Mrs. Clinton's talk of spirituality and moral values fits comfortably in this genre. It makes her neither incoherent nor an Orwellian Big Sister with New Age accessories.
Her actual words were far more Girl Scout than goddess worship, more concerned with strengthening non-governmental groups than expanding the state.
Michael Kelly may have been severe with Mrs. Clinton in parts of his revealing interview last Sunday in The New York Times Magazine, but he was on target when he wrote that Mrs. Clinton's liberalism is derived from her religious faith. Her politics combine, he wrote, "a generally 'progressive' social agenda with a strong dose of moralism, the admixture of the two driven by an abundant faith in the capacity of the human intellect and the redeeming power of love."
Admittedly Mrs. Clinton is a complex, political woman who zig-zags across stereotypes, both naturally and by calculation. But she has also become a kind of national Rorschach test where commentators project their own fears and weaknesses.
Her recent critics appear divided between conservatives who suspect she does not mean what she is saying and liberals who fear that she does. They include people who are wary of any political figures talking about values and spirituality and people who are just wary when Mrs. Clinton starts talking that way.
Convinced that the real meaning of her words must be couched below the surface, the commentators are poring over the ideas of Michael Lerner, the editor of the Jewish journal Tikkun, whose phrase, "the politics of meaning," Mrs. Clinton echoed in Texas. And they are trying hard to link Mrs. Clinton's remarks to her roots in the youthful movements for social change of the 1960's.
But Mrs. Clinton's remarks actually reflect almost nothing of Mr. Lerner's quite specific, highly psychological theory of "the politics of meaning" (which constitutes, by the way, a critique of 1960's liberal and radical politics). She seems to have borrowed no more from him than from any number of other thinkers whom the Clintons mine for ideas.
It is not whether the First Lady's outlook is some rare political departure but whether it will have any impact on the policies of her husband's Administration that ought to be the focus of attention. What is being called her moral crusade may be more compatible with the standard liberal agenda than either her conservative or liberal critics recognize.
But if she is enunciating a viewpoint that sees national renewal more in strengthening families and communities and less in claims of individual rights and entitlements, if she is trying to marry social conservatism with an economically interventionist government, sooner or later some policy difference should emerge.
Mrs. Clinton's soundest critics are not those who reflexively recoil at her talk about a spiritual vacuum and an ethos of individual responsibility and caring, but those who fear that it is only talk.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY SLOWED IN FIRST QUARTER

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Growth in the United States economy slowed to a near-standstill in the winter while inflation sped up, the Commerce Department reported yesterday in its second look at economic performance between January and March.
The report prompted investors to sell stocks, stirred fears of a tighter monetary policy and revived talk of that 1970's scourge, stagflation. 
 The gross domestic product expanded at a barely perceptible rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter -- the slowest pace since six-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991 and a sharp slowdown from the 4 percent pace of last year's second half.
 
Surge in Imports
 The revised rate was just half the meager 1.8 percent first-quarter rate that the Commerce Department reported a month ago. A big surge in imports -- much of which apparently went unsold and ended up in inventories -- accounted for the downward revision in growth.
But first-quarter inflation was at its highest since a 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter of 1991. In the latest quarter, the fixed-weight G.D.P. deflator -- the broadest inflation measure -- rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said, the same as estimated a month ago. That compared with 3.4 percent last fall and 2.2 percent in the summer.
Clinton Administration officials pointed to the revised G.D.P. data and the inflation figures as reasons for advancing their agenda of economic remedies.
"This shows why we needed the President's stimulus package to get the economy rolling for the short term," Jack F. DeVore Jr., the chief Treasury Department spokesman, said. "If we fail to enact his deficit reduction program, we're going to see the same kind of economic problems over the long term."
Last month, President Clinton's proposal to spend nearly $20 billion for jobs and public works projects was killed by a filibuster in the Senate. But his budget measure calling for tax increases and other measures to cut the deficit was approved by the House Thursday night.
Economists said fear of higher taxes and the uncertainty over the impact of the Administration's health-care proposals were the main reasons behind the slow growth.
Sizable revisions in G.D.P. figures like those announced yesterday are not unusual. Many of the components of gross domestic product -- the sum of all goods and services produced within United States -- are measured only indirectly and the estimates can change as fresh data are gathered.
For example, export and import figures for March were not available when the initial first-quarter G.D.P. report was issued in late April, so the quarterly trade figures had to be estimated based on the performance of January and February.
Most of the sources of slower growth in yesterday's revised report looked much as they did in the department's original report: consumers, who had been buying faster than their incomes were rising, barely raised their spending in the quarter; housing weakened, and a huge drop in military purchases took a big bite out of Federal outlays.
Consumer spending on goods and services accounts for two-thirds of the economy. With buying basically flat, inventories rose a hefty $36.8 billion, about what was originally estimated, much higher than the $9.8 billion inventory rise in the fourth quarter last year. The high inventories show that businesses have abundant stocks on their shelves that must be sold before more production is required.
The upward creep in inflation over the last few quarters, while not necessarily likely to continue, recently led the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee to authorize the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, to tighten monetary policy before the next meeting if conditions warrant.
"Things aren't going very well," said Joel Prakken an economist at Laurecne Meyer & Associates , a St. Louis economic forecasting firm.
Nonetheless, despite the looming uncertainties over taxes, health-care changes and Fed policy, most forecasters see signs that the economy is doing better now than in the winter. They expect growth to return to 3 percent or so in the year's second half and inflation to subside a bit.
Recent reports suggest that retail sales, car purchasing and home buying have picked up in April and May. Government spending, while on a gently downward path, is not apt to decline as sharply as it did in the winter, when military spending contracted at an abrupt annual rate of more than 25 percent. And foreign producers are likely to share some of the pain as orders are reduced to get inventories back into line with sales.
"In the second quarter, we should get a substantial reversal in imports," Gordon Richards, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said.
But growth in the current quarter could easily remain shy of the 3 percent rate.
"A lot of businessmen were totally misled by strong consumption late last year," Mr. Richards said. "Those inventories have to be liquidated."
If growth does fall short of 3 percent, further gains on the job front could be slow in coming.
"Lack of momentum can beget lack of momentum," David Kelly, an economist at the Boston Company, said. Slow growth can "create pent-up demand, but it also cuts off income growth that would have been generated by stronger job growth," he added.
 
Some Bright Spots
 The Commerce Department report was not all gloom. Businesses have been spending even more heavily on new equipment than originally thought, and the report indicated that this trend might continue.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Dip in Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury issues fell moderately in light trading yesterday as traders wound up their investment strategies ahead of the holiday weekend.
But after an unusually volatile week dominated by bearish news, long-term Treasury prices ended the week slightly higher as traders shed some of their fears that the Federal Reserve might soon act to tighten monetary policy. 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 20/32 of a point, while its yield climbed to 6.98 percent, from 6.92 percent late Thursday. Still, that was down from its yield of 7.04 percent on the previous Friday.
Analysts said yesterday's selling was mostly a result of traders' getting out of risky positions before the three-day holiday.
 
 
Thin Trading Volume
 John Fechter, head government securities trader at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the bond sales had an exaggerated influence on price and yield movements because of the light trading.
Fears in the market about the central bank's interest-rate policy were eased somewhat by a report that the American economy's growth in the first quarter was much slower than first estimated. The Government said the gross domestic product -- the sum of all goods and services produced -- registered an anemic growth rate of nine-tenths of a percent, seasonally adjusted, in the first three months of the year.
The Fed would be hard-pressed to raise rates given the persistent economic weakness, Mr. Fechter said.
Yesterday's selloff, confined largely to longer-term maturities, was also tied to more fundamental factors, said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
"What's disturbing the market is the continued weakness in the dollar and the upward bias in precious metals prices," Mr. Sullivan said.
The dollar's plunge against leading foreign currencies is making dollar-denominated investments like fixed-income securities less attractive.
In addition, a weak dollar means higher prices for imports. And when imports become more expensive, domestic producers may begin to increase prices in tandem, fueling inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
Also contributing to speculation that prices in the economy are headed higher is this year's powerful rally in gold, which is considered an investment hedge against inflation.
Short-term Treasuries ended unchanged to 1/32 point lower, and intermediate maturities were between 5/32 and 3/8 lower, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.29, to 1,285.29.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 1 basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.05 percent. The discount rates on six-month bills slipped 1 basis point, to 3.21 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills gained 8 basis points, to 3.46 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10027/32 , down 1/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.89 percent.

Rudolph W. Giuliani and Herman Badillo joined forces to run for Mayor and Comptroller in a Republican-Liberal alliance against Mayor Dinkins. As he clutched a microphone atop a flatbed truck at East 116th Street and Lexington Avenue in East Harlem, Mr. Badillo, a Democrat and the elder statesman of the city's Hispanic politicians, said he was joining Mr. Giuliani, a Republican and a former Federal prosecutor, "to rebuild our great city, restoring it to a place where standards are applied and met."

Shaleen Wadhwami and Hema Sakhrani met and fell in love at New York University. They planned to marry in July, a month before Mr. Wadhwami was to start medical school on a full scholarship. But one man did not share their joy. Chandran Nathan, the police said, had an obsession with Ms. Sakhrani. Late Wednesday night, the police said, he went to the door of Mr. Wadhwami's home in Manhasset, L.I., and fired 20 bullets at the young man, killing him as his parents slept upstairs. Anguished, Ms. Sakhrani jumped to her death yesterday morning from the 16th-floor terrace of her family's apartment in Rego Park, Queens, the police said. Page 1.

HEADLINE: Bill Gingerly Urges Talks On Segregation Problems

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 28

 BODY:
In a first tentative step toward addressing the racial and economic segregation of schools in Connecticut's cities, the State House of Representatives voted early today for legislation that urges towns and cities to cooperate regionally to improve all public schools.
The bill, expected to win approval in the Senate next week, is much weaker than legislation submitted four months ago by the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., which set goals for racially integrating schools across each of six regions of the state. 
 But it was supported by Governor Weicker and his commissioner of education, Vincent Ferrandino, because it would require, for the first time, towns and cities across entire metropolitan regions to discuss cooperating to improve their schools.
"What we're saying in this bill is that we believe that everyone ought to at least sit down and talk about this issue and try to develop a plan," Mr. Ferrandino said. "We also believe that once that process begins, people will be able to find some common ground. We're assuming the best of communities."
 
Concern Over Quality
 Governor Weicker urged the state to overcome the racial and economic divisions between its cities and towns in January, as testimony was being heard in a lawsuit that seeks a desegregation order linking schools in Hartford with those in 21 surrounding towns.
The state's poor black and Hispanic children, concentrated in a handful of cities, were not getting an adequate education, he said, and the entire state would eventually end up paying for that failure.
In months of lobbying for a bill that promoted integration as essential to improving the quality of schools, Mr. Ferrandino repeatedly warned that this year might be Connecticut's last to address the issue in the Legislature, rather than under a court order.
The bill approved today, in an 81-68 vote, will require towns and cities, divided into 11 regions, to consider how to raise the quality of education by such means as new schools or programs that serve children from more than one community.
 
Incentives for Participation
 It does not, however, require communities to take part in the plans that result. Instead, it provides incentives: grants to help pay for new regional schools, and reimbursement for transporting children from one town to another.
The bill's only power is that it allows the Department of Education to set the criteria by which each region's plan will be assessed in a competition for the school grants. The degree to which a plan improves the racial balance in a region's schools will be a critical factor, Mr. Ferrandino said.
But unlike Mr. Weicker's proposal, the bill does not use the words "integrate," "racial isolation" or "minority." Its only reference to race is to include, as the last of several goals in improving the quality of education, "enhancing student diversity."
The racial issue was minimized, both opponents and advocates of the bill said, because months of public debate found little support for desegregating schools across the town lines that have defined school districts in Connecticut for the last century.
Most suburban residents, legislative leaders said, recognize that schools in cities like Hartford, where 92 percent of the children are black and Hispanic and nearly two-thirds are poor, must be improved. But, the legislators said, they reject any argument that the inferior conditions are the result of racial barriers, and so they reject desegregation as a solution.
 
Skirting Racial Issue
 There is also broad sentiment, in both towns and cities, against the wide-scale reassignment and busing of students that people associate with desegregation plans.
"What I learned out of this whole experience is people's feelings, which are basically the same," said Representative Nancy Wyman, a Democrat from Tolland, who as co-chairwoman of the Education Committee played a large role in keeping the bill alive. "It's a fear on one side, and a realistic point of view on the other that we have to change to help our kids.
"You can walk into Hartford and people will say, just help us with our schools and make them better and leave our kids alone, and you can go down to Beacon Falls and they'll say the same thing," she continued. "Fix the schools where they need to be fixed."
The racial issue is so sensitive that in the seven hours of debate that began Thursday, even Representative Wyman would not directly acknowledge the bill's integration roots.
 
Parents Called 'Frightened'
 "Does student diversity mean racial diversity?" Representative Robert Farr, a Republican from West Hartford, asked her.
"It means all kinds of diversity," she replied, suggesting it could refer to children with physical handicaps. "If you want to talk about just racial diversity, that's your decision."
But Republicans, in proposing 10 amendments, including one to replace the bill with a statewide school-choice plan, repeatedly referred to the legislation as a desegregation plan.
"We're simply going to perpetuate the anxiety that parents now feel," Representative Paul J. Knierim of Simsbury, the ranking Republican on the Education Committee, said of the bill's planning process. "My constituents are absolutely frightened of what might happen to public schools."
Under the bill, local and regional planning groups made up of parents, elected officials, teachers and administrators will assess the needs of their public schools and draft regional plans. The planning phase would take place during 1994. State grants would be available for the 1995-96 school year.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: The Overview;
Clinton Takes His Fight For Budget on the Road

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Facing an even more difficult task in the Senate than he had in the House of Representatives, President Clinton went back on the road today to generate political support for his budget.
At a rally in the courtyard of Philadelphia's City Hall, he implored the crowd to "stay with us, fight with us" to keep the plan on track in the Senate. 
 Mr. Clinton's goal was to build on the momentum from the cliffhanger vote for his program in the House of Representatives on Thursday night. The White House and the Democratic Congressional leadership were forced to pull out all stops to win the vote for the President's package, 219 to 213. Thirty-eight Democrats joined all 175 Republicans in opposition.
Many Democrats have complained that the Republicans and Ross Perot have dominated the public discourse on the budget so far. They say many of their constituents do not know, for instance, that the package includes spending cuts or that most of the tax increases would be borne by the wealthy.
About two-thirds of the higher taxes would be owed by the 1 percent of taxpayers with incomes above $200,000, and about three-quarters would be imposed on the 6 percent with incomes above $100,000.
As senators left the capital today for a 10-day recess, no one could confidently predict the eventual shape of the legislation. What is clear, however, is that the battle ahead will be bitter and partisan.
 
Counting Democratic Heads
 On the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bulk of the legislation and which has a history of operating in a bipartisan fashion, all nine Republicans are sworn to oppose the President's program. That means all 11 Democrats must vote for the measure to keep it alive, and one of them, David L. Boren of Oklahoma, has said he cannot support it in its current form.
Many lobbyists and staff assistants who are following every twist and turn of the legislation suggested that the whole plan might sink, either because Mr. Clinton was unwilling to make the compromises necessary to get it through the Senate or because concessions to the Senate would make it unpalatable to the House in its final form.
"Every time you try to do something in one area, it bulges out somewhere else," said Alan Kranowitz, a business lobbyist who once worked in the Reagan White House.
But others said they expected enactment of a bill, somewhat different from what the President proposed perhaps, but still recognizable. "There's a fundamental recognition up here that the Presidency is in profound need of support, and that's working to the advantage of passage," said a Democratic staff strategist in the Senate.
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, agreed with that analysis. In an interview, he said: "It'll have a contentious time -- no question about that -- in the Finance Committee. But I just would think when all is said and done, it will probably pass. They'll make enough adjustments to attract the required Democratic votes, and you'll still be able to recognize it as Clinton's."
 
Reciting the Predictable
 What other Senators said in public was more predictable.
Senator Boren reiterated that he could not support the package unless the ratio of spending cuts to tax increases was made larger and unless the proposed new fuel tax was dropped or significantly modified.
Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee, said they expected the President's program to be approved basically intact.
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, disagreed completely. "I would say without fear of being wrong," he said on the "Morning News" program on CNN, "that this bill, this package, will not pass the Senate."
Mr. Domenici and all other Republicans in Congress, apparently, are opposing the President on both substantive and political grounds. Most of them say that the steep tax increases the President is proposing would be disastrous for an economy that seems to have little pep anyway. Further, they think that their reputation of favoring lower taxes, and the tax-and-spend charge they are leveling at Democrats, give them the best chance of picking up seats in Congress and regaining the White House in 1996.
Congressional Republicans have rarely been so united. Normally, some Republican Senators align themselves with Democrats on social and economic issues, just as some Democrats are often on the side of Republicans.
But Republican Senators got their backs up this spring after Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman of the Appropriations Committee, tried to use parliamentary tricks to freeze them out of the debate on Mr. Clinton's program to stimulate the economy. The Republicans' filibuster forced the withdrawal of that legislation and the senators have been feeling their oats ever since.
 
Unusual Republican Unity
 The House tends to operate on more partisan terms than the Senate, but even in the House, it is very unusual for the entire Republican Party to hang together as happened Thursday night.
The President's political consultant, Paul Begala, who went with him to Philadelphia, said Mr. Clinton would make many more trips in the days ahead to sell his plan.
"We have to do a better job of communicating to the American people," Mr. Begala said. "They have not heard our side of the story."
In his speech, Mr. Clinton defended his proposed energy tax, which is under heavy fire in the Senate. Since all states, regardless of population, have two senators, those from oil producing states, who generally oppose the tax, have a disproportionate influence.
Mr. Clinton argued that the tax would cost typical families of four only $1 a month next year, $7 a month in 1995 and $17 a month in 1996.
If cutting the budget deficit results in lower interest rates, the President said, "You will save more in interest rates than you'll ever pay in the energy tax, and you'll have a healthier economy and lower deficit."

HEADLINE: New York Telephone Plans to Lay Off 600 Managers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The New York Telephone Company, the state's second-largest employer, said yesterday that it plans to lay off 600 low- to middle-level managers around the state next September. The cost-cutting move would pare $36 million, or 1.8 percent, from the company's $1.97 billion payroll.
The layoffs -- the third round of involuntary dismissals since March 1992 in cuts ordered by Nynex, the company's parent -- will affect 8 percent of New York Telephone's 7,700 managers in switching centers, installation and repair offices and technical support and operator service centers across the state. 
 John Bonomo, a company spokesman, said the layoffs were expected to have no impact on service. The installation of advanced equipment and changes in many operating procedures in recent years have streamlined the company's management, eliminating the need for hundreds of jobs, he said.
The layoffs were also expected to have little impact on the state economy. Bern Rotman, a spokesman for the state Department of Economic Development, said the total payroll in the state was $400 billion a year, and the loss of $36 million -- particularly spread around the state -- would not be significant.
But for managers losing jobs paying $37,000 to $68,000 a year, many of them long-time company employees, the layoffs will hit hard, coming in an economy still struggling to emerge from a multiyear recession that has eliminated thousands of job opportunities.
 
Two Months' Notice
 The nonunion workers to be laid off will be selected on various criteria, including performance, potential and management skills, Mr. Bonomo said, and will be notified on July 13, two months before the Sept. 10 layoffs. He said all would be eligible for two weeks' pay for each year of service and would be given counseling, retraining and other assistance.
New York Telephone, which has 40,200 workers and 6.5 million customers and as a major employer in the state is second only to the state government itself, laid off 800 management employees in March 1992 and 625 more last December.
Next September's layoffs will bring the three-round total, over 18 months, to slightly more than 2,000, and the company payroll will have been cut by more than $100 million. More layoffs are being borne by other Nynex subsidiaries, including New England Telephone and Nynex Mobile Communications.
The roots of cost-saving personnel cuts for telecommunications companies run deep. In the 1970's, New York Telephone and other phone companies hired bumper crops of young employees to handle an explosion in demand for telephones by Wall Street, the banking business and other sectors of a booming economy.
But two decades later, after a technological revolution in fiber optics and automated switching equipment that cut the need for white- and blue-collar workers, Nynex and its subsidiaries found themselves with thousands of managers in their mid-40's, too young to retire and too expensive to keep in an era of intense competition from smaller, more efficient telecommunications companies.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines by 27.40 On New Economic Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market dropped sharply yesterday, partly in reaction to a downward revision of first-quarter economic growth figures. But computerized sell programs amid surprisingly heavy trading before the long Memorial Day weekend probably exaggerated the declines, analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 44.56 points before closing at 3,527.43, down 27.40 points in a retreat from the record highs established earlier in the week. Still, the Dow managed a gain for the week of 34.60 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped as much as 4.74 points yesterday before it closed down 2.22 points, to 450.19. 
 Investors were chilled by the Commerce Department's announcement in the morning of a downward revision of its first-quarter assessment of the economy. The gross domestic product, what the entire economy produces in goods and services, grew only at a nine-tenths of 1 percent annual rate, rather than the 1.8 percent initially reported a month ago.
 
Exodus From Securities
 But shortly before 1 P.M., the exodus of money from both stocks and bonds into, at least in part, gold reached its crest. Prices for the Dow component stocks firmed and so did yields on the long Treasury bond.
Gold prices then plummeted, but gold stocks, for the most part, did not follow. Contracts for the June delivery of gold on the Commodity Exchange in New York closed down $3.10, to $378.30 an ounce.
Yet Newmont Mining, which has typically tracked gold prices, closed up 1/8, to 52 3/8. Echo Bay Mines, as it has often been recently, was the most-active stock on the American Stock Exchange with 2.6 million shares changing hands. It closed up 1/4, to 12 1/4.
The Dow was dragged down mainly by seven stocks that dropped 1 point or more. The group was led by Aluminum Company of America, which dropped 1 1/2, to 67 1/2. The company's contract negotiations with its unions are expected to extend into the weekend.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped as well, down an especially sharp 4.06 points, to 700.53, and there was an even steeper decline in the Nasdaq 100 index, down 10.24 points, to 735.22. The American Stock Exchange market-value index declined 0.71 point, to 438.22.
Volume on the Big Board was 207.8 million shares, compared with Thursday's 300.8 million shares. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 0.83 point, to 248.60. Losing stocks outnumbered winners by 1,014 to 825.
 
The High-Technology Sector
 The high-technology sector posted especially deep declines. Computer-related stocks had been the hesitant leader in this very tentative market, but analysts are worried that a slow-growth economy will mean slow growth in technology sales as well. Hence the sharp drop in the Nasdaq composite index and the Nasdaq 100.
The 3Com Corporation was especially hard hit. With 13.8 million shares changing hands, it was by far the most-active stock on any exchange.
3Com dropped 11 1/2, to 27, after downgradings by analysts worried about the company's growth rate. 3Com makes computer networking products that would be useful to companies in a thriving economy but less so if the economy continues its lethargic growth.
Novell, also a computer-networking company, was the second most active at 6.7 million shares. Its shares declined 1 7/8, to 27 5/8 today, on no discernible news except for the pummeling of 3Com. It has seen its share price drop since last week as analysts expressed disappointment that Novell's strong earnings growth did not exceed their estimates.
Cisco Systems, the sixth-most-active stock in Nasdaq training and another computer-networking company, closed down 1, to 54.

HEADLINE: Administration Attacks Perot's Ad on Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration tried a preemptive strike against Ross Perot today as three top officials argued that his television commercial planned for Sunday was wrong in contending that the North American Free Trade Agreement would cost American jobs.
At a news conference today, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative; Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that Mr. Perot was using misleading and inaccurate information to attack the agreement. Mr. Kantor said he had discussed the agreement with Mr. Perot and believed the former Presidential candidate was being manipulated by the pact's opponents. 
 "I think their office has been victimized by some who are not exactly neutral on this subject, who have not looked at this in a serious way and are not dealing with the information in what I would call valid terms," Mr. Kantor said.
Mr. Perot has long criticized the free trade pact, which would eliminate import tariffs and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States.
 
Risk of Factory Shutdowns
 According to a partial text released by Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand America, the commercial will emphasize the risk that American companies may move factories to Mexico if the pact is approved.
"The purpose of our program tonight is to alert millions of hard-working Americans that your job is being placed in jeopardy by this agreement," Mr. Perot says in the commercial. "Surely, you don't question the risk because you've already witnessed the collapse of entire communities when factories have been closed."
According to the partial text, Mr. Perot will cite Paterson, N.J., as a community that has experienced hardship because of the loss of a factory to Mexico. Mr. Perot has contended that 5.9 million American workers are employed by industries that may move to Mexico if the trade pact is approved.
At a rally last Sunday in Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Perot raised the possibility of protesting the trade pact by leading a march of his supporters down the Washington Mall to the Capitol. But Sharon L. Holman, the spokeswoman for Mr. Perot, said today that no planning was being done for such an event.
 
 
Poll: More Believe Perot
 In the latest sign of political trouble for the pact, the Cable News Network and Time magazine released a telephone poll this afternoon showing that only 25 percent of the 800 respondents believed the Clinton Administration's contention that the agreement would create jobs, while 63 percent believed Mr. Perot's claims that it would destroy jobs. The poll had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points; it was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday.
"It's very, very clear to us that the American people relate to this and feel very strongly about jobs moving across the border," Ms. Holman said. "I don't think he is being manipulated by anybody."
Mr. Kantor closely duplicated Mr. Perot's folksy style during the news conference today. He used a series of simple black-and-white flip charts roughly the same size as those used by Mr. Perot in his commercials.
"I'm sorry, we don't have colored charts, we can't afford them in this Administration," Mr. Kantor joked.
Citing Commerce Department statistics, Mr. Kantor said today that 700,000 Americans worked last year on producing goods for the Mexican market, up from 275,000 in 1986.
With the pact, Mr. Kantor said, 900,000 Americans would be producing goods for Mexico by 1995. Without the pact, this export-related employment would drop to 500,000 by 1995, he warned.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops to a New Low Despite Fed's Rescue Effort

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar took another pounding yesterday, tumbling to a new low against the Japanese yen after a rescue attempt by the Federal Reserve failed.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.95 yen after recovering from a new low of 106.81 yen, which was reached in overseas markets. On Thursday, it fell to 107.10 yen in New York before edging higher to close at 107.20 yen. 
 The dollar also fell nearly 2 pfennigs against the German mark.
Dealers said the Federal Reserve was buying tens of millions of dollars, relatively little compared with the Bank of Japan's aggressive purchases of hundreds of millions of dollars. Although the Fed was more active than before, traders said they would not be convinced of its resolve to rescue the dollar unless the European central banks also joined in.
"There are absolutely no incentives visible to indicate dollar-buying at all," a European bank dealer in Tokyo said.
 
Interventions Expected
 The Federal Reserve's interventions were widely expected, said John Rothfield, international economist at the First Chicago Corporation, but the market was primed to meet the Fed head-on.
Japan's vice finance minister said Tokyo would take coordinated action with other Group of Seven industrial countries to counter the yen's rise. But the White House played down the idea of a special meeting of the group before its scheduled conference in early July, saying there was not enough time to organize it.
The dollar has been under pressure because of a widespread belief that the United States would prefer a stronger yen to help pare its huge trade deficit with Japan. Adding pressure was a Commerce Department report yesterday revising the first-quarter gross domestic product to show that total output had inched forward at an annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent, half the 1.8 percent rate estimated a month ago.
The German mark gained, helping to push the dollar below strong support at 1.60 marks. The dollar traded at 1.5850 marks at the New York close, down from Thursday's close of 1.6025 marks.
The British pound settled at $1.5630 in New York, up from $1.5587 Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Rises, Then Plunges, As Investors Cash In Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices fell sharply yesterday in a late round of profit taking after climbing early in the session to a 28-month high. Silver futures also retreated.
Gold for June delivery finished $3.10 lower at $378.30 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The volatile session featured prices as low as $375.50 and as high as $384.50, the highest gold price since Jan. 16, 1991. 
 Silver for July delivery fell 7.8 cents, to $4.622 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange.
The rally in precious metals, now in its third month, is encountering resistance as prices reach levels last seen just before the Persian Gulf war, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., in Weehawken, N.J.
"It's understandable that we're going to get profit taking at these levels," he said. "It doesn't necessarily mean the bull move is over."
In fact, demand for gold continued to broaden yesterday, with many new investors entering the market before it turned lower, said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals trading for Credit Suisse in New York.
The dollar's decline against the Japanese yen, which has potentially inflationary implications, continued to support gold prices, the analysts said.
Investors were also emboldened by a lack of action by the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to fight inflation, Mr. Savaiko said.
"Some players in the gold market are calling the Fed's bluff," he said. "They don't think the Fed can afford to tighten and raise interest rates in light of the fragile state of the U.S. economy right now."
On other commodity markets, crude oil futures slipped; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed. Trading volume was light on most markets just before the three-day Memorial Day weekend.
On the Mercantile Exchange in New York, light crude oil for July delivery slipped 4 cents, to $20.02 a barrel; June heating oil rose 0.30 cent, to 54.86 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline fell 0.29 cent, to 57.83 cents a gallon, and July natural gas rose 3.7 cents, to $2.141 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Most cattle futures rose and pork futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Live cattle for June delivery rose 0.07 cent, to 75.32 cents a pound; August feeder cattle rose 0.08 cent, to 85.35 cents a pound; June live hogs fell 0.53 cent, to 51.37 cents a pound, and July frozen pork bellies fell 1.05 cents, to 39.40 cents a pound.

Computer Code Plan Challenged

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The nation's largest computer makers have challenged a Clinton Administration plan to standardize a high-technology coding system that would let law-enforcement officials wiretap telephone calls and computer data transmissions.
The manufacturers say modern computer coding technology is essential for commerce and industry and cannot be restricted by the Government without hurting business. 
 The coding plan, developed secretly by the National Security Agency, was proposed last month by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, a Commerce Department agency. It calls for placing a special computer chip called the Clipper in a system that would encode telephone conversations.
Law-enforcement officials would be able to create a numeric "master key" that provides access to data and telephone transmissions by presenting a warrant to two separate agencies charged with protecting pieces of the key. The idea is that splitting the key would make it harder for Government officials or others to abuse the master key.
 
Plan Called Unworkable
 But the plan has drawn criticism from many computer researchers and civil libertarians who say that it would be unworkable and would have the potential to threaten privacy. On Thursday, 26 computer makers issued a statement criticizing the economic viability of the Clipper plan.
"We're going to work through our concerns with the Government," said Ollie Smoot, the executive vice president of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, a Washington trade organization. "The White House has made a commitment to listen."
The computer makers' statement was prepared for public testimony before the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board, a Government review panel, which will begin three days of hearings on Wednesday on the Clipper plan and other public cryptography issues.
In their statement, the computer makers say that "encryption issues no longer can be treated as the province of only a small circle of national security, law-enforcement and technology experts."
Companies signing the statement included Apple Computer, A.T.& T., Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., NCR, Tandem Computers and Xerox among others.
The association also raised questions about the viability of the coding plan, saying it would effectively handicap American computer and telecommunications equipment makers overseas. The group said that few foreign buyers would be willing to buy a coding device if the National Security Agency or law-enforcement agencies had access to a master key.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET;
Clinton's Poll Rating Sinks To a Historical Low Point

 BODY:
President Clinton's job performance rating is lower at this point in his term than that of any President since World War II, according to two national polls made public yesterday.
Most of the interviewing in the polls, both conducted Wednesday and Thursday, occurred before the House of Representatives narrowly passed Mr. Clinton's economic program on Thursday night. 
 A Time Magazine/CNN poll found 36 percent of Americans approving of the way the President was handling his job, while 50 percent disapproved, and 14 percent expressed no opinion. That poll was taken by Yankelovich Partners with 800 adults nationwide.
A Newsweek poll found identical results. That survey was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates with 750 adults nationwide.
Each telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Mr. Clinton's early-term ratings are the lowest of any President since modern poll taking began, in the second term of Presdent Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Of the Presidents since then, Gerald Ford had the approval rating closest to Mr. Clinton's at an equivalent point in his term, with 42 percent approval in a Gallup Poll taken in December of 1974, three months after he had issued a pardon for former President Richard Nixon.
The other eight Presidents all had considerably higher ratings at this juncture. Just above Mr. Ford was Ronald Reagan, who had 59 percent approval in a Gallup Poll in June 1981. The highest was Harry Truman who had 92 percent approval in an August 1945 Gallup Poll, several months after the end of World War II.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday comparing President Clinton's job aproval rating with that of his predecessors mischaracterized the timing of a Gallup poll taken in August 1945. That poll, in which 92 percent of those surveyed approved of the way Harry S. Truman was handling his job as President, was taken several months after the German surrender and two weeks after the Japanese surrender, not several months after the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: The Everything Solution

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Bendix; Jeffrey Bendix is a writer.

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
The Clintons and their brain trust think the solution to the health care crisis is managed competition. The idea is that health care consumers -- all of us -- will be organized into large purchasing cooperatives. The size of these cooperatives will enable them to bargain down the price of care they buy from hospitals and doctors. That's the theory, anyway.
I don't know if managed competition will work. But even if it doesn't, the idea behind it -- solving a problem by grouping more people into an existing process -- could be applied to lots of other areas of our national life. The National Hockey League is already experimenting with the idea. It has been trying to prop up sagging revenues by allowing almost every team into the playoffs. 
 How might this idea work in solving other problems? Let's start with violent crime. Using a concept we might call "managed security," the Government could easily take care of the problem by buying guns for everyone. (This is a variation of an idea suggested by the syndicated columnist Mike Royko at the height of the skyjacking craze. His solution: Arm all the passengers.)
We might reduce crime further by organizing everyone into "security cooperatives," encompassing blocks or entire neighborhoods. These cooperatives would be large and powerful enough to have round-the-clock patrols, armored vehicles or anything else members wanted to make themselves feel secure.
Just think of how managed security could improve our lives. First, we would all feel safer knowing we could blow away any hoodlum foolish enough to attack us. It would lower unemployment, as weapons makers (and undertakers) geared up to meet demand. Best of all, the National Rifle Association, having attained its nirvana of a gun in every household, would lose the reason for its existence.
Before trying managed security on a national scale, it would be a good idea to try a local experiment. Fortunately, one place already is doing just that. Nearly one million handguns have been sold in Los Angeles County in the past 10 years -- one for every nine residents -- and those are just the legal transactions.
A reporter for The New Republic, describing preparations for anticipated rioting after the second Rodney King verdict, wrote: "I know of at least one affluent neighborhood where residents have hired a full-time guard on each block. And so many neighborhoods have plans for barricading streets that L.A. will become a giant obstacle course if rioting breaks out." Sure, getting to the grocery store might be a little trickier, but at least you'd feel secure.
Another dilemma that Government-sponsored inclusion might address is voter apathy. Politics turns off ordinary people, the media tell us, because they feel their votes don't matter, that they have no chance of being heard over the money of the special interests and political-action committees.
Here, too, the answer is simple: The Government need only subsidize PAC membership for everyone. That way, we will each have someone looking out for our interests in Washington, we will all feel included in the process and voter turnout will swell.
Another advantage to universal PAC membership: With everyone part of a special interest, Congress will be in perpetual gridlock, no new legislation will get passed and we won't have to listen to Rush Limbaugh and other talk-radio ranters complaining about Government intervention in our lives.
To the objection that there aren't enough PAC's for all of us, I would point out that there are 4,100 registered PAC's lobbying Congress. That works out to about 610,000 Americans per PAC, considerably less than the current membership of such lobbying heavyweights as the American Medical Association and Common Cause.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Why Clinton Can't Go on TV and Fix Everything

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
To judge by some of the commentators who buzz around the Presidency like bugs in rainy season, Bill Clinton's parade is a washout because he has lost his television magic. For several weeks the favored figure of speech on all channels for what is lacking in the White House has been "focus," a word associated with a camera. That is appropriate enough, since many observers, especially those in the television trade, judge events by what they see on the tube. They seem disappointed that the politician who used the medium so sharply in attaining the Presidency now presents so fuzzy an image. If only he could be brought into the shop and put back on autofocus, everything would go well again.
But if President Clinton's current tribulations show anything, it is the limits of even so television-wise a politician when faced with conditions that cannot be powdered over in the studio dressing room. To borrow a phrase from Irving Kristol, Mr. Clinton is being mugged by reality. 
 His success as a television performer in the campaign, after all, came at the expense of an incumbent who not only had trouble putting together sentences with the usual parts of speech but also was floundering in a recession. Had George Bush been as proficient a communicator as Ronald Reagan, it still would have availed him nothing, while Ross Perot, who never won a charisma Emmy, rose to television stardom on the wings of the national debt.
Now Mr. Clinton, whose campaign persona left an uncomfortable impression of dissimulation even among the minority of voters who chose him, has more consequential enemies than just the feckless Mr. Bush. To list only the most conspicuous: the lingering unemployment, which, if not dealt with soon, will come to be known as the Clinton recession; the Republicans, led by Senator Bob Dole, who is already campaigning for 1996 on a platform of Democratic failure, and the inimitable Mr. Perot, who seems to have something similar in mind, and Serbian nationalists, who are not running for the White House and show virtually no interest in how they come across on American television. (Never mind such chronic embarrassments as the White House staff, the Arkansas cronies and that expensive Hollywood barber.)
In returning to the Don Imus radio show on WFAN in New York a few weeks ago and in making trips around the country, Mr. Clinton has been trying to evoke some of the triumphs of his campaign. On stops here and there he can still draw cheers with made-for-rally lines like: "We must change our priorities, no matter how difficult it is. That is the challenge of the day, and we must meet it." And, hey, there were pictures of the open-collared President shooting baskets at a playground in South-Central Los Angeles. Bring out the sax.
But the show already seems like a rerun. As a campaigner, Mr. Clinton could come on strong about everything, including the economy and Bosnia. Both subjects invited ringing assertions that something more effective had to be done than the Bush Administration was doing. That is what challengers on the outside are bound to say about everything on the inside. It is not a difficult assignment, and it plays well on the screen.
Only now it turns out that despite the nightly images of slaughter in Bosnia and the muscular campaign rhetoric, the President has little support for action among Americans, not to mention among America's allies. Whether this is a war that can be stopped or won by the United States remains in doubt, but televised threats alone plainly will not do the trick, since the Serbs are not sophisticated enough to be as impressed by the power of television as by the power of artillery. Mr. Clinton stayed away from the subject on his recent trip out West like a Bosnian Muslim avoiding a dangerous neighborhood.
As for the economy, television is not the best medium for explaining anything more abstract than an unemployment line. The economic proposals emerging from the Administration are complicated and keep changing, and the medium that was the simplifier's friend has become the policy maker's nemesis. The pictures of closed plants and laid-off workers that helped sink the Bush Presidency now buffet the Clinton Presidency.
If television were in fact the nuclear weapon of politics, Mr. Clinton's evangelizing around the country, carrying the good news of his deficit-reduction and economic-stimulus package, would have better prospects of success. Folks may be flattered to have the President drop in, but not even the most polished television performance can disguise the fact that he is asking for higher taxes in tough times, with the bill for a health plan yet to come. No town meeting goes by now without a reminder that in another incarnation Mr. Clinton promised not to raise taxes on the middle class. It's not the performer that is the problem; it is the script.
Still, you have to sympathize with Mr. Clinton for leaving town. Adroit though he is at accentuating his accomplishments in White House news conferences, some reporters will insist on bringing up his failures.
One regular informed the President during his last such ordeal that "there's a widespread perception that you're waffling." Another managed to use both "indecisive" and "indecisiveness" in a little question about Bosnia. Another reminded him that the latest poll showed a 10 percent drop in his public-approval rating within two weeks. (When this happens, the incumbent announces that he is not the sort of person to be influenced by polls. When the polls turn favorable, he produces them as evidence of public support.) Mr. Clinton punched back, but the final impression after every news conference is of a man on the perspiring defensive.
Yes, of course television remains a formidable political weapon, and Mr. Clinton must continue to try to find ways to turn it to his advantage. Perhaps his visits to selected markets will help him win a skirmish or two with Senator Dole. But if he cannot get the nation to be more enthusiastic about, or even grasp, his economic plan or his health plan or his lack of a plan for Bosnia or any of the other heavy matters that will continue to weigh on his Administration, don't blame it on television.

Big Advances Against Small Killers

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
PARASITIC diseases kill and debilitate millions of people every year, but for a combination of socioeconomic and scientific reasons, they have long defied conventional medicine. Now researchers at the University of California at San Francisco, with financing from the Defense Department, have taken a novel biotechnology approach to two common parasites. And the results are promising.
The university scientists, who reported their work recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal, have identified compounds that interfere at crucial points in the life cycles of the parasites that cause two tropical diseases: malaria and schistosomiasis. The compounds are not drugs, but they provide useful leads that medicinal chemists may be able to turn into drugs. 
 Malaria, a blood disease that can cause fever and chills, is borne by mosquitoes. Schistosomiasis, a potentially fatal parasitic invasion of the liver, is transmitted by a tiny worm that lives in tropical rivers. The Defense Department has become increasingly interested in such research because it expects to deploy troops in parts of the world where such diseases are prevalent.
The large pharmaceutical companies have not devoted many resources to parasitic diseases, at least in part because they are afflictions of the third world and recouping the research investment would be difficult.
Even when big drug makers have created products for developing countries with philanthropic intent -- such as Ivermectin, Merck & Company's treatment for river blindness disease, which is offered free to indigent populations -- they have been stymied by an inadequate distribution system in the target countries.
Parasites also present a scientific challenge. Unlike bacteria or viruses, parasites undergo a metamorphosis during their life cycles that presents the human immune system with a moving target. Development of effective vaccines is tricky. The malaria parasite, plasmodium, is becoming resistant to the main effective treatment, the drug chloroquine. And while schistosomiasis can still be cured with the drug praziquantel, re-infection is a common problem for those who bathe or wash clothes in infested waters.
The economic and medical challenges called for a new source of financing and a new scientific approach. To pay for the work, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency came through with $7.7 million.
"They've been very generous in funding this work," said Dr. Fred Cohen, an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the university, who directed the study.
"These are diseases they expect to encounter in the third world venues they expect to find themselves in," he said, referring to the military's interest in protecting troops from tropical scourges.
On the scientific level, the work has benefited from the discovery that both parasites employed a protease in their life cycles. A protease (pronounced PROH-tee-ace) is any of a multitude of protein enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the body by dividing other proteins. As such they play a big role in normal body functions, such as blood-clotting and digestion, and in disease states, including AIDS and high blood pressure. Many drugs work by inhibiting a protease.
In the case of malaria, the parasite survives by eating human red blood cells, and uses a protease to break down hemoglobin. The schistosomiasis parasite uses a protease that enables it to penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream; the parasite eventually makes its way to the liver, causing severe damage and even death.
"Pathogens and parasites have to get in somehow, and one of their characteristics is the tendency to use proteases to break in," said David Estell, vice president of research and development at Khepri Pharmaceuticals Inc., a new biotechnology company that specializes in proteases and protease inhibitors. "The traditional approach is to prepare the immune system" with a vaccine, said Mr. Estell, who is familiar with Dr. Cohen's work.
"What Fred and his group are doing," Mr. Estell said, "is to go back one step further and prevent the organism from getting in. Or if it does get in, prevent it from getting further."
Inhibiting the parasite's protease means finding a molecule with a shape that can bind with, and thus block, the active region of the protease. One way would be through so-called rational drug design, which is based on the creation of a three-dimensional model of the molecular structure of a target. But that would mean using sophisticated technology like X-ray crystallography or magnetic-resonance imaging -- expensive techniques that were beyond the resources of Dr. Cohen's lab.

ALTERNATELY, combining thousands of possible inhibitors with the proteases in test tubes would have been too time consuming. Instead, the researchers employed a kind of computer-aided educated guesswork.
Like all proteins, proteases are constructed of the basic building blocks of life known as amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the malaria and schistosomiasis proteases, as it turned out, were similar to the sequences of certain proteases that had structures that were already known. So Dr. Cohen's team took a scientific leap and assumed the structures might be similar as well.
A graduate student in Dr. Cohen's lab, Christine Ring, constructed computer models of the proteases of malaria and schistosomiasis using a proprietary software program created at the university called Dock.
The researchers used the computer to screen a database of commercially available chemical compounds for those which would bind with the various models of the two proteases. "These all had the advantage that if a compound looked promising, all you had to do is buy it," said Dr. Cohen. "We decided to do the screening 'in compuo,' " he said, "because it is very reproducible. Plus, the computer works nights and weekends."
The software builds models that appear on a computer screen like an agglomeration of Ping-Pong balls, with the peaks and valleys of the target molecule represented by overlapping spheres. Possible inhibitors are smaller molecules, which can fit into a gap in the target like a lock in a key, disabling the protease. The quality of fit is judged either by similarity of shape or a mathematical estimation of the interaction.

AFTER screening 4,400 compounds against the two proteases, the scientists wound up with 52 possible inhibitors for the schistosomiasis protease, and 31 for malaria. They then bought the 83 chemicals and tested them in test tube cultures, evaluating their effects on both the proteases and the parasites.
Despite the help of the computer, Ms. Ring had to rely heavily on her own knowledge and intuition in narrowing down the finalist compounds to be screened manually. About 10 percent of them worked.
"Modeling is still an art," she said. "Different people may have chosen to model things differently or to test different chemicals." Indeed, there was some surprise that the approach worked as well as it did.
"Not only do these compounds block the enzyme, but if you try them against the parasite, they block the parasite as well," Dr. Cohen said. "These are lead compounds, not drugs. But they're a clue as to how you get to a drug."
Jeff Blaney, director of computational and biophysical chemistry at the Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company, agreed. "The most novel thing that they did was to build inhibitors based on models based on other known proteases," said Mr. Blaney, who is familiar with the work, though neither he nor Chiron has a stake in it. "It's an exciting result and it's kind of surprising it worked."
The compounds Dr. Cohen and Ms. Ring identified "are not that far removed from what could be a drug," Mr. Blaney said. "They would be reasonable leads for a medicinal chemist to start doing analogs, trying to increase specificity and potency."
The chemicals the group identified as the most potent and most specific inhibitors of the two proteases are small molecules and are shaped in such a way that drugs derived from them might be active in oral form, Dr. Cohen said. Now he needs to find a drug company willing to take his leads and turn them into cures.

Valuing Argentina's Crown Jewel

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
ARGENTINA and its investment bankers First Boston and Merrill Lynch -- begin the "roadshow" on Monday for the privatization of the country's industrial crown jewel -- the oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, known as Y.P.F.
After a presentation on the floor of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the sales group for the giant oil and gas company, which accounts for more than half of Argentina's energy industry, will travel to the United States for the rest of the week. The roadshow will then go to Tokyo, London and several cities in Europe, and return to the United States. 
 The frenzied sales effort is intended to charm investors into putting up as much as $2.5 billion for what will likely be the largest privatization in Latin America -- and the biggest initial public offering of stock in 1993.
Without a doubt, the offering is the high mark of President Carlos Saul Menem's stunning turnaround of this once inflation-ridden, speculation-driven, bureaucracy-burdened, corruption-plagued economy, and a barometer of the nation's willingness to put aside nationalistic, anti-American sentiments and step into the world capital markets.
Embodying all the ills of Argentina, Y.P.F. lost more than $6 billion in the 1980's, when it employed almost 50,000 people. Under a hard-nosed oil executive, Jose Estenssoro, the company has pared employees to about 12,000 and restored profits.
But the syndicate of Wall Street pinstripes will not find it easy to try to sell 35 percent of what will be one of the world's 20 largest energy companies.
"The local market perceives this as going off far too fast, leaving big questions about the value of Y.P.F. and its future that have to be clarified," said an investment banker who insisted on not being named. "You have essentially a political problem -- in the rush to sell Y.P.F., the question is, can the investment bankers get a price that's politically acceptable to the Argentine public without the public thinking they have given away the company?"
The privatization, originally planned for later in the year, has been pushed up several months, apparently at President Menem's insistence.
President Menem and his Peronist party faces tough congressional elections in October and is trying to win enough seats in the new Congress to pass a constitutional amendment that would permit him to stand for re-election, now prohibited by law.
Key to his support are the country's one million retirees, who hold more than $2 billion in bonds, which come due in August and September. Failure by the Government to pay off those debts is considered ruinous for President Menem's political career.
But the rush to raise money by selling Y.P.F., according to investment bankers, means that investors will have less time to warm to the idea of buying its stock. To avoid selling during the summer doldrums in the United States, the completion of the sale is now planned for July 7.
And there are other questions.
One is what is the company's true profitability? After repeated adjustments, Y.P.F. reported earnings of only $256 million in 1992, far below expectations. Investment bankers now must sell the company based on projected 1993 earnings, which are optimistically put at $600 million to $700 million.
The future of Mr. Estenssoro has been uncertain. By law, Federal and provincial governments will be left with considerable ownership in Y.P.F., and bankers fear continued meddling. Mr. Estenssoro has said that unless there is clear managerial autonomy, he and his management team will step down after the shares are sold.
Also, brokers here became worried last week -- after copies of the draft prospectus were distributed -- over the future of one of the company's major natural gas fields in the south.
Under contract, Y.P.F. must pay a French operating company working the gas field 50 percent above the current market price, meaning potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars a year indefinitely. Analysts say the company will eventually have to cede the gas field to the French concern, a move that would drastically reduce its gas reserves.
All this makes the final calculation of the value of the company highly risky.
Estimates vary wildly. Mr. Estenssoro has placed the value at $12 billion. The head of another major Argentine energy company said last week Y.P.F. was worth at least $9 billion. On Friday, Domingo F. Cavallo, the economy minister, said the Government values the company at $6 billion to $7 billion.
Most say that investors will look at Y.P.F. as a pure oil and gas play -- pricing the company at the value of its reserves -- rather than a proxy on the future of the Argentine economy. That would place the price at about $5.5 billion.
And investors remain nervous about overpaying for Argentine privatizations. Last year, they were badly burned when the Government sold its holdings in the state telephone company at prices so inflated that they fell by almost 40 percent within weeks and have yet to recover.
"People remember Telecom and don't want to be burned again," said a broker who asked to remain anonymous. "We think Y.P.F. is going to sell between 8 and 10 times projected earnings. That would mean a value of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. I can't see people paying too much more than that."

THE ECONOMY
 
Round One of the Budget Battle Goes to Clinton
 
After a long wait, Bill Clinton enjoyed a significant victory, albeit by a weak margin, when the House passed, 219 to 213, the President's budget plan. Approval was seen as a prerequisite if Mr. Clinton hopes to have any clout on the rest of his agenda: health care, trade and so on. The plan that passed includes what is by some measures the largest tax increase ever, with the goal of accomplishing what may be the greatest Federal deficit reduction ever. The taxes come in several varieties and are likely to affect all but the very poorest people. In addition, spending on automatic benefit programs will be reduced by almost $100 billion and freezes in discretionary spending are supposed to save about $100 billion more over five years. Mr. Clinton pushed hard for this victory, giving in on some details, but retaining most of what he wanted. Still, the House vote was seen as the easy one, and a number of Senators are determined to amend the plan.
 
The Growth Engine Sputters
 
The United States economy, which was cruising along at a growth rate of 4.7 percent in the last quarter of 1992, misfired in the first quarter of this year even more badly than was previously thought, the Government disclosed. It now appears that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in January through March. That was only half the 1.8 percent rate estimated a month ago. It was the weakest economic growth since the fourth quarter of 1991.
 
A Tumble in Public Confidence
 
In the Conference Board's latest survey, the public's confidence has fallen to its lowest level since before the presidential election. Only 13 percent think jobs will be more plentiful in six months than they are now, for instance; it was the lowest level in a year. But if people are losing hope for the future, they are not so gloomy about current economic conditions. The current-conditions index remained a good deal higher than it was in October. As Norma Pace, president of WEFA's Economic Consulting and Planning in New York, put it, "The index is an accurate reflection of how consumers feel, but it's not a good reflection of how they spend."
 
The Fed Can't Stop The Drop
 
The Federal Reserve intervened to try to stop the decline of the dollar against the yen on Thursday and Friday, but it was not enough to keep the United States currency from establishing record lows. That is because many traders believed Washington is not all that uneasy with the idea of a stronger yen, which could lead to a decrease in the American trade deficit with Japan. By late in the week, however, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Lawrence H. Summers, said, "The market has moved too far, too fast." How far and how fast? It took 125 yen to buy a dollar in January; for a while on Friday, it took fewer than 107.
 
Layoff Notices Not Required
 
A Federal judge has ruled that the General Dynamics Corporation did not have to follow the law requiring that workers be given 60 days' notice before being laid off. The case involved a mass layoff in 1991 after the Navy canceled a warplane program. Other companies must deal with the competitive marketplace, natural disasters and economic cycles and still must warn their workers of possible layoffs. But military contractors have a bigger burden. They do business with the Federal Government.
 
A Short HDTV Honeymoon
 
As it became clear that the three research teams competing to develop high definition television, known as HDTV, in the United States all had worthy technologies, the focus shifted to nontechnological matters, including jobs. So, there was a sense of relief when the rivals agreed last week to join forces, presumably heading off lawsuits by those not chosen. But the euphoria was shortlived. Experts quickly suggested that it might be impossible to reconcile crucial technical issues without alienating television equipment companies or computer companies.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Renault, After the Socialists
 
When the Socialists held the reins in France, they stopped the privatization of Government-owned companies. But now the Socialists are gone, and the new Prime Minister has designated 21 companies for privatization, starting next fall. Added to the list for the first time was Renault, which has done surprisingly well in the crowded European auto market.
 
In Default? The Aga Khan?
 
Among the world's rich and famous, there are few people as rich and as famous as the Aga Khan. But this counts for little these days in Italy. When the Aga Khan's investments in luxury resorts faltered and his main holding company failed to make a loan payment, his creditors moved to seize assets, and the Milan stock exchange suspended trading in his companies.
 
Another Chance for China
 
As a candidate, Bill Clinton lacerated George Bush for not using trade as a lever to improve human rights in China. But as President, Mr. Clinton has not deployed his main weapon: China's "most favored nation" trade status. He will give Beijing another year to make progress on rights.
 
COMPANIES
 
Time on Their Side
 
Since Time took Warner as a partner, there have been periodic reports that the company was looking for well-heeled investors. Now they are starting to appear. Earlier this month, U S West said it would take a 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment. Then Seagram unexpectedly disclosed that it had acquired 5.7 percent of Time Warner's stock and wanted to accumulate 15 percent. Time Warner professed to be delighted, although it was not immediately clear what it might gain from a closer relationship with a Canadian liquor and fruit juice company.
 
Crossing Paths Again
 
Before Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts took RJR Nabisco private for $25 billion, one of its biggest deals was a $6 billion buyout of Beatrice. But it was not a particularly happy deal for Kohlberg, which finally sold the company to Conagra, headed by Charles M. Harper. But Kohlberg, Kravis must have been impressed by Mr. Harper's performance because it has now turned to him to become chief executive of RJR Nabisco.
 
Looking Under The Rock
 
At Prudential Securities, insiders say, some high-commission brokers in the booming Dallas branch ran amok from the mid-80's until last summer. Among other things, they are said to have purchased securities without authorization and forged clients' signatures. Now the S.E.C. is reported to be investigating whether the firm has violated a 1986 settlement involving earlier complaints that its supervisors had failed to do their jobs.
 
Rendezvous in Hog Heaven
 
Harley-Davidson, which has roared past its competitors by improving the quality of its motorcycles and promoting the joy of the open road, is about to celebrate its 90th anniversary with festivities in Milwaukee on June 12. To get the expected 60,000 bikers to the blast on time, the company has mapped out 10 paths to Milwaukee and the company is assigning high-ranking executives to serve as ride hosts for the various routes. Its chief executive, Richard Teerlink, for instance, is leading the caravan from San Francisco.
 
A Dip at Dell...
 
In the folklore of the computer industry, the story of the rise of Dell Computer is one of the standards. Hatched in a University of Texas dormitory room by 19-year-old Michael Dell, the company has grown in less than a decade to be the fourth-largest personal computer maker. But now Dell has had its wings clipped. The company reported first-quarter profits that were half of the previous year's even though revenues were sharply higher. The big problem was that the company had failed to keep up in the fast-growing notebook-computer market. For the week Dell's stock plunged $9 a share, or more than 27 percent.
 
...And an AST Acquisition
 
Dell may soon be unseated as No. 4 in the PC business by AST Research, based in Irvine, Calif. AST has agreed to buy the money-losing TE Electronics, the computer-manufacturing subsidiary of the Tandy Corporation. Tandy had previously announced that it would spin off TE at the beginning of July as a separately traded company. For AST, the purchase is a chance to acquire manufacturing capacity. Tandy wants to concentrate on its Radio Shack stores and other retail operations. But the sale also removes a pioneer of the PC industry. There was a time a decade or more ago when Tandy -- along with Commodore and Atari -- was one of the leaders in the industry.
 
Soap Opera Update
 
Last week on "As the Executive World Turns": After being sued by his former boss Jack (John F. Smith Jr.), Inaki (Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua) breaks his silence and swears he did not take confidential documents when he left General Motors. One reason he left, he said, was that others were thwarting his dream of building a car plant in the Basque region of Spain. Meanwhile, a Ger- man magazine calls him "The Unscrupulous One" on its cover. Still, his new boss, Ferdinand (Piech, Volkswagen's chairman), stands by his ace cost-cutter. He does disclose, though, that Inaki approached VW about leaving Detroit, and not the other way around.

HEADLINE: The King of Cable Reaches for More

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, Colo.

 BODY:
JOHN C. MALONE'S personal life has all the markings of a more genteel, slower time. Most days, he drives home from the office for lunch. And each year about this time, he leaves the Denver area to spend the summer at his retreat in Maine or on his sailboat. He usually makes the long trip to Maine by car because his wife, Leslie, does not like to fly.
But in his business life, as head of Tele-Communications Inc., Dr. Malone is anything but genteel. "This is not touch football, this is tackle," he said in a recent interview in his office here. And he is almost always the fastest player on the field. 
 Dr. Malone (he holds a Ph.D. in industrial engineering from Johns Hopkins) has already built T.C.I. into the nation's biggest operator of cable systems. Two years ago, he spun off most of T.C.I.'s cable programming services into another powerhouse that he heads, the Liberty Media Corporation. Somewhere along the line, he became known to the industry -- if not the public -- as the brilliant and sometimes brutal king of cable TV who has the clout to call many of the industry's shots.
"He is the gatekeeper," said a rival executive, who would comment only if promised anonymity. "He is allowed to decide what people see and don't see."
But that was just for openers. Television is on the brink of a technological revolution that promises to change what Americans watch and how they watch it -- and the 52-year-old Dr. Malone is positioning himself to be at all the right spots to lay claim to a new reign as the once and future king of all of TV.
 
Going Interactive
 Thanks to fiber optics and digital transmission, the television viewer is being pulled into the world of computers and high-speed two-way communications. Hundreds of channels are on the horizon, along with a trove of "interactive services." Viewers will be able to call up movies on demand, for example, or stroll through video libraries. Home shoppers will flip through electronic catalogues, pressing buttons for a taped demonstration of fly-casting equipment, say, or to see a model wearing lingerie. And video-game players will spar on screen with opponents across the street or on the other side of the country.
With so much up for grabs, the battle to get control of the new wires and programming heading for American homes is roiling the communications industry. Alliances among cable operators, telephone companies, broadcast networks and video-game makers are being announced willy-nilly as jittery companies fear missing out on one new gold mine or another. [Page 10.]
Judging by the number and breadth of the deals Dr. Malone has been striking in recent months, it seems clear that he does not want to miss out on anything.
On the one hand, he is spending billions of dollars to upgrade his cable systems to deliver TV's exotic new products in this country and to expand that delivery to viewers around the world. On the other hand, he is buying and developing programming of all kinds, anticipating the insatiable appetite of all those new channels.
There is an economic calculus at work as well. Washington is regulating cable with new vigor, making its basic services more like a utility with less upside potential. In repositioning himself technologically, Dr. Malone is also moving aggressively into cable's high-end premium services, which face less regulation.
But there is no guarantee that consumers will pay for all the new goodies. If they don't, T.C.I.'s cash flow could be severely affected. And as Dr. Malone's empire continues to grow, he risks regulatory reaction. For the moment, Federal rules do not address the question of the breadth of his control over the industry, but some competitors are hoping desperately that Washington will eventually curb his power.
In any event, a sampling of deals and spending plans shows how fast Dr. Malone has been going:
* Last December, T.C.I. said it would introduce data-compression technology -- a way to squeeze vast amounts of information through existing cables. The technology could be employed as early as next year, ultimately allowing viewers to receive 500 channels, 10 times more than the current limit.
* In April, the company said it would spend $2 billion to lay fiber optic cable in more than 400 communities across the country by 1996. Such cable, which has virtually unlimited capacity, is the vehicle for an "information superhighway."
* In recent months, Liberty Media has been consolidating its hold on the home-shopping industry. It has taken voting control of the Home Shopping Network and is part of a group that now controls rival QVC, in which it previously held a stake.
* As part of the QVC deal, Dr. Malone joined forces with Barry Diller, the highly respected former head of Fox Inc. Mr. Diller, who now runs QVC, is not expected to be content selling cubic zirconia rings or baseballs autographed by Pete Rose. His ambitious plans go beyond electronic shopping catalogues to encompass travel services (choosing a hotel by "walking" around the premises on screen) and other upscale products. But they also extend to interactive news programs (with viewers requesting particular stories) and entertainment shows. There is talk of merging QVC with the Home Shopping Network -- and even of launching a fifth broadcasting network with Mr. Diller at the helm.
* Eager to have access to a film library, T.C.I. invested $100 million in April in troubled Carolco Pictures in exchange for the right to run its films on pay-per-view TV at the same time they open in movie theaters.
* Weeks later, T.C.I. joined with Sega of America and Time Warner to develop a channel that will bring video games into the home via cable.
* And just last week, one of Liberty's pay TV services, Encore, announced six new theme-oriented channels for older films and still another channel for new movies.
 
Jockeying for Position
 Dr. Malone is hardly alone in trying to prepare for the future. Last month, Time Warner, the country's second-biggest cable operator, announced a joint venture with U S West to develop sophisticated cable systems.
The alliance represents the biggest deal so far that tries to marry a cable company's programming expertise with a phone company's strengths in two-way communication. "U S West and Time Warner temporarily moved ahead on the board in terms of strategic position," said Paul Kagan, a telecommunications consultant.
It could be a tenuous lead, however. For one thing, rumors have been circulating about a grand alliance between the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and T.C.I. Neither side will comment.
For another, T.C.I. has critical mass: it has 10.4 million cable subscribers, or roughly 18 percent of the domestic market. Last year, T.C.I. generated an extremely strong cash flow of $1.6 billion.
What's more, T.C.I. has Dr. Malone, who is more than willing to use his company's size -- and his own elbows -- to get what he wants. A decision by him to carry a programming service on his cable systems is almost a guarantee of success -- and a decision to ignore or drop one is a virtual death warrant, which helps explain why he is feared by so many in the industry.
"We play within the rules, but we play hard," he said in the recent interview. But he is sometimes accused of playing outside the rules as well. There has been a string of disputes and court battles with the cities and towns served by his cable systems over complaints about poor service and rising rates.
And there have been tangles with competitors. Last year, for example, T.C.I. was accused of antitrust violations by Data Broadcasting over the 1991 sale of the Learning Channel to the Discovery Channel, which Dr. Malone controls with partners. The suit, which was dismissed in November, accused T.C.I. of depressing the sales price by threatening to take the channel off its systems.
In the interview, Dr. Malone seemed to relish his reputation as a tough guy. Alluding to various rivalries with the broadcast networks and their cable operations, he said: "When T.C.I. tells General Electric that it won't pay two cents a month more to carry CNBC, that is T.C.I. playing hardball. I mean, give me a break. We are supposed to have a lot of sympathy for NBC, for Capital Cities, for Larry Tisch?"
To succeed, he said, an entrepreneur has to be tough. "Big corporations put together teams to work on things and the teams are worried about getting out of the office by 5 P.M. They don't invent much. I.B.M. likes to look back and see itself as a bunch of sweet, nice guys. When they were building I.B.M., they were sons of bitches. As a result they got huge market share, got very rich -- and then forgot how they got there."
John Malone got there by taking a chance on T.C.I. in 1972.
Graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Yale, he began his career with Bell Labs. After a stint as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, he joined the General Instrument Corporation, quickly becoming president of its Jerrold cable equipment division. As a supplier to cable systems operators, he caught the eye of Steven J. Ross, head of Warner Communications, who offered him the top job at his fledgling cable operation.
Wanting to move his family out of New York and looking for something more entrepreneurial, he turned Mr. Ross down. Instead, he signed on with Bob J. Magness, the man who began building T.C.I. in the 1950's. Dr. Malone has since made hundreds of deals to cobble T.C.I. together, recognizing early that being the largest operator gave him enormous leverage in getting programming.
But owning even big systems was not enough to dominate the industry. For that, Dr. Malone needed to own the programming directly, setting off a new buying spree. Now, as the industry enters its new phase, he is wearing his dealmaker hat again.
"T.C.I. wants the dominant market share of interactive subscribers," said Frank Biondi, president of Viacom International, another major cable operator and the parent company of MTV and Showtime. "That will give them tremendous say over what interactive programming gets on."
Eventually, Dr. Malone hopes to offer his programming on cable systems around the world. He recently announced a joint venture to provide cable services in Latin America, following similar deals in Europe.
"Cable programmers will be like Hollywood studios," Dr. Malone said. If they want to deliver high-quality programming, "they will need world-wide distribution to make the economics work."
As he extends his reach, he is not likely to become any less combative, however, judging by the particularly Darwinian note he sounded in a recent speech about the industry's prospects. "It is every man for himself," he said.
