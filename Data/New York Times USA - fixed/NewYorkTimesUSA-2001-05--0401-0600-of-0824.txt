HEADLINE: Italian Conservative Assures Europe He's in the Mainstream 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, May 15 

 BODY:
Assuring Europe and the United States that he was proud to be their partner, the conservative media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi today began the business of becoming Italy's next prime minister by seeking to allay foreign fears.
 In the election on Sunday, Mr. Berlusconi did more than simply defeat the center-left that has ruled Italy for the past five years. He also won a second chance to launch a "revolution" that he says Italy needs to compete. 
 Unlike in 1994, when his coalition government collapsed after seven months after the leader of the Northern League, Umberto Bossi, withdrew, now Mr. Berlusconi could have enough support in Parliament to govern without Mr. Bossi. That could bring stability to a country that has had 58 governments since the end of World War II. 
In a solemn address broadcast on state television, Mr. Berlusconi reached out to all Italians. But he also sought to legitimize his victory abroad. 
European leaders and editorial writers have expressed alarm about the conflicts of interest presented by Mr. Berlusconi's three private television networks and his vast financial empire. They have particularly criticized his alliance with Mr. Bossi, who is often likened to Austria's leading nationalist, Jorg Haider.
President Bush sent a warm congratulatory telegram today but Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, was more guarded. And the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, warned Mr. Berlusconi that Europe "would pay close attention to what the government is, and to what it is doing." Mr. Haider was one of the first to react, offering congratulations and his support.
Actually, however, Europe may have reason to relax, at least about Mr. Bossi. The leader of the Northern League will be "irrelevant," in the new government, according to Roberto D'Alimonte, a political scientist at the University of Florence. 
"Berlusconi has enough seats in both houses to form a majority without the Northern League," Mr. D'Alimonte said. But he added: "Berlusconi has no alibis. There is nobody he can blame if he fails to deliver on what he thinks he can do." 
Mr. Berlusconi said he was ready. 
"You asked for a government that works and makes the state work like an efficient machine at the service of its citizens," he told viewers, outlining a few of his ambitious proposals for the first 100 days. "We feel the full responsibility of this freely made choice. I assure you, you won't be disappointed." 
Mr. Berlusconi defeated his liberal rival, Francesco Rutelli, 46, the pragmatic former mayor of Rome, mostly because he convinced many Italians that he really could cut taxes, increase minimum pensions, trim the bloated government and undertake vast public works projects -- all without increasing Italy's huge debt and putting the country on a collision course with the European Union. 
Many economists are skeptical. His political rivals are scornful.
In a concession speech today, Mr. Rutelli promised "intransigent" opposition against "a right wing we do not trust, and who we know will not be able to maintain its campaign promises." 
The vote tally was delayed because a reduced number of voting stations forced many polls to stay open until almost dawn today to accommodate floods of irate voters. 
But when the counting was over, Mr. Berlusconi's center-right coalition had won a clear majority in both houses of Parliament. His party, Forza Italia -- in essence an advertising vehicle for his candidacy that he set up in 1994 with his own vast fortune -- won 29.4 percent of the votes cast in districts where seats were allotted proportionally, far more than any other party. 
Mr. Berlusconi had expected to win handily in the north, but he surpassed expectations by also sweeping Sicily and large parts of the south.
It looked tonight as if Mr. Bossi's party failed to reach the neccesary 4 percent of votes cast to qualify for parliamentary seats awarded proportionally, which in Italy's hybrid system account for 25 percent of the total. He will undoubtedly acquire other seats in Parliament, at least 16 in the Senate. But 4 percent is less than half of what the Northern League got in 1996. 
Mr. Bossi complained on Sunday that the Northern League had paid "a monstrous price" by supporting Mr. Berlusconi. He closeted himself in his office today, refusing all interviews. 
Mr. Berlusconi won Mr. Bossi's electoral support by working out a joint program that includes more autonomy for regions. (Mr. Bossi started his career demanding that the wealthy north secede from the needy south.) Throughout the campaign, Mr. Berlusconi said he would invite Northern League politicians to join his cabinet, as some did in 1994. A spokesman said tonight that it was "premature" to say whether he really would.
The losing side reacted with much rancor and hand wringing about Mr. Berlusconi's success and its own failure to unite. 
The Marxist Refounded Communists refused to join forces with Mr. Rutelli's coalition but won 5 percent of the vote, which Mr. Rutelli's supporters called wasted votes that could have helped Mr. Rutelli's center-left coalition. 
Several cabinet ministers lost their Senate races, including Enzo Bianco, the interior minister, who was widely blamed for the election-night confusion. In a cost-cutting measure, the government had reduced the number of polling stations by a third, contributing to long lines of angry voters. 
Cardinal Camillo Ruini, head of the Italian bishops conference, called the delays "very disagreeable." Mr. Bianco humbly asked forgiveness from the Italian people.
Mr. Bianco, like others, could nevertheless get into the Senate through his party, which receives a certain percentage of seats awarded proportionally.
Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who was prime minister twice during the center-left's up-and-down reign, was one of the few prominent politicians to take the risk of running in a winner-take-all race, in Gallipoli, in the south. He won, despite a cameo campaign appearance there by Mr. Berlusconi, whose helicopter arrival was described by D'Alema supporters as "Apocalypse Now." 
But the center-left coalition was weakened by other, more centrist candidates who ran as independents, tempted by Italy's hybrid election system, which awards 75 percent of seats on a winner-take-all basis, and 25 percent proportionally. That system is intended to give even small parties a way into Parliament, where they often use their leverage to bring down coalition governments. 
The center-left's failure to reform election laws to encourage a two-bloc system hurt Mr. Rutelli's chances. And its failure to pass a stringent conflict-of-interest law frees Mr. Berlusconi to introduce his own. He has yet to indicate that he sees his three private networks and financial empire, which spans insurance, banking, real estate and publishing, as a real cause for concern.
Mr. Berlusconi did not mention a law to resolve conflict-of-interest problems today, when he listed the goals for his first days in office. 
"I don't know if it will be the first, the second or the third thing on the agenda," said Gianfranco Fini, head of the right-wing National Alliance Party, a part of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition. "But we will draft a law on conflict of interest."

HEADLINE: Medicare Panel Head Is Replaced as Holdings Are Questioned 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
Gail R. Wilensky, one of the Republican Party's top health care experts, is losing her job as chairwoman of an influential commission that advises Congress on Medicare, in part because of concerns about her substantial investments in health care companies.
 Dr. Wilensky was an adviser to George W. Bush in the presidential campaign and worked for Mr. Bush's father as head of the federal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid. She has been chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and one of its predecessor panels since 1995. 
 Medicare provides health care to 40 million people who are elderly or disabled, at a cost of more than $215 billion a year. The program is technically complex and politically explosive. Congress often follows the commission's advice when deciding how much to pay doctors, hospitals and other care providers. It has also sought the commission's advice on adding drug benefits to Medicare.
The 17 commission members are appointed by the comptroller general of the United States, now David M. Walker, who is head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.
Mr. Walker said today that his decision to replace Dr. Wilensky, whose term expired last month, had been prompted by two factors. He wanted to see some turnover in the leadership of the commission and he was somewhat concerned that Dr. Wilensky might be perceived as having potential conflicts of interest. In recent years she has served on the boards of eight health care companies, in which she held stock and stock options worth more than $4 million. The companies include the UnitedHealth Group, a large managed care company.
Mr. Walker named Glenn M. Hackbarth, a health care consultant in Bend, Ore., to replace Dr. Wilensky as head of the Medicare advisory commission. Mr. Walker named Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, to be vice chairman of the panel.
Dr. Wilensky, an economist, tried to hold on to her job, and she had bipartisan support. But she had irritated one important House member, Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
"My independence was troublesome" to some lawmakers, Dr. Wilensky said. "I say what I think."
Members of the Medicare commission include hospital and insurance executives, doctors, employers, an officer of AARP and an employee of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Congress assumed that some commissioners would have financial interests in the health care industry, and such interests must be disclosed. But in an interview today, Mr. Walker said that the chairman of the commission should be held to a higher standard because the chairman "has additional power and responsibilities," including the authority to call meetings and set the agenda.
"As a certified public accountant," Mr. Walker said, "I know that independence is important, and appearances do count."
Dr. Wilensky said that her work on the commission had not been influenced by her financial holdings, and that Congress had chosen to deal with such issues by requiring public disclosure.
Mr. Walker is planning to appoint three new commission members. They are Sheila P. Burke, under secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who was chief of staff to Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader; Allen D. Feezor, health benefits administrator for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, and Ralph W. Muller, president of the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System.
The commission annoyed some lawmakers last year when it recommended a substantial increase in Medicare payments to hospitals.

HEADLINE: Bush Actions, And Inaction, Set Scientists Grumbling 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Dr. Marye Anne Fox was a science adviser to George W. Bush when he was governor of Texas. So in March, when she was called to Washington for an interview, the rumor mill had her all but installed as the new White House science adviser.
 But Dr. Fox, a chemist, was uninterested, federal officials said. "There were too many restrictions," one recalled. "They were saying, 'Hey, be in the president's office, but don't do anything." 
 For specialists worried about the fate of science in the Bush administration, the continuing lack of a presidential science adviser symbolizes what they see as a troubling lack of interest in science and research. 
The administration's proposed spending on science for next year has far more decreases than increases, key leadership positions are unfilled and grumbling has reached new heights. Even Republican leaders are criticizing some of the budget cuts as dangerous for the nation's well-being.
In President Bush's budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, research spending, after inflation, is down at Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, Energy, Education, the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Projection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The main winners are health and defense.
Critics say some cuts make no sense, given the administration's own priorities and the problems it is confronting. Take the 11 percent reduction for the federal geologists who aid the hunt for fossil fuels.
"The year of a power-production crisis seems an odd time for a cutback," said Donald Kennedy, the editor of the journal Science. The administration also proposes to cut research spending for alternative energy sources and energy conservation.
To be sure, scientists regularly grumble that the government is not spending enough on research, and many of the administration's sharpest critics would stand to benefit from increased support for research. Also, previous administrations have occasionally left major science posts unfilled in their early months.
But perhaps because science research budgets enjoyed robust expansion in the Clinton years, scientific leaders are now expressing an unusual sense of dismay. They have also criticized the administration's early actions on climate, the environment, antimissile defense and toxic chemicals, saying good science advice could have averted missteps.
For their part, administration officials defend their actions, appointments and budgets as sound. The scientists who complain, they say, are often just angling for money or disagreeing about policy.
"Science is something the administration cares about," Richard Russell, staff director of the White House science office, said in an interview. The overall budget is up 6 percent, he said. "That's significant," he said.
But critics of the administration's research budget, including influential Republicans in Congress, disagree, saying the 6 percent figure ignores inflation and promotes health and defense research at the expense of hundreds of other efforts.
Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican of New York, who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said recently that the administration's overall science budgets were too low and that some proposed cuts left him "very disturbed." He singled out those planned for the Energy Department (4.5 percent) and the National Science Foundation (1.6 percent), which is the main conduit of government support for civilian basic research in the physical sciences.
And Dr. Fox, who became chancellor of North Carolina State University in 1998 after working at the University of Texas for two decades, added her own voice to the warnings soon after her White House visit. "Without a major investment," she wrote in The News and Observer of Raleigh, "we should expect innovation, and with it our competitive edge, to shift overseas."
Defenders of the administration say the budget situation has altered in recent years because corporate America is putting so much money into research and development. This year, the private sector is expected to spend $180 billion -- about twice what Washington does.
The Bush White House hails the shift, as do some of its vigorous supporters. Dr. Edward E. David, President Richard M. Nixon's science adviser and a former head of Exxon research, said the change meant that the president's science office should become a "window on the private sector," not, as it has been, a guiding force behind federal research.
But many other experts disagree. They say corporations focus largely on near-term goals -- projects that can be expected to turn into moneymakers in relatively short order -- rather than the long-range, blue sky research that has produced some of the most important breakthroughs in physics, medicine, energy and understanding the universe.
Also, they note, corporations cannot necessarily be relied upon to maintain research budgets in economic downturns.
Dr. D. Allan Bromley, a Yale physicist, who was White House science adviser for President Bush's father, has all but ignored the industry argument in leading calls for raising the federal research budget.
"No science, no surplus," he wrote in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times on March 9. "It's that simple."
Dr. Bromley and Dr. David have clashed on the topic. "I didn't think that was logical or rational," Dr. David said in an interview.
Despite their differences, the two men recently joined to lobby the White House when rumors spread that its science office was to be killed or left empty. Dr. Bromley said he had written to both President Bush and his father.
"We succeeded, I believe," he told a symposium this month at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in observation of the 25th anniversary of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In an interview, he said White House staff members had assured him the office would be maintained. 
Still, as of yet, there is no presidential science adviser, no commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, no head of the National Institutes of Health and no heads of science at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Departments of Energy and Agriculture.
Mr. Russell, the science office staff director, said the staffing situation was fairly normal for this stage of a new administration and that the president had moved rapidly on an important post, when in late March he named E. Floyd Kvamme, a businessman with industry experience at Apple Computer and National Semiconductor, to be co-chairman of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. This group aids the science adviser in evaluating issues for the president.
"This is one of the premier spots," Mr. Russell said, adding that the committee of private experts was "the single best conduit to the president from the nonacademic sector."
But Dr. Charles M. Vest, the president of M.I.T., told the symposium recently that the administration's budget was "dangerously lopsided" toward health and urged more emphasis on nonmedical basic science, engineering research and advanced education.
"When the most interesting ideas are emerging at the surprising overlaps and intersections between previously unrelated fields," Dr. Vest said, "that unbalanced investment represents a serious strategic error."
John E. Porter, who represented Illinois in the House for 21 years and helped win financing increases for biomedical research, told the group that the lack of a presidential science adviser at this point meant that the Bush administration had inadequate planning advice for two budgets, 2002 and 2003.
Mr. Boehlert, the House Science Committee chairman, said the picture, though bleak, was bound to get better because support for science remained strong in the administration and Congress. Friends of science will improve the proposed budget before it is finally adopted, he said.
"These numbers are going to be better -- most likely, a little better this year, and a lot better next year," he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science recently.
He said the current figures did not reflect administration hostility toward science but rather a sense of drift, because science played no major role in Mr. Bush's presidential campaign.
He urged scientists to speak out in order to encourage a renewed commitment and to reverse the downward spiral. Complacency, he added, is "a recipe for failure."

HEADLINE: Hearing Bush Energy Plan, Union Leaders Offer Praise 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Union leaders praised parts of President Bush's energy plan yesterday after attending a White House meeting where Vice President Dick Cheney and other administration officials outlined the plan and predicted that it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.
 Leaders of the Teamsters, the Steelworkers and various building trades unions said they were pleased to hear that the plan called for building 1,300 to 1,900 power plants and more than 18,000 miles of fuel pipeline in the next 20 years. 
 In a major overture to labor, the Bush administration invited more than 30 union officials to the meeting in the hope that organized labor, long one of Mr. Bush's fiercest foes, would support his plan, the details of which are to be announced on Thursday. The union leaders were delighted by forecasts that each new power plant would create 1,000 construction jobs and 200 permanent jobs and that every 1,000 miles of pipeline built would create 5,000 jobs. 
"It's a plan that the majority of unions who were there support," said Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "It's about job creation."
Several union leaders explicitly withheld support from the overall plan, saying they first wanted to see all of the details. 
"We think in certain areas we're going to be able to work together," said Edward C. Sullivan, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Building and Construction Trades Department. Among the unions that sent top officials to the meeting were the Plumbers, Laborers, Carpenters, Operating Engineers, Steam Fitters, Seafarers and Marine Engineers.
The building trades department, the Teamsters and several maritime unions have endorsed the administration's plans to allow oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to the chagrin of environmentalists. Union officials say they expect exploration in the refuge to create thousands of jobs.
Environmental leaders and even some union leaders have voiced concern that the administration was seeking to divide two core Democratic constituencies, environmentalists and labor, by trying to gain union backing for the plan. Environmentalists have denounced the plan, saying it will ruin the Arctic refuge.
Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said today that he wanted the Senate Energy Committee to begin hearings next week on the energy plan and that he hoped to have an energy bill on the Senate floor by mid-June.
After the hourlong meeting today, several union leaders echoed Mr. Cheney's remarks about the importance of building power plants and doing more drilling to increase output and reduce energy prices.
"One of the things that the vice president said is we need supply, if we have more supply the price will go down," said Douglas McCarron, the president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. "That's very important."
James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters praised the administration's plans to build more nuclear reactors, refine more oil and use more coal, but he warned that unions could sour on the plan if it unduly favors industry.
"We want to make sure we get lower prices, not higher prices," Mr. Hoffa said. "The point that I stressed in there, the bottom line here, is this is not about enriching the oil companies. This is about affordable gas prices for working Americans."
At the meeting, union leaders repeatedly stressed that they wanted the jobs created by the plan to go to unionized American workers. Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers of America, said the steel used to construct pipelines should not be imported.
Labor Secretary Elaine Chao sought to build cooperation by telling the labor leaders that there were some issues they could work on together, while there would be others they disagreed on.
Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said after the meeting that she expected that environmentalists and labor would continue working together and would find some common ground on the energy plan.
"I have confidence that as labor unions look more deeply at the economics of the plan they may think twice about some of the solutions the White House is proposing," she said. 
In introducing Vice President Cheney at the meeting, Karl Rove, a senior adviser to the president, noted that he was the first vice president to have ever been a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. After Mr. Cheney left Yale without graduating, he worked briefly as a utility company lineman in Wyoming.

HEADLINE: Bank One Names a Chief for First USA 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 14 

 BODY:
The Bank One Corporation named a former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp as the president and chief operating officer of First USA Inc., its credit card subsidiary.
 The executive, Daniel J. Frate, 40, succeeds Anthony Vuoto, who resigned in March after a year in the position. 
The company said Mr. Frate, who started yesterday, reports to First USA's chief executive, Philip Heasley, who took over the Bank One credit card business in mid-January. 
 Mr. Heasley, who was president and chief operating officer at U.S. Bancorp until August, was hired by Bank One's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to rebuild the credit card business, which has lost millions of customers since 1999.
First USA has hurt Bank One's profit since 1999, when it lost customers after giving them less time to pay their bills and then imposing late fees and raising interest rates for those who missed the deadline.

HEADLINE: Signs in China and Taiwan Of Making Money, Not War 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: KUNSHAN, China, May 11 

 BODY:
Despite the visions of war conjured by President Bush's suggestion that the United States could help defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, the social and economic integration between the mainland and the island is stronger than ever, and growing.
 Tension across the 100-mile strait separating the two sides of a decades-old civil war has recently ebbed considerably. Some experts say that if the trend continues, Taiwan's government will soon be unable to afford antagonizing China, and that the cost to China of attacking Taiwan may become prohibitive. 
 Nowhere is that on starker display than in Kunshan, a town that Taiwan built. About 10 percent of Taiwan's $50 billion investment in the mainland has landed here, just off the 60-mile highway from Shanghai to Suzhou. 
And almost all of the town's tax revenue comes from 900 Taiwan companies that have transformed the once ramshackle farming community into one of China's brightest new cities.
During the spring and autumn wedding seasons, a few women a month here marry men from Taiwan. The women wear dresses from brightly-lit bridal shops with names like Ruby, Venus and Taiwan Flavor. They move into one of the town's upscale Taiwanese compounds, like Beautiful Crystal Plaza or Treasure Island Garden, a reference to Taiwan. And they bear children who are half of the mainland and half of Taiwan.
"What we may be seeing in cross-strait relations is a kind of Hong Kong-ization of Taiwan-mainland relations," said Orville Schell, a longtime China watcher now at the University of California at Berkeley. 
He noted that the economic promise of friendly ties with Beijing had earlier eroded the anti-Communism of Hong Kong's business elite and smoothed the territory's 1997 return to mainland rule.
"Simply put, the tension of politics may be cut by the imperatives of business and trade," Mr. Schell said.
Kunshan's silver 20-story city hall rises across from a massive science and culture exhibition center, still under a wrap of sheeted scaffolding.
Near the center of town, freshly painted pastel apartment blocks line streets so clean and orderly that they look more like Tokyo than China, where urban centers are more often a mess. 
Businessmen from Taiwan patronize restaurants like Taipei Small Town or Champs Elysee, which serves whipped iced tea -- a fad imported from Taipei -- and Taiwanese marinated pork with rice, served in a Japanese-style lacquered box as it is in Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony from 1895 until the end of World War II.
"Even in 1995, the streets were run down," said Lu Caiping, a middle-aged woman standing amid clouds of tulle and organza in a wedding shop along Advance Street. "Now the sidewalks are paved with granite."
Taiwan's economic presence on the mainland has risen steadily for the last decade, even though the island and China have never formally ended the civil war that left the Communist Party in control of the mainland after 1949 and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces in control of Taiwan. 
Chiang and his archfoe Mao Zedong both died in the 1970's, and Taiwan, under pressure from business people eager to take part in China's economic opening to the world, began allowing indirect travel, trade and investment in the mainland in 1987. Taiwan has since become one of China's top investors.
Investment accelerated markedly after a devastating earthquake on Taiwan in 1999. The quake temporarily shut down much of the computer-related industry on the island, which is prone to quakes, prompting many technology companies to shift production to China. Taiwan investors are also drawn to the vast mainland market. Half of Taiwan's high-tech products are now made on the mainland.
Belligerency and political mistrust may still, of course, vanquish economic imperatives.
China's weapons purchases and recent sharp increase in military spending are directed almost exclusively at Taiwan. China has not slowed the frequency of its military exercises or new missile deployments facing the island, which in turn has not slowed its own program to acquire weapons. 
The same economic growth that is drawing Taiwan to the mainland is financing Beijing's military expansion, aimed at giving China a coercive edge over Taiwan.
Talks between the two governments show no sign of resuming after breaking down two years ago. China's leaders, trapped by their Marxist-Leninist past, have yet to define a more democratic future in which Taiwan might want to take part.
Growing economic ties to Taiwan's business community could even work against political reforms as that community becomes increasingly reliant on a stable government in China to protect its investments and interests, Mr. Schell said.
But there have been no military tensions in the strait since President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan was elected a year ago. And he has proven more open to developing economic ties than was his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui. 
Taiwan investment on the mainland is booming, and at any one time there are hundreds of thousands of people from Taiwan living in or visiting China.
As much as $10 billion has poured into China from Taiwan in the last two years, compared with $40 billion in the previous decade, when the country had already become the main destination for overseas investment from the island of 23 million people. 
Cross-strait trade reached $30 billion in 2000, making Taiwan China's sixth-largest trading partner.
By some estimates, Taiwan is poised to invest more money in the mainland in the next three years than it has in the last 10. If so, that could further blend the two economies. 
"After visiting Taiwanese companies along the Shanghai-Suzhou corridor, I'm convinced that the cross-strait issue will resolve in 10 years," said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
In his New Year address this year, President Chen said China and Taiwan should begin "the integration of our economies, trade and culture" to gradually "build a new framework of permanent peace and political integration."
He opened direct trade and transport between the mainland and two tiny Taiwan-controlled islands hard against the mainland coast, and he is reviewing such links between the mainland and Taiwan proper.
He plans to begin allowing mainland tourists to visit Taiwan later this year and is considering relaxing restrictions governing Taiwan investment on the mainland. Taiwan companies regularly ignore the rules by investing through offshore companies in any case.
"Over the long run I believe that economic integration will lead to some kind of social and political integration," said Lin Chong-ping, vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, in a telephone interview.
Taiwan's investment in the mainland, most of which comes into the country indirectly through Hong Kong, once focused on Guangdong Province in southern China, lured by cheap land and low-cost labor. 
It has more recently migrated north toward Shanghai and shifted into increasingly advanced technologies and larger, longer-term projects.
Formosa Plastics, Taiwan's largest enterprise, is considering plans to invest in a huge petrochemical plant in Ningbo, south of Shanghai. And last year Winston Wong, the son of Formosa Plastics' chairman, joined President Jiang Zemin's son, Jiang Mianheng, to break ground on a $1.63 billion Shanghai plant that will produce circuit-etched silicon wafers -- the most critical component in computer chips. Nearby, another Taiwanese-financed wafer foundry, as the plants are known, is under way.
"With China entering the World Trade Organization, we are looking more at the domestic market here than at China as a base for exports," said D. C. Yang, the former head of the Shanghai association of Taiwan business people. 
While no exact figures are available, he estimates that there are a quarter of a million people from Taiwan in Shanghai at any one time. There are many more living in or visiting the south.
"East China is becoming the hub of Taiwan investment radiating out to other parts of the country," Mr. Yang said.
The highway between Shanghai and Suzhou has become a technology corridor, with Kunshan drawing most of the investment because of prompt service to investors by the town's mayor and easy access to Shanghai, just 40 minutes away.
And despite a recent mainland spy hunt that has led to the arrest of ethnic Chinese scholars visiting China, Beijing is more welcoming to people from Taiwan today than any time in the last decade. 
It has drastically increased the number of mainlanders allowed to visit Taiwan and aggressively courted visits from Taiwan opinion leaders, including legislators, former government officials, scholars and celebrities.
Taipei and Shanghai have exchanged visits by deputy mayors. And Taiwan's former prime minister, Vincent Siew, is currently in China to lobby for a common market between the mainland and Taiwan. He is the second vice chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party, the Nationalist Party, to set foot in China in less than six months.
"In cross-strait relations, we are in something of a race between the forces of economic integration and political separation," said Mr. Schell. "Barring some really nasty bump in the road, I would bet on integration."

HEADLINE: Even for Wealthy, Tax Plan's Benefits Could Vary Widely 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Much of the debate about President Bush's plan to cut income taxes has focused on its benefits to the richest Americans. But the government has provided few details about which taxpayers would get the biggest cuts.
 Now a new analysis gives a far clearer picture. Under the version of the plan that was passed by the House earlier this spring with Mr. Bush's support, the biggest cuts would go more to the extraordinarily wealthy than to the merely wealthy and the affluent. While the Senate version is less generous to the extraordinarily wealthy, it gives much more than does the plan approved by the House to the affluent. The Senate Finance Committee will take up the proposal today. Page A16. 
 Indeed, under the House plan, the vast majority of taxpayers whose income is in the top 20 percent -- those who make more than $72,000 -- would average fewer dollars from the tax cut than the $1,600 that President Bush says the typical middle-class family would save. 
But the very richest, the 400 Americans with the highest incomes, averaging $110 million each in 1998, would save more than $1 million a year under the House plan. Even under the proposal in the Senate, they would save an average of $622,900 each, according to an analysis by The New York Times of figures provided by Prof. Joel Slemrod, a tax specialist at the University of Michigan. He obtained the data from the Internal Revenue Service, which had previously refused numerous requests for detailed breakdowns on the very-highest-income Americans.
The final shape of the tax plan will depend on what the Senate passes, and then on what the House and Senate agree to send to President Bush. Under the current Senate version of the plan, intended to reduce the impact of the alternative minimum tax on the cuts Mr. Bush wants, people in the top 20 percent income group would on average fare better than they would under the House plan, while the very richest would not do as well, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group that says the tax system favors the rich. 
The New York Times asked this group for a more detailed analysis, using its computer model. Economists who disagree with Citizens for Tax Justice's views on taxes, including Bill Beach of the Heritage Foundation, a major backer of Mr. Bush's plan, say they accept the reliability of the group's calculations. 
They show that top 1 percent of taxpayers -- the 1.25 million who make more than $373,000 and pay higher taxes -- would receive an average tax cut of $28,608 under the House plan, but $20,135 under the Senate proposal. 
Because the Senate plan would change the way the alternative minimum tax kicks in, taxpayers in the next 4 percent -- the five million two-income couples, professionals and business owners who make $147,000 to $373,000 -- would average $3,593 each if the Senate proposal became law but would get $1,302 under the House plan. 
The $1,302 is less than the $1,600 Mr. Bush has said his plan will give back to families with children that are making around $60,000 -- an income far less than in the top groups.
The next 15 percent -- the nearly 19 million taxpayers who make $72,000 to $147,000 -- would get a tax cut of $2,093 each under the Senate plan, and $1,509 under the House plan, according to the Citizens for Tax Justice calculations.
The House plan calls for cutting the top tax rates to 33 percent from 36 percent and 39.6 percent, and the administration says this remains a top goal. But last Friday, two leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, put forth a plan that would lower the top rate to 36 percent instead of 33 percent, citing insufficient support for the deeper cut. 
Before the House passed its version of the plan, Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders agreed to scale back the tax cut from $1.6 trillion over 10 years to $1.35 trillion. 
In Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation has issued a limited analysis. 
The Heritage Foundation and other supporters of the president's plan say that the top tax rates are unfairly high and that the most economically productive taxpayers would be even more productive if their tax rates were significantly reduced. They add that because most taxes are paid by high-income Americans, most of the savings should go to them.
Indeed, the plan approved by the House would give the very-highest-income Americans a tax cut equal to 1 percent of their incomes. That is less in percentage terms than the tax cuts proposed for the middle class, although higher than the cuts for the poorest 20 percent and for those affected by the alternative minimum tax. Under the Senate version, the top 400 would get a 0.6 percent tax cut. 
The tax cut proposals come three years after another tax cut that also benefited the very richest Americans most, a 1998 reduction in tax rates on long-term capital gains. The new I.R.S. data show that the top 400 taxpayers saved an average of $6.4 million each that year, assuming that all their gains were long term. While Congress made these cuts available to all 125 million taxpayers, these 400 taxpayers alone received 7 percent of all the savings. These taxpayers account for about 1 percent of all income tax revenues. 
As a result of the cut in capital- gains tax rates, which began to take effect in 1997, the share of income that the top 400 taxpayers owe in taxes has fallen significantly. The top 400 paid an average of 22 percent of their adjusted gross incomes in 1998, down from 30 percent in 1995. Under Mr. Bush's plan, as approved by the House, the figure would fall further, to 20.9 percent; 21.4 percent under the Senate plan.
For all taxpayers, the average income tax rose to 14.6 percent from 14 percent over these same years, the I.R.S. data shows. Under Mr. Bush's plan, as the House passed it, the average income tax for all Americans should fall to 12.3 percent, Treasury officials said. No such figures have been calculated for the Senate alternative to the Bush plan. 
Mr. Bush also proposes to repeal the estate tax, which he calls the death tax. The administration has not provided estimates of how much various income groups would benefit from this cut, but the tax is paid on the fortunes of only the richest 2 percent of Americans who die.
Mr. Bush originally proposed to cut all tax rates. The two highest rates, 39.6 percent and 36 percent, would fall to 33 percent. The 31 percent and 28 percent rates would fall to 25 percent, and a fourth of the money taxed at 15 percent would fall to a new 10 percent bracket.
The highest rate is paid by the top 1 percent, and the second highest by the top 2 percent. 
But the almost 25 million taxpayers making $72,000 to $627,000 would get far less than these rate cuts would imply because of the alternative minimum tax. White House officials have said they are aware that the alternative minimum tax will take away some of the tax savings Mr. Bush proposes. The proposal under discussion in the Senate Finance Committee would seek to reduce somewhat the effect of the alternative minimum tax.
That tax was adopted 32 years ago to make sure that very wealthy individuals could not use deductions or tax-avoidance schemes to escape paying a fair share of taxes. But because Congress has not adjusted the tax to keep pace with inflation or other changes in the law, it no longer applies to people who make more than $627,000.
Indeed, it has increasingly come to apply to middle- and upper-income taxpayers who claim wholly legitimate deductions.
For example, on its face the Bush plan passed by the House would save a couple making $373,000 about $8,800, or 11 percent of their tax bill, the Citizens for Tax Justice model shows. But the alternative minimum tax would take away $6,370 of that, wiping out all but $2,430 of the income tax savings.
The Senate version gives this taxpayer $4,551 because of changes it makes in the alternative minimum tax.
The alternative minimum tax hits hardest at large families and people who live in places with high state taxes like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts and California. That is because it reduces or eliminates deductions taxpayers take for themselves, for their children and for state income and local property taxes, as well as some medical bills. 
Indeed, Mr. Bush's plan would increase revenue from the alternative minimum tax by $130 billion and that increase would help hold down the overall cost of the Bush tax cuts.
The alternative minimum tax has come under renewed scrutiny recently as legislators and tax analysts study the effect it would have on any broad-based tax cut.
But Mr. Bush did not address the problem in his tax proposal, saying that reducing all tax rates, increasing the child credit, reducing the so-called marriage penalty and eliminating the estate tax were higher priorities. 
The White House referred all questions to Mark Weinberger, the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy, who said Mr. Bush's plan was intended to provide cuts for all taxpayers in proportion to their income.
"We did not focus on the top 1 percent or on the alternative minimum tax" in designing the package, Mr. Weinberger said. He said that the alternative minimum tax must be changed, but that the tax cut must come first because Mr. Bush ran for office on a promise to cut tax rates, not to fix the alternative minimum tax. 
The proposal being considered by the Senate Finance Committee would somewhat reduce the scale of the problem, but eliminating the alternative minimum tax would cost as much as several hundred billion dollars over the next decade -- more than Republican leaders can allocate to it and still include all of Mr. Bush's priorities in the $1.35 trillion tax bill.
Mr. Bush and Republican leaders seem to have made a decision that they would rather push through the underlying tax cut now and rely on public pressure to help them enact another tax bill in the next year or two to address the alternative tax problem.
David Keating, executive director of the Club for Growth, a Washington group that works to defeat members of Congress who resist deep tax cuts, said the disparity in benefits within the top 1 percent was evidence that the alternative minimum tax should be overhauled or abolished. "For someone to lose three-fourths of their tax cut because of the alternative minimum tax shows that rates are not being pushed down nearly as much as advertised," he said.
Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, said taking away tax breaks through the alternative minimum tax illustrates what he said was deceptive marketing by the White House of a tax plan that supposedly benefits everyone. "This is a plan designed solely for the rich," he said, "and everybody else gets a trivial tax cut that they will pay for with the loss of valuable government services."

The Isles of Greece in Microminiature

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
AT 380 square feet, kitchen included, and with seating for 10, barely, Snack is one of Manhattan's smallest restaurants. Even so, Elias Varkoutas, who opened Snack in SoHo in 1999, thought there was room enough to take on a partner. So he has joined forces with Adam Greene, a former general manager of Aquavit and Union Pacific. Together, they have expanded Snack's menu and hours, transforming a luncheonette serving vegetarian Greek appetizers into a restaurant with full Greek meals.
 Now, a tiny place like Snack could be viewed as a curiosity, a testament to the rigors of the Manhattan real estate market. But taste Snack's stifado ($13), a wonderful stew of braised lamb, delicately spiced with cinnamon and oregano and touched with the sweet juices of a currant, apricot and almond pilaf, and you know right away that Snack is worth squeezing into. 
 And I do mean squeeze. Plain wooden tables line one side of the narrow dining room, and access to the banquette requires lifting a table out of the way. Arrive with a party of three, and you will hunker around a table built for two rather than leaving a seat empty at a table for four. Small-scale economics, you know.
Still, the two-man operation (I'm told there's kitchen help, but I've never seen anybody else) handles awkward seating moments with good nature. At Snack, where your neighbor's business inevitably becomes yours, everybody nonetheless seems to get along. 
Maybe that's because everybody is enjoying the food, starting with impeccable cold appetizers ($9 for a selection of three). Hummus is sharpened to a lively tang with copious lemon juice, while melitzanes salata, an eggplant spread, is chunky and deliciously smoky. Fluffy and light taramosalata, a whipped carp-roe spread, tastes of the briny sea, while tzatziki, the cucumber-and-yogurt dip, is a refreshing anodyne to skordalia, a classic garlic-laden potato puree. 
The skordalia reappears in an excellent beet salad ($6), contrasting well with mildly sweet beets and peppery arugula. Roasted red pepper salad ($6) is on the sedate side, not as sweet as I expected but augmented by feta cheese and a garlic vinaigrette. Neither chewy octopus in a garlic sauce ($8) nor rubbery saganaki ($6) rivaled the cold appetizers, but chicken boureki ($8), a triangle of puff pastry layered with sesame seeds and stuffed with chicken, feta, mushrooms and herbs, is a close-your-eyes-and-sigh kind of dish. Olive boureki ($8) is pretty good, too, and since it comes with a salad or an appetizer, it can make a light meal.
I find it difficult to pass over the stifado, but Snack does offer other gems among its small selection of main courses. Keftedes ($13), or savory veal meatballs with pine nuts and almond slivers, are served with sweet prunes in a red wine sauce over tiny, paper-thin squares of pasta. Juicy roast chicken ($11), redolent of lemon, rosemary and garlic, comes with greens and roasted lemon potatoes, crisp and flavorful. I can do without the pastitsio ($12), a layered dish of beef, pasta and bechamel, which is like a flavorless Greek lasagna, but a pepper and a tomato, both stuffed with an airy yet spicy mixture of brown rice, onions, mint and dill ($11), are superb.
Desserts are simple and satisfying, whether yogurt with honey ($3) or a moist semolina "halvah" in a cinnamon-orange syrup. Snack does not have a wine-and-beer license but is expecting one soon.
While the cramped size is a drawback, it is a virtue, too. I wondered how Snack differed from the big, high-end restaurants Mr. Greene worked at previously. "We oversee everything here," he told me by telephone. "Very little is unobserved."

Not Just for Brightening Up the Old Yurt Anymore

BYLINE:  By Douglas Frantz 

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan 

 BODY:
For centuries, the folk art of this mountainous realm reflected the nomadic wanderings of its people, and even the most beautiful and precious goods had to be useful and portable.
 The prized works were colorful lightweight felt rugs known as shyrdaks (pronounced SHEER-dox) and exquisitely embroidered cotton and silk wall hangings called tush-kiiz (TOOSH-kees). Spread across the floor and hung on walls, they brightened the yurt and kept this round, tentlike structure warm in winter. 
 By the end of the 20th century most Kyrgyz were in villages and cities and the artisans' skills had withered. Felt rugs of inferior quality were still produced for the occasional tourist. No one seemed willing to spend months stitching the intricate patterns of a traditional tush-kiiz. 
A reporter's tour of the teeming bazaars in Bishkek, the capital, and Osh, the largest city in southern Kyrgyzstan, failed to turn up anything matching the quality and workmanship of the older goods, though there were poor imitations among the endless wares in hundreds of stalls.
But efforts are being made to revive the crafts of Kyrgyzstan and the other countries along the ancient Silk Road that spans Central Asia. The impetus is part reverence for tradition and part recognition that a thriving folk art industry will bring economic benefits, no small matter in former Soviet republics where half the people live below the poverty line.
"We have tried to involve the poorest part of the population," Dinara Chochunbaeva, the force behind the revival, said in an interview. "People have the skills and, with some help, they can produce wonderful things." She runs Kyrgyz Style, a nonprofit organization in Bishkek that is trying to resurrect traditional arts and culture. It conducts workshops throughout the country to help rural women relearn the traditional folk arts and the knowlege to market their products.
Most of the 4.5 million residents of Kyrgyzstan are far too poor to buy crafts; the per capita income is $330 a year. Most tourists who visit are hunters hoping to bag a big-horned sheep or mountain climbers and hikers eager to test the Tian Shan and Pamir ranges, which Marco Polo called the roof of the world.
The export market offers the biggest hope for the crafts revival. Though the totals remain small, figures have been promising. In 1997, the first year the group counted exports, goods valued at $2,442 were sold. Last year sales were $102,412; a third of that involved sales in the United States.
The star of the felt rug revival is Janyl Aliebekov, who lives in the mountain village of Acha-Kayingi and is regarded as the country's best maker of shyrdaks.
The quality of her rugs is clear even to a novice. The felt is thinner and more supple than that of other rugs yet strong and light: a result, she says, of carefully selecting the right wool from the right sheep. The colors are subdued and harmonious.
Working on five or six rugs at a time, with help from family members, Mrs. Aliebekov can earn $250 to $300 a month, nearly a year's per capita earnings here. Her work will be displayed in late July at an international symposium on felt rugs in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.
It has proved harder to stimulate a rebirth in tush-kiiz. These colorful hand-made wall panels resemble thin quilts, with a three-sided border surrounding an elaborately embroidered center panel. The bottom side was left unfinished because beds were usually pushed beneath the tush-kiiz or rugs were piled in front of it.
Few people are willing to devote the hundreds of hours required to stitch the intricate patterns in silk thread on the cotton backing. Because they are still considered compulsory dowry items for brides, modern tush-kiiz are usually bright patches of silk sewn together. 
But Bishkek is flooded with gorgeous tush-kiiz from the 1950's and 60's, generally selling for as little as $70 or $80 in the shops and galleries of Bishkek. The finest examples usually have the date and name of the maker stitched onto them.
When Ms. Chochunbaeva and Francois Colcanap, a Peace Corps volunteer working for Kyrgyz Style, took some old ones to show the British Museum in London recently, the museum purchased every item for its collection. The prices were so low, Mr. Colcanap said, that he refused to disclose them. 
In an effort to promote the folk art revival, the Central Asia Crafts Support Association was created last year. The association has 16 organizations and 3,000 members in five countries, from carpet weavers in Turkmenistan to ikat silk robe makers in Uzbekistan.
There is a parallel attempt to revive fine arts in Bishkek, the most hospitable and liberal city in Central Asia. Abandoned Soviet-era factories throughout the city have been transformed into studios and a handful of galleries have opened.
The United Nations Development Program in Kyrgyzstan published a catalog of local artists to showcase and stimulate the revival. Tourists and foreign workers in Bishkek have provided a small, but steady market.
An ambitious exhibition of art from Central Asia and Russia opened recently at the Aytiev Museum of Fine Arts in Bishkek and is to travel to Almaty, Kazakhstan, St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Netherlands.
Called "Internal Asia," the exhibition of 144 works is intended to demonstrate the energy and diversity of the region's contemporary painting and sculpture.
Many of the works are mundane and could have come from anywhere in the world, but others capture the uniqueness and vibrancy of Asia. A collage of photographs and diary installments from a trip to Tibet by Francisco Infante, a Moscow-based artist, for example, offers different perspectives on that remote and mysterious part of the world.
In one large installation, four blackened cooking pots called kazans are overturned on a strip of white cotton, mud and straw. A pathway leads to a traditional skin used to hold fermented mare's milk, which the nomads used as a cure for illnesses.
"The nomads turned the kazans over as a signal that it was time to move," said Murat Jumaliev, one of four local artists who created the installation. "It's symbolic of the wide road of our past and the new road we hope to follow in the future."

Cyclical School of Hard Knocks

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Roger Siboni had never experienced anything like it. One day, investors were rewarding a sevenfold annual increase in sales at his company, E.piphany Inc., by pushing its stock price above $200 a share. Then, seemingly without warning, they began to worry about costs and a slowdown in sales, and the stock started a descent that reached as low as $7.
 "I don't recall ever seeing such a rapid drop-off from exuberance to despair," said Mr. Siboni, the 46-year-old chief executive of E.piphany, a San Mateo, Calif., software company that went public less than two years ago. "It's almost like someone's flipped a switch." 
 As the exaggerated swings in stock markets illustrate, many investors have never had to navigate a bear market. At the same time, there are many chief executives whose memory of the last economic slowdown is dim. 
During the last recession of the early 90's, most of today's top executives were not in the jobs they now hold -- and many were not even among a company's senior management.
While managing during any economic downturn is a challenge, executives face a particularly formidable task this time around.
After a decade in which companies flourished seemingly without effort -- the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth on record -- many executives now face a radically different environment, according to management consultants and some of the executives themselves.
Shareholders have become deeply skeptical, demand has slowed drastically in many areas and there is intense pressure to cut costs to show profits or, at the very least, to conserve cash.
Executives who have led their companies only through rapid growth are having a difficult time, said Peter Crist, a vice chairman of Korn/Ferry International, an executive recruiting firm. "I can guarantee you that they have the deer-in-the-headlights look when they get to a soft spot," he said.
Mr. Siboni acknowledged that the suddenness of the slowdown had rattled his peers. "This has hit the psyche of every C.E.O. across the U.S., and even globally," he said.
While some of the youngest and least-experienced managers are found among the many companies that were created in boom times, even some established companies lack a lot of gray hair in the executive suite. "You have companies that have lost so many of their top and middle managers that they are dependent on someone who was in school during the last downturn," said Gary Stibel, principal of the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. Many of those managers went to dot-coms and other start-ups, and some were asked to leave.
The combination of a widening gap between the performance that investors expect and what companies can deliver, combined with the high level of turnover among chief executives, is creating what Chris Zook, the head of the worldwide strategy practice for Bain & Company, describes as the management equivalent of "the perfect storm."
Executives are also being forced to rethink what they tell Wall Street and the kind of promises they can make, according to executives and consultants.
"Companies have been in a trap of false enthusiasm in the last six to eight years," Mr. Zook said.
While some chief executives may still think they can get away with promising double-digit growth in revenue or earnings even when they may not be able to deliver, most are learning a newfound realism based on old-fashioned business methods that were learned the hard way by those who were around in the last recession.
No one says that having lived through the last recession was complete protection against this decline, of course, and even relatively seasoned chief executives like John T. Chambers at Cisco Systems seem to have been caught unaware.
Mr. Chambers, who joined Cisco as a senior vice president during the last downturn, said last month that a 30 percent drop in third-quarter sales at his company was symptomatic of a broader slump that "may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated." He likened the slowdown that Cisco was experiencing to "a 100-year flood."
But experience with an earlier recession may help executives steer their companies through the current slowdown. Gone are the days when promises of growth were enough to levitate a stock, which helped many executives look like heroes.
"The slogan du jour was get big, fast," recalled Mr. Siboni of E.piphany, which had been blessed with a stock price that topped $216. Mr. Siboni joined the company in 1998 after a 20-year career as a consultant with KPMG Peat Marwick.
Back then, he said, "so much of our efforts were directed at modulating the highs." Today, the emphasis is on digging out of the lows.
Mr. Siboni, for example, is paying careful attention to his company's costs, especially after revenue proved disappointing in the first quarter. He is exiting less profitable businesses like software integration because the high cost of hiring people makes profits hard to come by.
Like many other executives, Mr. Siboni must also use a stock that is trading around $11 to motivate employees who for the most part know only what it is like to work in a company with a rising stock price and seemingly unlimited potential.
At a recent meeting, for example, he tried to persuade his employees that the current period "is probably a more important time in your career than the last five great and glory years."
He argues that those who prove themselves during these hard times will benefit from the lessons they have learned and the depth of their experience.
Executives who were once punished for not delivering dazzling dot-com-style results say that by not being caught up in the mania, they are having an easier time making their case to the investment community now. Harry M. Jansen Kraemer Jr., the chief executive of Baxter International, recalled the questions from Wall Street about why Baxter, which makes blood products, vaccines and other medical products in Deerfield, Ill., could not increase its annual earnings as much as 25 percent.
"We didn't grow at 20 to 30 percent when some of the craziness was going on," said Mr. Kraemer, 46, who has spent the last 19 years at Baxter and was named chief executive in early 1999. But his focus on delivering profits that he knows Baxter can achieve, in the midteens on a yearly basis, means that the company's stock is now being rewarded and is trading near its 52-week high. 
Unlike many companies, Baxter is not in a position radically different than it was a few years ago, according to Mr. Kraemer. The company has always been under pressure to contain expenses, for example, because it cannot increase its prices to protect its profits. "What you have to do now is what I have to do every year," Mr. Kraemer said.
Certainly some young executives are not convinced that having run a company through the last downturn would make their job any easier today. Managing during times like this "is not something you can learn from one downturn to the next," said Guy Gecht, the 36-year-old chief executive of Electronics for Imaging, a Foster City, Calif., company that makes devices for printers.
Mr. Gecht, who was a software manager during the last recession, now oversees a work force of about 900 people. The company warned last June that its second-quarter earnings would be lower than Wall Street was expecting because of lower demand. Electronics for Imaging's stock, which reached about $69 in April, fell as low as $11 by October.
When the economy began to slow, Mr. Gecht said that he met with his senior managers and talked about how to handle the shifting environment, and they discussed what steps they needed to take. The company now gives clearer guidance trends in sales and profits, he said, and this has helped it meet Wall Street's expectations for the last two quarters. As a result, the stock has rebounded somewhat, to trade around $29.
Mr. Gecht is also focusing on talking with employees. Until very recently, he said that he used to block out an hour each day on his calendar to walk around the offices and talk to people, hearing their concerns and explaining the company's strategy.
Other executives, however, say that they think there is a clear benefit to experience.
"The most important thing you learn about a business cycle is that it ends," said Umang Gupta, the 51-year-old chief executive of Keynote Systems, a San Mateo, Calif., company that helps other companies measure the effectiveness of their Web sites.
Mr. Gupta, who created an earlier software company that went public and prospered until it stumbled in the mid-90's, when Mr. Gupta left, thinks the perspective offered by seeing an economic decline is useful.
Last year, for example, Mr. Gupta said he and his management team were convinced that the boom would end, given their experience with other business cycles, so they raised as much cash as they could before the bubble burst. Although the company went public in September 1999, it raised $350 million for itself in a secondary offering in early 2000. 
The company has also shifted its client base away from Internet companies that may or may not survive to corporate clients like Bank of America and Charles Schwab.
"That requires a hardheadedness," Mr. Gupta said, and an understanding that the company cannot afford to do everything.
Experience with slowdowns can give executives the perspective needed to choose wisely among difficult options.
In the coming months, many executives will stumble, cutting staff too deeply or refusing to become realistic about how quickly their businesses can grow.
"True leaders really shine in a downturn," said Mr. Crist, the executive recruiter. "The impostors are defrocked in tough times."

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Airlines await the return of business passengers, creating bargain opportunities in leisure fares.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: sharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOARING air fares usually get most of the blame for the cutbacks in business travel that hammered the airline industry's balance sheets in the first quarter of this year. But there are some early indications that the ascent in air fares has leveled off.
 Far less clear, though, is when we can expect to see robust growth again in domestic business travel. 
 Airlines, struggling to keep revenue up as costs rise and business demand slackens, are obviously becoming aggressive on discounting some fares. The Air Transport Association, a trade group, reported recently that average domestic air fares declined 2.5 percent in March over March 2000. 
That doesn't necessarily indicate that conditions are improving for corporate travel, which is one of the barometers of a rebounding economy, said David A. Swierenga, the chief economist at the association.
"What you have today are two countervailing forces," Mr. Swierenga said. On one hand, higher fuel and labor-settlement costs are pushing fares up, while plummeting demand the last two months has prompted selective fare discounts by airlines that are looking for ways to fill seats, he said.
The newspapers currently brim with airline fare-sale ads. But the discounting is aimed mostly at the leisure-travel end of the market, in which airlines are essentially hoping to pick up small change until the far more lucrative business-travel side resumes its recent growth levels -- something a few industry experts don't expect to see until next year.
"Demand has been really weak in the full-fare and premium-cabin categories" that constitute the bulk of the business travel market, Mr. Swierenga said.
"The real difficulty with soft demand in the airline industry is the business traveler," he added, "and that's not going to turn around until businesses see their incomes beginning to rise again." Discretionary business travel is usually among the first expenditures to be cut when quarterly results start looking wobbly.
The leisure travel market, meanwhile, does not appear to be reacting with the same intensity to economic worries. In fact, more than 80 percent of leisure travelers say they will travel this summer as much as (59 percent) or more than (23 percent) they did last summer, according to the American Express leisure travel index released yesterday.
There isn't any indication that people are planning to cut back on vacation spending this summer. According to the American Express survey, 44 percent of leisure travelers plan to spend more this year than last, and 39 percent said they expected to spend about the same amount.
Joanne Fisher, a spokeswoman for the leisure travel index, said that the figures shouldn't be interpreted to suggest that an inordinate amount of Americans are laughing off a soft economy and "booking vacation safaris" or piling on other luxuries. They just don't seem to be panicking.
As always, the most popular leisure trips are visiting family and friends, and the favorite type of accommodations remains "moderately priced hotels," said Elizabeth Cohen, vice president for the lodging industry at American Express.
There's also encouraging news from another American Express survey, to be released later this week, which shows that companies are seeing some respite from steadily rising business air fares, at least for the time being.
According to the American Express Business Travel Monitor, which tracks business air fares in 215 domestic city pairs each month, while typical business air fares remain at record high levels and have shot up 77 percent since 1996, they stayed flat in March and February at about an average of $1,158 for a round-trip ticket. For the entire first quarter, however, the fares were 13 percent higher than the period a year earlier.
American Express defines typical business fares as the standard rate "basically the sticker price, the lowest economy-class fare available" at close to last-minute purchase, said Don Munro, an American Express spokesman.
The survey tracks another index, however, the so-called average fare paid. This fare "reflects what a company's business travelers actually wind up paying" for an airline ticket, Mr. Munro said.
In March, the average business fare paid was $638 for a round trip. Those fares grew only 4 percent during the first quarter over the average for the first quarter of 2000.
One reason for that is the revolution currently sweeping corporate travel departments, where traveling employees are being encouraged -- and pressed -- to adhere better to travel-budget policies intended to allow planners to negotiate prices using volume discounts, advance purchasing, online booking and other cost-saving techniques.
"More companies are using nonrefundable tickets," which are less
expensive because they must be bought weeks in advance, Mr. Munro said.
"Companies are getting the word out to employees," he said, "that you have to plan earlier for your trip if you want to take advantage of these lower fares."
Also, Mr. Munro added, "companies are doing a better job telling their employees about negotiated discounts" with specific airlines. To a growing extent, he said, more employees are starting to cooperate through corporate intranet travel engines, which are seen by travel managers as ways to reduce long-term travel costs.
All in all, he said, "companies are becoming increasingly successful at buffering the full effects of air fares."

HEADLINE: Zale Jewelry Chain Posts Weak Results 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 15 

 BODY:
The Zale Corporation, the largest jewelry retailer in the nation, said today that its profit fell more than 50 percent in its most recent quarter because of a slowdown in consumer spending and inventory problems.
 Zale, which operates more than 2,300 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, said it earned $3.5 million, or 10 cents a share, down from $10.5 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Sales in the period, which ended April 30 and was the third quarter of Zale's fiscal year, rose 13.9 percent, to $411.5 million, while comparable-store sales, a critical measure of performance, fell 7.3 percent from a year earlier.
Excluding a charge for severance payments, Zale earned $4.8 million, or 14 cents a share, which fell short of the 15 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/ First Call.
Zale said it expected a flat performance for the coming year.
"Profit numbers were in line with our expectations for this quarter," the chairman, Robert DiNicola, said in a statement. "However, as we look ahead I would anticipate a flat profit performance for next fiscal year since both internal and external factors are negatively impacting our business."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Finish Flat After Initial Excitement Over Rate Cut

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks initially spiked higher yesterday but ended nearly flat in reaction to the Federal Reserve's fifth cut in interest rates this year to try to jump-start the sagging economy.
 "The market opened up the present, pulled the tissue away and looked for the bonus gift at the bottom of the box. It didn't see anything at the bottom and sold off, almost like a 3-year-old on Christmas morning," said David Sowerby, a market strategist for Loomis Sayles, which oversees about $65 billion. "I think people were looking for the Fed to say more definitively that they are not done cutting rates." 
 In a move that was widely anticipated by the financial markets, the central bank lowered the federal funds rate, a benchmark for short-term interest rates, by 50 basis points, to 4.0 percent from 4.5 percent. The Fed, citing signs of weakness in the economy, hinted it might cut more.
With the Fed not scheduled to meet again until late June, Wall Street is desperately searching for signs that profits are improving, analysts said. Lower interest rates encourage business investment and increase consumer spending. But the question is: When will it show up in corporate America's bottom line?
"The next quarter's earnings will look pretty yucky, but I think that's discounted in the marketplace," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners. "Now, really, the issue is: What are third- and fourth-quarter earnings going to look like?"
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 4.36 points, at 10,872.97, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up just 0.52 point, to 1,249.44.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index edged up 3.66 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,085.58, after initially rising more than 2 percent on news of the rate cut.
Before the news, the broad stock market was slightly lower, along with the Dow, although technology stocks held modest gains.
The Fed, which with its latest action took the federal funds rate to its lowest level in seven years, also reduced the discount rate -- charged on direct Fed loans to commercial banks -- by half a percentage point, to 3.5 percent.
In its accompanying statement, the central bank said it still saw excessive weakness as the main threat to the economy, citing concerns about falling investment spending and weak corporate profits.
The Fed's warning about the threat of economic weakness, as well as its comment that inflation remained contained, helped bolster the view that the central bank was poised to trim rates further if the need arose.
Since the last monetary easing on April 18, stocks have moved higher on the expectation that lower rates will reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, thereby aiding spending and corporate profits.
Wal-Mart Stores fell $2.35, to $52, after the retailer offered cautious comments on the economy's effect on its future business, while reporting earnings that were slightly higher than expected.
Home Depot gained 95 cents, to $50.10, after saying it expected to meet Wall Street's forecasts for the next quarter because of strong cost-control measures, while J. C. Penney fell 86 cents, to $20.19, after reporting lower results, citing a slowdown in its catalog business because of the slumping economy.
In other corporate news, Motorola said it was considering selling its Integrated Information Systems Group, a government communication and information technology business. Motorola slipped 78 cents, to $14.96.

Treasury Prices Drop
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Most Treasury bond prices fell after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate half a point, to 4 percent, fueling speculation that the five rate reductions this year will accelerate inflation.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32, to a price of 96 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.50 percent from 5.43 percent on Monday. 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 25/32, to 92 19/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.91 percent from 5.85 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed's Statement 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 4 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent. 
 A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently. Investment in capital equipment, however, has continued to decline. The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.
With pressures on labor and product markets easing, inflation is expected to remain contained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.
The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
The FedCut Rates, and Wall Street Yawned

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors got what they expected from the Federal Reserve yesterday, but didn't jump for joy.
 The Fed again lowered its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- by half a percentage point, to 4 percent, and indicated that it was prepared to cut again. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down around 50 points before the announcement, finished 4.36 points lower, at 10,872.97. The Nasdaq composite index, up about 6 points before the announcement, ended the day up 3.66 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,085.58. 
In the bond market, shorter-term rates rallied a bit on the expectation of further rate cuts, but longer-term securities sold off, pushing yields higher.
Still, yesterday's response from the stock market was a bit more positive than it had been after the two earlier rate cuts the Fed made this year at regularly scheduled meetings. On Jan. 31, the Dow was essentially unchanged, and on March 20, it fell 2.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.3 percent on Jan. 31 and 4.8 percent on March 20.
By contrast, the two surprise rate cuts, made between scheduled meetings, produced big surges in stock indexes.
Bonds had responded positively to three of the previous four rate cuts, with prices rising and yields consequently declining across the board.
For the markets, the crucial aspect of the Fed's decision yesterday was not so much the size of the rate cut, but the indication that Federal Reserve policy makers stood ready to reduce interest rates again. That is what gives investors confidence these days.
"They will not quit," said Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, "until they achieve success in turning around capital spending and compensating for the negative wealth effect" undermining consumer spending. She was citing two of the three factors that Fed policy makers said continue "to weigh on the economy" -- the third being the risk of slower economic growth abroad.
But Ms. Callies also said she "would not be surprised to see short-term stagnation in the stock indexes." This, she explained, is because investors were given what they had expected, and since their portfolios were positioned for a rate reduction, many saw no need to change them.
The latest rate cut comes at a time when both stock and bond investors seem to believe that the central bank will be able to engineer an economic recovery in the second half of the year. Such sentiment is reflected in recent rises in the Nasdaq composite index, which is up more than 25 percent from its low in April, and in the rise in longer-term Treasury yields as investors prepare for the higher interest rates that would presumably come with an economic recovery.
In part, such confidence stems from the rapidity of the Fed's rate cuts and their combined force -- with the benchmark short-term rate now down 2.5 percentage points in five half-point moves starting on Jan. 3.
This is the fastest that the central bank has lowered interest rates since a combined reduction of two and a half percentage points between July 20 and Aug. 16, 1982. While such rate cuts are expected to take months to have practical effects on the economy, the stock market in the past has recovered sooner with aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve.
In fact, after the first three cuts this year, the Dow Jones industrials were down two weeks later; the Nasdaq composite index was down two weeks after the second and third rate cuts. But after the surprise cut on April 18, both indexes were up two weeks thereafter. And while those two stock indexes have since given up some of the gains, before the Fed announced its move yesterday, both were still higher than they had been with the previous rate cut.
The economic data, though, have not yet confirmed that a recovery is in place, and the rising number of layoffs points to a risk of the economy's slowing further before it recovers. The unemployment rate is now 4.5 percent, up from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent six months earlier.
"The Fed is very worried about the economic outlook" said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, "because they are not precluding a further rate cut."
John Lipsky, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, said only clear signs that the economy was turning around would preclude another rate cut when Fed officials next meet on June 26-27.
"It seems unlikely that such signs would appear," Mr. Lipsky said, adding that he is expecting another half-point cut next month.
But while more reductions are anticipated, the Federal Reserve seemed to indicate that it was not likely to make another cut between meetings before June 26. In their statement yesterday, Fed officials dropped language in their March 20 statement that investors interpreted then as signaling the possibility of another rate cut between sessions.
Corporate profits, which are declining, could also keep investors off balance because the decline is likely to result in further pressure on employers to reduce costs by cutting jobs.
In the first quarter of this year, profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were down 6.4 percent, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
For the second quarter, Wall Street analysts forecast a decline in earnings of 11.4 percent, and then a drop of 2.9 percent in the third quarter. If these forecasts prove correct, it would be the first three consecutive quarterly earnings declines since 1991, during the last recession.
Recent economic data confirm this mixed picture. Last week, the government reported a surprising 0.8 percent jump in retail sales in April and a rise in consumer confidence. A recent sharp increase in first-time claims for unemployment benefits also stopped. But on the negative side, industrial production fell 0.3 percent in April, the seventh consecutive monthly decline.

HEADLINE: Ruling May Erode Longshoremen's Grip on Ports 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
In a major blow to the longshoremen's union and its grip on the docks of New York Harbor, a stevedoring company will be allowed to use members of its laborers' union to unload some ships at Port Newark.
 The company says it challenged decades-old rules and pushed to use its own employees to unload the ships as a way to bring new business to Port Newark and end a government-sanctioned monopoly unique to the Port of New York and New Jersey. 
 Yesterday, the government body that regulates the port agreed, at least in part. The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor gave the company permission to use those workers, but only to unload steel products that have not been coming into the port until now. 
"I'm a little disappointed that they restricted us to just handling steel," said Andrew J. Naporano Jr., the former owner of Metal Management's Newark operation, who is leading the company's move into stevedoring. "But overall, I'm pleased." 
The company plans to start lining up clients right away, he said, and hopes to begin unloading steel in the fall.
The president of the International Longshoremen's Association, John Bowers, said that his union planned to fight Mr. Naporano. He said the union's lawyers would meet today with lawyers for the shipping companies, which also oppose Mr. Naporano's plans, to try to figure out what to do next.
"This opens the door for somebody else to do the same thing, that's what we're worried about," Mr. Bowers said. "Today it's steel, tomorrow it will be some other cargo."
The stakes are high, for Mr. Naporano and his business, for roughly 2,700 local members of the International Longshoremen's Association, and for the area's ports, which directly and indirectly employ more than 166,000 people, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
In its heyday in the middle of the last century, half of everything that came into the United States from abroad went through New York Harbor, where 25,000 men were hired every day to unload ships. And the longshoreman's union controlled it all, for better and for worse.
It was the worse that prompted the legislatures to create the commission in 1953, just before the film "On the Waterfront" dramatized the situation on the docks, where mob bosses and corrupt union leaders forced longshoremen to pay bribes to get work.
The commission also tries to bring supply and demand for longshoremen into balance, a task performed at other ports by free-market forces and collective bargaining.
What made that task so tough was the rise of shipping containers, those truck-trailer-size boxes that came into use in the 1960's. Suddenly, the port did not need 31,000 longshoremen to unload ships anymore; it needed a couple of thousand who knew how to use a crane.
In 1966, the New York Shipping Association, which represents employers in the port, agreed to pay a guaranteed annual income to longshoremen who could no longer get enough work. To try to keep a lid on costs, the Waterfront Commission soon stopped approving new longshoremen.
Even so, by 1983, the annual payments to longshoremen hit $65 million a year, and shippers complained about the high costs of doing business in New York.
Containers, which made it easy to move cargo by rail or truck, allowed them to go elsewhere economically, said Wayne K. Talley, executive director of the Maritime Institute at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. So New York began losing out to other ports.
This was the situation when Mr. Naporano came to know the port. He and his brother were running Naporano Iron and Metal, a scrap business his grandfather founded in 1907.
For two decades, Mr. Naporano's imports were unloaded and his exports loaded by stevedores using I.L.A. labor. But a strike in 1991 threatened to keep them from loading a ship -- and made him decide to take matters into his own hands.
The port rules exempted from the I.L.A. contract bulk cargo -- oil, orange juice, salt -- things that could not be counted as individual items. He decided that scrap metal was bulk, too. So he used his own crews to load that ship.
Hundreds of members of the longshoremen's union walked off their jobs briefly in protest. But Mr. Naporano's company continued to load and unload his own cargo and, in 1997, began to do bulk stevedoring work for other companies.
In the meantime, longshoremen began to retire and the guaranteed-income charges plummeted. The union agreed to less restrictive work rules. Trade through the port picked up.
By the late 1990's, there was no longer a surplus of longshoremen, but rather a shortage of people trained to use computers and complicated equipment. So last year, for the first time in three decades, the Waterfront Commission added new longshoremen, 481 of them, to its approved list.
Even so, the commission's staff said that by its calculations, a third of the time last year there would not have been enough I.L.A. longshoremen available to do Mr. Naporano's work.
Mr. Naporano's critics say the plan could cause unnecessary labor strife and upset the port's delicate balance just as New York Harbor is booming again.
In its decision, the commission said that Metal Management's laborers would unload only steel products that were not now coming into the port. Therefore, the commission wrote, approving Mr. Naporano's plan "will not adversely impact the existing work force of longshoremen, but will affirmatively advance the public interest of the Port of New York District."

HEADLINE: Job and Tax Data Show the Slowdown Reaching New York 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The New York metropolitan economy, so strong for so long, is finally beginning to show signs of strain from the national slowdown.
 In New Jersey, almost 7,000 jobs were lost in April, and the state's unemployment rate jumped to 4.2 percent from 3.8 percent the month before, according to data released yesterday. In Rockland County, N.Y., shoppers have cut back spending so much that the county fears a $10 million shortfall in sales tax collections. 
 And in New York City, hotel rooms are increasingly empty, and a rising number of workers are filing for unemployment insurance benefits. Surveys in the region show that optimism is waning among consumers and business executives. 
None of this suggests that the economic sky is falling, but people in the New York area have more reason to worry. 
"We are now officially part of the national economic slowdown," said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "A month ago, we were certainly impacted, but not fully embraced by the slowdown."
Until now, the slowdown has been concentrated in areas with a lot of manufacturing; unemployment has surged in Michigan and Illinois, for example. In the New York City area, factories are scarce, which helps explain why unemployment here has not been rising.
April jobs data for New York State and New York City will not be released until tomorrow, and some economists think signs of a slowdown in employment may not show that soon. But the weakness of New Jersey's April results has made others more cautious about the outlook for New York.
"We've had two months of job declines on the national level, which means we might get a surprise in New York," said Thomas J. Spitznas, an economist in Mount Vernon, N.Y. "We're kind of at a critical point here."
More than half the 6,900 job losses in New Jersey were in manufacturing, which dropped by 3,800, the New Jersey Department of Labor said. Construction jobs also fell by 1,900.
But employment in the service sector also declined, by about 1,100. Services -- a category that includes everything from store clerks to stockbrokers -- have been the strong point in the local economy until now.
In what may be a warning sign for New York City and its major industry, employment at brokerage firms fell by 500. That may not sound like much, but jobs at securities firms in New Jersey have been rising steadily since late 1994, as Wall Street moved clerical and other jobs to Jersey City.
Faced with a sullen stock market and reluctant corporate clients, investment companies like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have announced big layoffs. Until now, however, the effects have not really shown up in the jobs data.
While some economists think that the weakness in manufacturing is spreading to services in general, others, like Marc M. Goloven of J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, say most of what look like job losses in the service sector have been suffered by temporary workers who have been placed at manufacturing firms. In New Jersey in April, personnel suppliers accounted for 1,500 job losses.
New Jersey officials preferred to emphasize the positive yesterday, noting that despite the 0.4 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, New Jersey's 4.2 percent jobless level remains below the national average of 4.5 percent. "The New Jersey economy continues to perform well despite this upswing in the unemployment rate," said Mark Boyd, the state labor commissioner.
In fact, the meaning of much economic data remains murky, even to economists. Some are alarmed by the steep rise in weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance in New York, which are up by about 25 percent this year. Others say such claims have not proved to be useful indicators in New York City.
Similarly, the New York State comptroller's office reports that collections of sales tax fell by 5.6 percent in April, compared with the previous year. But analysts there are not sure if the decline comes from consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets, or from things like the elimination of the tax on clothing that costs less than $110.
But in Rockland County, government officials are convinced that the county's shortfall is caused by cautious consumers, said C. Scott Vanderhoef, the county executive. Sales taxes, which account for more than 70 percent of the county's budget, have been rising by about 9 percent a year, Mr. Vanderhoef said. But though the county only budgeted a 6.5 percent rise this year, he added, collections are falling far short of that.
Some businesspeople sense that the good times may have rolled away. Bob Maguire, a second-generation car dealer in Bordentown, N.J., said his customers were increasingly interested in buying used cars rather than the more expensive new Chevrolets and Saturns he sells.
"They realize they would like a new car, but a late-model used car will meet their budgets," said Mr. Maguire, who is president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Are his customers worried about their financial futures? "No, I don't see worry," Mr. Maguire said. "But people are not as expansive in outlook as they once were. They're not talking about going on a cruise or buying a new house."

HEADLINE: In the Catskills, Water Hazards; 
A 36-Hole, 500-Acre Resort Plan Draws Opposition

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH 

DATELINE: SHANDAKEN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
There were snickers and snide comments five years ago when Dean L. Gitter built Catskill Corners, a gaudy gift-shop mall featuring the world's largest kaleidoscope and a silo painted with psychedelic designs. Even Mr. Gitter, an actor-turned-developer who wears a cowboy hat and ponytail, seemed happy to poke fun at his hucksterish image, promoting himself as "the P.T. Barnum of the Catskills." 
 But few people here, Mr. Gitter included, are laughing about his latest proposal, for a $300 million resort atop a mountain in the heart of the Catskill Park. 
 It is the largest development ever proposed in the state park: a 500-acre complex with two 18-hole golf courses, two hotels, several lodges and hundreds of time-share residences. To slake its thirst, Mr. Gitter has bought the local water company. And in the process, he has split this normally peaceful town into two angry camps and drawn fire from environmental groups in Albany and even from New York City mayoral candidates. 
To some, the resort is a godsend that could jump-start the depressed economy of this quiet hideaway in Ulster County, about 125 miles northwest of Manhattan. Others warn that it will mar the landscape and contaminate the nearby reservoirs that supply most of New York City's drinking water.
At the very least, the project is expected to pose the biggest test yet for the fragile agreement the city and state reached with upstate communities four years ago to keep the reservoirs clean. Under that agreement, the city gives towns in the watershed money to promote economic development, and the towns in return have dropped their long resistance to water-protection efforts.
The state environmental officials who will soon review the resort proposal face a tricky decision. If they order it scaled back, Mr. Gitter and his allies, who supported the watershed accord, are likely to say they have been betrayed because they believed the pact would encourage projects like theirs. But if the state approves the project, environmentalists warn, water quality will suffer and the federal government could follow through on its threat to force the city to spend billions of dollars on a filtration plant. 
"This project is shaping up as an unavoidable test of the state's commitment to watershed protection," said Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has included the resort project on a list of issues to raise with New York City mayoral candidates. Already, two of those candidates, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, have spoken out against the plan.
Reviving tourism has long been a preoccupation in the Catskills, where flashy resorts drew tens of thousands of visitors each year until the 1960's. A number of major developments have been proposed in recent years, including plans for a $500 million hotel and conference center at the former Concord Hotel, south of the Catskill Park in Kiamesha Lake.
But in the park, "nothing proposed or discussed is anywhere near the scale and scope of this proposed development," said James M. Tierney, an assistant state attorney general who serves as the inspector general for the city's watershed.
Before publicizing their proposal in late 1999, Mr. Gitter and his partners acquired 2,000 acres for the complex, to be called the Belleayre Resort, after the mountain where it would surround the small, state-run Belleayre Mountain Ski Center. They will soon submit a detailed plan to the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which will then seek public comment and make a decision.
Although about three-quarters of the land would remain undeveloped except for nature trails, opponents say the plan could endanger two of New York City's most important reservoirs with pesticides and soil erosion from the golf course, along with runoff from new roads and traffic and development fostered by the resort.
Any project this large is bound to stir opposition. But Mr. Gitter's flamboyant style has provoked a special rancor among many of the year-round residents and summer people who chose Shandaken (pronounced shan-DAKE-in) for its remoteness and tranquillity.
"This is the most controversial thing a sleepy town like this has ever seen," said the town supervisor, Wayne Guttman. "And Mr. Gitter's personality does get involved."
The developer, who began his business career by recording the folk-music legend Odetta's first major album in the late 1950's and went on to earn an M.B.A. at Harvard, clearly has big dreams. A decade ago, he tried to build a $500 million cultural theme park and trade center near Baltimore with the help of the former Democratic presidential candidate Paul Tsongas and a $23 million investment from the Chinese government, but the project foundered, in part because of local opposition. 
Mr. Gitter, 65, moved here from Boston in 1971 to be with his guru, Rudrananda, known locally as Rudy, who ran an ashram here. Mr. Gitter still follows Rudy's teachings and maintains a small outdoor shrine to the guru's memory. From the silo at Catskill Corners, a painted pair of Buddha eyes stare out at the mountains. 
But Mr. Gitter's spiritual talk conceals a ruthless businessman, said Peter DiModica, an opponent of the project who runs an antiques shop. Opponents have accused the developer of getting town and county officials to help him gain control of one hamlet's water supply to use for his resort.
Mr. Gitter dismisses those accusations as a ploy to kill his project, which he calls "a civic-minded effort to do good. I have been painted into a posture of villainy," he said during an interview at the Emerson Inn, a $7 million venture that is his largest successful project so far. 
He conceded that the $300 million Belleayre resort would be a quantum leap for him, and said he might sell the project to a larger company with more experience in resort management.
The project's goal, he said, is simply to restore the area's tourist economy -- "to get people sitting around the kitchen table in Long Island or New Jersey to say, 'Let's go to the Catskills.' "
Mr. Gitter said his critics exaggerate the resort's environmental impact and ignore the glaring need for jobs in a town where he says "every single child who graduates from the regional high school gets a diploma and a bus ticket." 
The state owns most of the land in Shandaken as part of the Catskill Park, and New York City has been buying land for several years in an effort to protect the city's watershed, shrinking the amount of taxable land and forcing residents to shoulder an ever-higher portion of the tax burden.
"The fact is that more people favor this project than oppose it, and it's going to be good for the area," said Robert Linge, the owner of the Cold Spring Lodge here. He added that 170 business owners in Shandaken and neighboring towns signed a petition supporting the resort proposal last year. 
The resort would create 350 full-time jobs, Mr. Gitter said. It would contribute about $80 million a year to the local economy and add about $100 million to the tax base, said Eric Griesser, the town assessor and a supporter.
Opponents counter that most of the new jobs would be low-paying and seasonal, and that the increase in the tax base would not compensate for the added services and roads the town would have to supply. Above all, they say, the project is totally out of character with the region's unspoiled mountain scenery.
"He's offering a theme-park vision that threatens our most precious resource -- virgin wilderness," said Adam Nagy, co-chairman of the Catskills Heritage Alliance, formed in 1999 to oppose the resort.
But for many here, a bigger concern is Mr. Gitter's purchase and management of the water system that serves the hamlet of Pine Hill, within the Town of Shandaken. He bought the system in March 2000, just as the town appeared close to a deal to buy it from a private owner and shortly after state officials informed his lawyers that the availability of drinkable water would be a crucial element in the resort's environmental review.
A number of local residents and officials, including the area's representative in Congress, Maurice D. Hinchey, have raised questions about how Mr. Gitter acquired the company and have pressured him to sell it to the town. But he has insisted on keeping part of it for his resort -- a stance that infuriates many residents, who say they will be left without an adequate water supply.
"This is unheard of, it's very unethical," said Margaret Loyd, a former mayor of Pine Hill.
Mr. Gitter said private polls he commissioned showed that people in Shandaken and neighboring Middletown supported his proposal. But Mr. Guttman, the town supervisor, said a survey the town conducted last year showed that most residents did not want any resort in Shandaken.
He recalled a conversation several years ago, when Mr. Gitter was planning another development that did not succeed.
"Listen -- what do you hear?" he recalls asking the developer as they stood outdoors. 
"I don't hear anything," Mr. Gitter said.
"That's just it," Mr. Guttman told him. "It's quiet, and that's the way people here like it."

HEADLINE: Jobs, and a City's Revival, Suffer in a Factory's Blaze 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ANSONIA, Conn., May 15 

 BODY:
The Latex Foam Products plant here churned out tens of thousands of pillows, foam mattresses and cosmetic sponge pads every year, a world leader in the pillow industry and a source of pride -- and jobs -- for this struggling blue-collar city.
 "The largest manufacturer of pillows -- it allowed us to lay claim to something," said Claude Perry, the city's economic development officer and, as a resident for 40 years, an observer of the cycles of boom and bust that have visited the Naugatuck River Valley. 
 Today, the factory was a smoldering pile of twisted metal, ash and collapsed brick walls, after a fire on Monday that drove the city's more than 100 volunteer firefighters to exhaustion and rained debris -- some of it containing asbestos -- on neighborhoods downwind from the downtown plant. Most of Latex Foam's 240 employees are out of work, and the Valley, which had shown signs of revival, has suffered a setback. 
"We were just starting to turn a corner," said James T. Della Volpe, the mayor of this city of nearly 19,000 people about 10 miles west of New Haven. In the last few years new stores, a new high school and new businesses moving into vacant factories offered hope for a recovery after years of factory closings in the area. "This is just a major blow," the mayor said.
The plants that studded the valley were once seen as an extension of family, with generations of relatives employed by the same company. Today, community life revolves more around churches and high school sports, particularly football. (The mayor is a former football coach at Ansonia High School.) 
There is not enough manufacturing work left, officials said, to absorb Latex's employees. Many are expected to go on unemployment or seek retraining for other jobs, city officials said.
The fire has left workers like Carmen Gonzalez, 35, in a daze, wondering how she will feed her four children and pay the rent on the apartment they just moved into. 
"I'm not feeling well about this," Ms. Gonzalez said, as she watched smoke drift over the rubble this afternoon as firefighters doused the last of the flames and bulldozers began cleaning up. "I cried all night. Every time I close my eyes, I see the whole thing."
Officials have not determined the cause of the fire, which was fought by firefighters from 12 towns.
Officials with the State Department of Environmental Protection said some debris from the fire contained asbestos, though they said a health risk is usually posed only to those who inhale high levels of the fibers over long periods of time. Still, the agency advised residents to wear gloves and wet any suspicious material before throwing it away, so that fibers do not become airborne. Residents should call the City Health Department to remove any large pieces, officials said.
As Latex Foam officials walked the factory site today, the charred ruins brought to mind the company's origins in a devastating fire a quarter-century ago.
Latex Foam was founded by former workers of the Sponge Rubber Products Company, whose plant at a former tire factory in nearby Shelton exploded and burned in 1975 in what the F.B.I. said at the time was the nation's largest arson case. Eight people were convicted.
The new company, Latex, moved to Ansonia in 1984, occupying a 10-acre riverfront site and, said Peter C. F. DeMarco, the chief operating officer, enjoying good times. It is the only maker of latex mattresses and pillows in North America, Mr. DeMarco said, and is the world's largest producer of latex pillows and cosmetic sponges.
The company had sales of about $50 million last year, he said, and recently signed contracts with Sealy, the mattress company, to supply foam bedding for a new product.
"The company was about to take off," Mr. DeMarco said, adding that its officers would not decide whether to rebuild until discussing its finances with insurers. He said all but about 20 administrative employees would be immediately furloughed.
The city is bracing for the inevitable ripple effect when one of its largest employers closes.
Paul Ciocco, co-owner of Eddy's Bake Shop, a block from the plant, relied on the steady stream of Latex employees.
"That's a lot of people that it brings down here and there really is nobody else," said Mr. Ciocco, whose family has owned the bakery for about 40 years. Mr. Ciocco said he was considering cutting back his staff of 20 part-time and full-time workers. "You've got to survive one way or another," he said.
But Judy Armstrong, who has lived in Ansonia for more than 30 years, showed the grit that many said is a local trademark.
"We're a small town," she said, "but we'll come back."

Weighing Students' Skills And Underlying Attitudes

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMERICANS' low math and science scores are well known. On the 1999 international math and science survey, our eighth graders scored below their peers in almost every other industrial nation that took part.
 Students in Japan and Korea ranked near the top. In math, average American eighth graders would have scored below the 25th percentile in Japan or Korea. 
 But the study also asked students if they liked math and science, thought it important and would want a job using these skills. Here, Japanese and Koreans scored at the very bottom. Only 9 percent of their eighth graders had positive attitudes toward math; only 10 percent felt positively about science.
In the United States, 35 percent felt positively about math and 32 percent about science, more than in almost every other industrial nation.
For 20 years, Americans have tried to remake schools, partly to be more like high-scoring East Asians. A Reagan administration report, "A Nation at Risk," warned in 1983 that America would soon lose its competitive edge to countries with superior schools, like Japan and Korea. Since then, our graduation requirements have been raised, testing has been increased, with severe penalties for failure, and instructional time has grown.
Meanwhile, schools in Japan and Korea have been trying to copy ours. Across East Asia, leaders are trying to reform education so students will know fewer facts and spend less time preparing for tests but, like Americans, be more willing to take risks and more creative in applying what they know.
The Japanese and Koreans also believe that economic survival demands education reform. Jaekyung Lee, a University of Maine professor who studies schools in his native Korea, said Korean employers realized that disciplined and highly skilled workers were not what they needed most. Instead, companies had to develop new products for new markets, and for that, workers unafraid to question authority or take initiative were essential.
A Korean presidential commission in 1994 demanded reform, much like President Ronald Reagan's group a decade before. The Korean commission proposed a de-emphasis of testing, more electives that depart from standardized curriculums and college admissions based more on recommendations and overall high school records than on standardized tests.
In Japan, too, policy makers are trying to relax standards. Recently, the government required new textbooks to reduce content by 30 percent so study time could be cut to encourage nonacademic leisure. And Saturday school has been dropped. Officials hope that with less textbook material to cover, teachers will encourage more student inquiry and initiative.
Teiichi Sato, director of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and a former deputy minister of education, argues that the 21st-century economy requires such reforms. He says Japanese education, emphasizing obedience and standards, is ill-suited to help students adapt easily to the rapid change that characterizes the new economy.
Japanese reform, Mr. Sato said in a recent speech, should inspire "zest for living," a trait he thinks characteristic of Americans but not of his own students. He defined it as "development of abilities to uncover issues, to study and think alone, reach judgments independently and to act and solve problems well."
Japanese officials, Mr. Sato said, no longer attach great importance to students' high rankings on international tests because the exams measure skills valued by the old education system, not the new. A zest for living cannot develop, he added, "under the former style of education in which students simply acquired as much knowledge as possible."
In Korea, as in the United States, the biggest bar to reform is poor teacher training. Dr. Lee said it was hard for Koreans to teach differently from the way they were trained. Many only know how to dictate information for students to memorize. Teachers have not been equipped to show students how to question, try different ways of solving problems or make informed guesses about the unknown.
None of this means American school reform is misguided. Americans may have veered too far from high standards, just as East Asians veered too far from developing the inquisitive boldness they now find lacking. But it is also too mechanistic to conclude simply that the ideal is halfway between these extremes.
The apparently inverse relationship between these nations' rankings on skills and their rankings on love of math and science should certainly be a warning. Can American schools inch up the skills scale without sacrificing their place on the attitudinal scale? Nobody knows which may ultimately prove more important.

HEADLINE: CITING DOWNTURN, FED LOWERS RATES 5TH TIME THIS YEAR 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve continued its campaign to reinvigorate the weakened economy today, cutting its benchmark interest rate half a percentage point for the fifth time this year.
 Suggesting that the worst of the slowdown may still not be past, the Fed said its decision was primarily driven by the deteriorating outlook for businesses, which have been cutting investments in new plants and equipment in the face of declining profits. 
 Today's action reduced the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 4 percent, from 4.5 percent. 
The decision brought the total reduction since the Fed began cutting rates in January to 2.5 percentage points, making this one of the most concentrated efforts it has ever undertaken to reignite economic growth. And the central bank, dismissing any concern that inflation might become a threat, hinted that it was likely to ease monetary policy further at its next scheduled meeting in late June. 
After fretting for several days that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues might limit their rate cut to a quarter percentage point, Wall Street bid up stock prices after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. But prices then fell back and finished flat.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.36 points, to 10,872.97; the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.66 points, to 2,085.58. Page C1. 
The Fed's action was intended to put downward pressure on borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it more affordable for consumers to buy a car or a new refrigerator as well as providing them with some assurance that their own financial situation would not worsen.
That process was under way within minutes, when banks began lowering their prime lending rates to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, a step that most directly affects small-business borrowers but also helps consumers who have certain types of credit cards, auto loans and adjustable mortgages.
Ultimately, the cumulative reductions in the short-term rates controlled by the Fed should have some impact on a variety of loans. But they will have only an indirect effect on the biggest borrowing expense for most people -- mortgages.
Mortgage rates are determined primarily by the bond market's assessment of the long-term economic outlook. And despite the cuts in short-term rates engineered by the Fed this year, mortgage rates have been more or less steady since January, reflecting a calculation by bond traders that any improvement in economic growth prospects could be offset by the risk of inflation.
Today's move came against the backdrop of an economy that appeared to have dipped into a zone of tepid growth just short of recession.
Retail sales rose in April, and consumer confidence stabilized, suggesting that consumer spending, the chief bulwark of the economy, was weathering the slowdown. Companies made progress in bringing their backlogs of unsold goods and supplies into line with reduced demand. The stock market stabilized.
But the economy lost 223,000 jobs in April, the biggest downturn in more than a decade, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent. Industrial production fell again last month.
And most worrying to many analysts, businesses continued to reduce investment spending plans. In doing so, they dragged down a segment of the economy that had been a leading engine of growth and raised questions about whether gains in productivity, the most fundamental measure of the economy's long-term potential, could be sustained.
"The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward," the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement. "This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy."
The federal funds rate -- the Fed's principal short-term rate -- has not been as low as 4 percent in almost seven years, when the central bank finished its campaign to turn around the economy after the recession of 1990-91. The Fed also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve by half a point, to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.
The Fed gave no signal that it saw a need to cut rates again before its next scheduled meeting on June 26-27 but left little doubt that a reduction of at least another quarter-point would be on the agenda.
The Fed emphasized that "inflation is expected to remain contained," an indication that it felt it still had plenty of leeway to cut rates.
And it held to its policy bias toward further rate reductions, concluding that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
Some economists said the Fed had reached a point where it needed to let its interest rate medicine do its work before administering another dose.
Not only does it take at least six months or so for a reduction in short-term rates to ripple through the financial system and into the economy, but Congress and the Bush administration are also working on a tax-cutting plan that would provide some additional stimulus later this year and into next year.
Some economists said they were surprised that the Fed was not more concerned about inflation, given that by most measures price increases accelerated this year. 
They also suggested that further cuts in interest rates might not have the desired effect on capital spending.
While lower interest rates clearly provide a boost to consumers and to interest-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing, they are believed to have only a limited impact on decisions by a business about whether to modernize a factory or upgrade a computer system. Those decisions tend to be driven more by calculations of potential profit and how much capacity is needed to meet expected demand than by the cost of borrowing money.
"The Fed did note that consumption is healthy, that housing is healthy and that inventory adjustment is rapid," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. "Obviously they are concerned about capital spending, which is a legitimate concern. But they can't do anything about it. And what really jumps out is that the Fed says inflation is contained, and it's not."
The Fed also sounded another optimistic note that was questioned by some analysts. Reflecting the view of Mr. Greenspan that huge investments in technology were making the economy fundamentally more efficient, the statement asserted that the underlying trend of improvement in productivity growth "appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects."
Improvements in productivity, or output per hour, mean that companies can pay higher wages or absorb cost increases without passing them along to their customers.
But productivity growth stalled in the first quarter. Economists said that if capital spending remained weak, productivity growth would remain muted.
David Orr, chief economist at First Union, said Mr. Greenspan seemed to have weighed the risk of fueling inflation and allowing productivity growth to ebb and favored promoting productivity growth by jump-starting the stalled expansion.
Mr. Greenspan "believes the path to containing inflation is through productivity," Mr Orr said, "and in order to assure its continued progress, growth and profits are the key."

HEADLINE: California Panel Spells Out Rise in Rates for Electricity 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 

 BODY:
Seven weeks after approving the biggest electric rate increase in California history, state power regulators decided today how to spread the pain, raising rates for the biggest residential users by an average of $85 a month.
 More than half of the residential ratepayers served by the state's two largest utilities will see no increase at all in their rates. But for those who consume the most, the new rates would mean an increase of up to 80 percent. 
 The plan, approved 3 to 2 by the State Public Utilities Commission, affects about nine million customers of the state's two largest utilities, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the Southern California Edison Company. 
The new rates, which will appear on June bills, fill out the details of a $5 billion rate increase that the commission approved in late March in an effort to provide financial relief to the state's utility companies. Today's vote came after a week of intense lobbying by industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential groups -- all trying to influence how the commission would allocate the rate increases.
The average rate increase for all residential customers of the two utilities is 19 percent. But low-income ratepayers and those who use the least electricity will face no rate increase at all.
Residential ratepayers are divided into five tiers, and those in PG&E's top tier -- about 9 percent of that utility's residential customers -- will see electric rates jump to 25.8 cents per kilowatt-hour from 14.3 cents, an 80 percent increase. That translates into an average monthly increase of $85, from $232 to $317.
For Edison's heaviest residential users, the rate increase is 71 percent, or an average increase from $194 to $265 on monthly bills.
Industrial customers of PG&E and Edison face rate increases of about 50 percent, while commercial and agricultural ratepayers will see less significant increases. The increases, which will begin appearing on June bills, will be retroactive to March 27, the day the overall rate increase was approved.
"This is probably the worst economic calamity the state has ever seen," said David Marshall, chief financial officer at Gregg Industries, a 400-person iron foundry in El Monte. "It has got ramifications well beyond anything that we can begin to understand."
Today's vote took place amid the jeers of protesters, who wore tombstone-shaped placards that read, "R.I.P. Affordable Energy."
Commissioner Jeff Brown bellowed back at the protesters: "We cannot walk away from it. We cannot pretend that this is some sort of problem that we can walk away from."
The rate plan approved today was a revision of the plan released by the commission president, Loretta Lynch, last week. Ms. Lynch reworked her plan after a huge outcry from businesses proclaiming that the proposed rate increases would doom California's economy and a critical statement from Gov. Gray Davis. 
Customers of the San Diego Gas and Electric Company and those who buy electricity directly from energy wholesalers like the California university system, are shielded from rate increases.
 --------------------

State's Credit Downgraded
 SACRAMENTO, May 15, (AP) -- A second major credit rating agency has downgraded California's credit, pointing to the energy crisis' increasing drain on the state's finances.
Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on $19.8 billion in state general obligation bonds from Aa3 to Aa2. The agency also lowered the rating on $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa3 to A1.
Last month, Standard & Poors downgraded California's credit and put the state almost at the bottom of its ranking of creditworthiness.
Credit ratings help determine how much states and other borrowers must pay when issuing bonds. The lower the rating, the higher the interest rate the state must pay to attract investors.

EGL, A GLOBAL FREIGHTCOMPANY, TO LAY OFF 950 WORKERS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 EGL Inc., an international freight company whose customers have been hurt by a slow economy, is cutting its United States work force about 15 percent to help trim $30 million in annual costs after an unexpected first-quarter loss. EGL, based in Houston, dismissed more than 450 employees through May 5 and plans to cut 400 more full-time workers, mostly in the United States, the company said. 
EGL employs more than 5,000 people in the United States and 9,000 worldwide and is trimming jobs through layoffs and attrition, a spokeswoman, Heather Fedele, said. EGL said its first-quarter loss was $9.1 million, or 19 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $8.5 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier. EGL expects to save $20 million a year from the job cuts and $10 million from other cost-cutting moves, which include consolidating offices.

HEADLINE: Brown Lungs, Lost Fingers; Now, a Lost Mill 

BYLINE:  By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Ala., May 11 

 BODY:
When it was running wide open, when its workers fed truckloads of 500-pound bales of cotton into its gigantic machines, the mill almost seemed to come alive. It roared, the scarred wooden floors trembled and popped, and tiny scraps of cotton swirled like gnats in the vast, windowless rooms.
 Like something alive, the cotton mill bit and clawed at the people who fed it, and workers who were careless for a split second lost fingers, hands and arms in machines designed to shred and tear. 
 Others, over decades, breathed in so much of the cotton fiber that it ruined their lungs, leaving them wheezing for air in identical mill village houses, or waving from wheelchairs parked on porches in the countryside.
But generations of men and women still lined up to serve the mill, many of them quitting school to take their places beside its machines. "It ain't when it's running that's scary," said Sonny Parker, who is 51 and has worked in cotton mills since he was 16. "It's when it ain't." 
In a blue-collar land where welfare is a dirty word and leaving these green foothills and ancestral graves is as unthinkable as a rocket-ship ride to another world, the Union Yarn Mill in Jacksonville has, for 95 years, offered the workers not only a living but an anchor.
The mill's paychecks financed homes, swing sets and Pontiacs, and made it possible for workers to live in a place where bank tellers ask about their mothers' blood pressure, convenience stores collect money in jars for sick children's doctor bills, and old men still hang dead snakes from the trees to make it rain. And inside the red-brick mill, the machines ran on and on, as if they would never stop.
On May 13, the last of a century's cotton will be processed into yarn and trucked away, the teeth of the giant machines will gnash at workers one last time, and the roar will fade to silence, forever.
Then, the Union Yarn Mill will move the machines to other plants in other towns, 197 men and women will lose their jobs, and a way of life will vanish here, with the closing of a gate.
"I quit school when I was 16, and Mama said either go back to school or go to work," said Smiley Sams, now 43. "My mama worked here. I got nine brothers and sisters, and all but one worked here. I got on Sept. 20, 1974. I don't know nothing else. I've never even filled out an application.
"This is all I've ever done."
It is not just work. It is as if the blood these people shed at their machines, and the fibers they ingested over time -- "eatin' cotton," they call it, with a smile -- have made this mill a part of them and them a part of it, all mixed together, metal, cotton, flesh and bone.
Billy Beal, who is 39 and has worked here for 15 years, lost part of the middle finger on his right hand in the mill, in 1987. "I was out three days, then I was back, running machines," Mr. Beal said.
He earns $11.92 an hour, has reared two children and paid off a house. He misses the end of his finger ("You'd be surprised how much you need that thing," he said), but he is not sure that he would give up 15 years of good money, 15 years of the friendships of people he considers family, for a 10-fingered life someplace else.
"Now," Mr. Beal said, "there's people who will lose everything."
The last week of production has dragged by like a funeral procession here in Jacksonville, a city of 10,000 people. Their mill will not close all at once, but is closing a room at a time, changing the very timbre of the place.
"It just don't sound right," said Randall Johnson, whom everybody calls Possum. "It's always been dangerous, hot, hard and nasty."
Alice Allen's husband, Jimmy, had a heart attack after he heard the news of the closing in March, but he is back at work. Every paycheck is crucial now.
In a company store, where the mill's name-brand clothing sold in a clearance sale for 75 percent off, mill workers bought double armloads of T-shirts and underwear, saying they would put them away and give them out at Christmas if they still did not have work. Then, some of them went to stand by themselves, to cry.

Found Cash Returned
Sonny Parker recently found a purse lying open in the parking lot of one of Jacksonville's grocery stores. "It had a big wad of cash money in it," Mr. Parker said. "Cash. Never seen so much money. Here I am, about to be without a job, can't get no job."
He stood over it a moment, he said, then turned it in at the store.
"I didn't earn it," Mr. Parker said, "so it wasn't mine."
For the mill workers, it is not a matter of searching for comparable work in a nearby town.
"There are skeletons all over Alabama," said Harvey Jackson, head of the history department at Jacksonville State University, just a few blocks from the mill.
The good-paying textile jobs that built many of the towns in the industrial South have been vanishing for decades, as manufacturers improve profits by moving to countries where labor is cheaper. The North American Free Trade Agreement, passed early in the Clinton administration, was a death knell for working people like the millers in Jacksonville.
For years, they feared it, surviving slowdowns and short time and temporary layoffs, bringing home as much as $14 an hour when they did work.
"People came to work sick, people gave their all to keep it open, to keep up production," said Mrs. Allen, who is 54 and has worked at the plant 22 years. "They thought that was their protection."
Fruit of the Loom, which operates the mill, has been in Chapter 11 since December. In March, it announced that it had found an overproduction of yarn and textiles and decided to close the Jacksonville mill.
"An awful lot of pain and suffering," said Wayne Flynt, a distinguished professor of history at Auburn University. "These are proud people. They will not want to be on welfare."
Brenda Bryant, 48, and her husband, Victor, 48, worked at the mill. They are selling their house, to keep the bank from taking it.
The word retraining is tossed around. But the hard facts are that not everyone will become a computer programmer or a real estate agent or get a job at the Honda plant being built in Lincoln, about 30 miles away. "A lot of them won't have the education for it," Professor Flynt said.
Some of them will have to leave, and that cuts worse than any machine. Randall Johnson, 30, said he would study to become a mechanic. But in a local economy glutted with laid-off blue-collar workers, Mr. Johnson is afraid he will have to leave to find work to support his wife and children. "I just want to stay," he said.
The mill has faded in its significance here -- Jacksonville State is the biggest employer -- but in a town where most of the mill workers are second- and even third-generation employees, the mill will always be the center of their existence. These are not people who long to escape from their hometown, but people who hunt, fish, fight, pray and like it here. And sometimes, when they walk out their doors, every stitch of clothing on their bodies is labeled "Fruit of the Loom."

Blessings and Curses
 Mill workers wondered what happened to Leon Spears after he got brown lung, the illness brought on by inhaling cotton fibers.
Mr. Spears retired from the mill after 19 years, when his breathing got so bad he could not work, and vanished to his sick bed. Then, one day last week, the 62-year-old Mr. Spears reappeared on his porch, in a wheelchair, feeling the sun on his face.
"I do pretty good, now, thank the good Lord," he said, but his hand, the one holding his inhaler, shook gently.
To him, the mill was a living, but no blessing.
"It put a lot of bread on the table," he said, "but in the long run, you pay for every piece of it."
The mill opened in 1906, and from the beginning people thanked God for it, then cursed it in the next breath.
Many of its first workers weighed in their last cotton sacks in the field and, the next day, took a job at the mill. It was brutally hot in summer, louder than anything they had ever heard, and safety was an afterthought.
But it was easier than dragging a pick sack along cotton rows without end, so they stuffed wads of cotton in their ears, and endured.
"My granddad lost all his fingers off his left hand, but not his thumb," said Linda Spears, Leon's wife.
Conditions and pay were so bad in the 1940's that the workers hanged the mill's superintendent, W. I. Greenleaf, but only in effigy.
As decades slipped by, conditions improved -- not that it was ever safe, ever easy. But it was always there. 
Debbie Glenn, 48, grew up surrounded by cotton, playing in her daddy's fields. She started at the mill when she was 19.
"You could get a job, if you wanted it," Ms. Glenn said. "I like to work. I got to stay at home. The people I worked with became closer to me than my own family."
Ms. Glenn's job on the machines played out this week, so she went to work in the company store. All day she smiled and chatted with people who came through not only to buy T-shirts but to talk about the mill's history and their connections to it. She smiled at all of them. She is one of those people who smiles all the time, even now.
"Her heart's broke, ain't it," said an elderly woman with a fist full of T-shirts.
"Uh-huh," another old woman said.

New Pontiac
Sonny Parker is a cotton miller because, when he was 16, he wanted a car.
"And there wasn't nobody else going to buy me one," he said.
Thirty-five years later, Mr. Parker lives in a little wood-frame house, which is paid for, and drives a 1983 Chevrolet pickup, which is paid for, too. "My kids never did without nothing," he said.
Others at the mill will lose their houses, he predicts, because their notes are too high to be met by minimum-wage jobs. They will lose cars, bought after mill officials promised them, just a few months before announcing the closing, that their jobs were safe.
The bosses did that, Mr. Parker said, because they knew the millers would work harder if there was hope, as they always have.
He and his wife, Theresa, who is also a mill worker, had just bought a like-new Pontiac Grand Prix, in gleaming red. He wanted to do something nice for his wife. She has brown lung.
"Look at us," Mr. Parker told her, then. "I got you something real nice. We can go anywhere in the world, in that." Or, most likely, they would just drive around town.
Now, they are both looking for work, wondering what they will keep, and lose. As he walked through a quiet room in the mill this week, he wished for the banging of metal, the whirring of gears, for the roar.
All he heard was his own footsteps.

HEADLINE: Building Up Central Europe on a Western Base 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: WARSAW 

 BODY:
Business is good these days, says Eric Rosedale, an American real estate lawyer in Warsaw, as he gives a tour of the many cranes, skyscrapers and empty lots visible from his 20th-floor office at Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
 "This is Saski Park, developed by AIG/Lincoln," a partnership of American International Group, the insurance and financial services concern based in New York, and the Dallas-based Lincoln Property Company, Mr. Rosedale said. "This building is being developed by Golub-Europe," an affiliate of Golub & Company, Chicago-based developers, and GE Capital. 
 A deep breath, then the list continues. Behind a new building for an insurance company is the Atrium business center, a complex developed by Skanska of Sweden. "And the main railway station is going to be replaced by the Zlota Center, a half-billion-dollar development by ING Real Estate" of the Netherlands, Mr. Rosedale said, before moving across the building for still more of the tour.
Poland, like much of Central Europe, is experiencing a building boom led largely by American and Western European real estate developers and investors. Along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, Poland expects to join the European Union sometime this decade.
Experts estimate that 90 percent of the commercial construction in Central Europe is financed by foreign developers. In Poland alone, foreign companies invested $2.5 billion in construction last year.
"We are looking at where are the places that are growing, and certainly Central Europe is going to be growing," said Michael Spies, senior managing director for Europe at Tishman Speyer Properties. Tishman Speyer, based in New York, is developing a one-million-square-foot complex of shopping, offices, hotels and housing in Krakow.
The Polimeni Organization, a developer based in Garden City, N.Y., has begun work on a $15 million, 200,000-square-foot shopping mall on the edge of Konin, a city of 83,000 people 120 miles west of Warsaw. It is expected to open later this year.
Philip Okun, president of Polimeni's international unit, said that unlike mall-saturated Long Island, Polimeni's home base, Poland has ample room for shopping centers.
"We came here and we flipped -- we couldn't believe the opportunities," Mr. Okun said. "There are plenty of cities with enormous potential. Poland is under-retailed."
Poland and its Central European neighbors are also under-officed, under-warehoused and under-residentialed, developers say. And on the larger construction projects, American and Western European developers have an edge: access to big money.
Seven Western-style megamalls have gone up in Prague the last four years, and two more are under construction, each anchored by a hypermarket. Most of the stores are foreign-owned chains, like Tesco of Britain and Royal Ahold of the Netherlands, and the developers are American or Western European.
With such an appetite for modern space, developers say their Central European projects yield a profit margin higher -- by two or three percentage points -- than that of similar projects in the United States.
Western developers also have a network of mainly Western-owned real estate agents and construction firms experienced in building to international standards. They say corruption and red tape in Central Europe are no worse than in most Western cities.
Local concerns have learned how to put up buildings on time and on budget, said Rob McLean, editor of Construction Journal, a Prague-based trade publication, "but in the modern sense of putting deals together, assembling financing, there was no expertise." That is where Western developers with a track record of success have the edge.
Among those helping with the bills is Lehman Brothers. The firm -- with Jones Lang LaSalle, a Chicago real estate services and investment management concern, and the giant construction concern Bouygues of France -- is a sponsor of the $400 million Central European Retail Property Fund, which acquires and develops large shopping malls in the region, $100 million projects of 440,000 to 660,000 square feet each. It is also about to close a $4 billion fund that will probably put part of its money into Central Europe, said Michael Capaccio, an executive director at Lehman.
Even after five years of the building boom, "there is no question there will be a sustained demand for well-thought-out retail," he said.
But for office space, the picture is not quite so rosy. In Warsaw, for instance, office space of 4.9 million square feet is under construction, half of it built speculatively and a fifth of it is unleased, said Darren Battle, Jones Lang's national director for Poland. The vacancy rate, he said, is among the highest in any European capital.
Prime office rents in the city center here fell 12.5 percent last year, to $31.20 to $33.60 a square foot annually, according to Mr. Battle, about the same as the average rate in Berlin.
"We are becoming a mature market with development cycles of overbuild, underbuild and institutional investors buying in," said Brian D. Patterson, managing partner at AIG/Lincoln Polska.
Still, developers and other real estate insiders say, any downturn in the demand for modern commercial space is temporary. In fact, Mr. Battle's research shows that a record number of new leases were signed in Prague, Warsaw and Bucharest, Romania, last year.
"The Warsaw office market is 1.4 million square meters," he said. "In the great scheme of things, that's nothing. But, two years ago it was 700,000 square meters." (A square meter is about 10.75 square feet.)
"Disposable income is forecast to grow," he added, "so in terms of opportunities for commercial property, we are nowhere near where we should be in terms of space."

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart and Home Depot Report Increases in Earnings 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. said yesterday that their first-quarter earnings rose as they kept a lid on costs and lured shoppers with low prices to weather the slowing economy. The J. C. Penney Company swung to a profit after posting a loss in the quarter a year earlier.
 Wal-Mart's earnings rose 4.1 percent, the smallest first-quarter gain in five years. Home Depot, whose profit was forecast to decline, eked out an increase of less than 1 percent. 
 Job reductions, rising energy prices and the slowing economy prompted merchants to contain expenses and sent shoppers looking for bargains on everything from clothes and household goods to home-improvement supplies. 
"Consumer spending appears to be stabilizing at its current levels," Wal-Mart's chief executive, Lee Scott, said in a conference call. "However, hopes for future improvement need to be tempered because of continued layoffs, high gasoline prices and increased utility costs."
Wal-Mart's net income in the quarter ended April 30 rose to $1.38 billion, or 31 cents a share, compared with $1.33 billion, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results matched analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Sales rose 12 percent, to $48.1 billion.
The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., said earnings would rise in the second quarter by about the same pace as in the first quarter and return to a double-digit percentage rate in the second half.
Shares of Wal-Mart fell $2.35, to $52. The company's board increased a stock buyback plan by $1 billion, to a total of $3 billion. Wal-Mart has repurchased $300 million of stock under the first plan, leaving $2.7 billion available for repurchases.
Home Depot's net income in the quarter ended April 30 rose to $632 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $629 million, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 9.8 percent, to $12.2 billion. Analysts had expected the company to earn 25 cents a share, according to First Call.
Profit growth was curbed by lower lumber prices and unusually cool March weather that kept consumers from buying lawn mowers and other outdoor products.
Robert L. Nardelli, who was hired as the company's chief executive in December, has scaled back store openings and focused on customer service and reducing expenses. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, said it would meet analysts' profit forecasts of 37 cents a share in the second quarter.
Shares of Home Depot rose 95 cents, to $50.10.
J. C. Penney had net income of $41 million, or 13 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $118 million, or 48 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Sales at department stores open at least a year rose 1.1 percent in the quarter ended April 28, the first gain in nearly two years. A 12 percent decline in catalog revenue lowered total sales to $7.52 billion from $7.53 billion. Shares of J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., fell 86 cents, to $20.19 after it forecast a loss for the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Verizon Will Seek a Rate Increase for Local New York Calls 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Verizon Communications said yesterday that it would seek approval to raise local phone rates in New York State for the first time in a decade.
 The company wants to raise rates by $1.25 a month for each residential customer, translating into an increase of around 6 percent on the average local bill of $19.93. Verizon, which has grown out of several mergers and takeovers, most recently Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE last year, controls about three-fourths of the state's local market. 
 The plan shows how much more consumers have benefited in recent years from competition in the long-distance industry than in the local phone business, which continues to be dominated by a handful of "Baby Bell" carriers. Since AT&T's monopoly was broken up in the 1980's, rates for interstate calls have declined nearly 40 percent while local rates have climbed more than 60 percent, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
Verizon's proposal comes after allegations that service quality in New York is deteriorating, with union representatives claiming that the company regularly falsified service reports to show improved responses. The New York State Public Service Commission asked the company last month to monitor its reporting procedures more closely.
Bob Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, Verizon's main union, said the increase should not be granted until Verizon "stops lying to state regulators about the quality of its service."
Verizon repeated yesterday that regulators had found no evidence of falsification of reports and said that the rate increase would allow it to improve the quality of basic phone service. The company also said that the increase would provide an additional $100 million in revenue a year, enabling it to make operations in New York more efficient. Verizon's rate of return -- its net revenue divided by its rate base -- is 4 percent in New York, compared with an average of over 10 percent in other states where the company operates.
"I think our customers will understand that the increase we're asking for is much less than the average inflation rate of 2 percent during the last 10 years," said Paul A. Crotty, president of Verizon New York.
Verizon already charges more for basic service in New York than its smaller competitors, according to a study released this month by the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Washington.
A spokesman for the Public Service Commission said yesterday that interested parties could voice opinions on Verizon's request at hearings later this year. If the commission approves Verizon's plan the increases will take effect in January. They would not affect about 500,000 low-income customers who pay as little as $1 a month for basic service.
On the issue of rate increases, Verizon said yesterday that it had repeatedly reduced residential phone charges in New York in the 1990's.
"It's time to bring New York in line with trends in other parts of the country," Mr. Crotty of Verizon said.

HEADLINE: Deere Earnings Miss Quarterly Forecast 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Deere & Company, the maker of heavy equipment, reported a weaker-than-expected profit in its most recent quarter yesterday as the slow economy and wet spring weather hurt sales.
 The company, based in Moline, Ill., said it earned $127.8 million, or 54 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 30, its second, down 37 percent from $204.3 million, or 87 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Sales were steady at $3.8 billion. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn 66 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, and shares of Deere fell $2.49, or 6 percent, to $38.52.
The company told analysts on a conference call that it remained on track to introduce about 100 new products through the end of its fiscal year in October. With those additions, it will have updated or refreshed about three-quarters of its products over the last four years.
The company said it expected unit sales in the current quarter to be down about 11 percent from a year ago, with operating margins under significant pressure.

HEADLINE: Delays Possible for Over-the-Counter Allergy Drugs 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Allergy sufferers who hope that Claritin will soon be available over the counter may well be waiting for many months, if not years.
 On Friday, a committee of experts advised the Food and Drug Administration that Claritin and two other popular allergy drugs, Allegra and Zyrtec, were safe enough to be made available without a prescription. 
 But it is not clear that the F.D.A. has the authority to force the allergy drug manufacturers -- Schering-Plough, Aventis and Pfizer -- to make the products available over the counter.
And even if the government does order the change, the drug companies are almost certain to fight back in court. In fact, at the end of Friday's meeting, Pfizer delivered a 49-page legal brief to agency officials laying out why such a move would violate the companies' property rights and be illegal. 
The advisory committee review of the status of the drugs was requested by Wellpoint Health Networks, an insurance company. Typically, pharmaceutical companies are the ones that ask for permission to sell their drugs without a prescription.
Analysts watching the case say that it is not clear that the Bush administration will even try to push ahead with a process that began during the Clinton administration. They also say that the F.D.A. is unlikely to make any decision until the White House appoints a new commissioner to lead the agency. The post has been vacant since President Bush took office.
But executives at Wellpoint said yesterday that they would continue to press their case.
Dr. Robert C. Seidman, Wellpoint's chief pharmacy officer, said that he planned to call Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, later this week. "I will ask when I will receive an official response," he said.
Dr. Seidman said he met on Monday with staff members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with drug regulation.
Officials at the F.D.A. said yesterday that they could not predict when a decision would be reached.
Laura Bradbard, a spokeswoman at the agency, said that officials were reviewing the advisory committee's decision as well as information on the drugs' safety. The agency must consider each drug individually, she said, and decide whether each is safe enough to be used over the counter.
Ms. Bradbard said the agency had not yet spent much time researching the legal questions associated with forcing the companies to sell the drugs without a prescription. Further legal research will not be done, she said, until agency officials decide whether they agree with the advisory committee that the three drugs are appropriate for sale over the counter.
"It will be a little while," Ms. Bradbard said.
The companies would have full discretion to set prices on their over-the-counter drugs, just as they set prices on prescription drugs. But analysts say the proposal could substantially hurt their profits since prices for over-the-counter drugs are generally much lower than those charged for prescription medicines. The companies are also concerned that the challenge by Wellpoint might establish a precedent that would allow third parties to ask that the status of other drugs be changed, according to industry officials.
The three drug companies have argued that it would be risky for patients to diagnose their own allergy treatments.
"There were a lot of reservations made by members of the committee that we hope will make the agency hesitate," said Lisa Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Aventis, the French company that sells Allegra.
"If the agency moves forward," Ms. Kennedy added, "we would absolutely challenge it."
Without giving specifics, Schering-Plough, which sells Claritin, said yesterday that it planned to press its case that the drugs are inappropriate for over-the- counter use.
Pfizer, which sells Zyrtec, declined to comment yesterday. But in its legal brief, the company argues that under the law, the F.D.A. must have a formal public hearing before it can make the drugs available without a prescription. To do that, Pfizer's lawyers argue, the agency would be forced to disclose confidential information on the drugs that the companies have shared only with the agency. That disclosure, Pfizer argues, would deprive the companies of the use and economic benefit of their property and violate federal law.
Experts are divided on whether the government can force the companies to sell the drugs over the counter.
Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the F.D.A., said that there are several procedures that the agency can use to switch a drug to over-the-counter use. "It appears the F.D.A. has the authority," he said.
But Ira S. Loss, a senior vice president at Washington Analysis, which monitors federal agencies for investors, said that he believed that the agency was uncertain about its legal authority to proceed because it has avoided discussing the issue, even at Friday's meeting.
"The statute does not prevent them from doing this," Mr. Loss said, "but it doesn't say they can either." He continued: "This is unprecedented. That makes trying to determine what will happen next speculative at best."
Dr. Kessler said that the drug companies were trying "to play both sides" with the allergy drugs. He said the companies are marketing the drugs directly to consumers but are now arguing that the medicines should be used only if consumers go to their doctors first.
"If you're marketing directly to consumers, it is one step closer to taking the physician out of the loop," Dr. Kessler said. "I wish it was the safety of these drugs that drove the companies' decisions, but we know it has a lot to do with their business models."

HEADLINE: Nursing Homes Bar the Return of Employees Who Went Out on Strike 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 15 

 BODY:
Striking workers at Connecticut's nursing homes voted on Monday to return to work, but discovered today that 38 of 39 of the privately run homes do not want them back unless they agree not to strike in the future and to accept the loss of some jobs to replacement workers. 
 Those conditions are wholly unacceptable, said Jerry Brown, president of the union, the New England Health Care Employees, District 1199, adding that any nursing home that accepts any workers back must accept all of them back. 
 The impasse, at what seemed the verge of a settlement of the two-week strike, had union officials, nursing home operators and state lawmakers confused, to put it mildly. 
Mr. Brown, the union president, labeled the situation a lockout and blamed not merely the nursing home operators but also the governor, John G. Rowland, who has directed the state to pay $1 million a day for replacement workers. 
By contrast, Kevin B. Sullivan, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, seemed optimistic that today's developments were just a bump in the negotiations. "What happens in the next 48 hours is more important than what happens in the next 4," he said. "I assume over the next couple of days you will see people going back to work." 
About 6,000 nursing aides and maintenance workers walked off their jobs on May 1, demanding increased staffing levels and higher wages. On Monday, District 1199 workers voted to return to work on the promise of top Democratic state lawmakers that they would direct to nursing homes more than the $68 million Mr. Rowland has proposed giving them in the 2002 budget. Democrats like Mr. Sullivan and Moira K. Lyons, the speaker of the House of Representatives, support giving the homes an additional $21 million, with the money earmarked for increased staffing and higher wages. 
Throughout the strike, Mr. Rowland has criticized the union workers as impossible to satisfy. But on Monday, the governor welcomed the union's decision to return to work as "a positive development."
Then today, faced with the new conflict, he said through a spokesman that he should play no major role in bringing nursing home owners and union officials to consensus.
"It's really an issue now between the nursing home union and the nursing homes," said Dean Pagani, the governor's press secretary. 
Mr. Brown, the union president, accused the governor of "continuing the collusive behavior to try and destroy or weaken our union and to try to undercut our campaign for better staffing and better patient care." Mr. Brown added that "we do not have an agreement with a single nursing home" to return to work, although one in New Haven is still negotiating to allow the union workers to return.
But the union faces the loss of hundreds of jobs. Federal labor law allows employers who are the object of a strike based on economic demands, like the wage increases sought by District 1199, to hire permanent replacement workers until strikers offer unconditionally to return to work, said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies at Cornell University. 
That seems to be what is happening at Roncalli Health Care, which owns 7 of the 39 nursing homes and said today that it had already permanently replaced 244 workers out of more than 600 union workers.
In addition, Deborah Chernoff, a District 1199 spokeswoman, said the union had received similar threats from at least two corporate-owned homes, Kindred Healthcare and Mariner Health Group, which combined employ about 1,000 workers.
Mr. Hurd, at Cornell, said these nursing homes and others "would be able to keep those workers on and not call back all the workers who have offered to return." Federal law, he said, is "friendly to employers in terms of replacing workers." 
Marc S. Ryan, Governor Rowland's budget director, said the state had the legal right, but was not obligated, to continue reimbursing nursing homes hiring out-of-state replacement workers. What the governor will do is still undecided, Mr. Ryan added, and depends on a number of factors, including how many nursing homes eventually refuse to allow union workers to return and when those homes' contracts with the Denver-based company providing replacement workers expires. 
But Mr. Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, said the governor considered any lockout situation part of an ongoing strike and would continue to support giving financial assistance to nursing homes hiring replacement workers.

HEADLINE: A Better CO2 Rule 

BYLINE:  By Susan Tierney; Susan Tierney, an energy and environmental consultant at Lexecon Inc., was assistant energy secretary for policy from 1993 to 1995.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
President Bush has endured an outpouring of criticism since repudiating his campaign promise to battle global warming by regulating carbon dioxide. For a way to address the environmental issue without compromising his concerns about energy supply and costs, the president should look to Massachusetts.
 In late April, Governor Jane Swift issued a rule requiring the six major coal- and oil-fired power plants in Massachusetts to meet stringent new air emissions standards by 2008. The standards cover major air pollutants that cause acid rain, smog and soot -- as well as carbon dioxide. Power plants must limit carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to 10 percent of what generators have been discharging in the state, but the plants have freedom in how they do it. They can switch fuels, change generating technologies or trade emissions reductions credits with other power plants. Or, significantly, they can invest in "off system" reductions, like lowering the output of carbon dioxide from other industries or from trucks and buses, or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees. 
 The reductions must be analyzed, measured and verified to ensure that they really occurred and wouldn't have happened anyway.
The Massachusetts regulations will lead to real carbon dioxide reduction. But they don't mandate reducing the use of coal or making high-cost technical changes all at once, and they won't disrupt the reliability of electrical supplies. Instead, the Massachusetts rule will prompt a private-sector chase for the lowest-cost reductions over the next few years.
Governor Swift, who has drawn far more attention in the press for being pregnant with twins, has made Massachusetts the first state to put in place broad and deep cuts in air emissions from older plants. Illinois, North Carolina, New York and New Hampshire are trying to find ways to do the same. Nationwide, there are about 500 older coal and oil plants, some built as early as the 1940's, that do not have to meet modern emissions standards. These plants pollute at four to 10 times the rate of even a new coal plant built today, let alone a clean new gas-fired plant or a renewable energy facility like a field of windmills or solar panels. If Governor Swift's rule were applied nationwide, not only would carbon dioxide emissions be reduced, but smog, acid rain, soot and haze originating from power plants would drop by 75 percent.
By putting requirements on its own plants, Massachusetts has also moved beyond the tired old argument in which the Northeast states say most of their pollution comes from the Midwest, while the Midwest claims that the Northeast is simply promoting power-plant rules to gain an economic edge. Now the burden falls on the Midwest and Congress to follow, promoting wider and more broadly effective clean-air legislation.

HEADLINE: New Bill on Patients' Rights Is Both Hailed and Criticized 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
President Bush warmly endorsed a new bill defining patients' rights today, but the legislation was immediately attacked, for different reasons, by Democrats and Republicans, health insurance companies and employers.
 The chief sponsor of the bill, Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said he had drafted the legislation to satisfy criteria set forth by Mr. Bush in February. 
 Mr. Bush hailed the bill. "It provides strong patient protections for all Americans, ensures that doctors and patients make medical decisions and holds health plans accountable by providing patients with meaningful remedies when they have been wrongly denied medical care," Mr. Bush said. 
But Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican who has championed patients' rights, denounced Mr. Frist's bill as a sop to the insurance industry. "If it is brought up in the House, I will personally exhaust every effort to defeat it," Mr. Norwood said. "This bill protects health maintenance organizations, not patients."
Mr. Frist, who is a heart surgeon, described the measure as "a centrist proposal." It would, he said, cover all Americans with private health insurance. The bill would give patients a limited new right to sue H.M.O.'s in federal court, if health plans refused to abide by the decisions of independent medical reviewers.
Injured patients could recover damages to reimburse them for lost earnings, medical expenses and related costs. But the bill would prohibit punitive damages and would limit verdicts for pain and suffering to $500,000.
Most Democrats support a patients' rights bill introduced by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and two Democratic senators, John Edwards of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. This bill would create a much broader right for patients to sue H.M.O.'s in state court, with no limits on damages for economic losses or pain and suffering.
Senator Kennedy and other Democrats denounced Mr. Frist's bill. "The liability provision makes a mockery of fair play, is designed to roll back patient protections and inappropriately federalizes issues that should be heard by state courts," Mr. Kennedy said.
Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Norwood, a dentist, said Mr. Frist's bill would severely constrain the right to sue, undermining victories won by patients in recent court cases.
The current law is changing even as Congress debates the issue. In the last few years, federal and state judges have allowed patients to sue health plans in situations where such lawsuits were once futile. Last month, for example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that an H.M.O. could be held liable, under state medical malpractice law, for a decision involving questions of medical treatment and eligibility.
Mr. Frist tried to enlist other senators as co-sponsors of his bill, but won only two endorsements, from Senators John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont.
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader of the Senate, criticized Mr. Frist's bill, saying it would trample on the states' power to regulate insurance. 
"I have vigorously opposed the federal government taking over regulation of health care plans," Mr. Nickles said. "That's a serious expansion of federal power into an area that has been the prerogative of the states. I don't think the federal government has the capability."
Mr. Nickles said Mr. Frist "has moved significantly to the left of where most Senate Republicans were" on the issue of patients' rights. In the process, Mr. Nickles said, Senator Frist lost Republican support without gaining any significant support from Democrats.
Many states have already enacted laws to define patients' rights, though the laws vary from state to state. Under Mr. Frist's bill, a federal advisory board would review state laws to see if they complied with federal standards.
Mr. Nickles said that even the limited right to sue allowed in Mr. Frist's bill could drive up health insurance costs, forcing some employers to drop coverage.
"Health costs are already rising 12 to 13 percent a year," Mr. Nickles said. "The economy is soft, and you have a lot of people being laid off. Let's not do anything to make it worse."
The Health Benefits Coalition, which represents employers and insurers, said the Frist bill "opens up the health care system to new lawsuits that will drive up costs." Lawyers could sue for economic damages in federal court while simultaneously pursuing claams in state courts, the coalition said.

HEADLINE: Finance Panel Moves Tax Plan Toward a Senate Vote 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Legislation that would lower the taxes of all Americans who owe income taxes cleared the Senate Finance Committee tonight, moving it one more step toward enactment.
 The measure contains the essence of the tax package President Bush campaigned for last year and proposed to Congress this year as his top legislative priority. 
 Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said he hoped the Senate would pass the bill this week, work out differences with the House of Representatives next week and have the measure ready for the president's signature before Memorial Day.
Both houses of Congress approved budget resolutions last week that ensured that the biggest tax reduction in two decades would become law, giving the president a strong political victory. The only remaining questions involve details. 
In the Finance Committee today, 4 of the 10 Democrats joined all 10 Republicans in favor of the measure. With the Senate divided 50 to 50, the Democratic support in the committee essentially guarantees the bill will be approved by the Senate without significant change.
But because the House has already passed its tax cut measures, the final answer on important details like what the top tax rate will be and how quickly some of the cuts will come will be decided in the Senate-House conference committee. The tax cut measures approved by the House are even closer than the Senate measure to what the president proposed.
One of the Democrats on the Finance Committee who sided today with the Republicans, Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, called the measure "affordable and balanced."
"In a time of peace," Mr. Torricelli said, "it is simply wrong that 20 percent of gross domestic product is paid in federal taxes."
The other Democrats who crossed party lines were Max Baucus of Montana, John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. James M. Jeffords of Vermont, a Republican who often breaks rank on fiscal issues, stuck with his party this time.
The Senate bill would give almost all income-tax payers a tax cut this year of at least $300 for single people and $600 for couples. That would be accomplished by reducing the tax rate to 10 percent from 15 percent on the first $6,000 of taxable income for individuals and $12,000 for couples. The lower taxes would be reflected in smaller amounts withheld from workers' paychecks. The House is expected to go along with this.
In addition, the tax credit for each child would be raised to $600 from $500 this year. So a couple with two children would get a total tax reduction of $800. ($600+$200=$800.)
Beginning next year, tax rates would be reduced across the board, with the top rate falling to 36 percent from 39.6 percent and the other tax brackets above the 15 percent bracket reduced by 3 percentage points each.
Many Democrats on the committee were scathing in their criticism.
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia called the bill a "profoundly wrong course" that "eviscerates the revenues of the federal government."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said the measure depended on a large budget surplus that would not materialize, unfairly benefited the wealthy and drained money from the government that would be needed to pay for the retirement of baby boomers.
An amendment offered by Mr. Daschle to lower the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent was rejected on a 10-to-10 party-line vote. In committees, amendments must command a majority to be approved.
Republicans also expressed dissatisfaction, complaining that the top tax rate should be reduced at least to 33 percent and saying they were holding their noses while voting for the bill. "The bill we have before us is way too timid of maximum rates," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader.
But a coalition put together by the Finance Committee chairman, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, and the committee's top Democrat, Mr. Baucus, resisted all challenges.
For example, a proposal by Mr. Rockefeller to delay the reduction in the top tax rate until Congress approved prescription drug coverage under Medicare was rejected, 12 to 8, when Mr. Baucus and Mr. Breaux voted with the Republicans.
The committee broke precedent by debating and voting on the legislation in public. In years past, the Finance Committee has generally closed itself off in back rooms to deal with tax bills and has emerged only to vote on the final product.
In addition to the rate reductions, important provisions would lower taxes for married couples, raise the tax credit for children in stages until it reaches $1,000, increase the size of estates exempt from taxation and repeal the estate tax entirely in 2011, allow a $5,000 deduction for college tuition payments, increase the amount of income exempt from the alternative minimum tax and give more favorable tax treatment to pensions and retirement programs.
The measure would also offer important new assistance to low- and moderate-income families with children. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute that studies how government programs affect the poor, calculated that a couple with two children and income of $20,000 would get a benefit of more than $2,000.
The president did not propose this relief for low-income families, and many Republicans oppose it. So it is unclear whether it can survive the House-Senate conference.
To fit the entire package within the $1.35 trillion allotted in the budget for tax reduction over the next 11 years, the writers of the legislation had to make a number of modifications in Mr. Bush's proposal. For instance, the lower taxes for married couples, a popular part of the Bush proposal, would not go into effect until 2006.
The tuition deductions would expire after 2005, and the higher exemptions from the alternative minimum tax would expire after 2006. These provisions are so popular that Congress would almost certainly extend them, but if there had been no expiration date, the cost of the bill would have exceeded $1.35 trillion.
The biggest maneuver is probably the delay in the repeal of the estate tax until 2011, a step that reflects not only the need to hold down the cost but also the political ambivalence of lawmakers about voting for a tax cut that affects only the very wealthiest taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Another Cut by the Fed 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve yesterday reaffirmed its strong commitment to averting a potential recession. The central bank, led by Alan Greenspan, cut the federal funds rate by a half-point for the fifth time this year. The rate, a key benchmark for short-term borrowing costs in the economy, is now 4 percent. Significantly, the Fed indicated in its statement announcing the move that it stands ready to cut rates even further because economic weakness remains a larger threat on the horizon than does inflation. It is worried about the decline in capital investment and corporate profits, weakening conditions overseas and the possible effect of stock market losses on people's behavior. 
 The Fed's aggressive efforts to encourage spending by consumers and businesses come at a time of heightened economic suspense. Though slowing down, the economy's longest uninterrupted expansion is now in its 11th year. Businesses have sharply cut back their spending, but consumers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of a declining stock market and news of layoffs. In April, a month when the production of industrial equipment dropped, retail sales were stronger than expected. Consumer confidence actually rose, despite an increase in unemployment. 
 The challenge for Mr. Greenspan and his fellow Federal Reserve governors is to bolster consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, thereby staving off a recession until businesses can once again ramp up their capital investment. The five rate cuts, which lowered the cost of borrowing more abruptly than at any other time during Mr. Greenspan's tenure, are aimed at encouraging consumers to stay the course, and at hastening the recovery of corporate investment. On this last point, the Fed noted approvingly the "significant reduction in excess inventories." 
Still, the fear remains that people may begin to follow businesses' lead in reining in their spending, before companies are able to bounce back. "The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward," the Fed said in a statement, before expressing concern over the "effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption."
Though it now seems likely that the Fed will cut rates again, barring a dramatic turnaround in coming weeks, we must be approaching the end of Mr. Greenspan's treatment. Rates can go only so low. The Fed has done its part. To keep the expansion on track in the second half of the year will take a recovery in corporate profits.
Meanwhile, if Congress wants to help bolster public confidence in the economy, it should insist that President Bush's proposed tax cut be distributed in a less regressive manner, so as to make a bigger difference in the lives of lower- and middle-income workers. And if it is to have any of the supposed stimulative effect, the back-loaded plan now before Congress should be adjusted to get money more quickly to those consumers.

Scenes from the selling of the tax cut:
 January 2001: The White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey argues that George W. Bush's tax cut -- not interest rate cuts -- is the right solution to the economic slowdown, because the tax cut has a "much bigger heft." Economists are puzzled by the attempt to sell a long-term tax cut as the answer to a short-run economic slowdown, especially given the fact that most of the cuts proposed by Mr. Bush wouldn't take place until the second half of the decade. Later, when Congress passes a budget resolution authorizing $1.35 trillion in tax cuts, administration allies try to eliminate language requiring that $100 billion of that total be reserved for immediate tax breaks to stimulate the economy. They would prefer to use the money for tax breaks for high-income families, even though those breaks will not phase in fully until 2006. 
 March 2001: President Bush declares that "nationwide there are more than 17.4 million small-business owners and entrepreneurs who stand to benefit from dropping the top rate from 39.6 to 33 percent." A press release from the Treasury Department seems to back him up, declaring that "it is evident that at least 17.4 million small-business owners and entrepreneurs, many of whom currently pay at the 39.6 percent rate, stand to benefit from the president's tax relief plan." Economists are puzzled, since only about a million taxpayers have any income taxed at the 39.6 percent rate, and most of those are not small-business owners. Independent estimates suggest that only about 1 percent of small businesses would receive any benefit from a cut in the top rate, giving a new meaning to the term "many." 
 May 2001: Mr. Bush is asked what his administration plans to do in the face of high gasoline prices. "Let me say it again, see if I can be more clear," he replies. "To the Congress, who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices: 'Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible.' We've set aside $100 billion to help consumers with high energy prices. That's the quickest way to help consumers. I am deeply concerned about consumers. I'm deeply concerned about high gas prices. To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers, pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible." Economists are puzzled, since the poorest families, who are most affected by the gasoline price spike, will receive no tax cut under the Bush plan. Also, that $100 billion that Mr. Bush says he has set aside "to help consumers with high energy prices" is the short-term tax cut that his Congressional allies tried to eliminate from the budget resolution.
 June 2001: Soaring electricity prices cause hardship for many families and small businesses in several parts of the United States. Mr. Bush continues to insist that there are no short-term solutions to energy problems, that the answer is to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. However, he adds that his tax relief package will help families afford electricity, or buy candles and propane lamps.
 July 2001: Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out in the United States, and spreads rapidly. Mr. Bush denies that the outbreak calls into question planned cuts in the Agriculture Department budget. The best answer, he argues, is broad tax relief, which will help farmers buy new animals, help consumers pay higher food prices and allow housewives to take courses in vegetarian cooking. 
 August 2001: Adverse weather conditions and lax pollution regulations lead to severe air-quality problems in Houston, which during Mr. Bush's governorship took the lead from Los Angeles in ozone pollution. Mr. Bush denies that the pollution is a warning sign for his production-oriented energy policy, and argues that his tax cut will help alleviate the problem, by giving families the money with which to pay for air filters, respirators and medical care.
 September 2001: Critics pan the new fall television lineup, describing it as "must-avoid TV" and calling it the worst set of new programs in decades. Mr. Bush declares that he is "very concerned" about the deteriorating quality of broadcast entertainment. He urges TV viewers to support his plan for tax relief, which will provide families with money they can use to subscribe to HBO, allowing them to watch "The Sopranos."

HEADLINE: Helms and Lieberman Seek to Aid Dissidents in Cuba 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Seeking to shift the United States' policy toward Cuba, two influential senators, backed by the largest Cuban exile lobby, will introduce legislation on Wednesday to send $100 million in aid to government critics and independent workers in Cuba during the next four years, Congressional officials said.
 The bill's sponsors, Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, say their goal is to provide government opponents in Cuba with the tools they need to subsist and continue their work. 
 The legislation would authorize the president to send cash, food, medicine, telephones, fax machines and other items to nongovernmental groups in Cuba, which would then distribute the aid. The plan would mark the first effort by the United States to provide direct support for Cuba's internal opposition, though advocates did not say how they would overcome obstacles that its government is certain to erect. 
Cubans eligible for the assistance would include political prisoners and their families, dissidents or repatriated refugees, independent economists and journalists and members of religious groups. The bill would also seek to funnel resources to independent libraries or agricultural groups in Cuba and alter the American trade ban to allow some self-employed Cubans to market their products in the United States.
Supporters of the legislation said they were modeling their approach on American support for the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980's.
The bill, titled the Cuban Solidarity Act of 2001, is the first major legislative proposal by hard-line critics of Mr. Castro in five years. In 1996, Mr. Helms cosponsored the Helms-Burton Act, which established harsh penalties for foreign businesses that invested in Cuban properties claimed by American companies and exiles.
In a statement prepared for delivery on Wednesday, Mr. Helms said the United States must seek out new tools beyond the four-decade-old American trade ban to end President Fidel Castro's "stranglehold" on the Cuban people.
"With enactment of this legislation the United States government will move beyond merely isolating the Castro regime," the statement said. "Indeed we can undermine Castro's isolation and oppression of the Cuban people by finding bold, proactive and creative programs to help those working for change on the island."
But critics said the American aid would never reach the proper recipients in a tightly controlled society and might actually complicate the work of Cuban human rights advocates and dissidents by allowing Mr. Castro to brand them as puppets of the United States. 
"Wasting taxpayer dollars on monies that Fidel Castro will make sure never get into the hands of average Cubans when we could be doing something truly meaningful to foster democracy is unfortunate," said Senator Christopher Dodd, the senior Democratic senator from Connecticut.
The legislation represents a change for the Cuban American National Foundation, the anti-Castro lobby, which for two decades focused on maintaining economic pressure against Castro and occasionally dismissed internal dissidents as his pawns.
"What we'd like to do is change the debate a bit," said Dennis Hays, the foundation's executive vice president. "The argument should not be about our embargo. It should be how do we promote peaceful, democratic change in Cuba."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES; 
Gasoline Prices Said to Have Bush Weighing Quicker Action

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
President Bush's energy plan, to be released tomorrow, will focus on long-term solutions for problems that the administration contends have been long in the making. But with public anger mounting about rapidly rising gasoline prices -- and Democrats intent on scoring political points -- the White House is beginning to weigh quicker fixes as well, according to industry experts close to the administration.
 A range of responses is available to Washington, the experts said, though each poses its own set of headaches. 
 Experts said the administration was divided about the causes behind the steep and sudden rise in gasoline prices, which might make it hard to fashion a plan to dampen prices. One group within the administration, which oil industry experts say includes Lawrence Lindsey, the President's chief economic adviser, and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is said to think that the administration should pressure the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise production. OPEC has reduced its daily output about 9 percent since the start of the year, which has helped keep crude oil prices $25 to $29 a barrel, and in turn, kept gasoline prices high. The cartel is meeting in Vienna on June 5. 
"The underlying problem has always been crude oil," said Jay Hakes, until recently the head of the Energy Information Administration, the statistical unit of the Energy Department. "If they did something for June, it would have an immediate impact on the oil futures market."
But petitioning OPEC would represent an embarrassing reversal for the administration, which so far has been reluctant to pressure the group. 
Another camp, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, contends that gasoline prices are high because of limited refining capacity in the United States. "A big part of our difficulty today with respect to gasoline prices doesn't have anything to do with the price of crude," Mr. Cheney told Reuters in an interview yesterday. 
A third approach to increasing supply quickly might entail releasing crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as the Clinton administration did to offset high heating oil prices last fall. But given the Republican outcry then, such a step by the Bush team seems unlikely. "The problem they have on both of these issues is that they were so critical of Clinton on things that ended up making a lot of sense that it would be hard for the administration to come back to them," Mr. Hakes said. 
Current gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, are still lower than they were in 1981. Many industry officials and analysts think that prices may have peaked. But the sharp rise this year has put pressure on the administration to act. In two months, prices rose 29 cents and reached an average of $1.71 a gallon a week ago, according to the Energy Information Administration. Even those experts who say that prices will not rise further acknowledge that the balance between supply and demand is so tight that any problem that affects supply, like a pipeline break or refinery shutdown, could drive up prices once more.
Gasoline supplies are further constrained by variations in the types of cleaner-burning fuel that different parts of the country are required to use. Those differences make it hard for one region to import fuel from another if supplies run short. 
The administration could waive some requirements this summer for the use of the cleaner-burning, or reformulated, gasoline. But most states seem unwilling to go along with a softening of pollution standards, and people close to the administration said the White House itself had decided against such a move.
The administration could also step into a patent fight within the oil industry that has limited production of cleaner-burning gasoline, said Philip Verleger Jr., an independent oil industry consultant. Unocal holds patents for some kinds of blending methods of reformulated gasoline. But many oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, the nation's largest refiner, have refused to pay what they say are high licensing fees to Unocal to use the gasoline blending methods. That has limited how much gasoline some refiners can produce.
"Under the Environmental Protection Act of 1973, the White House can ask Congress for licensing of the patents for products that are environmentally important," Mr. Verleger said. "People can start making gasoline; they don't have to pay so much to Unocal, and you would get more gasoline."
But such a move, Mr. Verleger said, would be highly controversial -- perhaps more so than the high gasoline prices themselves.
In the end, industry experts said, the administration may ultimately adhere to the position that the president and vice president have staked out since last year's campaign -- that the complex knot of factors that have helped drive up gasoline prices will take time to unravel.

Warning Lines of Laser Light May Improve Airport Safety

BYLINE:  By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
MOST frequent fliers are all too familiar with the stop-and-go traffic of airport taxiways and the frustration that can set in while the plane waits in line to take off. But while the wait can be tedious for passengers, it is a time when the pilot has to be alert and pay careful attention to the various pavement markings and lights that lead to the runway. 
 The instances when pilots miss the hold lines that keep them from entering active runways -- errors called runway incursions -- are being reported more frequently as airports become more crowded, aviation experts say. 
 To help guide pilots more effectively, Greatland Laser, based in Anchorage, is developing a laser device that enhances the painted lines pilots see as they taxi. Most airports mark runways and taxiways with red, green or yellow painted lines and often with incandescent lights that are flush with the markings. 
The Greatland device, which is about the size of a shoe box, takes a laser beam and shapes it with lenses to project lines of light above the painted lines. 
Jim O'Meara, president of Greatland Laser and a pilot himself, said the lack of lighting at many of Alaska's airports had inspired him to design the system. "There were times," he said, "when I'd have to rely on someone going out to the runway and igniting a coffee can stuffed with toilet paper and diesel fuel 40 minutes before my approach."
The device can emit red, green or yellow lines, which are the colors used to mark things like hold lines and stop bars, analogous to yield signs and stop signs for car traffic, and restricted areas. It is being tested by the Federal Aviation Administration's William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City.
To project a line of light across a typical hundred-foot-wide runway, two of Greatland Laser's devices are positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the runway so that they are each sending a beam across. The beams from the laser devices, each of which runs on three C batteries, are about 14 inches above the runway surface; each beam stops when it is blocked by a shield on the laser device on the other side.
The developers of the laser lighting system say it is a more economical way to light the runways because the lasers are located above ground and do not necessitate the digging and wiring used for the in-ground lights. 
"If you were going to create lines in a conventional way, it would cost something like $60,000 a line," said James Lynch, a senior vice president at Science and Engineering Associates, which is building the units with Greatland Laser. "We can project a line without disrupting the runway for roughly a third of that."
Unlike painted runway markings, the lasers have the advantage of being visible during bad weather. When it snows, rains or becomes foggy, the line of laser light illuminates the flakes or droplets, creating what Mr. O'Meara calls "a three-dimensional wall" that is easily seen by a pilot.
"Our line markings are painted on," said Dano Bollman, airport manager of the Wiley Post-Will Rogers Memorial Airport in Barrow, Alaska, "so they're usually covered by a layer of packed ice and snow by late September. A laser-light marking system looks like a way to alleviate that problem because it will shine on the surface regardless of the ice pack." The airport may decide to test the laser-light markings this year.
One goal is to make it easier for pilots to see the hold line, a double yellow line that alerts pilots to stop and wait before they approach the runway. According to the F.A.A., hold-line infractions by pilots accounted for 84 of the 140 runway incursions reported this year. In most airports, the hold line is indicated by two painted lines with incandescent lights on either side that turn on and off in alternating patterns.
"The flashing yellow lights can be confusing because there are so many other lights on the runway and in the background," Mr. O'Meara said. "We're trying to do away with the distracting movement."
Although Greatland, Science and Engineering Associates, and other companies involved with the project are working to develop a yellow laser line to enhance the painted hold lines, yellow laser light is expensive to produce because of the cost of materials. Both red and green laser lights have come down in price over the years as they have become more widely used, but producing a yellow beam requires the mixing of red and green light, so yellow laser light is essentially double the cost of red or green light.
There are still some technical problems to work out for the airport laser-lighting system. One issue is how thick the marker beam should be for a pilot to see it. The device is currently designed to emit a 75-milliwatt laser beam that is one inch wide. To a pilot seated 10 feet off the ground in a small plane at a distance of 150 feet, that beam would appear to be only 0.7 inches thick, which is not acceptable to aviation experts assessing the device.
"When you're approaching that narrow of a line from a perpendicular angle, it tends to disappear," said Jim Patterson, an airport safety specialist for the federal aviation agency who is overseeing the research and testing of the Greatland Laser product. "We're trying to help them find the right power laser and the right combination of optics to produce the line we're looking for. It's not ready for airports yet, but it's a very valid concept that's worth pursuing."
Until laser technology advances to the point where the line can be widened without diminishing its intensity, Mr. O'Meara's proposed solution is to line up two or more lasers on each side of the runway to increase the beam's width. The F.A.A.'s technical center will continue to test the lasers in coming months at Atlantic City International Airport.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Andrew Solomon; 
Showing The Demons The Door

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE son of a pharmaceutical fortune, Andrew Solomon, a writer, is living proof that money can't buy happiness. His latest book, "The Noonday Demon," to be published by Scribner in June, is as its subtitle states, "An Atlas of Depression," including three life-strangling episodes of his own.
 For a person who is, for now, the only serious historian of a sickness that disables more people in the United States than any other -- 28 million Americans are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Prozac -- Mr. Solomon and his problems make an incongruous pair. 
 As dapper as his drawing room, Mr. Solomon invited a reporter into his house recently. The house, a 28-foot-wide, five-story brownstone on a prime block off lower Fifth Avenue, where Mr. Solomon, 37, lives alone with his staff of two, was rebuilt and refurbished five years ago by Robert Couturier, a French architect, in a large-scale style that could be called "Student Prince." 
With its silk brocaded sofas, doges' lanterns, Russian paintings, polar bear rugs and Chinese dragon robes, the house is a principality that exists in storybooks only -- part Eastern Europe, part Lubitsch's Hollywood. 
A historical landmark because Emma Lazarus, the poet, lived there, Mr. Solomon's house, in the blue plaque on its facade, quotes the sonnet also inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." Ironies are not lost on Mr. Solomon. He enjoys them, like good dinner party anecdotes.
Wearing a burnt-tangerine windowpane-checked linen and cashmere blazer, beige suede trousers, brown Gucci boots, a shirt unbuttoned low on the chest, a leather-thong necklace, and with a gold ring in the shape of an alligator coiling on his finger, Mr. Solomon, accidentally observed admiring his appearance in a pier mirror inside the front door, greeted his guest in the drawing room and led him upstairs to a rooftop garden for a talk, his golden retriever, River, at his side. 
He passed several people as he ascended -- the citizenry of Mr. Solomon's world. (When asked, the close-friend count numbered 50.)
"That was Ethan Hawke's mother, by the way," he said, stepping onto his terrace. Leslie Hawke, in a Peace Corps project, is working with a group of Romanians who are studying the homeless here. The Romanians were staying in the house.
Recalling his depression in "The Noonday Demon," Mr. Solomon writes, "One day, seven years ago, hell came to pay me a surprise visit," a turn of events unleashed, he thinks, by his mother's death. Carolyn Solomon, whose ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989, planned her suicide in the terminal stage of her illness with her two sons, David and Andrew, and her husband, their father, Howard. That morning, she made the tea and muffins to keep the pills down: 40 Seconals. Forty-five minutes later, she was dead. The last thing she told Andrew, as he cried at her bed, was, "Enjoy what you have." Clearing out her effects, he pocketed the Seconal she hadn't swallowed. He was 27. Three years later, he was trying to kill himself, not with pills but with "economical" trips to a park in London for sex that he hoped would infect him with H.I.V., as he writes, because he wished to die from terminal illness like his mother.
Mr. Solomon is well now, though he argues in his expansively researched book, which uses his own experience as a point of departure for a much wider discussion of the subject, that depression recurs. It is inexorable, like life when you choose it, he believes. Mr. Solomon takes five medications daily: Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Topramax and BuSpar. He speaks regularly with both a psychiatrist and a psychopharmacologist. He tested negatively, again, for H.I.V. last month. 
The author of "A Stone Boat," a novel, and "The Irony Tower: Soviet Artists in a Time of Glasnost" and a regular contributor to magazines like The New Yorker, where the article that became "The Noonday Demon" appeared, Mr. Solomon has called depression his "big career break." He received a $1 million advance for the book.
"I certainly think it's possible that I'll change my mind at some stage, and kill myself; I refuse to make any promises on that score to anyone," he said. Mr. Solomon sat by a bed of tulips under an evening sky as blue as his eyes. Wide and oceanic in expression, part of which is dilation from drugs, part of which is his absorption in things, Mr. Solomon's eyes are those of a man continuously looking out to sea.
Depression produces emotional requirements of a home that happiness and health don't. In extremes,home is like the skin -- either the edge of safety or the thing you claw out of, unable to inhabit the identity it represents.
Sensitive to settings as much as situations, Mr. Solomon during his sickness alternatively hid in his own house, retreating to his bed, or escaped to his father's apartment, too weak to wash.
Howard Solomon, chairman of Forest Laboratories in New York, a pharmaceutical company valued at $12 billion, introduced antidepressants like Celexa, which now competes in sales with Prozac, because of a sudden urgency to help people like his son.
"He became interested in antidepressants, in part, because he had seen how effective they were for me," said Mr. Solomon, who dedicates his book to his father, "who gave me life not once, but twice." He credits his illness with having brought them close. The elder Mr. Solomon fed and bathed his son when Andrew became too disengaged to take care of himself.
"I'm very proud of my father," Mr. Solomon said, in a second interview. "He's an entirely self-made man. He grew up waiting on milk lines in the Bronx. His great love was always music, and he got a job when he was 13 selling librettos at the old Met because he loved opera. Now, he's chairman of the City Ballet and on the board of the opera."
When depression gripped him in 1994 -- in his book, Mr. Solomon describes it as a tree being choked by a vine -- he was living in a loft on West 15th Street, designed as an elaborate disguise against the reality of being a boy who was losing his mother.
"I was coming back to New York from London because my mother was dying, and I had a nervous breakdown there," he said, chin tilted, hand to his throat. "It was a place that looked rather glossy on the surface -- it was quite chic looking, barren and austere -- and nothing in it worked, including me. When I got it I wanted to be really tough, and live downtown. I got some sadistic-looking metal furniture in Berlin, and that was all the furniture that I had. And I bought a leather jacket. I didn't get any tattoos because I thought they'd age badly. But, I was in the mood."
Mr. Solomon's second psychological storm hit during the move into the house where he lives now.
The imposing house, bought in what he described as "a weird estate sale" was a ruin -- not the best roof to put over your head when you're depressive.
"It was falling down," Mr. Solomon said. "I didn't want to be here. Everything I owned was in boxes. Everything was filthy. There were construction people everywhere. I had a hateful housekeeper who was trying to make me miserable, who actually subsequently wrote me a letter and said that she'd been having a nervous breakdown at the time."
Mr. Solomon rode it out -- adjusting his medications, staying again with his father, stripping his obligations to a skeletal list and disappearing.
Amy Fine Collins, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, and a friend of 11 years, said: "You'd leave messages. It was like he'd gone out of town."
Five years later, the new house was home -- a fairly perfect reflection, Mr. Solomon found, of himself.
"Bigger than life, enthusiastic, imaginative, a lot of fun," he said, when asked how. "A little over the top, sometimes slightly ridiculous, a little bit affected but mostly in a forgivable way, occasionally self-important, and at the same time reasonably decorous."
"A mixture of rather wild and solid and bourgeois," he concluded. When met with agreement, he laughed. The elegant Mr. Solomon's laugh keeps him honest -- he brays loudly.
"There is a certain form of theatricality that the house's scale lent itself to," said Mr. Couturier, the architect, who has known Mr. Solomon for 13 years. "He's of a different era, because of his dandyism. He finds that quite amusing. But no one wanted to pretend to live here the way they lived in 1882."
There are 250 bronze door knobs by Allegra Hicks, an English designer, who is a friend of Mr. Couturier's and now Mr. Solomon's, that look like large serpent's eggs. The Chinese wedding bed in the master bedroom was designed by William Sofield, in a modernist mandarin manner, based on scrolled-cloud panels Mr. Solomon bought at a flea market in Beijing.
Elizabeth Zeschin, an American photographer based in London, who stays with Mr. Solomon in New York, said: "Andrew's feels like home to me. It just does, because it's him -- it's so Andrew. The contemporary art and the beautiful antiques are put together in a way I've never seen anywhere else, and I've photographed a lot of homes."
Mr. Solomon, whose last depression was in 1999, precipitated when a lover left unannounced for a monastery, is happy here, too. He receives friends, publicly, in the grand rooms downstairs. He retreats to privacy above. The house, behind its heavy black door at the street, could be moated, for all the intrusion it allows.
"I feel as though I close that door, and I'm safe and unassailable," he said, shaking his visitor's hand to depart for a dinner engagement, then walking out and leaving him behind in the house. 
In his book, Mr. Solomon quotes Jay Gatsby -- an inevitable personal comparison, but like most inevitable comparisons, Mr. Solomon tends to get to them first.
"I tried very hard to die," Gatsby says, weary with wisdom, "but I seemed to bear an enchanted life."

HEADLINE: Mexicans in the U.S. 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Census Shows Big Gain for Mexican-Americans" (news article, May 10), an immigration expert says welfare rates are higher among Hispanic immigrants. 
 The 21 million Mexicans living in the United States work, pay taxes, receive few benefits and fuel certain sectors of the American economy. 
According to the Department of Labor, three-fourths of all farmworkers in the United States are Mexican-born, and earn an average of $5.95 an hour.
Today, many Mexicans live below the poverty line because they perform jobs that Americans do not want or that pay too little, a fact that is the driving force behind several bipartisan proposals in Congress to give them worker rights.
Knee-jerk reactions to Mexicans' condition in the United States are not merely offensive. They are outdated.

Baseball's in a Sad State: Stars Shine (in the U.S.)

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 12 

 BODY:
From steel to supercomputers, for decades the Japanese have compulsively measured themselves against the United States, and professional baseball has been one area where people here have always thought their country comes up short.
 But now that the best Japanese players are increasingly showing they can compete in the American major leagues, Japanese professional baseball is suddenly wondering if it can survive the competition with American teams for talent. 
 The breakthrough this season of Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners and Tsuyoshi Shinjo of the New York Mets, the first nonpitchers from this country to play in the major leagues, has been celebrated here by extraordinary fan interest and pride. So much so, in fact, the television audience and ballpark attendance for Japan's professional teams have taken a sharp hit. 
After weeks of quiet observation of this disquieting trend, Japan's baseball establishment and some fans have been groping for an answer. 
Tokyo Sports, a daily newspaper, recently reported that executives of the Nippon Television Network had issued a secret order to the channel's sports program directors to play down highlights of major league games.
The network, a member of the same corporate family that owns Japan's richest and by far most popular and successful baseball team, the Yomiuri Giants, denied the report. 
"There has been no such order," said Tomoyasu Koibuchi, a spokesman for the network. "Regarding the major league games, there is an issue of copyrights."
For avid fans, the best evidence of something strange afoot was the absence on the network of any mention of a May 3 game in which Hideo Nomo of the Boston Red Sox, a Japanese pitcher well established in the major leagues, and Ichiro faced off for the first time in the United States. The game took place two days after a Yomiuri Giants game drew an 11.6 percent viewer rating, the low for the season. The average ratings for the team in April were the worst for the month in five years.
The duel between Nomo, who pitched a no-hitter earlier this year, and Ichiro, a former batting champion in Japan and one of the American League's top hitters so far this season, was the talk of Japan all that week and was the lead item on most sports programs and in the pages of this country's newspapers. Their performance, together with that of Shinjo of the Mets, has usually been the lead item of most sports news programs throughout the season.
A recent sports news broadcast by the state-owned NHK network was typical. It began with taped highlights of the three players and then the announcer said, in a deadpan that only reinforced the feeling that it was an afterthought, "and now we turn to Japanese pro baseball."
Broadcasters and sports editors say, apparently with reason, that the prominence they are giving to the exploits of the expatriate players merely reflects the interest of the fans. But for many who have spent their lives in or near the Japanese professional game there is a feeling that rankles: that after decades of autonomous development this country's teams may suddenly be turning into yet another American farm league of sorts.
"Sooner or later, I have no doubt that Hideki Matsui will say he wants to go to the major leagues," Shigeo Nagashima, the Giants' manager wrote ruefully in a recent essay in the Asahi Shimbun about the team's star outfielder. "I am sure that he thinks he can play in the majors because Ichiro is doing so well. However, Matsui represents Japanese baseball, and if he goes it will be a problem for professional baseball. Even though I somehow want to let him go, I want him to stay in Japan, because heroes are an important part of sports."
Some say the loss of stars like Ichiro hits especially hard because the collapse of the country's economic bubble 11 years ago, after a decade of almost euphoric prosperity, and the ensuing drift and decline have left people with few heroes and little to cheer. And the current stagnation and financial decay in Japanese baseball mirror what has been taking place in the society at large, as well as Japan's sense of relative decline vis-a-vis America.
"Japanese baseball will decline as top players drain away to the U.S. because as businesses the teams cannot continue to exist unless they maintain their popularity," said Takinori Emoto, a member of Parliament and former pitcher with the Hanshin Tigers. "By copying the U.S., the salaries of players here have been skyrocketing, but many teams are running deficits, and some of them may not be viable. Unless some kind of agreement is reached between the U.S. and Japan for the good of the game and for mutual benefit, it is inevitable that Japanese pro baseball will be hurt."
Major league owners in the United States also complain about high player salaries and some say they are losing money, but they are not losing stars to Japan.
Comments like Mr. Emoto's echo American proposals for managed trade of popular Japanese exports like autos and televisions that have frequently vexed relations between the countries in the past.
But not everybody is filled with gloom about the future of Japanese baseball. Just as many economists say that Japan's prolonged recession is the price of heavy regulation and widespread protectionism, some critics of the game say that competition from the American major leagues is just what Japanese baseball needs to revive itself.
"This new phenomenon should lead to a higher level of baseball, which will draw more fans and encourage better management of the teams," said Toshi Saeki, a professor of sports sociology at Tskuba University. "People will try to create regulations, but we can't stop the trend of top players going to the States. Rather, we should encourage Japanese players to go when they are young and come back to Japan when they are mature."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up; Home Building Rises 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose less than expected last month, and home construction in April rose for the first time in three months, government reports showed today.
 The Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent in April, compared with the forecast of a 0.4 percent rise, according to the Labor Department. The core index, which excludes energy and food, increased 0.2 percent for a second consecutive month. 
 April's rise in prices came after an increase of 0.1 percent in March. Decreases in clothing and computer costs were offset by a rise in prices of energy, particularly gasoline, and tobacco.
The index is increasing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, compared with a 4 percent pace in the first four months of 2000.
The bright spot in the economy, housing, continued to show resilience last month. Builders started new homes last month at an annual pace of 1.609 million units, up 1.5 percent, the Commerce Department said. Starts had fallen 2.3 percent in March, to a pace of 1.586 million units. Analysts had expected starts to decline 0.8 percent in April.
Economists say mortgage rates that are the lowest in two years, a record pace of new-home sales and a record backlog of orders are keeping builders busy.
"The economy will not go into recession if the housing market remains strong," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "The housing market remains strong."
The reports came a day after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by half a percentage point, to 4 percent, the fifth reduction this year. Growth from October to March slowed to an annual pace of 1.5 percent, the slowest six-month period since a 1.1 percent rate in the first half of 1995.
Starts of single-family homes rose 6.7 percent in April, to a rate of 1.288 million units, after falling 6.3 percent in March, and were up 1 percent compared with starts a year earlier. April starts of multifamily homes fell 15 percent, to an annual rate of 321,000 units, after rising 13 percent in March.
Building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 2.5 percent, to an annual rate of 1.587 million units, after falling 2.2 percent in March. Permits for single-family construction rose 0.7 percent after falling 1.5 percent the previous month. 
April housing completions rose 4.7 percent, to an annual rate of 1.533 million units.
Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged about 7 percent during the first four months, the lowest since early 1999. The rate climbed to a five-year high of 8.64 percent in mid-May of 2000. The rate reached 6.89 percent in March, which was the lowest since April 1999.

Real Issues Of Governing Get Back Seat

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
BEFORE we are distracted by another scene from the war of the municipal roses, or another inspection of a sunny island, a pause to consider what our elected folk are not doing.
 While Gov. George E. Pataki was raising campaign dollars in California earlier this month (after making his crucial fact-finding, fund-raising trip to Vieques), he was not negotiating the state budget, now 46 days late. 
 That sounds like a technicality, but there is an elaborate minuet in Albany, where passing a budget is a little like getting engaged. No engagement, no wedding. No budget, no action on legislation. 
So, the effort to soften the state's harsh Rockefeller drug laws is on hold, despite general agreement to change them. The State Assembly, which has shied away from amending the laws in the past to avoid looking soft on crime, now says it's ready to act (it's not an election year).
But four months into the legislative game, there's no Assembly bill yet to answer the governor's version, and while Albany fiddles, nonviolent people convicted of low-level drug offenses sit in prison, and more people are headed there.
Others can't get their day in court.
Promised reforms of the dysfunctional system of providing legal counsel to the indigent is also stalled. The state-set fees that haven't increased since 1986 -- $40 an hour in court, $25 an hour for case preparation -- have caused a lawyer shortage, gumming up the works in family and criminal courts. Emergencies and cases that could endanger a child are covered, said Joseph M. Lauria, administrative judge of the city's Family Court. Otherwise, there are serious delays -- in moving children out of foster care, in reuniting families, in resolving custody claims, in dealing with domestic violence.
Last February, Mr. Pataki and lawmakers named a panel led by the state's criminal justice coordinator, Katherine N. Lapp, to study the system. Since that system has been around almost 40 years, you'd think it wouldn't need exhaustive study.
You might also think that Mr. Pataki would get more exercised about the turmoil in the courts. He was so outraged about a case in 1996 that he successfully championed the ouster of a criminal court judge. The judge had released a three-time felon who then killed his former girlfriend. But that case got a lot of publicity and involved an innocent woman. This involves the uninfluential poor.
Caroline A. Quarteraro, Ms. Lapp's spokeswoman, said "there's really nothing to report as of this particular time."
Same could be said of labor negotiations in New York City, where the mayor has been rather distracted lately. Just over half of city employees are still working under expired contracts. Just yesterday, Randi Weingarten, the head of the teachers' union, said the new contract should be resolved by June 5 or go to nonbinding arbitration; otherwise, she said, there will not be enough time for a ratification vote or for the schools to hire enough teachers by September, to compensate for a shortage.
Ms. Weingarten is clearly putting pressure on City Hall, trying to move talks forward before the city budget is locked up by July 1, and before the economy softens enough to endanger a handsome pact.
STRATEGY aside, there is indeed a shortage, which the union blames on low salaries that encourage retirements, discourage applicants or fail to hold teachers lured to higher paying suburbs.
Actually, suburban competition is not that problematic. Out of 78,000 city teachers, the Board of Education recently estimated that only 1,100 a year leave for the suburbs; Sol Stern, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, puts the figure closer to 150.
Whatever the precise number of departures, the shortage exists, though it's not across the board. It's worse in poor neighborhoods and in certain disciplines, including math and science, and could get worse in two years, when, under state rules, all public school teachers will have to be certified. That will make recruiting the best-qualified teachers even more competitive.
The Citizens Budget Commission recommends paying more to people who teach in areas and subjects where there are shortages. Sensible, but hardly likely.
The increases will clearly be sizeable across the board, on equity grounds alone, and the union will clearly have to make concessions. In other words, a tough negotiation, however you cut it.
But when? In the meantime, how many good teachers will get away? And how many more petty criminals will be consigned to prison cells because of bad law? How many more indigent New Yorkers will do without decent counsel in court?
Ask our busy leaders.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stock Indexes Rise Sharply, Perhaps on Tame Consumer Prices

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks posted strong gains yesterday, a day after the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 11,000 for the first time since September.
 Investors hoping for more rate cuts were cheered by new indications that inflation remained under control, and gains in the bond market suggested that investors were not afraid that long-term interest rates might continue their recent rise. 
 The strong advances across many sectors of the stock market yesterday surprised some analysts because the major indexes were little changed on Tuesday, even after the Fed had cut short-term rates by half a percentage point. 
"When I got in this morning, I didn't think it was going to be that good of a day," said Francis D. Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. Mr. Gannon said he thought that the Dow industrials' move above 11,000 would be "really psychologically important for the market."
At the close, the Dow was up 342.95 points, or 3.15 percent, at 11,215.92. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 80.86 points, or 3.88 percent, to 2,166.44. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 35.55 points, or 2.85 percent, to 1,284.99. Advancing issues widely outnumbered those declining.
Strong trading volume of more than 1.4 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange seemed to indicate that institutional investors had endorsed the Fed's latest effort to revive the economy and consumer spending. But analysts warned that the stock gains would evaporate if those efforts did not in time revive corporate profits.
"Can you expect that the impact will be sustainable?" said David Henwood, chief investment officer for Raymond James & Associates. "It would be nice to think yes, but I know the business news is going to be bad for another couple of quarters."
Among the hazards, the economy is burdened with volatile and increasing energy prices, further layoffs and rising long-term interest rates. Consumer confidence has fluctuated wildly in recent months.
But the Labor Department reported yesterday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in April after a 0.1 percent increase in March. Economists had expected the index to rise more steeply, by 0.4 percent. Excluding food and energy costs, the index was up 0.2 percent in April, matching the previous month.
Within an hour of the announcement on prices, the Dow, which had opened down slightly, began a steady climb that would involve all its sectors and build momentum all day long. Among the 30 stocks in the blue-chip index, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose $7.95, to $125.50; Johnson & Johnson climbed $2.69, to $99.77; and United Technologies rose $3.73, to $82.90.
Elsewhere, Cisco Systems, a battered technology giant, advanced $1.26, to $20, on trading of nearly 89 million shares. Other technology leaders rose, too.
Many investors seemed to be buying stocks yesterday simply because they were rising, Mr. Henwood said. But if inflation were to reappear or consumers to flinch, he said, any optimism about earnings could quickly disappear, and in that case "maybe we haven't seen the lows in equities."
Several more companies provided evidence of how corporate earnings had weakened as the economy slowed. After the market closed, Hewlett-Packard, a Dow component, reported that its earnings fell 66 percent in the second fiscal quarter, while still exceeding Wall Street expectations that had been cut by more than half. The company's chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina, said revenue might fall this quarter. Still, shares of Hewlett-Packard, which rose $1.34, to $26.74, in the regular session moved up further after hours, to $28, according to Instinet.
Federated Department Stores, the owner of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said profit from operations fell 3.4 percent, but those results surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Shares of Federated gained $2.29, to $46.38. The company attributed the lower earnings to weak sales and steep discounts and said it expected to meet earnings forecasts for the rest of the year.
Analysts said that even if the Fed succeeded in reviving spending and the job market without touching off inflation, it would be at least six more months before corporate earnings revived.
"Perhaps it is true that the economy is starting to brighten," said Brett Gallagher, vice president of Julius Baer Investment Management, "but what's priced into the market is 18 percent earnings growth next year, and I don't see how we're going to get that."
Bond prices benefited from the benign inflation news. In late trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32, to a price of 96 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.45 percent from 5.50 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32, to 93 10/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.85 percent from 5.91 percent.
Since an intrasession rate cut by the Fed on April 18, bonds have sold off sharply as traders worried that the Fed's aggressive path might cause inflation to surge.

HEADLINE: New Drug Plan Shifts Focus in Latin America 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
After criticism that American anti-narcotics policy in South America relies too heavily on military aid to Colombia, the Bush administration proposed a more regional approach today that would emphasize economic development and cultivation of legal crops.
 The new program does not cancel the $1.3 billion program, known as Plan Colombia, to help the Colombian military battle narcotics growers and traffickers, But officials said the new aid would not allow Colombia's security forces to acquire additional military equipment or finance a greater role for the American advisers in Colombia beyond what is provided in the existing program. 
 The new package, which still must be approved by Congress, would effectively reorient United States counternarcotics spending in Latin America, providing $882 million to seven countries over several years. And it would strike an equal balance between drug interdiction efforts and addressing the social and economic conditions that give rise to drug production. 
Administration officials conceded that the change in spending priorities resulted in part from criticism in Congress and the news media of the Clinton policy to give the bulk of the anti-narcotics funds to Colombia for military aid. Under that program, the United States pledged to provide 16 Blackhawk helicopters and to train and equip three counternarcotics battalions in the Colombian Army. 
Skeptics of Plan Colombia have voiced fears that the United States might be drawn into a protracted military conflict as Colombia struggles with two guerrilla insurgencies and right-wing paramilitary groups in addition to drug traffickers. The critics also worried about the Colombian military's poor human rights record and warned that the American-backed military incursion into southern Colombia could force the combat and corruption to spill into other nations.
"We heard all of the criticism and comments of the past year," said William Brownfield, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. 
Under the initiative, Colombia would still be the largest recipient of American aid, receiving $399 million, or 45 percent. But about half of that money would go to programs of the United States Agency for International Development to reform the judicial sector, improve the efficiency of local governments and induce farmers in the south to shift to legal crops.
The administration's package, which is to be parceled out over several years, calls for spending half of the money on security assistance -- including interdiction and eradication efforts -- and half on economic and social development, Mr. Brownfield said.
The package includes aid for Washington's traditional drug war allies: Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. But it also includes $26.1 million for Brazil and $20.5 million for Panama, both of which have increasingly seen their border areas used by Colombian guerrillas and traffickers. Bolivia is scheduled to receive $143.5 million and Ecuador $76.5 million.
Peru stands to receive $163.7 million for social programs in addition to $77 million in security aid. About one-third of the development spending would be put toward reducing poverty by helping small businesses and improving health services.
The government of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is to receive $10 million in security aid. Mr. Chavez, an ardent nationalist, has irritated American officials by refusing to allow their anti-narcotics flights to overfly his nation.
Even as he extolled the new approach, Mr. Brownfield said the Bush administration remained committed to Plan Colombia and its military objective to force drug-financed rebels into peace negotiations. He acknowledged that the United States was able to turn its attention to support for regional development and crop substitution largely because it had already financed the "big ticket" items Colombians required. Some analysts suggested, moreover, that the initiative might reflect Colombia's limited capacity to absorb the American aid already in the pipeline. Still, some drug-policy experts who had criticized the Clinton administration's emphasis on military spending welcomed what they said was a more comprehensive approach that addresses the problems underlying drug production and seeks to bolster Colombia's neighbors.
"This seems to be an appropriate investment in these neighboring countries to resist this spillover effect," said Stephen Flynn, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a critic of Plan Colombia.
Juan Orduz, a spokesman for the Colombian Embassy in Washington, said the money would help the government of President Andres Pastrana integrate areas in Colombia, like Putumayo Province, that have long been marginalized by the central government and become a major source of drugs. 
"This fight is not only a matter of eradicating and interdicting drugs," he said. "You must give farmers a livelihood and the means to take their products out of the region."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Layoffs at Agencies; Economy Is Cited

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
In more signs of the slowing economy, two agencies laid off employees on Tuesday.
 McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, laid off 35 to 40 employees, or about 3 percent of its staff of 1,300. 
 Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman at McCann-Erickson, confirmed reports of the layoffs in the online editions of Advertising Age and Adweek and attributed the layoffs to budget cutbacks of clients and the state of the economy. The layoffs came from all parts of the New York agency, she said, including its media arm, Universal McCann.
And Frankel in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe, laid off 30 employees, or about 4.5 percent of its staff of 660. "Everybody's cutting their budgets," said Liane Adduci, a spokeswoman for Frankel, confirming a report in the online edition of Advertising Age, adding that there was also "not as much new business coming in as we expected." The layoffs, she said, came from all departments, almost all from the Chicago office.

HEADLINE: The Search for a Hofstra Sophomore Becomes a College Murder Case 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., May 16 

 BODY:
For the last three weeks, Max B. Kolb's family scoured his favorite haunts, taped up posters and gave radio interviews, pleading for help in finding Mr. Kolb, a Hofstra University sophomore who had suddenly vanished, his dorm-room door papered with notes from friends: "Max, where are you? You weren't in class" and "Max, give me a call."
 Today, an unwelcome answer came, as the authorities in Nassau County announced that they had arrested and lodged murder charges against a friend of Mr. Kolb's, a 23-year-old fellow sophomore, after finding Mr. Kolb's body buried in the yard behind the suspect's oceanfront apartment in Long Beach this morning. 
 The details only got worse. The police said the suspect, Shaun T. Alexander, a banking and finance major from an affluent suburb of Atlanta, had used a kitchen knife to stab and partly dismember Mr. Kolb, 20, an honors student from Kingston, Mass., after Mr. Kolb rejected his sexual advances in a Hicksville motel. 
Word of the arrest, days before Sunday commencement exercises at this liberal arts college of 13,000 students, stunned the campus, turning a quiet afternoon during final exam week into a scene of turmoil as news crews descended with their cameras and questions. Students gathered in classrooms, dorms and meeting halls to try to make sense of the disturbing events and to pray for Mr. Kolb's family.
"The campus is shaken," said David N. Franklin, an assistant professor who taught Mr. Kolb in his Introduction to Film Production class. "I don't think everybody has even absorbed the impact of what has happened. It feels pretty bad right now, but I am sure it is going to get even worse."
Although their investigation is continuing, detectives and prosecutors said Mr. Alexander killed Mr. Kolb before dawn on April 25 in Room 102 at the EconoLodge Motel on Old Country Road in Hicksville, less than 10 miles from the Hofstra campus.
Detective Lt. Frank Guidice of the Nassau police said that Mr. Alexander lured Mr. Kolb to the motel by telling him he had a problem he needed to discuss with him privately. A security camera at the Estabrook Hall dormitory, where Mr. Kolb lived alone in a single room on the 10th floor, caught him leaving the dorm about 1:30 a.m., moments after a cell phone call from Mr. Alexander's red 2000 Land Rover was placed to Mr. Kolb's room, officials said.
It was the last trace of Mr. Kolb's life, as activity on his A.T.M. and credit cards suddenly ceased and the normally diligent student, a film and communications major, failed to show up for classes.
When his father and stepmother, Thomas and Diane Kolb, arrived for dinner with Mr. Kolb that Saturday, April 28, from their home in Wellesley, Mass., they found his dorm room empty and the notes from friends stuck to the door, the police said. His door was locked, his car was found parked nearby, and a computer check showed that he had last used his university meal card for dinner on April 24, said Michael B. DeLuise, a university spokesman.
The break in the case came about a week ago, Lieutenant Guidice said, when an anonymous caller to the police Crime Stoppers hot line said Mr. Kolb was seen getting into Mr. Alexander's Land Rover on April 25. The police said they secured a search warrant for the vehicle on Monday and took Mr. Alexander into custody on Tuesday.
In videotaped statements, prosecutors said, Mr. Alexander told them where the body was buried, behind a brick backyard barbecue at 539 West Park Avenue in Long Beach, where he had recently rented an apartment facing the Atlantic Ocean with money from his father, an investment banker. There, in a shallow grave, wrapped in plastic bags and a tarp, was Mr. Kolb's partly dismembered body.
"It was the most disturbing murder scene I have been to in my 22 years," said Fred Klein, chief of the major-offense bureau in the Nassau district attorney's office. "We are looking into whether he committed any other similar types. He denied it. He was very methodical and violent for a first-time offender."
Mr. Klein said Mr. Alexander told the authorities that after his advances were spurned, he became very angry with Mr. Kolb.
The police said Mr. Alexander kept the body in three different places: first in his Land Rover for seven days, then for five days in a public storage space he had been renting on Stewart Avenue in Garden City, and finally in his backyard.
Today, at Mr. Alexander's arraignment, where he was ordered held without bail, Mr. Klein said prosecutors had documents, photos and witnesses showing that Mr. Alexander was the last person seen with Mr. Kolb. Mr. Klein said the police had recovered what they believed was the murder weapon, a steak knife, from a knapsack in Mr. Alexander's apartment.
Eric W. Naiburg, Mr. Alexander's lawyer, would not comment on the case. He said his client's parents, Gerald and Cynthia Alexander, were on the way to Long Island from their home in Dunwoody, Ga., where neighbors described them as quiet people, with a daughter also away at college.
"He has never been in a jail before," Mr. Naiburg said of his client. "He looks to me to be a very unlikely candidate to be charged with a crime like this. He appears to be, contrary to the allegations, a very gentle soul."
Mr. DeLuise, the Hofstra spokesman, said that Mr. Alexander was disciplined for a fraternity prank in 1998 and that he later filed a civil lawsuit against the university. The case was thrown out, though Mr. Alexander was appealing that decision, Mr. DeLuise said.
The police said Mr. Alexander had completed only 51 credits since he began attending Hofstra in September 1996, while most students finish 120 credits -- the number needed for graduation -- in four years. 
Stuart King, 23, a former classmate at North Springs High School, in Georgia, remembered Mr. Alexander as "kind of a nerdy dude" who gave a big party in his senior year, even though he seemed not to have many close friends. "His parents had a lot of money," Mr. King said in describing the party. "They catered it."
The police said Mr. Alexander and Mr. Kolb became friends several months ago. "But I wouldn't describe them as good friends," said Lieutenant Guidice of the Nassau police. "We are still looking into how close of a relationship they may have had."
As night approached at Hofstra University, and counselors and chaplains were on hand to speak with distraught students, many described Mr. Kolb as a quiet, likable young man who had recently produced a short film, a love story called "Blinding Heather," and who loved to travel by train to Manhattan to try to get into the studio audience at the "Late Show With David Letterman."
"He was a gentleman, and he was very funny and he was really sweet, and I loved him," said Laura Fu, 21, a member of Entertainment Unlimited, a school club.
Ms. Fu said she helped Mr. Kolb's parents, who are divorced, as they searched for their son. "The last three weeks have been like a nightmare," Ms. Fu said. "I am glad to have closure, but I never imagined or wanted it to end this way."
Mr. Kolb's stepmother said he had two older brothers. "Max was a wonderful young man," she said.
His mother, Lisa Kolb, had planned to hold a news conference this morning to announce a $5,000 reward. But it was canceled and she returned to her home in Kingston, Mass., by evening. The voice message on her phone was addressed to her son. "Max, honey," it said. "Please call and let us know you are all right, sweetie. We love you."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Education: Teacher Salaries Are Said To Lag Behind Inflation 

BYLINE:  By Jodi Wilgoren (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The average teacher salary rose 3.2 percent from 1998-99 to 1999-2000, to $41,820, less than the 3.4 percent rate of inflation, a survey by the American Federation of Teachers shows.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Jobless Rate Falls 

BYLINE:  By Alan Cowell (NYT) 

 BODY:
Three weeks before a general election, Britain's jobless rate was reported to have fallen to a 26-year low of 3.2 percent in April from 3.3 percent in March. And the slowing growth of wages and inflation suggested that the Bank of England might follow the United States Federal Reserve in a further reduction of interest rates. The data was more good news for Prime Minister Tony Blair, already well ahead in opinion surveys. Alan Cowell (NYT)

 New Zealand's central bank cut a major overnight lending rate to 5.75 percent from 6 percent, the third rate cut in nine weeks. 
In easing monetary policy, a New Zealand Reserve Bank governor, Don Brash, left, noted the slowing economies of major trading partners, including Australia, Japan and the United States. The central bank expects low inflation, Mr. Brash said. "However, other outcomes that are less benign -- in either direction -- can be easily envisaged, which would require more vigorous monetary policy responses," Mr. Brash said. Becky Gaylord (NYT)

HEADLINE: Toyota's Net Surges 16% Despite Slowing Economies 

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 16 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that its earnings rose 16 percent in the year ended March 31, as strong sales and aggressive cost-cutting helped the company overcome the impact of slowing economies in its main markets.
 Toyota, the world's third-largest automaker, easily surpassed its Japanese rivals, reporting earnings of 471 billion yen ($3.8 billion) -- the highest annual profit in the company's history -- compared with 407 billion yen ($3.3 billion) the previous year. Sales rose 4.2 percent, to 13.4 trillion yen ($108 billion). The results exceeded analysts' forecasts. 
 Tadaaki Jagawa, Toyota's executive vice president, said his company's recent focus on younger drivers and cost-reduction efforts had paid off. "Our success in shortening development time, serving young car drivers' tastes and cost-cutting have enabled us to markedly improve our earnings power," he said. 
Mr. Jagawa pointed in particular to brisk sales of the Tundra truck and Sequoia sports utility vehicle in the United States. "These locally manufactured vehicles are gaining favor there," he said. 
Sales in North America rose 6.4 percent from a year ago, to 4.96 trillion yen ($40 billion) for the year. Operating profit surged 25.5 percent, to 206 billion yen ($1.7 billion).
Europe, however, was a weak spot. It reported an operating loss of 23 billion yen ($186 million), much wider than its operating loss of 8.8 billion yen ($70 million) the previous year, as the cheaper euro eroded profitability even though sales volume increased. Mr. Jagawa said he did not expect the European unit to turn a profit until 2003.
Global sales of vehicles increased 7 percent, to 5.52 million for the year. In Japan, Toyota sold 2.32 million vehicles, up 6.7 percent from the previous year, while overseas sales rose 6.6 percent to reach 3.2 million. Toyota expects to sell 5.59 million vehicles worldwide this year. 
The sales gains came as Toyota overcame a reputation for stodgy models for middle-age drivers by introducing models like the Vitz, a compact with a European design; Will Vi, a car with a pumpkinlike shape; and bB, a boxy minivehicle. The new design push, which began about two years ago, started to pay off handsomely this year, and was largely responsible for the gains in Japan.
To enhance its ability to respond to market demands quickly and flexibly, Toyota has shortened the time needed to develop small vehicles like the bB to 12 months, company officials said.
Toyota's outperformance amid Japan's sluggish economy is remarkable. Its closest rival, Honda Motor, reported last month that its group net profit had slipped 11.5 percent from a year earlier, even as sales rose to record levels. Toyota officials said it had a domestic market share of 43.1 percent.
Toyota's results were announced after the stock market in Tokyo closed. Earlier, shares of Toyota fell 1 percent, to close at 4,030 yen ($32.63). In New York, its American depository receipts, each representing two shares of the company, rose 55 cents, to $67.15.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The wealth of nations depends on how open they are to international trade.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com

 BODY:
STUMPING last week for expanding free trade, President Bush added a fresh argument to the usual promises of new markets for American goods and services. He called free trade a "moral imperative" essential to economic and political progress. "When we negotiate for open markets," he said, "we are providing new hope for the world's poor."
 That's true both directly and indirectly. Economists have been explaining the direct advantages of trade since "The Wealth of Nations," by Adam Smith, was published in 1776. By allowing nations, organizations and individuals to specialize in what they do best, trade makes more goods and services available to everyone, raising living standards for all. 
 Open international trade has indirect advantages as well. By increasing competition, it spurs producers to find ways to reduce costs and, hence, prices to consumers -- again, increasing living standards. And it spreads knowledge and skill. People all over the world gain access to the best technologies and most productive business practices.
Unless they're forbidden to adopt them.
Such prohibitions explain why poor countries stay poor, two economists, Stephen L. Parente of the University of Illinois and Edward C. Prescott of the University of Minnesota, argue in "Barriers to Riches," published last year by MIT Press. "Although countries have access to the same stock of knowledge," they write, "they do not all make equally efficient use of this knowledge because policies in some countries lead to barriers that effectively prevent firms from adopting more productive technologies and from changing to more efficient work practices."
In other words, says Professor Parente, "poor countries are poor because some groups are benefiting by the status quo," and those groups use the law to block change. India has a long history of this. In the early 20th century, strikes kept Indian textile mills from increasing the number of looms each worker operated, and the government protected the old ways through steep tariffs on foreign textiles. As a result, from 1920 to 1938 textile productivity rose by only a third as much in India as it did in Japan, which was beginning its climb to prosperity.
Such policies, the authors note, continue in India, where "regulations require certain firms to award workers with lifetime employment and require firms with more than 25 workers to use official labor exchanges to fill any vacancy."
They add, "The state can and often does discourage entry by firms that use more productive work practices through the subsidization of existing firms."
To protect favored workers, India forces its economy to be less productive than it could be, making the country poorer.
Professors Parente and Prescott came to their bold conclusion after examining alternative explanations, like savings rates or educational levels. The difference, they argue, can't be explained by what countries put into their economies. It must lie in what comes out.
If savings and education were enough, says Professor Prescott, "Khrushchev would have been right."
"The former Soviet Union would have buried the West. They were well educated. They had high savings rates. The efficiency with which you use resources matters."
Take savings as an example. From 1966 to 1993, the savings rates in rich and poor countries were about the same, roughly a fifth of gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund. Africa, for example, lags only a few percentage points behind the industrialized regions and has occasionally surpassed them. The economists acknowledge that these statistics are open to question, since countries have been known to fudge their data and collecting accurate information is a difficult task. But these are the same data used by people who claim that high savings rates are the key to economic growth.
Besides, the savings hypothesis doesn't pass the smell test. The gap between rich and poor countries is simply too big. For savings and investment to account for the difference in output, the authors calculate that "savings rates in the rich countries would have to be 8,000 times higher than in the poor countries."
Education is another common explanation for growth. Basic literacy is necessary, but it isn't sufficient, the economists argue. Education spending can't explain "economic miracles." As Professor Parente notes, "Japan didn't double its schooling capital when it doubled its income."
One by one, the book explores the standard explanations for economic differences and concludes that while inputs matter, they can't account for the huge differences between rich and poor countries or explain why some countries catch up with the economic leaders.
Something must be going on that makes some countries more productive. That's a puzzle, since everyone has access to the same technologies and capital markets. Indeed, multinational companies make information flows between countries increasingly fluid. When Ford builds an auto plant in Mexico, it draws on the best practices developed all over the world. Mexicans don't have to reinvent auto manufacturing from scratch. "Technological transfer is so much easier than it's ever been," Professor Parente says.
The economists argue that the puzzle is explained by local interest groups' blocking efficient techniques. Free trade's indirect benefit is that it forces local monopolies to compete, opening countries to the most productive technologies and practices. Governments that commit themselves to free trade agreements are binding themselves not to protect the status quo, even in the face of interest group pressure. "Trade," Professor Parente says, "is great for getting rid of these vested interests."
This research turns the activist attack on free trade on its head. Multinational companies become the carriers of the state-of-the-art production techniques that poor countries need to climb out of poverty. And political power and influence, which antitrade protesters praise as democratic, becomes the biggest barrier to riches -- and the greatest source of poverty.
Not surprisingly, Professor Prescott expresses great hope for a Free Trade Area of the Americas. He recently spent time in Brazil and is distressed to see such a resource-rich country with a dynamic people remain so poor. "If they formed this free trade within the Americas, you'd see growth miracles throughout," he says. "We'd benefit a little bit. These other countries would benefit a huge amount."

HEADLINE: Italy's New Leader Begins To Assemble His Cabinet 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, May 16 

 BODY:
After two days of secluded talks with advisers, Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's newly elected prime minister, paid a call on the president today, the first formality on his way to taking office.
 Mr. Berlusconi, the media tycoon, whose center-right coalition won a solid majority in both houses of Parliament on Sunday, is unlikely to begin the business of running Italy until early June, after the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies meet and elect new leaders. 
 Even after Mr. Berlusconi announces his cabinet and is sworn, the two houses must still hold a vote of confidence, though Mr. Berlusconi has the votes to breeze in. 
In his first public statement since his election-night comments, Mr. Berlusconi said he would soon release a list of cabinet ministers. 
But already two prominent people whose names he dropped at the end of the campaign have demurred: Luca Di Montezemolo, president of Ferrari, says he is still needed at the race car company. And Letizia Moratti, a former head of Italian state television and of Rupert Murdoch's Italian headquarters, signaled that she might not sign up, saying she did not want to be the only nonpolitician in the cabinet. She is also the only woman on the short list. 
On the other hand, Mr. Berlusconi's ally in the election, Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, said his party would gladly play a role in the new government. He assured reporters that even though his party did poorly in the election, "we are a decisive force in the Senate."
In the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, together with other centrist and right-wing parties, have enough votes (337 of 630) without Mr. Bossi. In the Senate, however, the coalition is two votes short of a majority without the Northern League's 17 seats. But given the flexible view of party allegiance among Italian legislators, Mr. Berlusconi could find other votes among the Senate's nine senators for life, or even from other centrists. 
Mr. Bossi, who has said his party paid a "monstrous price" for supporting Mr. Berlusconi, said a Northern League politician should either be elected president of one house of Parliament, or be included in the cabinet. 
At least one of his demands is likely to be granted, despite European fears about Mr. Bossi's nationalism. "I think Berlusconi will want him in his government," said Sergio Romano, a former Italian ambassador to the United States, "on the theory that says, 'The closer they are, the less damage they do.' " 
Italy's defeated center-left parties, which have chosen Francesco Rutelli, Mr. Berlusconi's campaign rival, as opposition leader, are not waiting for a new Parliament or a new government to attack. 
Two days before the election, Mr. Berlusconi had pledged to eliminate a regional tax on productivity paid by companies and the self-employed, saying it penalized business. Today Antonio Marzano, an economist and a leading member of Forza Italia whom Mr. Berlusconi has promoted as a probable cabinet minister, warned it would be unwise to cut the tax because it would reduce income to regions and cause friction with the European Union.
Roberto Cuillo, spokesman for the Democrats of the Left, a leftist party in the opposition coalition, scoffed today, saying Mr. Berlusconi had already broken two promises -- to cut the tax and to bring the president of Ferrari into his cabinet. 
But both sides failed to deliver on campaign pledges to bring more women into Parliament. Women now account for 9.2 percent of the legislators, below the European average of 9.7 percent. 
Emma Bonino, the head of the Radical Party, who held a hunger strike to protest the lack of news media interest in her issues, was defeated in her Senate race. Italy, which has never had a strong gay-rights movement, did elect its first openly lesbian legislator, Titti de Simone, 31, who was elected to the Senate as a Marxist.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Likely to Meet Putin During June Visit to Europe 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
American officials said today that President Bush would probably meet Russia's president, Vladimir N. Putin, during a trip to Europe in June. The session will present their first opportunity to discuss several points of friction between Washington and Moscow, including the administration's missile defense plans, the future of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and Mr. Bush's oft-stated reluctance to provide additional financial aid to Russia. 
 The encounter is expected to come toward the end of a trip during which Mr. Bush will meet with the leaders of NATO nations and visit Spain, Poland, Sweden and Belgium. A month later, Mr. Bush will meet Mr. Putin again, at the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's major industrial nations in Genoa, Italy. 
 "The date of the first meeting is not nailed down," an administration official said today. "But we expect them to meet next month."
The administration has been sensitive to the charge that Mr. Bush has so far had no direct contact with the leaders of Russia and China, both of whom oppose his missile defense plans. Under current plans, Mr. Bush will not meet President Jiang Zemin until he visits Shanghai and Beijing in October. 
But one administration official said last week that "there's a sense we have to get things going with Putin," particularly if Mr. Bush hopes to head off Russia's objections to scrapping the ABM treaty.
In return, Mr. Bush plans to offer deep unilateral cuts in American nuclear arms, which would ease pressure on Russia to upgrade its own nuclear arsenal. Mr. Bush has also hinted, without ever spelling out the details, that the United States would be willing to share its missile shield technology with Russia. But Mr. Bush has made it clear that he wants to go ahead with his plans with or without Russian cooperation.
It is far from clear that Mr. Bush's inducements will be enough to persuade Mr. Putin to adopt Mr. Bush's view that the 1972 ABM treaty is an outmoded relic of the cold war.
The Russian leader is also seeking to wipe away Soviet-era debt, and to breathe new life into loan commitments from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions that have sent little new money into Russia since the collapse of the country's currency in 1998. Increased oil revenues have alleviated the need for some of that aid, and Mr. Bush, during and after his campaign, suggested that he saw no role for the United States in continuing economic aid to Moscow.
Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, is to arrive here on Thursday to work out the details of the meetings. 
Before he left Moscow, Mr. Ivanov said that Russia was open to talks on missile defense. But he said, as Mr. Putin has said on several occasions, that extraordinary care must be taken before abandoning arms treaties.

HEADLINE: Mitchell Report on Mideast Violence May Thaw the Ice; 
U.S. Gingerly Discusses Taking More Active Role

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Faced with increasing pressure to help reduce the violence in the Middle East, the Bush administration is trying to find ways to become involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while steering clear of what it views as the failures of the Clinton presidency.
 President Bush met today at the White House with his top foreign policy advisers, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, for what officials called a strategy session. 
 A centerpiece of the talks was a report by an international panel led by a former United States senator, George J. Mitchell. 
But officials cautioned that the administration was searching for a formula that did not fully support the freeze on settlements that the Palestinians are demanding and the Israelis reject, a freeze backed by Mr. Mitchell's panel. 
As part of the strategy of using the Mitchell report as a vehicle for possible talks, the State Department is trying to arrange a meeting between General Powell and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.
"There's a broad recognition that the situation on the ground between the Israelis and the Palestinians is deteriorating and that the Mitchell report offers a potential vehicle to jump start a political process that could arrest the deterioration," a senior administration official said after the talks today, at the National Security Council. 
The change of heart is being propelled by the intensifying violence and by pressure from European and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, to get involved. 
Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the day-to-day leader of his nation, one of Washington's most important Arab allies, has declined an invitation to come to Washington next month. 
The rebuff was seen here as a stark indication of Arab displeasure with the administration's more distant approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The prince, who will be in Canada in June and could easily come here, has indicated that he would not visit until the United States has done more to persuade Israel to halt military actions against the Palestinians, officials said. 
Some senior officials have concluded that unless serious efforts are made to halt the violence, a long war of attrition lies ahead that will severely hurt American interests in the region. 
General Powell is also concerned that his efforts to refashion economic sanctions against Iraq are being hurt by anger among Arab allies whose cooperation he needs on that mission, but whose people see the United States as fueling violence against Palestinians. 
President Bush has conspicuously refused to meet with Mr. Arafat until the violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories abates, though he has met with the leaders of Egypt and Jordan. 
The encounter General Powell is seeking with Mr. Arafat would take place during the secretary's trip to Africa and Europe, which begins next week, and thus would not carry the fanfare of a Washington meeting. 
If the Bush administration decides to wade into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it will be with a distinctly different style than during the Clinton era. 
Unlike President Clinton, President Bush would not be so directly involved. 
"The President doesn't schedule meetings for the sake of scheduling meetings," one administration aide said in a tart reference to Mr. Clinton's many sessions with Mr. Arafat. 
In a departure from the methods of the former Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, General Powell, who has been holding wideranging Middle East seminars in his office with representatives from across the administration, would carry most of the diplomacy. 
In a gesture to the Palestinians, General Powell met Tuesday at the State Department with Mr. Arafat's second in command, Mahmoud Abbas, who is known as Abu Mazen. 
But tempering the welcome, the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, went to the State Department to see Mr. Abbas rather than greet him at the White House. 
Mr. Abbas said Mr. Arafat could only end the violence on the Palestinian side if the Israeli government addressed Palestinian concerns, officials accompanying him said.
A focus of the discussion with General Powell was on Israeli settlements, and the Palestinian opposition to the plans for further construction of settlements even as some units remain vacant, a Palestininan official said. 
At the heart of the problem for the administration is how to finesse the question of Israel's insistence that it cannot accept a freeze on the building of settlements, a major recommendation in the Mitchell report. 
Bush administration officials say they cannot ask Prime Minister Ariel Sharon directly for a freeze. 
Mr. Sharon has made it abundantly clear that he is philosophically opposed to such a proposal. 
And anyway, officials add, his coalition government would fall if he accepted such a proposal. 
After today's White House session with President Bush, a senior administration official said the Mitchell report, which was drawn up at the request of the United States, would be officially published next week. 
At that time, the administration will describe its position on the report's call for a freeze on settlement, the administration official said.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Casinos, In Shift of Position, Back Online Betting 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
In a sharp reversal, several of Las Vegas's most powerful casinos no longer want to ban Internet gambling, and some are starting Web sites and exploring technology that could eventually offer wagering in homes, offices or anywhere there is a computer wired into cyberspace.
 The policy change is reverberating through Nevada and Washington, where some casino companies are gearing up to oppose legislation they once embraced that would explicitly ban Internet gambling and force Internet companies to block access to illegal sites. 
 The $40 billion casino industry is not unanimous on the issue. But those who oppose a ban on Internet gambling say they now believe such a ban is not technologically feasible and therefore they should be allowed to compete with the 1,400 sites, operated from overseas, that already offer gambling.
Some politicians and industry analysts have a more skeptical view of the casinos' motives, asserting that the casinos are seeking to control a lucrative field that they have realized they cannot legislate out of existence. These critics expect the casinos eventually to seek regulation that could give them the only legitimate licenses, enabling them to co-opt, if not monopolize, the industry. 
In the last Congress, legislation intended to halt Internet gambling passed in the Senate and fell just short in the House. But the bill's Senate sponsor, Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said that because of the casino industry's reversal and the power of its lobby, the window to pass such a law "may have closed." 
Already, members of Congress from Nevada who supported the bills just months ago are suggesting that their positions have changed, echoing the sentiments of an industry that pours millions of dollars into campaign coffers.
Sally Denton, co-author of "The Money and the Power," a recently published book that chronicles the influence of Las Vegas casinos, said the maneuvering appeared to be a precursor to the casinos' seeking to "take over Internet gambling," leaving legalized online betting in the hands of the existing casino companies. 
According to a report in March by the investment bank Bear, Stearns, Internet gambling generated $1.6 billion in revenue worldwide in 2000 and is projected to grow to $5 billion in 2003. Roughly 1,400 sites are operated by 250 companies, situated in several dozen countries where Internet gambling is either not regulated or is explicitly licensed, said Marc Falcone, a gambling industry analyst with Bear, Stearns. He added that hundreds of them give unusually poor odds, fix games or do not pay gamblers what they are owed.
Still, Americans are logging on in droves. Around 4.5 million Americans have gambled online at least once, and a million do so every day, according to a study last year by the Pew Internet and American Life project. Sitting at home computers, players see vivid images that make it seem as if they are at a real blackjack table or slot machine, or sitting in the sports-betting area of a casino, complete with bells, whistles and even background chatter.
To wager, a player simply enters a credit or debit card number, enabling cash to be deducted from a bank or credit card account with the click of a mouse and winnings to be credited back.
"You can literally wake up in the morning, log on and start losing all your money," Senator Kyl said. 
Some states have passed laws making it illegal to place a bet on the Internet, while many others have laws that could be interpreted as doing so, according to legal experts. The federal law enforcement officials say, meanwhile, that the foreign-based operators are breaking federal law, which prohibits telephone-based interstate gambling operations, including those run on the Internet. But enforcement has been almost nonexistent.
The bills sponsored by Senator Kyl and Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, would have added new teeth to the federal law by explicitly prohibiting operation of an Internet gambling site. Under those bills, the federal government would also have been able to ask Internet service providers like America Online to prevent users from gaining access to illegal sites.
Both Senator Kyl and Representative Goodlatte say they plan to re-introduce online gambling legislation in this Congress, but neither has committed himself to a timetable.
They will find new opposition. J. Terrence Lanni, chairman and chief executive of MGM Mirage and a member of the board of the American Gaming Association, the lobbying arm of the industry, predicted that when the organization next meets, on Tuesday, there "may well be a vote against reintroduction of the bill," which the organization previously supported. 
Philip G. Satre, chairman and chief executive of Harrah's Entertainment and another prominent member of the gaming association board, will also support reversal of the position, said Gary Thompson, Harrah's spokesman. 
Mr. Lanni, considered one of the most powerful men in the casino lobby, said that until late 1999 he opposed Internet gambling. But he said he came to believe that regardless of legislation that bans online wagering, people would still be able to gain access to gambling sites. He said people would find ways around restrictions by using foreign-based Internet service providers or foreign banks or credit cards, which the United States cannot regulate. 
Given what Mr. Lanni deems the inevitability of Internet gambling, he said he favored legalizing Internet gambling but "regulating and taxing" it so that governments receive some benefit and consumers can feel assured they are dealing with reputable casinos.
"My view, very simply, is you should not put American business at a disadvantage to business outside the U.S.," he said, adding later: "We want to move ahead with an Internet future to our gaming." 
The three largest gambling companies -- MGM, Harrah's and Park Place Entertainment, which operates Caesar's Palace and Bally's -- have already established sites where players can gamble, not for money but for prizes.
Mr. Thompson, Harrah's spokesman, said that if questions about enforcement and legality could be cleared up, and presuming Internet gambling fitted the company's code of ethics, "we plan to be a player."
Not all casino executives are convinced. Thomas E. Gallagher, president and chief executive of Park Place, said he had not decided his position on the Kyl legislation and was not certain that Internet gambling was inevitable. And Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president and chief executive of the American Gaming Association, said it was not possible to predict yet, as Mr. Lanni had suggested, that the group would come out against the Kyl legislation.
Indeed, the argument that Internet gambling is inevitable carries little weight with Senator Kyl and Representative Goodlatte, who said that just because all Internet gambling could not be stopped did not mean it should be ignored or sanctioned to benefit corporations.
"So all illegal activity we should keep in the U.S. so we can get our take?" Senator Kyl said. "You don't have to accept something you can stop most of."
Nevertheless, he said in an interview last week that he had become more pessimistic about the chances his bill would become law if the industry opposed it. Senator Kyl said the industry "has a ton of money, and money is what killed us last time." The bill was opposed then by some Indian tribes, which are permitted to operate casinos on their reservations; Internet service providers that did not want to have to enforce blocks on gambling sites; and e-lottery interests seeking to make lotteries available online.
Representative Goodlatte was more optimistic about chances for a bill, saying that governments that are losing lottery revenue to the Internet might support a ban, giving his side a new ally.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that monitors political spending, the gambling industry spent $10.7 million in the 2000 election cycle, up from $6.6 million in 1998, making it one of the fastest-growing special interests in the United States. 
Legislators from Nevada, who not long ago supported Senator Kyl and Representative Goodlatte's legislation, are starting to move toward the position of the casinos.
Senator John R. Ensign, a freshman Republican Senator who voted for the Goodlatte bill in the last Congress when he was in the House, said he now had reservations. He said he still found Internet gambling to be an "unhealthy form of gambling."
But, echoing the sentiments of the gambling lobby, he said he would like to see it legalized and regulated if a ban was not enforceable, adding that United States casinos were "going to have to get in there and try to compete." 
Representative Shelley Berkley, a Democrat who represents the Las Vegas area, said that since last July, when she voted for the Goodlatte bill, her position had changed, too. "I was beginning to have serious reservations" last year, she said. She added that people in the industry had assured her that technology was emerging that would make it possible to regulate and tax games and keep them fair, and when that happened she would embrace legalization.
The groundwork to legalize Internet gambling has been laid in Nevada. The Assembly there recently passed a bill, which the Senate is debating, to permit state regulatory bodies to license Internet sites.
Mr. Lanni of MGM said he was optimistic officials would see fit to grant such licenses, noting that the regulators, who he said were lukewarm to the idea of Internet gambling as recently as last year, had changed their minds, too. 
Casinos in New Jersey are taking a different tack. Proposed legislation in New Jersey that would lead to licensing casinos there for online gambling "is being defeated, because not a single casino company supports the idea," said I. Nelson Rose, a professor and gambling law expert at the Whittier Law School in California.
Mr. Rose said that the difference between Nevada and New Jersey on Internet gambling revolved around the states' views in general toward gambling. Nevada's livelihood centers on gambling, Mr. Rose said, while New Jersey has always seen casino gambling as an inevitable evil that should be isolated in Atlantic City.
Ms. Denton and the co-author of her book, Roger Morris, said the change in view among Nevada regulators was not a coincidence but showed the influence of the industry. "It's a company town and a company state, and they're going to do what the company wants," Ms. Denton said. 
Mr. Lanni characterized his own change of viewpoint as a 180-degree turn. And he said that was partly because he believed technology might soon be available that could make it possible to verify whether Internet users, no matter how far-flung, were old enough to gamble. 
With a small device attached to a person's computer, "we could identify the person who has the account," he said.
The industry has also talked of using global positioning systems to establish a user's physical location, to determine if the person is wagering from a jurisdiction where gambling is permitted. But industry critics question how reliable such technology could be.
Senator Kyl said he did not know if it was feasible to create such technology, but he said the activity to create it suggested just how much money was at stake.
"Considering the expense one would go to to employ it," he said, "what does that tell you about the potential economic benefits? Should society be promoting taking that much money out of productive use and putting it in the hands of MGM?"

HEADLINE: Energy Task Force: The Results Are In 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Dick Cheney, Energy Czar" (editorial, May 14): 
 That the Bush administration, with its links to big oil, should use scare tactics about our energy supply to sell aggressive drilling in Alaska and elsewhere should come as no surprise. 
President Bush used similar scare tactics with his assertions that the economy was much worse off than everyone thought in order to sell the need for a huge tax cut. Almost overnight, the country was in a tailspin with widespread layoffs and company cutbacks. In an increasingly vicious cycle, the American public, fearful of losing jobs tomorrow, cut back on spending today. And companies hit by lower demand cut back on production and manpower.
Perhaps it is time for a more honest, thoughtful and cautious use of words and prognostications by our leaders.

HEADLINE: Proposal Is Latest U.S. Reaction To Concerns That Wax and Wane 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Gov. Bob Wise of West Virginia was in a bullish mood when he met with his state's leading coal-industry officials last week. Once again, he said, an administration has declared an energy crisis and concluded that coal, the domestic workhorse of fossil fuels, is a major part of the solution. "We're back," he said.
 But there was a wariness between the lines of Mr. Wise's message, and more than than a little sense of deja vu. 
 "It seems to be running in a 20-year cycle: The country vows, by golly, we're going to do something about energy," Mr. Wise, a Democrat, told the group. "But then memories get short," he added. "The question is whether we will truly be back in a sustained way." 
The Bush administration produced its energy plan tonight, declaring that "America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970's." But many veterans of the past energy wars share a guarded view of such plans. The nation, they suggest, may be better at declaring energy crises than sticking with policies to fight them. 
James R. Schlesinger, secretary of energy from 1977 to 1979, when the issue dominated and arguably consumed the Carter administration, said somewhat ruefully, "It's easier to make plans than to get them accepted."
In fact, there has been no shortage of energy proposals over the years: for a big investment in synthetic fuels, for vast new efforts in energy efficiency, for major expansions of coal use, for the creation of new agencies and the regulation -- and deregulation -- of oil and natural gas. Some endured, some lost support when the price of oil dropped, some did not survive the changes of administrations and philosophies.
As expected, the Bush administration's energy plan calls for added supply from domestic oil, gas and coal but also calls for government to "streamline the licensing of nuclear power plants." It also declares that "our energy crisis has been years in the making, and will take years to put fully behind us."
In recent days, many energy veterans have said the debate seems very familiar.
Jody Powell, press secretary for President Jimmy Carter, said: "One would think now, after all these many years, starting in '72, '73, that we might have learned this is a recurring problem that we probably ought to think about dealing with on a longer-term, more thoughtful basis. We've had two oil shocks, a third one of unknown dimensions on the horizon. And we also went to war about this."
But Walter Rosenbaum, an expert on energy at the University of Florida, suggested that the policy zigzags of the last 30 years should not be surprising. 
"Short of a war, this has probably been the most difficult kind of planning," said Mr. Rosenbaum, a professor of political science, "because it requires us to make sacrifices that hit the pocketbook directly. And it's hard for politicians because those are the things that people remember."
Both in the 1970's and today, the energy debate raises some of the most complicated and politically charged trade-offs: conservation vs. production; environment vs. energy; government intervention vs. market forces. 
In the 1970's, beginning with the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the energy crisis seemed an enduring feature of American life. It led to elaborate regulatory structures, an array of new government agencies, (first the Federal Energy Administration and the Energy Research and Development Agency, then the cabinet-level Department of Energy) and the first of many vows to end the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
When President Richard M. Nixon announced Project Independence in 1973, he compared it to the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program, and promised, "By the end of this decade, we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy needs without depending upon any foreign energy sources." (The nation's dependence on foreign oil was greater by 1980 and greater still by 2000.)
But it was Mr. Carter who essentially staked his presidency on what he called, just a few months after taking office in a cold winter during a natural gas crisis, "the moral equivalent of war." 
It was a war fraught with symbolism: solar panels on the White House roof (eventually removed during the Reagan administration), sweaters on the president, urgent pleas to the nation to set winter thermostats at no more than 65.
The war was also waged with huge new investments. Mr. Rosenbaum said that between 1974 and 1981, federal support for all forms of energy research and development increased 475 percent.
Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, noted that the Carter years saw a move toward rolling back a "Rube Goldberg system of price controls" for oil and natural gas, overcoming intense political opposition and "the great skepticism about the ability of markets to actually work." 
In those years there was also a heavy emphasis on conservation and energy efficiency, with measures like tax credits for home insulation and energy efficiency standards for home appliances.
David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, an advocacy group, said that one of the most enduring elements of the Carter era was the push toward conservation and efficiency. The fuel economy standards were passed just before Mr. Carter took office but were put into effect in his tenure and save more than three million barrels of oil a day, Mr. Nemtzow said. The appliance standards were haggled over for years but eventually took hold. 
"If you buy a full-size refrigerator today," Mr. Nemtzow said, "it will use no more than 40 percent of the electricity that a full-size refrigerator did in the 70's."
As time passed, and the price of oil dropped, the public's zeal for conservation eased; witness the popularity of less efficient sports utility vehicles and small trucks. But the overall trend toward energy efficiency remained, Mr. Yergin said.
Other energy initiatives from the Carter years, though, proved to be dead ends. One was the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, intended to pump billions into developing new ways of producing fuels, like coal liquefaction and gasification. An area outside Morgantown, W.Va., was slated to get a $1.4 billion plant designed to produce a clean-burning liquid from high-sulfur coal.
But after President Ronald Reagan came in, and the price of oil began to drop, the Synthetic Fuels Corporation proved a tempting target. It was abolished in 1985; the site where the synfuel plant was supposed to be built is now being developed as an industrial park.
It was emblematic of the sharp shift between the Carter and Reagan philosophies. Mr. Reagan preached the virtues of a free market and campaigned for the abolition of the Energy Department. Financing for energy research and development was cut substantially, and fuel economy standards were relaxed. Meanwhile, world oil prices were falling. The energy crisis receded for a while, although it was rediscovered in the first Bush administration around the time of the Persian Gulf war.
Federal policy on coal has been particularly inconsistent over the years; power plants were discouraged from burning coal for environmental reasons and encouraged to burn it for energy reasons. The Bush plan released tonight may be starting another cycle.
This policy roller coaster is hard for a state like West Virginia, which has far too much experience with the boom-bust cycle of coal. Governor Wise says he is setting up his own task force to see how his state can create a sustainable boom.
In the meantime, the governor said, "I want this country to recognize that you can't turn energy off and on like a spigot." --------------------

James Watt Sees Vindication
DENVER, May 16 (AP) -- James G. Watt, interior secretary under President Reagan, said in an interview published today that the Bush administration's focus on drilling to solve energy problems was just what he suggested 20 years ago.
Mr. Watt called for tapping energy on public land, and in recent weeks Vice President Dick Cheney has said production should take precedence over conservation.
"Twenty years later, it sounds like they've just dusted off the old work," Mr. Watt said in an interview with The Denver Post.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND BRITAIN SEEK TO RESTORE TRADE WITH IRAQ 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 16 

 BODY:
Britain, backed by the United States, will propose next week that the United Nations lift the 11-year ban on international trade with Iraq, British officials said today.
 The long-awaited British-American proposal, if adopted by the Security Council, would prohibit only the sale of a specific list of arms and weapons-related items to Iraq. 
 But the plan would require Iraq to let international arms inspections resume before any sanctions could be lifted, and it would reject Iraqi demands to return to Baghdad the control over money Iraq earns from oil sales. That money would still be deposited into a United Nations-supervised escrow account, to be drawn on for imports. Iraq has already said it would accept nothing short of an end to the embargo, and it expelled international inspectors in 1998, so it is likely to reject the plan as inadequate. 
"The measures that we are proposing in effect will mean the end of sanctions on ordinary civilian imports into Iraq," a British official said today. "We are trying to agree on more focused controls on Iraq's weapons and illegal oil exports," he said. 
Although the new proposals, representing a fundamental shift in the way the United Nations will deal with Iraq, were developed jointly, Bush administration officials appeared reluctant to comment publicly on the plan, leaving the British alone out front today. 
The administration's approach has many critics in Washington, especially among conservatives who believe Mr. Bush should increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein in the hope of bringing down his regime. But Mr. Bush, in an interview with The New York Times in January, likened the Iraqi sanctions to "Swiss cheese" and went along with a proposal by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to focus on enforcing sanctions on military transfers.
"You undercut all sanctions if you try to stop everything," one State Department official said. "It simply doesn't work to try to lock up the country, especially when so many other countries are willing to turn the other way when goods are smuggled across the border. So it's time to try a different approach."
The proposal comes several years after deep fissures developed in the Security Council over the usefulness or ethical justification for the sweeping embargo that the Security Council imposed under the last Bush administration and which the Clinton administration demanded it keep in place. In recent years, rising oil prices also gave Mr. Hussein enhanced economic power that helped reduce his diplomatic isolation, as old and new trading partners joined in calls for a lifting of sanctions.
A long and difficult council debate is expected. The other permanent members of the council with veto power, China, France and Russia, which have argued for a quicker suspension of sanctions, did not comment on the proposals today. 
In Washington, Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said that the administration was in "a sort of intermediate stage" of consultations with Security Council members and nations near Iraq. "We don't have a proposal at this point to present."
Mr. Boucher did indicate, however, that the administration supported the plan in principle. "The goal of this process is to control effectively Iraq's ability to buy weapons, to control Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors, especially to control Iraq's ability to threaten its region with weapons of mass destruction," he said. "So, on the one hand, you will have a set of controls that do that. On the other hand, we will smooth out the process and enable civilian goods to reach the Iraqi people."
The British official briefing reporters said that the basic plan was ready to be presented to the Security Council as a resolution as early as next week.
"We've been consulting other Security Council members and key states in the region, and have proposed some ideas, and so far we are receiving a reasonably positive response," the British official said. 
Ambassador James Cunningham, the acting American representative on the Council, said today that he hoped to see the resolution adopted by the end of this month, but refused to discuss the proposal in detail.
A review and renewal of the existing "oil for food" program in Iraq is due by June 4, and British and American officials would like to replace that with the new plan at that time.
There has been a steady erosion of the isolation of Iraq, as neighboring countries and other nations began to increase trade and send flights to Baghdad's newly reopened airport. At the same time, Arab nations and other opponents of sanctions continue to criticize them for causing unacceptable hardship to the Iraqi people.
"Under this system, Iraq will be able to meet all of its civilian needs," the British official said. "If our proposals are adopted by the Security Council, Iraq will have no excuse for the suffering of the Iraqi people." 
The new plan for Iraq marks another stage in a long-running attempt by the Security Council to deal effectively with an Iraqi government noted for its record of trying to create nuclear, chemical and biological weapons before and possibly since its invasion and occupation of neighboring Kuwait in August 1990.
After the war to free Kuwait that followed in early 1991, Iraq was told by the Security Council that it would remain under a strict embargo on oil sales and weapons purchases until it had been fully disarmed to the satisfaction of United Nations inspectors. Goods like food and medicine were never included in the embargo. 
By the end of that year, when much of Iraq's arsenal was being destroyed but it was clear that Mr. Hussein was neither going to cooperate with the inspection system in ferreting out undeclared arms nor use what money he had to alleviate civilian hardships, the Security Council offered Iraq the chance to buy more civilian goods through controlled oil sales. Iraq refused, and it was not until 1996 that a revised oil-for-food program was accepted.
That program has been steadily expanded, until Iraq is now free to import a wide range of goods and equipment. But it is still required to present a list of proposed purchases to the United Nations periodically. That rule would now be lifted.
Under the new British-American proposal, Iraq is still required to readmit arms inspectors, who have not been allowed to work in the country since 1998, and to be declared free of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons or components as well as missiles with a range of over 150 kilometers. Until then, the sanctions imposed in 1990 and reaffirmed repeatedly since remain in place.
The proposal requires that two concrete lists of prohibited weapons and weapons-related goods be drawn up, one for weapons of mass destruction and the other for conventional arms. Such purchases could not be made by Iraq, and questionable contracts could still be referred to the Council's sanctions committee. That panel, the British official said, could deny a sale entirely, exercise a line-item veto or ask that United Nations monitors track the ultimate destination and use of a suspect item in Iraq.
In general, the new proposals rely heavily on United Nations monitoring, which could be problematic. Britain and the United States have pressed for more monitors in Iraq, but this has been rejected by some of Iraq's supporters. The Iraqi government could simply bar monitors.
The free flow of civilian goods into Iraq would place a heavy responsibility for vigilance on Iraq's neighbors, since arms inspectors of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission are concerned about the possibility of Iraq's hiding material for arms programs in civilian shipments.
On a recent visit to the Middle East, General Powell discussed these next steps with countries in the region. Diplomats say that Jordan, Turkey and Syria would have to be reassured that they would not suffer economically if they cooperated with the United Nations.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a proposal by Britain and the United States to lift the 11-year ban on international trade with Iraq misstated the reason for the departure of international inspectors there in 1998. It occurred -- that December, before the United States and Britain began bombing raids on Iraq -- because the United Nations feared that they might be harmed or taken hostage. They were not expelled.

HEADLINE: A Dark View of the Street; 
Spotlight Shines on Skeptic Who Sees a Long Slowdown

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL STEINBERGER 

 BODY:
Bearishness has its benefits these days. Just ask Stephen S. Roach, Morgan Stanley's chief economist and currently Wall Street's leading merchant of doom.
 Last month, Mr. Roach made his debut on "Hardball," MSNBC's nightly political scrum. Rather than the mauling that most guests receive, he was treated like visiting royalty. Chris Matthews, the program's host, introduced Mr. Roach as a "very prestigious fellow" and, in a rare display of deference from Hardball's brusque ringmaster, only interrupted him three times. That was not all. 
 "I'd never even seen this show before," Mr. Roach said, "and the next morning, random people are coming up to me saying, 'Great job on Hardball.' I was amazed." 
For Mr. Roach, the spotlight is shining hotter than ever. He was among the earliest on Wall Street to say that the economy was about to hit a wall -- he issued his forecast in early January -- and no one has articulated the case more aggressively or provocatively.
Indeed, though the economic data remain mixed about the extent of the downturn, he has turned even more negative lately, saying that evidence of a sharp slowdown was "the most compelling I've seen in 20 years."
While the markets seem confident that the economy's slide will be easily reversed, Mr. Roach says that the bottoming has only begun and that the country is facing a long stretch of anemic growth.
He has also offered a withering critique of the economic boom of the late 1990's: Far from being a powerful expression of American ingenuity and industriousness, it was a textbook example of the damage that can be done when financial manias rage unchecked.
Sweeping judgments are nothing new for Mr. Roach. He often goes beyond Fed watching and number crunching to consider the larger forces in the marketplace, as well as the social consequences of economic policy. The conclusions he draws are frequently at odds with Wall Street's prevailing wisdom.
The starkness of his opinions also invites some understandable needling. After listening to Mr. Roach sketch an especially dire outlook at a roundtable discussion in February sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, John Lipsky, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, replied sarcastically: "So, I guess that means we're never going to grow again?"
Mr. Roach is not quite that pessimistic, but in the wake of the jump in April unemployment figures, he is more certain than ever that a turbulent ride is in store. 
Though he hedges on whether the United States will experience two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output, the popular definition of a recession, he says the situation will feel like one regardless. And with Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, slumping again, he says he fears a "synchronized global recession" may be in the offing.
Like most successful mavericks, Mr. Roach, 55, is adept at getting himself heard.
Partly it is aesthetic: his thick glasses, furrowed brow and scholarly mien seem to lend his charts and graphs instant credibility. But he also knows how to give his otherwise sober analysis the melodramatic packaging that attracts attention.
"Steve presents his views in a flamboyant way," said Allen Sinai, chief executive of Primark Decision Economics, "and it is catchy."
Seated in his spacious, spotless Midtown office overlooking the Hudson River and the Palisades, Mr. Roach discussed the condition of the economy in the slightly emphatic tones of someone tired of having to explain what, to him, is obvious.
"We went to excess in the late 1990's on many counts -- investing in information technology, depleting personal savings, relying on foreign capital, and the overarching excess, the stock market bubble, capped off by the Nasdaq folly," he said. "At some point, you purge the excesses and revert to the norms, and that is generally triggered by recession."
Mr. Roach, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1982 after stints at Morgan Guaranty and the Federal Reserve, is of the sin-and-punishment school: after so much bingeing, he claims a bad hangover is not only inevitable but necessary. The runaway stock market, he says, was the worst kind of asset bubble because it infected the real economy. The surging market, fueled by the technology boom, persuaded companies that every dollar spent on computers and information networks would be rewarded with a rising share price.
Similarly, millions of Americans became convinced that the market went only up and that the valuations of technology stocks could stay in the stratosphere indefinitely. That led them, Mr. Roach says, to blow every cent of their paychecks, and then some.
Now that the bubble has imploded, Mr. Roach says companies are burdened with overcapacity, and corporations and individuals are choking on debt. Amid deteriorating business and personal balance sheets, he says the last thing on Main Street's agenda is another shopping spree. Thus, the usual tonic, interest rate cuts, may not work its magic this time.
He maintains that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, bears much of the blame for the economy's Icarian flight.
"We just had the biggest party ever," Mr. Roach said, "and not only did he not take away the punch bowl; he added more punch. I am afraid that's going to be part of his legacy."
As Mr. Roach sees it, Mr. Greenspan committed two blunders. The first was sounding a warning in 1996 about the stock market's "irrational exuberance" but then doing nothing to quell it. The second was his endorsement of the "new paradigm" hypothesis, in particular the notion that technology investment was paying off in the form of permanently higher productivity growth rates.
Mr. Roach said the central bank's seal of approval was the green light that sent the markets into orbit and helped create the bubble.
He attributes the spike in productivity rates -- they have risen an average of 2.8 percent a year since 1995 -- mainly to spending on computers and other technologies, which increased output. Now that investment has dried up, and he expects productivity will resume its pedestrian growth.
Mr. Roach's diagnosis is disputed by many economists, not to mention Mr. Greenspan. Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities, is convinced that the jump in productivity will ultimately prove sustainable and that new technology has had a far greater influence than Mr. Roach concedes. Further, Mr. Yardeni maintains that globalization and corporate cost-cutting have substantially improved long-term efficiency.
Mr. Yardeni suggested that Mr. Roach was simply acting the part of the village curmudgeon.
"What are we really arguing about?" he asks rhetorically. "Nobody denies there were excesses. But there's also no debating that the standard of living in America has never been higher. Is he saying the prosperity is a mirage? It just seems like Steve is being dismal for dismal's sake."
Still, the skepticism Mr. Roach voiced in the latter half of the 1990's about the underlying health of the economy did not necessarily translate into erroneous projections, or prevent him from turning bullish at crucial points.
He got some big things wrong: from 1997 to 1999, he thought inflation was about to return with a vengeance.
He also got some important things right. After Russia's loan default in 1998, the consensus was that a global recession, maybe even depression, was on the horizon. Mr. Roach was one of the few Wall Street economists -- others included Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, and David Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company -- to predict, accurately, that the world would weather the storm without much serious harm.
The often-dichotomous nature of his views reflects the dual roles Morgan Stanley permits Mr. Roach to play. His chief duty is overseeing a 30-member team responsible for assessing the immediate outlook for the global economy. The numbers they derive are factored into the forecasts of the firm's analysts and strategists. He also confers daily with Morgan Stanley's top brass, its sales and trading staff and its institutional clientele. He travels most weeks, often overseas, and writes commentaries three times that are distributed to clients and co-workers.
But Mr. Roach also serves a second, more informal function: he is the investment bank's futurist, contemplating the tectonic shifts reshaping the economic landscape.
Perhaps the most prescient example of his crystal-ball gazing was in 1991. While the attention was on the shakeout in manufacturing, Mr. Roach correctly foresaw the brutal restructuring the service sector was about to undergo.
But this also led to the biggest flip-flop of his career.
Mr. Roach thought an overhaul was needed and supported the downsizing that was such an integral part of the process. In 1996, however, he confessed to a change of heart, writing in the Harvard Business Review that downsizing, rather than being the temporary measure he envisioned, had become a permanent, and potentially damaging, corporate strategy. While Mr. Roach says the latest wave of layoffs was unavoidable -- too much white-collar fat accumulated during the boom, he adds that his concern about the slash-and-burn mind-set in boardrooms has not dissipated.
Mr. Roach readily admits that Wall Street is a big part of the problem: demands from investors and analysts for perpetual profit growth often encourage executives to pursue quick fixes, like downsizing, at the expense of long-term solutions. Still, he sees the constant drumbeat for "shareholder value" as emblematic of a pattern.
"There are times when the balance of power shifts in favor of labor or capital, and usually those shifts go to extremes," he said. "This has been a period when economic power has shifted enormously in favor of capital." 
But now that the economic boom of the 90's has played out, he suspects, the pendulum may be about to swing, with public opinion becoming less tolerant of globalization, income inequality and various hallmarks of the new economy.
Dispassionate talk of class warfare may seem odd coming from one of the star employees of a major investment bank. "I've been called a socialist, a communist," Mr. Roach said with a laugh. But his candor has earned him plenty of admirers.
"Most Wall Street economists serve two purposes: one is decorative, the other marketing," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "Their job is to soothe clients and help facilitate the sale of securities. Steve makes his living looking for the next big thing, regardless of whether it's helpful to his firm. He takes unauthorized positions, and for that he has to be saluted."

A Spirit of Nonviolence Creates a Stir in Oregon

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. May 16

 BODY:
When the Dalai Lama visited Salt Lake City and Minneapolis last week, he was well received. But in Portland this week he caused a downright sensation. 
 "World peace must develop from inner peace," the Dalai Lama told 25,000 people packed on Sunday into Pioneer Courthouse Square downtown, many of whom had waited for several hours. 
 People in business attire mixed with monks in yellow and red robes and area residents who had walked for four days from Mount Hood, about 60 miles away, to see the Dalai Lama. 
After a high school band played the Tibetan and American anthems, Gov. John Kitzhaber and Mayor Vera Katz welcomed the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, the ancient Himalayan land now under Chinese control. 
The gathering was the first event in a four-day series, most sold out more than six months ago, at which the Dalai Lama spoke. The appearances were part of a seven-city tour to increase awareness about Tibetan culture and, in Oregon, to raise money for a world peace center in the state. The Portland visit ended today with a breakfast for donors who gave $5,000 or more to the center. 
The Dalai Lama's arrival here has been accompanied by a whirlwind of local activity, including school presentations, a sand painting by monks at the public library (to be destroyed as a reminder of impermanence), art exhibits, sermons at local churches and synagogues and the showing of films about Tibet. 
"I was very impressed, especially when he said that external disarmament must come from inner disarmament" Emily Payne, 22, a legal assistant, said after the Dalai Lama spoke on Tuesday to 10,000 people at the Portland Memorial Coliseum. "He talked about embodying inner peace in your actions in your community, and that community change often leads to world change. That's a really big idea." 
There are fewer than 300 Tibetan immigrants in the area, but the Dalai Lama caused a bigger stir here than he had in some other cities.
"Some of it is because this is a coastal city with a strong orientation towards Asia, but also in some ways the 1960's and 70's are still alive and well here in terms of interest in alternative political, social and economic approaches," Carl Abbott, professor of Urban Studies at Portland State University, said. "Portland has a steady grass-roots progressivism that leavens its mainstream politics."
But not everybody was happy with the Dalai Lama's visit. Five Republican legislators from Clark County, Wash., just across the Columbia River, complained last week in a letter to the county school superintendents about the use of public funds to bus pupils to hear the Dalai Lama at a youth gathering.
"Schools have used the separation of church and state as an excuse to not allow students to participate in certain types of religious activities, including reading their Bible at school, praying at graduation ceremonies, or holding Bible studies on school grounds," the letter said. "Would any of you allow your schools to be used as a vehicle to promote a gathering of these same students that featured other prominent religious leaders such as Billy Graham or Pope John Paul II, promoting nonviolence and peace based on their world views?" 
Sharon Kitzhaber, the Oregon governor's wife and one of the event's organizers, said of the letter writers, "I think these people are misguided and they're looking for ways to assert their own beliefs."
Jigme Topgyal, president of the Northwest Tibetan Cultural Association, the sponsor of the student event, said, "The Dalai Lama's meeting with children was not religious in nature but promoted the values of conflict resolution through compassionate understanding and nonviolence." 
Tickets to hear the Dalai Lama were a hot item in Ethan Harris's high school in Eugene, Ore.
"This is something that is deeply spiritual and something where we can find value even if we don't necessarily agree," said Mr. Harris, 17, who came with a busload of fellow students. "There isn't religious persecution here, and the idea of experiencing other religions is fully encouraged." 
Governor Kitzhaber, a Democrat, who attended most of the events, viewed the Dalai Lama's message as secular wisdom: "If you listen to his speeches, he's not here in his capacity as a leader of Tibetan Buddhists, he's here as a Nobel Peace laureate. I would compare his visit here not to a visit by the pope or by Billy Graham, but to a visit by Martin Luther King or Gandhi. I really think that's what this is about."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Overview of Task Force's Report on National Energy Policy 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the overview of the national energy policy being proposed by President Bush today, as provided by the White House:
 America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970's. The effects are already being felt nationwide. Many families face energy bills two or three times higher than they were a year ago. Millions of Americans find themselves dealing with rolling blackouts or brownouts; some employers must lay off workers or curtail production to absorb the rising cost of energy. Drivers across America are paying higher and higher gasoline prices. 
 Californians have felt these problems most acutely. California actually began the 1990's with a surplus of electricity generating capacity. Yet despite an economic boom, a rapidly growing population and a corresponding increase in energy needs, California did not add a single new major electric power plant during the 1990's. The result is a demand for electricity that greatly succeeds the amount available. 
A fundamental imbalance between supply and demand defines our nation's energy crisis. As the chart illustrates, if energy production increases at the same rate as during the last decade our projected energy needs will far outstrip expected levels of production.
This imbalance, if allowed to continue, will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our national security. But it is not beyond our power to correct. . . .

The Challenge
America's energy challenge begins with our expanding economy, growing population and rising standard of living. Our prosperity and way of life are sustained by energy use. America has the technological know-how and environmentally sound 21st-century technologies needed to meet the principal energy challenges we face: promoting energy conservation, repairing and modernizing our energy infrastructure and increasing our energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment. Meeting each of these challenges is critical to expanding our economy, meeting the needs of a growing population and raising the American standard of living.
We are already working to meet the first challenge: using energy more wisely. Dramatic technological advances in energy efficiency have enabled us to make great strides in conservation, from the operation of farms and factories to the construction of buildings and automobiles. New technology allows us to go about our lives and work with less cost, less effort and less burden on the natural environment. While such advances cannot alone solve America's energy problems, they can and will continue to play an important role in our energy future. 
The second challenge is to repair and expand our energy infrastructure. Our current, outdated network of electric generators, transmission lines, pipelines and refineries that convert raw materials into usable fuel has been allowed to deteriorate. Oil pipelines and refining capacity are in need of repair and expansion. Not a single major oil refinery has been built in the United States in nearly a generation, causing the kind of bottlenecks that lead to sudden spikes in the price of gasoline.
Natural gas distribution, likewise, is hindered by an aging and inadequate network of pipelines. To match supply and demand will require some 38,000 miles of new gas pipelines, along with 255,000 miles of distribution lines. Similarly, an antiquated and inadequate transmission grid prevents us from routing electricity over long distances and thereby avoiding regional blackouts, such as California's.
Increasing energy supplies while protecting the environment is the third challenge. Even with successful conservation efforts, America will need more energy.
Renewable and alternative fuels offer hope for America's energy future. But they supply only a small fraction of present energy needs. The day they fulfill the bulk of our needs is still years away. Until that day comes, we must continue meeting the nation's energy requirements by the means available to us.
Estimates indicate that over the next 20 years, U.S. oil consumption will increase by 33 percent, natural gas consumption by well over 50 percent and demand for electricity will rise by 45 percent. If America's energy production grows at the same rate as it did in the 1990's, we will face an ever-increasing gap.
Increases on this scale will require preparation and action today. Yet America has not been bringing on line the necessary supplies and infrastructure.
Extraordinary advances in technology have transformed energy exploration and production. Yet we produce 39 percent less oil today than we did in 1970, leaving us ever more reliant on foreign suppliers. On our present course, America 20 years from now will import nearly two of every three barrels of oil, a condition of increased dependency on foreign powers that do not always have America's interests at heart. Our increasing demand for natural gas, one of the cleanest forms of energy, far exceeds the current rate of production. We should reconsider any regulatory restrictions that do not take technological advances into account.
We have a similar opportunity to increase our supplies of electricity. To meet projected demand over the next to decades, America must have in place between 1,300 and 1,900 new electric plants. Much of this new generation will be fueled by natural gas. However, existing and new technologies offer us the opportunity to expand nuclear generation as well. Nuclear power today accounts for 20 percent of our country's electricity. This power source, which causes no greenhouse gas emissions, can play an expanding part in our energy future. The recommendations of this report address the energy challenges facing America. Taken together, they offer the thorough and responsible energy plan our nation has long needed.

Components
The national energy policy we propose follows three basic principles:
*The policy is a long-term, comprehensive strategy. Our energy crisis has been years in the making and will take years to put fully behind us.
*The policy will advance new, environmentally friendly technologies to increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy use.
*The policy seeks to raise the living standards of the American people, recognizing that to do so our country must fully integrate its energy, environmental, and economic policies.
Applying these principles, we urge action to meet five specific national goals. America must modernize conservation, modernize our energy infrastructure, increase energy supplies, accelerate the protection and improvement of the environment, and increase our nation's energy security.

Modernize Conservation
Americans share the goal of energy conservation. The best way of meeting this goal is to increase energy efficiency by applying new technology -- raising productivity, reducing waste and trimming costs. In addition, it holds out great hope for improving the quality of the environment. American families, communities and businesses all depend upon reliable and affordable energy services for their well being and safety. From transportation to communication, from air conditioning to lighting, energy is critical to nearly everything we do in life and work. Public policy can and should encourage energy conservation.
Over the past three decades, America has made impressive gains in energy efficiency. Today's automobiles, for example, use about 60 percent of the gasoline they did in 1972, while new refrigerators require just one-third the electricity they did 30 years ago. As a result, since 1973, the U.S. economy has grown by 126 percent, while energy use has increased by only 30 percent. In the 1990's alone, manufacturing output expanded by 41 percent, while industrial electricity consumption grew by only 11 percent. We must build on this progress and strengthen America's commitment to energy efficiency and conservation. . . .

Modernize Our Energy Infrastructure
The energy we use passes through a vast nationwide network of generating facilities, transmission lines, pipelines and refineries that converts raw resources into usable fuel and power. That system is deteriorating, and is now strained to capacity.
One reason for this is government regulation, often excessive and redundant. Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly burdensome. Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities, making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, price spikes and supply disruptions. America needs more environmentally sound energy projects to connect supply sources to growing markets and to deliver energy to homes and business.
To reduce the incidence of electricity blackouts, we must greatly enhance our ability to transmit electric power between geographic regions, that is, sending power to where it is needed from where it is produced. . . .

Increase Energy Supplies
A primary goal of the national energy policy is to add supply from diverse sources. This means domestic oil, gas and coal. It also means hydropower and nuclear power. And it means making greater use of non-hydro renewable sources now available.
One aspect of the present crisis is an increased dependence, not only on foreign oil, but on a narrow range of energy options. For example, about 90 percent of all new electricity plants currently under construction will be fueled by natural gas. While natural gas has many advantages, an over-reliance on any one fuel source leaves consumers vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions. There are several other fuel sources available that can help meet our needs.
Currently, the U.S. has enough coal to last for another 250 years. Yet very few coal-powered electric plants are now under construction.
Nuclear power plants serve millions of American homes and businesses, have a dependable record for safety and efficiency and discharge no greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As noted earlier, these facilities currently generate 20 percent of all electricity in America, and more than 40 percent of electricity generated in 10 states in the Northeast, South and Midwest. Other nations, such as Japan and France, generate a much higher percentage of their electricity from nuclear power. Yet the number of nuclear plants in America is actually projected to decline in coming years, as old plants close and none are built to replace them.

HEADLINE: IN ENERGY PLAN, BUSH URGES NEW DRILLING, CONSERVATION AND NUCLEAR POWER REVIEW 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
President Bush's long-awaited energy plan proposes loosening regulations on oil and gas exploration, conservation-minded efforts like a review of gas mileage standards and a $4 billion tax credit for a new generation of highly fuel efficient cars, and urges a reconsideration of a quarter-century ban on the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.
 With a declaration that the energy problems threaten the nation's economy and security, the Bush plan also orders a sweeping review of public lands to determine whether more energy resources can be extracted. 
 "America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970's," the administration's energy report states.
Without action, it continues, projected energy shortfalls in coming years "will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our national security." Excerpts, Page A21. 
The proposals are among 105 initiatives outlined in the administration's energy report, said a senior government official who briefed reporters on its contents tonight. The White House released an eight-page overview of the document, which will be distributed in full on Thursday.
The official said Mr. Bush would also issue two executive orders later this week directing all federal agencies to consider the effects of all new regulations on energy production and to expedite permits for all energy projects "while remaining mindful of protecting the environment."
The overview released tonight states that federal regulation of the nation's energy producers has unduly inhibited production and increased prices.
"Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly burdensome," the report says. "Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities, making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, price spikes and supply disruptions."
Mr. Bush will also order Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, an outspoken proponent of seeking new sources of energy on federal lands, to "look at any impediments" that discourage exploration for oil and gas.
The report repeats Mr. Bush's commitment to explore in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- a proposal that seems unlikely to survive in Congress -- and also urges a review that will include other places in Alaska, the Rocky Mountains and along the Gulf Coast.
The report also urges the revision or reinterpretation of a major clause of the Clean Air Act that requires long government review of any modifications of power plants that affect their emissions. 
The senior government official, who was deeply involved in the development of the plan, argued tonight that the "new source reviews" by the Environmental Protection Agency are a "time-consuming process" that often "discourage fuel efficiency." 
The Justice Department will also be ordered to review several multi-million-dollar lawsuits brought by the Clinton administration against utilities accused of ignoring the law.
One official of an environmental group said the report was about what he had expected, and he predicted that conservation organizations would be highly critical of it.
"This has just a lot of opportunity for mischief from the energy producers and no real solid commitments for the green components," the official, David G. Hawkins, senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.
Mr. Hawkins said he was "astounded" that the policy would recommend a review of legal actions now under way on utility emissions, calling it "political interference with law enforcement." 
Mr. Bush is to announce his plan on Thursday morning at an innovative energy plant in St. Paul. But even before he begins his campaign for a national energy policy, he has touched off a heated political argument between Democrats and Republicans over how to balance environmental concerns against growing energy needs, and whether to impose temporary price caps in places like California, where a deregulation program and soaring demand has sent prices rocketing.
Democrats have urged the use of such controls, while Mr. Bush will argue "vociferously" on Thursday, one aide said, that the controls would only discourage the production of more electricity. 
Mr. Bush's report adopts a tone that is by turns admonishing and encouraging.
"The complacency of the past decade must now give way to swift, but well-considered, action," it says in its introduction, echoing themes that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the task force, have sounded in recent weeks.
"Present trends are not encouraging, but they are not immutable," the report says.
Then, in a clear effort to separate Mr. Bush's approach from President Jimmy Carter's politically disastrous calls for household austerity during the energy crises of the late 1970's, it adds: "Our country has met many great tests. Some have imposed extreme hardship and sacrifice. Others have demanded only resolve, ingenuity and clarity of purpose. Such is the case with energy today."
The decision to offer a relatively hefty tax credit for "hybrid" cars, which use a combination of gasoline and battery power, is bound to help both Detroit and two Japanese automakers -- Honda and Toyota -- which are already marketing such vehicles in the United States.
They will be less enthusiastic, however, about orders by Mr. Bush for the government to review the federal standards for automotive fuel efficiency, though the report makes no commitment that those standards will be raised.
The plan also calls for a new evaluation of nuclear reprocessing, a technology that takes advantage of the fact that as reactors consume uranium, they also produce plutonium. If the plutonium is chemically scavenged from the fuel, it can be used to run reactors. 
But the technology has drawbacks. The work is dirty, with the threat of radioactive releases, and it is expensive. 
For the last decade at least, it has been far cheaper to fuel reactors with new uranium than to recover plutonium. And while uranium fuel used in power reactors cannot be used to make a bomb, plutonium can, raising the threat of world commerce in a material that could be diverted by countries -- or terrorist groups -- that want a bomb.
Britain, France and Japan currently reprocess fuel, although the British are considering ending the practice because it is so expensive.
But reprocessing can reduce the volume of plutonium requiring disposal, which is important because plutonium is so long-lived and difficult to store safely.
Some opponents of the technology said today that they believed it had been included in the Bush plan as a sop to Nevada, where the Energy Department is trying to build a waste repository. But reprocessing would not eliminate the need for such a repository.
The plan also calls for cooperation with Canada on building a pipeline that could bring more natural gas into the United States. 
The report mixes several existing initiatives with new ones, particularly in the area of conservation. For example, of $10 billion in proposed tax credits over the next 10 years, $5 billion in credits are already in the budget or the result of extending existing ones.
Other programs get modest increases. The administration recommends $300 million in new money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and calls for funneling some oil and gas royalty payments, which companies pay the federal government for extracting resources on public land, to the program for the poor.
Similarly, in an effort directed toward environmentalists, it would commit royalties from any energy extracted in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve for land conservation. 
There are no credits or other tax breaks for oil or gas producers, or electric utilities -- a reflection of the sensitivity of the White House to criticism that Mr. Cheney and other top officials spent their private-sector years in the energy industry. But the tone of deregulation, reassessment of the merits of the Clean Air Act and the emphasis on opening of federal lands to more energy production -- everything from wind power to oil and gas drilling -- provides those industries with effective subsidies totaling in the billions of dollars.
Much of the report simply urges companies to build, build and build some more, including 38,000 miles of new gas pipelines, 255,000 miles of distribution pipelines and a new power plant every few days for the next 20 years. But for every such proposal, Mr. Bush's team carefully inserted proposals for expanding the use of renewable fuels, from geo-thermal energy sources to the methane produced in landfills.
The nuclear power industry gets one major concession: a tax break that would eliminate the double taxation of money put aside for decommissioning plants. Those taxes have been a deterrent to buying and selling nuclear plants. It commits $2 billion over 10 years to a clean-coal technology program in the Department of Energy.
It urges the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to speed the licensing of hydroelectric power plants, and seeks "market-based incentives" to reduce pollutants that cause global climate change.
But this winter Mr. Bush rejected any American participation in the Kyoto treaty on global warming, which would have mandated cuts in American emissions, at considerable economic cost.

HEADLINE: Backers of Caspian Pipeline Say Project Will Move Ahead 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, May 17 

 BODY:
The companies involved in a much-debated pipeline to carry oil from the Caspian Sea to Turkey's Mediterranean coast have announced that they have found the initial cost estimate to be viable and will begin the next phase.
 The pipeline, backed by the previous and current American administrations as a means of loosening Russia's control over the transportation of Caspian Sea oil, would run from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, through Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. 
 It has been criticized as too expensive, but supporters said an initial engineering study put the costs within an acceptable range. Though they did not specify the range, previous statements have estimated the cost at about $2.7 billion. 
BP P.L.C., the oil company managing the project, said investors met in Baku on Tuesday and had authorized a more detailed feasibility study. The study, it said, will cost $150 million and should be completed in mid-2002. Construction could be completed by the end of 2004.
People close to the project said the basic report came up with a price that was within 30 percent of the $2.7 billion estimate. Variables like the price of steel, rights of way and construction of roads through mountainous terrain in Georgia will be factored into the final price.
BP holds 25.4 percent of the Baku-Ceyhan project; six other multinationals, including Unocal and Delta Hess, share an additional 24.6 percent. The remaining 50 percent is held by the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic, or Socar.
Elizabeth Jones, the Bush administration's adviser on Caspian energy projects, said the decision to begin a detailed study was significant. 
"It is a lot more commitment of funding, and the companies are telling me that once you get into detailed engineering, it is very rare that you don't go on to construction," Ms. Jones said in a phone interview from Washington. "Financing still has to be pulled together, but the companies would not go this far if they were not confident."
Socar has said that it hopes to sell 20 percent of its stake; the Chevron Corporation and TotalFinaElf of France have expressed interest in investing in the project.
The state company also hopes to find financing for its remaining share from international lenders.
The Caspian basin covers oil in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Estimates place the total reserves as high as 10 billion tons.
Questions have been raised about whether Azerbaijan has enough oil to make the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline economically viable, but BP said preliminary discussions with international lenders and export credit agencies had been encouraging.
If Chevron invests in the project, it could also use the pipeline to transport oil from the huge Tengiz field it manages in western Kazakhstan. Tankers are expected to begin hauling oil from Tengiz through Turkey's crowded Bosporus next month, a development that has alarmed Turkish officials and environmental advocates.

New Museum To Open in Fall
 After "Self-Portrait With Horn" (1938), a rare and haunting work by the German artist Max Beckmann, sold for $22.5 million at Sotheby's last week, it was announced that Richard Feigen, the Manhattan dealer, had bought the painting on behalf of the Neue Galerie. 
 "The what?" asked people who had been in the salesroom. The next day the phones at the Neue Galerie, a new museum dedicated to German and Austrian fine and decorative arts, were ringing off the hook as journalists, art lovers and museum professionals sought details about the institution. 
The Neue Galerie is to open in early November in a Louis XIII-style building at 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street. The institution is the brainchild of Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky. Mr. Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, is chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and one of the leading American collectors of German and Austrian art. Sabarsky, an art dealer who was a leading authority on German and Austrian Expressionism, died in 1996. He and Mr. Lauder, who met in 1967, talked for years about starting a museum. In 1994 the Serge Sabarsky Foundation and Mr. Lauder bought the five-story brick-and-limestone building, built in 1914, for $9 million.
Designed by Carrere & Hastings, the architects of the New York Public Library, the building was once a mansion and more recently belonged to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. Anabelle Selldorf, an architect who has designed many Manhattan galleries, is putting the finishing touches on the building.
"This is a museum with no compromises," Mr. Lauder said. "It's an old-fashioned type of museum with only two people's vision."
The museum has an acquisitions budget and has been buying fine art, decorative objects and jewelry both at auction and privately.
The museum will be run by two directors: Renee Price, who was the director of the Sabarsky Gallery in New York, and Gerwald Sonnberger, who is the director of the Museum of Modern Art in Passau, Germany, and a co-founder of the Egon Schiele Center in the Czech Republic.
The museum plans two special exhibitions a year, along with rotating displays of works from its own collection, the Sabarsky collection, the Lauder family and other institutions and private collections. The first exhibition, "New Worlds: German and Austrian Art, 1890-1940," will feature works from the museum's collection, the Sabarsky collection and the Lauder family. It is to run from Nov. 9 to Feb. 18.
The museum will have a cafe known as Cafe Sabarsky, run by Kurt Gutenbrunner, the owner and chef of Wallse, an Austrian restaurant on West 11th Street in the West Village. It will also have a bookstore and a design shop that will sell reproductions of designs by architects like Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos.
"This museum will have an international flavor," Mr. Lauder said, adding that he saw it as a small gem comparable to the Wallace Collection in London.
The Neue Galerie is to be open four days a week, Fridays through Mondays, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission will be $10; $7 for students and those over 65.

Bacon Suit to Proceed
The High Court of Justice, Chancery Division in London ruled this week that the legal battle between the estate of the painter Francis Bacon and his former dealer, Marlborough Fine Art of London and its international arm based in Lichtenstein, could proceed.
A trial is expected to begin in January and last about 12 weeks.
Marlborough represented Bacon from 1958 until his death in 1992. Now Bacon's friend and executor, Brian Clarke, contends that the painter was underpaid for works, some of which he and his lawyers say the gallery has still not accounted for.
The suit also contends that Marlborough cheated Bacon out of more than $150 million by consistently undervaluing his paintings, which it bought from him and quickly resold for substantially higher prices. Court papers say the gallery controlled the most minute aspects of Bacon's financial and personal life and used this influence to deprive him of the true value of his work.
In late April the two sides met in court in London to argue their case. Marlborough denied the estate's charges and asked the court to dismiss the case. But after hearing both sides, the judge denied the gallery's request, saying he believed there was at least an arguable case.
Marlborough, run by the Duke of Beaufort and Gilbert Lloyd, son of the gallery's founder, said the accusations against the gallery were "without foundation."
In his ruling the judge said it was now up to a court to decide what kind of relationship existed between the artist and his gallery and whether it was abused.

Fun Facts on the Tate Modern
As the Tate Modern in London celebrates its first anniversary, it is reporting attendance of 5.2 million visitors, making it the most popular modern art museum in the world.
An economic impact study by McKinsey & Company, an international consulting firm based in New York, reported that the museum had created 3,000 new jobs in London. From 1997 to 2000, when the museum opened, the number of hotels and catering businesses in the area increased by 23 percent. The economic benefit to London was estimated to be $150 million in the first year.
The study revealed that the average length of a visit to the Tate Modern was 2 hours 14 minutes. The majority of visitors were from Britain: 37 percent of the total came from London and 34 percent from elsewhere in the country. Among foreign visitors, 11 percent were from the United States and 12 percent from European countries.
Since the museum opened, 135,000 visitors have used audio guides, 1.5 million postcards have been sold and 850,000 cups of tea and coffee have been served in the cafe.
Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, said that what surprised him most was the way visitors had responded to the building.
"The fact that they stayed for over two hours means they must have been looking at the art," he said. He was also pleased by the proportion of British visitors from outside London. "It shows we're a national resource," he said.

HEADLINE: Turkish Bailout Is Joined to a Political Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, May 17 

 BODY:
Turkey's leaders have won promises of $16 billion in new loans for their ailing economy, but now confront the infinitely tougher task of reforming a bankrupt political system, effectively doing away with the state-controlled economy created by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk when modern Turkey was founded in 1923. 
 The sweeping overhaul demanded as a condition for the bailout has backed the shaky governing coalition into a corner: its leaders can either stop using state assets to reward cronies and win votes or try to wriggle out of the commitments and risk a halt to the loans and worse financial disaster. 
 "This can be a defining moment in Turkish history," said the Swedish ambassador, Henrik Liljegren, dean of Ankara's diplomatic corps. "Without the external support, the politicians would not have agreed to these far-reaching reforms." 
Political fault lines have opened already. The two junior parties in the governing coalition have opposed some changes and the senior party headed by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit may prove too weak to keep them in line. 
Polls show the coalition's popularity plunging as prices rise. Opposition parties are clamoring for new elections, which might only bring new instability. 
Parliament has approved legislation to implement many reforms like restructuring the banking system and privatizing more industries. The question is how far and how quickly the leaders will move to dismantle a system that is the lifeblood of Turkish politics. 
"The new economic program is campaign-finance reform," said Muharrem Kayhan, a business owner and official with the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association. "It is against the grain of politicians, but there is a realization that they have to carry it out." 
For years, Turkish governments have ordered state banks to provide cheap loans to special interests and businesses, which in turn contributed to party coffers. The banks also provided cut-rate loans to farmers and small businesses to win support. Often loans were not repaid and state banks are saddled with $20 billion in bad debts. 
To hold successive coalitions together, each party got control over particular ministries and associated industries to raise money and reward supporters. State-owned businesses are widely regarded as grossly overstaffed; one former minister recently acknowledged hiring 14,000 temporary workers. 
The crony capitalism started to unravel in February after a dispute between Mr. Ecevit and the country's president over the pace of investigations into bank corruption. The financial markets were alarmed, creating a crisis that sent the value of the Turkish lira plummeting and prices soaring. One victim was a year-old anti-inflation program supervised by the International Monetary Fund. 
The Bush administration insisted the bailout be tied to economic reforms, and Turkey was desperate enough to agree. On Tuesday, the I.M.F. board approved $8 billion in new loans. Coupled with other assistance, total aid could reach $16 billion by year's end. 
In a letter to Mr. Ecevit last week, President Bush expressed confidence that Turkey would meet the requirements and laid down some benchmarks, including privatizing telecommunications and restructuring the banking industry. 
Some Turks saw a warning between the lines. "The letter asks Turkey to transform itself to be part of the global system and also conveys that if it does not, Turkey has no one to blame but itself for becoming a third-rate or fourth-rate nation," said Cem Duna, an investment consultant and former diplomat. 
The reform package was assembled by the new minister of economy, Kemal Dervis, a former World Bank executive who left Turkey in 1978. Mr. Dervis was brought back by Mr. Ecevit to restore confidence and attract new international loans. 
In less than three months, Mr. Dervis has soared to the top of public opinion polls and is being touted as a future prime minister. Opposition parties eager to take advantage of the coalition's weakness are alarmed by his popularity. 
"He is limited in his power and the necessary reforms can be realized only by a new government," said Ertan Yulek, deputy chairman of the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party. "You will never be able to grow a tropical plant in a cold climate."
Elections may not benefit the opposition either. Polls show that none of the five leading parties would get enough votes to join a new government, evidence of the depth of disenchantment with the current system. 
One danger, analysts said, is that new loans from the I.M.F. and World Bank will ease the financial crisis enough for politicians to return to business as usual, even if it means forsaking the final installments.
"The acid test will be whether this three-party coalition stands behind its commitment," said Mr. Duna. "If it does, it will mark the beginning of the decoupling of politics and economics in Turkey."

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Go Up For First Time in 3 Months 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators rose in April for the first time in three months, an industry survey showed today, suggesting that the economy may rebound later this year.
 The index, a gauge of economic activity over the next three to six months, rose 0.1 percent last month after falling 0.2 percent in each of the previous two months. The increase was led by a rise in money supply and higher stock prices. 
 The increase in the index suggests that five reductions in interest rates by the Federal Reserve since the start of the year may bolster the economy in coming months.
The report, issued by the Conference Board, suggests "that the economy is not in recession and not likely to fall into one," said Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. "However, they also indicate that growth over the next six months or so is likely to be very sluggish."
The Conference Board uses previously reported economic statistics to compile the index.
Besides an increase in money supply and higher stock prices, the leading indicators index was lifted by a wider spread between the yield on the overnight bank-lending rate and the 10-year Treasury note.
A rise in jobless claims; faster vendor delivery times, which suggest weaker demand; lower consumer confidence; a decline in building permits; and fewer orders for business equipment limited the April increase. There was no change in the factory workweek or orders for consumer goods.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity, was unchanged in April after rising 0.1 percent in March. The index of lagging indicators decreased 0.3 percent, matching the March decline.
In a separate report, the Labor Department reported today that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since March. Claims declined by 8,000, to 380,000. That was the first back-to-back decrease since the middle of February.
And an index of manufacturing in the Philadelphia area contracted in May for a sixth consecutive month, the Philadelphia Fed said today. The bank's general economic index fell to minus 8.8 this month from minus 7.2 in April. 
The drop in the Philadelphia index is the first since January. Any negative reading indicates a decline in business, and the index has been negative since December. The string of contractions in activity was the longest since May 1989-April 1991.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: THE BUSINESS RESPONSE; 
Energy Executives Like Proposals; Outside Experts See Less Need for Action

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Energy industry officials and analysts generally embraced the White House energy report issued yesterday. But they pointed out major aspects of the plan that could spark protracted battles with environmentalists and state governments.
 Many company executives praised the Bush administration for articulating the issues facing the country, and the oil and gas industry uniformly welcomed the drive to open more federally controlled land for exploration and production. 
 But other experts said that the nation's energy problems were short-term and that the market was already responding, with companies producing more natural gas and gasoline while demand was beginning to decline because of higher prices. 
"There are places where the government can help but they have also offered solutions where there is no problem," said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, for example opening federal land for oil drilling. 
"The market is taking care of things," Mr. Borenstein said. "The bottom line is that there isn't an energy crisis except for the electricity crisis in California." 
Most analysts contended, however, that the administration suggested important measures that could increase energy supplies but would be sure to ignite controversy. 
The White House plan, for example, proposes granting federal agencies the right of eminent domain to seize private property needed for new electricity transmission lines. But the move has already met opposition in the West among environmentalists and state officials.
"Infrastructure is really very important but it's been widely ignored because it's not very attractive and the jurisdiction for electricity transmission is so messed up," said Gerald M. Keenan, a partner for the Energy Strategic Change arm of PriceWaterhouse Coopers. "Trying to site and build any amount of electricity transmission can be almost a lifelong process." 
The administration also seeks ways to reduce the many types of cleaner-burning gasoline made in the United States.
There are 50 to 60 types of gasoline used across the country, because of the different ingredients mandated for air quality, which makes it hard for one region to import from another when supplies run short. With supplies of many of these gasolines lagging, prices have risen steeply in many regions. 
Refiners say they worry that any changes in current production regulations might void capital investments they made to produce a particular kind of cleaner-burning gasoline.
"The devil is in the details," said John Felmy, chief economist with the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group.
Mr. Felmy said, "The question is can we pull all the stakeholders together and pull ourselves out of the balkanization we have now in the gasoline markets?"

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
Baseball Tale: Successful In Seattle

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
THEY are baseball's hottest and most heartening team, America's anti-A-Rods, the superstar-stripped engine that could. Be careful, however, in characterizing the Seattle Mariners, who deserve a national round of applause but are no Main Street shop rising up against the mall.
 "We've got a lot of people who from a character standpoint fit in, a lot of blue-collar guys," Pat Gillick said recently from Seattle. "But we are not a small-market team. I'd call us a high-end mid." 
 Gillick, the Mariners' executive vice president and general manager, set the team's payroll this season at $80 million, about $25 million less than that of the Yankees, who begin a weekend series tonight in Seattle. Still, in the parlance of the New York real estate market, the Mariners are not exactly the equivalent of a rent-stabilized apartment.
The Mariners turned a $14.2 million profit last season. They sell $195 seats behind the plate at Safeco Field and no team produces higher ratings for its local broadcasts. Forbes magazine estimates the Mariners' value at $323 million, 11th in the major leagues. And despite the perception of them as have-nots following the 0 for 3 they hit when facing free-agency curveballs from Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, they retooled smartly, not cheaply. Combining $5 million in salary with a onetime $13 million rights expenditure, they coughed up $18 million alone this year for the Japanese sensation Ichiro Suzuki.
"The game is not a precise game, but you try to be precise," Gillick said. "The difference between New York and Seattle is that New York can afford a mistake. We can't."
So what is the moral of the Mariners, who have torn through April and May and matched their geographic perch in the American League West, as Rodriguez and pitching-poor Texas have sunk to the bottom? Mostly, they remind us not to embrace simplistic cures like Commissioner Bud Selig's shot of franchise contraction across the bow of the players association, the first sure sign of impending labor war.
As veteran observers in Seattle will tell you, the Mariners just a decade ago were as much the junkyard candidate the Montreal Expos now are, a bad team with a worse ballpark in an uninterested market that its owners denounced as too small.
Kansas City, as these adjustable classifications go, is a small market. St. Louis is not. Baltimore is not. Minneapolis is. Somewhere between the extremist rhetoric is the Mariners' middle-ground mantra: invest in your product, and you will be supported at home. Make smart trades and reasonable free-agent investments, and you will make money, too.
Maybe the most intelligent decision Seattle ever made was to configure a ballpark, not a launching pad. Following the 1994 strike, baseball became addicted to the home run, its wonder drug, via hitter-friendly parks and most likely an enlivened ball and possibly some synthetically manufactured bodies. Longtime practitioners of indoor pinball, the Mariners played the hand dealt by Griffey and Rodriguez and gradually tailored their roster to a dimensionally equitable facility.
This has required, Gillick said, a trust in baseball nuance, nothing Seattle fans were accustomed to. On the telephone, he was reveling in Tuesday night's victory over Chicago, thanks to an eight-pitch at-bat by right fielder Suzuki that produced a mighty three-hopper up the middle, and a 9-4-5 putout that cut down the tying run at third with none out in the ninth.
"Working the pitcher and a perfect throw from the right-field corner to the cutoff man to third are things that don't show up in the box score that you have to believe can hold your fans' attention," Gillick said.
In Seattle's slumping dot.com economy, the Mariners are drawing large crowds because they not only have a new park; they have also sustained a quality club since the mid-90's. "The true small-revenue teams might carry it on for a year or two, but they can't replace players when they lose them," Gillick said. "Something still has to be done."
The bargain basement Twins are up. The moneyed Mets are down. Donald Fehr must be basking in these surprising early season developments that include the Mariners, but only to a point.
They can't be the Yankees, who have brilliantly built a dynasty but can also shrug off checkbook mistakes like the Cuban third baseman Andy Morales. The Mariners have spent money but within market limits, which they seem to have mastered, along with baseball's new fundamentals, defending against the free agent's hit-and-run.

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Earnings Decline 51% at Gap 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 17 

 BODY:
Gap Inc. said today that its first-quarter profit fell 51 percent as it continued to struggle with sluggish consumer spending and declining same-store sales.
 The company, based in San Francisco, said its profit for the quarter ended May 5 was $115 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $235 million, or 27 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Sales rose to $3.2 billion from $2.7 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent. 
 Gap operates the Gap chain of apparel stores, Banana Republic and Old Navy.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 12 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The company released its results after the close of trading, and in after-hours trading the company's stock was up 20 cents a share. In regular market trading, Gap rose 75 cents, to $34.90 a share.
In the first quarter, same-store sales at its Gap domestic stores fell in the mid-single digit range, while Banana Republic brand same-store sales fell in the high-single digits. Same-store sales at Old Navy stores fell in the high-single digit range, and Gap international sales fell in the high single-digits. 
Gap said it had seen improvements in the last several months, but it expected to rely on promotions and markdowns to sell its summer inventory. As a result, same-store sales are expected to fall.

HEADLINE: The Changing American Family 

 BODY:
Few sociological metaphors have ever been as successful as that of the nuclear family, which entered the language in 1949 at the beginning of what turned out to be the baby boom -- another highly successful figure of speech. The phrase "nuclear family," meaning a married man and woman living with their offspring, was introduced by the anthropologist George Murdock, who openly acknowledged the implicit metaphor. "Among the majority of the peoples on earth," he wrote, "nuclear families are combined, like atoms in a molecule, into larger aggregates." But he also noted that in our own society, the nuclear family was "the type of family recognized to the exclusion of all others." 
 The cultural truth acknowledged in that last sentence is one of the reasons why the Census Bureau's new data on family structures in America are so interesting. For the past half-century, this country has tended to think of the state of the nuclear family as a leading moral indicator. Now, for the first time, fewer than a quarter of the households in this country are made up of nuclear families -- 23.5 percent to be exact, down from 25.6 percent in 1990 and 45 percent in 1960. Also, for the first time, the number of people living alone is greater than the number of nuclear families. Meanwhile, the number of unmarried couples nearly doubled in the past decade to 5.5 million, still vastly fewer than the 55 million married couples. 
 It is certainly possible to read these figures as unwelcome deviations from a fundamental norm, as conservative groups like the Family Research Council do. But the dominance of the nuclear family in the 1950's and 1960's was just as much an expression of prevailing economic and sociological forces as its lack of dominance is now. The broad social shifts underlying these data -- the prevalence of women working outside the home, the decline of agricultural households, the ever-growing mobility of Americans, the postponing of marriage and childbearing, the extension of life spans -- do not necessarily point toward a more fragile social structure, even though some changes, like the increase in the number of single women with children, are troubling. What they point to is the flexibility and the increasing complexity of American family arrangements.
The ideological emphasis on the nuclear family in recent decades has caused us to forget that the nuclear family itself, especially in its suburban, Ozzie and Harriet form, is a reduction of what family has meant in most places at most times in human history. The American nuclear family has been notable, to borrow George Murdock's words, for not combining into larger aggregates, like extended families, but for sticking to itself. 
You only have to have grown up in a nuclear family to understand the good it can do. But even children who grew up in nuclear families have contributed to their decline as they have gone on in many cases to form non-nuclear families of their own. What the new census data underscore is an increasing awareness that the nuclear family is not the only kind of family or even the only healthy kind of family. In modern America no type of family can really be recognized to the exclusion of all others.

HEADLINE: Banks Growing Cautious on Loans 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The number of banks that have tightened standards for credit card loans surged early this year amid worries consumers would have difficulty paying debts in a slowing economy, according to a survey released today.
 The survey, released by the Federal Reserve, also said that banks remained cautious with business borrowers. 
The survey said that 20 percent of banks reported that they put stricter standards on credit card loans over the last three months, compared with 12 percent in the final three months of 2000. 
 The Fed survey also said that banks' standards for approving residential mortgage loans were largely unchanged. Low mortgage rates have helped to keep the housing market strong.
The Fed surveyed loan officers from 55 large domestic banks and 21 American branches of foreign banks.
Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, told a House committee today that while both lenders and borrowers have become more cautious, there still is a healthy flow of credit.

HEADLINE: Notes on Fed Rate Reductions Show Debate on Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chose not to cut interest rates between scheduled meetings at one point last month because of concern that it would unsettle the financial markets, but a week later it decided to cut rates anyway as evidence mounted that the economy was continuing to weaken, according to minutes of the deliberations released today.
 The summary of the Fed's policy debates at its scheduled meeting on March 20 and in two subsequent conference calls in April show that officials of the central bank were monitoring economic data, business plans and investor sentiment especially closely in what they termed "rapidly changing and highly uncertain circumstances." 
 The summary also showed them grappling with how to balance pressure from Wall Street for more aggressive monetary easing with their desire to focus primarily on economic data rather than the ups and downs of the financial markets.
After cutting rates in March and April, the Fed went on to reduce rates yet again on Tuesday, its fifth half-point cut of the year, in an effort to keep the economy from sliding into recession. 
The minutes disclosed that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and other members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee considered cutting rates during a telephone conference call on April 11, three weeks and a day after having cut the central bank's benchmark rate by half a percentage point at a regularly scheduled meeting in March. That reduction disappointed the stock market, which had hoped for something more. 
The conference call came a week after the government reported that the economy had shed jobs at a rate not seen since the last recession in 1990 and 1991, prompting calls from investors for the Fed to take more aggressive action to head off a steeper downturn. But during the call, Fed officials decided that the full array of economic data did not yet require an emergency rate cut.
The economic indicators "did not indicate that the economy had been weakening further, but they raised questions about the potential strength of a rebound in growth over coming quarters," the minutes said in summarizing the discussion. "In particular, heightened business concerns about future sales and further downward revisions to expected earnings threatened to restrain capital spending for some time."
The committee agreed that it would probably have to cut rates again soon. But it decided to hold off on that day, the minutes said, in part because "the attendant surprise to most outside observers risked unpredictable actions in the financial markets."
The minutes said the Fed had judged the markets at that point to be "especially volatile." It is unclear what led the central bank to that conclusion. Stock prices had been rising in the days before the conference call, in part because of expectations that the Fed might act, although the market had been jittery the week before.
A week later, on April 18, the committee held another conference call. It came on the heels of reports that several large companies, including Cisco Systems, had downgraded their earnings outlook and cut their capital spending plans. Fed officials have become increasingly convinced that a sharp decline in capital spending could be the biggest problem facing the economy.
"In addition to the continuing concerns about business plans for capital investment, consumer spending had leveled out and confidence had fallen further," the account of the conference call said. "In these circumstances, lower interest rates were likely to be necessary to foster more satisfactory economic expansion."
The minutes said that "a few" members of the committee wanted to delay any rate cut until the scheduled meeting on May 15. But, judging markets to be "more settled," they all eventually went along with a half-point cut that day, reducing the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 4.5 percent.
The minutes suggested an unusually wide array of opinions among the committee members about how to proceed throughout the period. 
At the scheduled meeting on March 20, some members lobbied for a rate cut of three-quarters of a percentage point. 
The Fed had been cutting interest rates in half-point increments but was under growing pressure from Wall Street to do something more. Still, a majority of the committee favored a "focus on the economy," the minutes suggested. When the Fed held its reduction to half a percentage point that day, stock prices tumbled.
There were also debates during both the conference calls in April about whether it was wise for the Fed to change policy between scheduled meetings, the minutes said.

HEADLINE: Newspapers Plan More Cuts As Their Ad Revenues Fall 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
With advertising revenue showing no signs of rebounding, newspapers owned by companies like the Gannett Company and Knight Ridder are intensifying their effort to cut costs.
 USA Today, Gannett's flagship newspaper, announced earlier this week that it was laying off journalists for the first time since it was founded in 1982, according to its spokesman, Steven Atkinson. The size of the cut -- 6 journalists out of a newsroom of 435, plus 7 employees of usatoday.com -- belies its symbolic impact in a company that has long told the employees of its 99 United States newspapers that it rarely lays anyone off. 
 Tara Connell, a spokeswoman for Gannett, said yesterday that job cutback decisions were being made at individual newspapers, and that Gannett executives had not set any companywide targets for cost reduction. Through a spokeswoman, the company's chief executive, Douglas H. McCorkindale, said yesterday: "We have no corporate mandated numbers. We have no corporate mandated margins. It would be dumb to manage like that."
At the Miami Herald Publishing Company, which is owned by Knight Ridder, the job cuts announced this week were more extensive. But executives at The Herald hope to achieve the desired level of staff cutbacks through a voluntary buyout -- the same approach being used at The New York Times.
The Herald, fresh from a banner year journalistically and financially -- it won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Elian Gonzalez case and capped a financial turnaround by achieving 22 percent margins -- is now trimming 10 percent of its staff, or about 180 people from its total work force of 1,900, according to its publisher, Alberto Ibarguen.
Asked about the effect of the cutback, Mr. Ibarguen said, "It tightens your operation at a time of declining revenues, which is simply common sense." He added, that "since it is a permanent reduction, it sets you up for the possibility of improved margin performance when the economy comes back."
Cutbacks are also being discussed at several other Knight Ridder newspapers, including The San Jose Mercury News, The St. Paul Pioneer Press, The Kansas City Star and The Akron Beacon-Journal. Editors of four of those newspapers were in San Jose yesterday meeting with top corporate executives to discuss budgetary issues.
The New York Times Company reported April advertising figures Wednesday. Compared with April 2000 -- a banner month, in which advertising revenues at The New York Times newspaper increased 16.5 percent from the previous year -- the advertising revenue last month was down 16 percent, led by a falloff in advertising for technology products, telecommunications, media and entertainment.
Newspaper advertising revenue in the Times Company as a whole decreased 15.4 percent for April 2001, compared with the period a year earlier. This figure did not include the revenue of seven regional newspapers that were sold last year.

HEADLINE: Big Change Is Bearing Down On Small Town; 
College Gets Rich Graduate To Pump Some Money Into the Old Place

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: AURORA, N.Y., May 15 

 BODY:
The rumors spread like one of those morning fogs coming off Cayuga Lake, creeping into the conversations outside the post office. Before long, some of the hushed discussions about this woman called Pleasant were anything but.
 She's buying the candy store called Mack's, came the word. And the Old Post Office building; and the Abbott House, that spectacular home on the lake; and the rambling and empty Leffingwell House; and two farms up on Sherwood Road. She's also bidding on MacKenzie-Childs Ltd., a local home-furnishings business that has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 There came the sense that people should not linger too long in one place, lest they be bought up, too. 
Of course, rumors thrive in information vacuums. All that residents here knew for sure was that Pleasant T. Rowland, the extremely wealthy founder of the American Girl doll business, and Wells College, a major local employer and her alma mater, were concocting ambitious plans to spruce up this inviting but frayed village. Change was coming fast, it seemed, like one of those 18-wheelers that barrel through the village, shaking foundations.
Most residents knew that Aurora was slowly succumbing to the economic coma that has overtaken so many upstate towns; after all, the Aurora Inn, the linchpin to the community, was closed -- again. But there was something unsettling about having a benefactor emerge to shore up the village with her money. The thought chafed against the community's sense of democracy and independence, and it raised the obvious question: At what cost?
The answer, they hoped, would come on Monday night, when Pleasant Rowland herself was to speak at a public meeting that she and Wells had called to explain plans that were already in motion. It would be in the Morgan Opera House, just above the public library, and there would be refreshments afterward. The meeting would clearly be the hottest event here since the fire that took most of the business district in 1919. 
"Pleasant Rowland could revitalize the village," said George Peter, a resident and retired researcher at Cornell University. "But there are legitimate concerns that she may make this village into what she would like this village to be, and not what the residents of the village want it to be."
Aurora was once a port town, the place where farmers in this stretch of the Finger Lakes region would bring their goods to be shipped up to the Erie Canal. But that way of life vanished, and over the last half-century the shrinking village became more reliant on Wells, one of the country's oldest liberal arts colleges for women.
"The success of the village and of the college are so intertwined that you can't hit one without hurting the other," said the mayor, Tom Gunderson.
The mayor reflects that symbiotic relationship; he is a Wells employee, as are three of the village's four trustees. The village has maybe 800 residents, and roughly half are Wells students. Wells also owns much of the property here, including the Fargo Building -- with the only bar -- and the Aurora Inn, which traditionally brought money-spending visitors to town.
In recent years, though, the 168-year-old inn provided less charm than poor service and uncomfortable rooms. So last fall, Wells closed the inn and set out to find help. 
Lisa Marsh Ryerson, the exuberant college president, sought out Ms. Rowland, Class of '62, who had earned a fortune with her American Girl dolls. Sold mostly through catalogs, Addy ("a courageous girl" who escaped slavery in the Civil War), Kit ("a clever, resourceful girl" of the Depression) and the other dolls came with stories, accouterments and even matching clothes for their young owners.
Admirers said the dolls evoked American history and stressed independence; critics said that at nearly $90 each, the dolls were meant for the affluent and some were just a tad creepy. But no one could dispute their profitability. In 1998, Ms. Rowland sold her business to Mattel Inc. for $700 million.
Ms. Rowland, 60, lives with her husband, W. Jerome Frautschi, in Madison, Wis., where they have donated tens of millions of dollars. She had also spent $2 million in 1995 to renovate the Wells campus's public spaces; that gift reflected her belief in the importance of presentation in marketing.
In late March, Wells College and Ms. Rowland announced plans to create the Aurora Foundation, a limited liability company intended to "bolster economic activity in the heart of the village." The announcement came as post office rumors were spreading about a red-hot real estate market being generated by a single buyer with a singular name. Those rumors brought a meeting of "concerned citizens," which brought more rumors.
Some residents were flattered by the attention. Others thoroughly distrusted the process and feared that Aurora would become "Pleasantville": a cutesy tourist destination anchored by some doll museum. As Sheila Edmunds, the village historian, put it, "I'm not a doll person."
So when signs went up this month trumpeting a town meeting at the opera house, people cleared their calendars. The village seemed split between those who were enthusiastic and those who didn't even trust the offer of post-meeting refreshments.
"People are excited about buildings being saved," Joe DeForest, the owner of the Shakelton Hardware store, said Monday morning. "But the scary thing for people is one person, one entity, having control of so much."
Across the street, Doris Reynolds sat behind the dusty counter of her Mack's variety store, surrounded by jars of Tootsie Rolls and Smarties. For decades she has been the town's gentle heart, serving ice cream in the summer to children still glistening with lake water. But she is 68 now and fighting an illness, she said, and Ms. Rowland paid her asking price for the store.
"I sold her the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel," Mrs. Reynolds said, as a regular named Bill helped himself to some maple walnut ice cream. "I'd always asked this price, which was high because I really didn't want to sell it. But right now I've got to get well."
At 7 Monday night, Mrs. Reynolds and others -- the hardware-store owner, the historian, the mayor -- were sitting on the edges of their opera house seats as Ms. Ryerson began the evening's carefully orchestrated presentation, complete with slides. 
She said the Pleasant T. Rowland Foundation would contribute at least $4 million in cash, as well as $800,000 worth of property, to the new foundation, and incur all losses. Wells College would contribute the inn -- which would be redesigned and renovated -- and a few other properties, and collect the revenue. The new foundation would also pay real estate taxes on all its properties.
A short while later, Pleasant Rowland, stocky with short-cropped white hair, approached the lectern to read her speech. " She said she wanted to answer questions raised by a village poll, including "Why is she in Aurora?" and "What property has she bought and why?"
She began by saying that many of the seeds for the American Girl dolls were planted in the village, and that she wanted to repay Aurora. "I need no return on my investment," she said. "I want no return. I will take no return."
She also warned that the Aurora Foundation "can't help in an environment of distrust, suspicion and confrontation." She asked that the village give the foundation "a chance to earn your trust as we help execute this vision."
These remarks elicited no response, but when she said she had indeed signed an agreement to buy the Leffingwell House and planned to use it "as my personal home in the village," the room resounded.
She addressed other rumors. No, she had not bought any farms. Yes, she had bought the Abbott House but had no plans to turn it into a doll museum. As for Mack's, she hoped to have the store refurbished in time for the summer crush of children.
And yes, it was true about MacKenzie-Childs. She said that when she heard some prospective bidders were proposing to move the business, which employs roughly 240 people, she submitted her own bid to keep it in the village. (Its founders, Richard and Victoria MacKenzie-Childs, are also planning to bid.)
Ms. Rowland got a final round of applause for expressing the hope that everyone in the room will witness "a new day for Aurora, a second sunrise for this dear place."
The meeting ended a few minutes later. There was no question-and-answer session; instead, Ms. Rowland and Ms. Ryerson mingled with the people munching on the free cookies. Each woman declined to talk to a reporter, and then they left. 
The next day, residents and merchants pondered what they had heard. Ms. Rowland seemed sincere, many said, and her loving but sharp view of the village was on target. 
Still, not all concerns were allayed. The new foundation's board of managers would have five members, three appointed by Ms. Rowland and two by the college. And Ms. Rowland had said that one of her longtime employees would be her choice for executive director. What voice the village would have in the foundation was not clear.
"I do think that she's acting out of a certain benevolence; I don't doubt that," Mr. DeForest said as he stood behind his hardware store's counter. "But I do believe that she has some kind of vision. And if you see that, and like that, it's wonderful."
As he spoke, a representative of Pleasant Rowland walked into Mack's variety store across the street. There were matters of renovation to tend to.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Old Hospital Is Centerpiece Of a Luxurious Compound

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
For more than 25 years, a French Renaissance-style chateau on Central Park West between 105th and 106th Streets has sat vacant, falling ever further into decay as one developer after another abandoned efforts to restore it. 
 Now, as plans to transform it into a luxurious residential complex are finally coming to fruition, the interiors of the landmark structure are being scooped out, gingerly so as not to weaken the building's skeletal shell or its cone-shaped turrets. 
 It is a scene of devastation en route to grandeur in the far from exclusive but rapidly changing Manhattan Valley neighborhood. At the rear of the building, which began as the nation's first cancer hospital and was converted to a nursing home in the 1950's, the foundation for a sleek adjoining 25-story tower is being sunk. 
All told, there are to be 100 condominium units, 19 of them in the renovated chateau, 81 in the tower, many of them with panoramic views of Central Park and the Hudson River. The two buildings will surround a landscaped bluestone courtyard and will be connected by a lobby described by its designer, David Rockwell, as romantic with cast bronze screen walls.
The developer is Daniel E. McLean, 53, president and chief executive of the MCL Companies in Chicago, which is currently putting up River East, a $2 billion development there with seven residential towers, 600,000 square feet of retail space, 400,000 square feet of offices and a 455-room hotel. Mr. McLean is also developing a large chunk of Fisher Island off Miami.
Even for New York, Mr. McLean's debut on the real estate stage with this project has been dramatic. "A friend of mine on Fisher Island told me about this unbelievable property 24 hours before the bids were due" in March 2000, Mr. McLean said as he picked his way around the site earlier this week. "I flew in with a construction team from Chicago and saw this dark and scary wreck that had not been occupied for 24 years. I liked the challenge."
Zoning for a tower had been approved in 1987 during the ownership by a previous developer, so the only zoning change Mr. McLean needed was for a parking garage. 
The landmark portion of the $150 million project has a storied past. Founded in 1884, the New York Cancer Hospital was designed with circular wards on the theory that they would prevent the accumulation of germ-bearing dust in corners. In the 1950's, the building was acquired by Bernard Bergman, the notorious nursing-home operator, who was later convicted of Medicaid and tax fraud. Known as the Towers Nursing Home, it was closed in 1974.
Traces of radium in the cellar are among the legacies of its medical past. "The owners are in the process of removing all the spots where we found any reading of radium that came from the use of radium needles for cancer care at the turn of the century," said Sandra Mullin, associate commissioner of public affairs for the New York City Health Department. "When the process is complete, we will do a final inspection based on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards for safety." 
Peter Bafitis, whose firm, RKT&B Architects, designed the project in collaboration with Perkins Eastman Architects, has been involved with it through all its fits and starts since 1984. "This was a particularly difficult project because of the economics of restoring a landmark," he said. "The tower was necessary because no one could possibly restore this landmark and make a reasonable return for the money without additional development." 
The exterior of the Towers Nursing Home was declared a landmark in 1976, and, Mr. Bafitis explained, "a new interior is to be inserted into the old shell." 
By any standards, the 19 apartments in the landmark building will have some spectacular characteristics, including, in some units, circular living-dining rooms with 40-foot diameters and ceilings ranging from 12 to 36 feet high. One duplex, for example, will be spread out over two turrets, with the living-dining room to be contained in one, the master bedroom in the other.
Although prices have not been firmly established, Mr. McLean said they would probably range from $3 million to $6 million. 
In the tower adjunct, the number of apartments per story will decrease as the building rises to only one on the 21st to 25th floors. The full-floor units will have 360-degree views and will include 40-foot terraces. Prices for apartments in the tower will range from about $750,000 to $6 million, he estimated. 
Asked why he would succeed where others had failed, Mr. McLean responded: "Timing is everything. The New York market of the early 1990's was not ready for this, nor was the neighborhood. Now demographics have changed, and people are more affluent."
And besides, he added, "there is no other product like this available, and certainly not on Central Park West."

HEADLINE: $22.5 Million Sale Breaks Contemporary-Art Records 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Seminal contemporary artworks, by masters like Bruce Nauman and rising stars like Maurizio Cattelan who were little known to the public two years ago, became expensive objects of desire at Christie's last night.
 It was the final evening in a week of back-to-back auctions of postwar and contemporary art. Bidders and spectators crowded into Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters, exuding consumer confidence. Buyers were willing to spend, spend, spend, breaking price records for 10 contemporary artists. 
 Of the 51 lots, only 8 failed to sell. The sale totaled $22.5 million, far above its $17 million high estimate.
The most exciting moment came when bidding started for Bruce Nauman's "Henry Moore Bound to Fail (Back View)," executed in 1967. A wax cast of the artist's back tied up and bound with string, it was considered by experts to be "a history-book piece." Christie's estimated the sculpture at $2 million to $3 million, and three bidders wanted it badly. After a tense battle between the Manhattan dealer Lucy Mitchell-Innes and a telephone bidder, the sculpture sold to the latter for $9.9 million, a record for the artist. Gasps could be heard when the hammer fell, and the room burst into applause.
Then came the speculation. Some people were convinced the buyer must be a mega-rich European; others were betting that Phyllis Wattis, one of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's biggest benefactors, was buying it for the museum. Christie's executives declined to identify the buyer. They confirmed that there was museum buying last night but said museum buyers were not prepared to announce their purchases.
(Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Another record was set for Mr. Cattelan, although it wasn't as much of a surprise as the high price paid for Mr. Nauman's sculpture. For two months now, Christie's has been crowing about selling a version of Mr. Cattelan's cutting-edge 1999 installation "The Ninth Hour," a room-size work depicting a realistic life-size wax figure of Pope John Paul II in white robes, felled by a meteorite that crashed through a skylight.
Its installation at Christie's, overseen by the artist, was the first time the piece had been shown in America, and it drew more than 3,500 visitors. Three telephone bidders went for the installation, which soared above its $400,000 to $600,000 estimate to sell for $886,000.
Its price could arguably be an example of the power of marketing. The image was the cover of last night's sale's catalog and the subject of Christie's advertisements.
Auctiongoers will remember similar hype from Christie's last year when "Woman in Tub" (1988), a sculpture of a woman grabbing her breasts by the 1980's art star Jeff Koons, brought $1.7 million. Last night, another cast of the same piece had an estimate of $1.5 million to $2.5 million. What a difference a year makes: it sold to an anonymous buyer for $2.8 million.
Throughout the week, works of Jean-Michel Basquiat brought big prices, and last night was no exception. Four buyers wanted a 1983 triptych with many of the artist's angry faces. Estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, it ended up selling for $974,000. The buyer was believed to be Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate and Basquiat collector.
Donald Judd's untitled 1987 sculpture of galvanized iron and turquoise plexiglass was another popular piece. It went to an unidentified buyer for $633,000, nearly twice its $350,000 high estimate.
Results for some younger artists were mixed. Cindy Sherman's "Untitled Film Still No. 48" (1979), from an edition of 10 showing a young woman standing on a deserted road, was estimated at $150,000 to $200,000. Four bidders went for the photograph, which sold to an anonymous American collector for $336,000.
But works some of the young British artists who were wildly popular several seasons ago performed poorly. A painting by Gary Hume, "Four Colored Doors" (1989-90), failed to sell. Estimated at $100,000 to $150,000, it fell flat at $85,000. Damien Hirst produced mixed results. "When Logic Dies," a white Formica table with medical instruments, failed to sell, but one of his dot paintings brought $314,000, above its $250,000 low estimate.
Prices for unique pieces by two other British artists, Chris Ofili and Jenny Saville, broke records.
Mr. Ofili's "X + Y = 0" (2000), a diptych supported by pieces of the artist's signature elephant dung, sold for $237,000, above its $200,000 high estimate.
Ms. Saville's 1992 painting "Interfacing" sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $198,500.
"Some of the hype has gone out of the market for younger artists," Ms. Mitchell-Innes said after the sale. "Especially for those artists whose works exists in editions. People realize there's not need to pay a lot of money when another is likely to come up for sale."

HEADLINE: Farm Subsidies: Who Gets Fed? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It's unclear whether your May 14 front-page article about farm subsidies implies that farmers shouldn't receive help or that eligible farmers should look as if they're right out of "The Grapes of Wrath." With farmers' real net cash income at the lowest level since the Great Depression and record high costs, the needs are obvious. 
 The "free market" permits foreign producers, aided by tariffs and subsidies, to undercut our farmers through predatory pricing -- which would be illegal if practiced by one American business against another.
If we deny farmers help, America loses its farmers, the economy suffers, and we're left with a food policy resembling the energy policy that brought us the $2 gallon of gas. The question is, When Americans pay less for food than anyone else in the developed world, why do that?

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: THE DETAILS; 
Excessive Regulation Is Blamed for Energy Woes

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's national energy policy is a glossy, picture-filled and comprehensive look at nearly every energy issue facing the United States today, but buried in the text is single stark conclusion: Excessive regulation has produced the worst energy crisis in decades.
 The report states at the outset that the nation faces an energy crisis, which it defines as a "severe imbalance between supply and demand," because there has been no comprehensive policy that aims to increase domestic sources of energy. Energy problems have not been this bad since the 1970's, it says. 
 But unlike the situation in the 1970's, when the nation grappled with an international oil boycott and the enemy was undoubtedly OPEC, the only identifiable villain in this report is the proliferation of domestic regulations, most of them aimed at protecting the environment. The administration views many federal regulations, especially as interpreted by the Clinton administration, as impeding industry's ability to find oil and natural gas and to build power plants and pipelines. 
"Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly burdensome," the report says. "Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities, making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, price spikes and supply disruptions."
The 170-page policy paper devotes the bulk of its text, which reads in parts like a nonpolitical academic study, to examining how to reduce energy demand and cultivate clean sources of energy like wind and biomass, as agricultural, human and animal waste are known. The administration has emphasized that of its 105 specific recommendations, highlighted throughout the text with blue stars, 42 deal with conservation, efficiency and renewable energy sources, while only 35 address supplies of traditional energy sources.
But the report's priorities are evident from the start. The first chart in the report, which illustrates how energy consumption is outpacing production, uses a mix of government statistics to make the future shortfall in production seem more acute than it might turn out to be.
The chart uses estimates from the Energy Information Administration to show rising energy consumption over the next 20 years. But it relies on data from the Sandia National Laboratories to show production increasing at the same pace it did in the 1990's, when record low prices for electricity, natural gas and oil discouraged domestic production. The energy agency actually projects that energy production will rise at a much faster pace than it did in the 1990's because of a cyclical recovery in production.
The policy recommendations with the most teeth, many of which the president has the power to implement without Congressional approval, suggest that the administration views increasing the supply and improving the infrastructure of oil, natural gas and nuclear power, as overwhelming priorities.
Among the many regulations it has vowed to review, streamline, expedite or eliminate are land-use restrictions in the Rocky Mountains, lease stipulations for off-shore and coastal zones where oil and gas are plentiful and environmental reviews required when utilities want to retool power plants or oil companies want to expand refineries.
The federal government controls 31 percent of the land in the United States, and too much of that is off-limits to energy companies, the report says. It calls the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where drilling is banned by Congress, "the single most promising prospect in the United States."
Democrats and moderate Republicans have already lined up against the lifting of land and off-shore drilling restrictions elsewhere, making the prospect of short-term action in those areas unlikely.
The regulatory rollback singles out the Environmental Protection Agency's procedures for approving the updating of power plants, especially those using coal, and refineries. Industry executives complain that the oversight, known as New Source Review, became too aggressive in the Clinton years, resulting in widespread litigation that actually discouraged companies from taking steps to clean up operations.
The report also says that the Justice Department will be asked to review pending litigation with an eye to ending lawsuits against energy companies that did not comply with the Clinton administration's interpretations of environmental rules.
The Bush team's regulatory focus has already prompted a backlash in Congress, where Democrats say the solution to energy shortages is investing in new energy efficiency technologies, not loosening environmental controls.
"This report relies on the heavy polluters of the past and looks to ease important environmental protections," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Although the report reviews all the major ways the nation could reduce energy demand or boost supply of nonpolluting energy sources in the years to come, its recommendations in these areas are relatively weak. It proposes no specific targets for energy efficiency, offers only vague guidance on financing, and puts off decisions in many areas until new research is complete.

HEADLINE: Booming Nashville Inaugurates a New Country Music Hall of Fame 

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, May 17 

 BODY:
Some rolled up in wheelchairs and hobbled on canes. Others swaggered in Stetsons and sauntered in dresses designed by the local fashion kingpin, Manuel. They were the country-music giants of the last seven decades -- Harlan Howard, Earl Scruggs, Brenda Lee, George Jones, Trisha Yearwood and dozens more.
 The occasion was the grand opening this morning of the new Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the $37 million crown jewel in Nashville's downtown revitalization project and a replacement for the rustic barn-shaped original Hall of Fame, which opened a mile away on Music Row in 1967. 
 Country music itself has been experiencing a troubling downturn in sales, but Nashville, the capital of country music, has been in the midst of a construction boom. The visitor today will see a green road sign pointing the direction to the Country Music Hall of Fame and the $45 million Frist Center for the Visual Arts. Just three months ago, neither building was open.
Also in the last couple years, sprouting up around the dusty old honky-tonks of lower Broadway have been a new arena, with its own National Hockey League team, the Predators; a new stadium with a football team, the Tennessee Titans; statues of musicians like the guitarist Chet Atkins; new hotels; and a soon-to-open $50 million public library.
The constant tension in Nashville between the modern and the traditional was evident at the hall of fame's opening ceremony, where Gov. Don Sundquist had a few choice words for the executives of Music Row.
"If I could make one wish, I'd make a wish that we could have some more airtime for our earlier performers," Mr. Sundquist said, echoing words on the lips of several music fans watching the ceremony in front of the museum, which included performances by Emmylou Harris, Marty Stuart, Vince Gill, George Jones and Kathy Mattea. 
"Real country music tells the story of the people," said Paul Rayl, a 67-year-old Whirlpool maintenance technician from nearby Murfreesboro, who was attending the ceremony because museum admission, normally $14.95 a head, was free today. "People have pain and heartaches, and country comes closer to describing them than any other kind of music."
Populism, said Kyle Young, the hall of fame's director, was an inspiration behind the new museum's design. The building by the local firm Tuck Hinton Architects is a symbolically rich structure: depending on what angle it is viewed from, it resembles a piano, a Cadillac fin, a bass clef or a radio tower. Since the building's groundbreaking 23 months ago, there has been a rush to raise private and public money to complete construction.
Just a month ago, there was still a gaping hole in the building, through which curators hauled in, by crane, two prize collection pieces: Elvis Presley's gold-colored Cadillac and Webb Pierce's Pontiac Bonneville, customized with pistol door handles and a gearshift mounted on a saddle. 
Wednesday night, employees were still constructing display cases, removing graffiti from an elevator and finishing other last-minute details on the interior, which was designed by Ralph Applebaum, who is perhaps best known for the Holocaust Museum in Washington.
The four-story museum's core is two floors of artifacts, films and interactive displays tracing the history, artists and many side branches of country music.
The museum's archivists, curators and audio restoration team, once buried in the basement of the old hall of fame, now work behind glass windows in the center of the building, like living exhibits.
"We're going to have to work on our curatorial dress code," said Mr. Young, who started working at the museum 25 years ago as a ticket collector.
Perhaps more than any other music hall of fame, Nashville's is tied into the lifeblood of the music it represents and the culture of the nation. Many country stars, including Ms. Yearwood and Ms. Mattea, worked at the museum in its old location; the reference books, magazines and CD's that the museum's foundation produces are essential for any country music buff; and its longtime director, William Ivey, is now head of the National Endowment for the Arts.
Mr. Young said that early research estimated that 550,000 visitors would come to the museum in its first 12 months. But, he said, since the addition of several corporate sponsors to help with financing and marketing, he is setting his sights higher.
"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame did one million in its first year," Mr. Young said, "so I guess I'm admitting that I'll be disappointed if I don't do a million."

HEADLINE: City Shows Job Growth in Face of Slowdown 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
New York's economy is clearly slowing, but is far stronger than the nation's, according to data released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.
 Indeed, despite the loss of almost a quarter of a million jobs nationally in April, the number of new private-sector jobs edged up statewide, and jumped in New York City. 
 Adjusting for seasonal factors, company payrolls in the city rose by 9,700 jobs in April, according to the city comptroller's office. Statewide, companies added about 2,200 jobs in April, after seasonal adjustment, the Labor Department said, which suggests that parts of the state outside the city lost jobs. 
"The employment statistics for April 2001 show that the weakening national economy is affecting some regions and industries in New York," said Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki. "However, New York's relative job performance continues to improve" compared with the rest of the nation.
Not all the news was good for New York workers. In both the city and the state, the unemployment rate jumped by 0.3 of a percentage point, more than the national increase of 0.2 of a percentage point in April. That put the city's jobless rate at 5.4 percent and the state's jobless rate at 4.3 percent. Nationally, the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent.
Economists caution against putting too much weight on a single month's change in the unemployment rate, which sometimes moves erratically. Even data on jobs, which tend to be more reliable, are subject to big swings every month. So some economists prefer to look at rolling 12-month periods to evaluate the strength of job creation, a major indicator of economic health.
By that measure, New York City is growing four times as fast as the nation. Over the last 12 months, private sector jobs grew by 2.6 percent, while the national average was 0.6 percent. The city economy has clearly cooled since fall, however, when its job growth rate hit 2.9 percent.
The state's private-sector job creation rate is now 1.8 percent, three times the national rate but down from 2.4 percent in September.
Some of the state's biggest cities have been hit by the nationwide downturn in manufacturing. In Rochester, jobs actually fell by 0.3 percent over the last 12 months.
Some economists and public officials remain concerned about the future strength of New York City's economy, especially if earnings for brokerage firms do not recover. A model developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is forecasting even slower growth in the second half of this year, said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the bank.

HEADLINE: Commencement; 
At Rutgers, Graduation Is a Family Affair

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., May 17 

 BODY:
Among the 10,300 students who graduated from Rutgers University this year were a mother and daughter.
 Hindy Alster and her daughter Amy both received bachelor's degrees this afternoon. 
 "College wasn't as emphasized when I graduated high school in 1964," Mrs. Alster, 53, said in an interview earlier this week. "But I always wanted to go back to school." 
Amy Alster, 24, enrolled in Rutgers in 1999, after a short leave from the University of Maryland. Her break from college made her parents nervous, she said. "My mother never graduated from college until now, and she didn't want me to be like her -- regretting it for years." So Ms. Alster returned home and joined her mother as roommate -- and classmate. "We didn't see each other on campus that much, but we did take one class together," Amy Alster said. During lectures in Sociology of Women, their shared class, she said: "It was weird. Sometimes I would stop and look over and think: I'm in college with my mom. But we would look at each other and smile when we spoke up in class." 
Mrs. Alster added, "We motivated each other." 
At the main commencement, the president of Rutgers, Francis L. Lawrence, said: "In the 21st century, the engine of economic growth is fueled by knowledge, and New Jersey is rich in the natural resources that count most: highly educated citizens like you." 
Graduate students and some undergraduates attended the ceremony, at Louis Brown Athletic Center, one of 19 events at Rutgers' three main campuses scheduled through May 25, when Senator Jon S. Corzine is to address law school graduates at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.
Students looked serious today as they listened to Dr. Lawrence, while families punctuated his sentences with flashbulbs and arm-waving. 
Honorary degrees were given to Kevin J. Collins, chairman of the Rutgers board of governors; Mae C. Jemison, the former NASA astronaut who was the first black woman in space; Walter Kohn, who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in chemistry; Paris Qualles, a screenwriter, producer and director; and Elaine Showalter, a feminist critic. Mr. Collins and Mr. Qualles are Rutgers alumni; Ms. Showalter was a professor at Rutgers in the 1970's.
At Newark, an honorary degree was given to Richard Butler, who was an Australian ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the United Nations special commission to disarm Iraq.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: CONSERVATION; 
Plan Proposes Voluntary Efforts

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

 BODY:
The Bush energy policy describes conservation as one of the "important elements of a sound energy policy," and notes that in the last three decades, the American economy has grown nearly five times faster than energy use.
 But in looking to the future, the policy shies away from mandatory approaches to conservation, except to direct that federal agencies develop a plan in the next 30 days to "conserve energy use at their facilities" to the maximum extent possible. 
 That approach has faced sharp criticism from environmental groups and many Democrats, who say the Bush plan puts too much emphasis on increasing energy supply and too little on reducing demand. 
With average fuel economy for passenger vehicles now at a 20-year low, officials of national environmental groups have said the most important immediate step the administration could have taken would have been to tighten automobile fuel efficiency standards, which have not been changed in more than a decade.
Instead, Mr. Bush's energy task force recommended that a review of those standards by the secretary of transportation be delayed until at least July, to await a study by the National Academy of Sciences, which is to report on the ability of automakers to meet stricter fuel-efficiency standards. The task force also directed that any future standards "increase efficiency without negatively impacting the U.S. automobile industry," a guideline that environmentalists said would most likely restrict all but incremental change.
The Bush policy does call on the treasury secretary to work with Congress on legislation that would offer a tax credit of undetermined size for fuel-efficient vehicles. It recommends that "a temporary, efficiency based income tax credit be available for purchase of new hybrid fuel-cell vehicles between 2002 and 2007."
On other conservation fronts, the Bush policy calls for the energy secretary to promote greater energy efficiency, in part by expanding the government's Energy Star labeling program providing consumers information about energy efficiency of appliances beyond the air-conditioners, refrigerators, freezers and other appliances already covered. Mr. Bush's policy also directs the energy secretary to improve the energy efficiency of particular appliances. DOUGLAS JEHL

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: LOOKING ABROAD; 
Better U.S. Access To Oil Is a Goal

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's energy policy recommends expanding world production of oil, especially in Latin America and Africa, while rethinking American support for sanctions against energy-producing nations and deepening links to resource-rich Canada and Mexico.
 The plan notes that the United States, which now consumes more than 25 percent of the oil produced worldwide, will find itself increasingly in competition for oil with rapidly industrializing countries like China. 
 It largely recommends meeting that demand by improving American diplomatic ties and the overall business climate in certain countries, taking advantage of new technologies and bold construction strategies to develop unexploited fields and avoiding an international commitment on global warming. 
"We can strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working cooperatively with key countries and institutions to expand the sources and types of global energy supplies," the plan says.
Environmental groups criticized that strategy, saying it gives short shrift to conservation and energy efficiency and would encourage developing nations to add to pollution associated with climate change.
The plan focuses on improving American access to oil, noting that the United States is virtually self-sufficient in all other energy resources. The document urges Washington to deepen its integration with Canada, the nation's largest energy trading partner, and Mexico.
The plan urges federal support for a privately constructed natural gas pipeline to run from Alaska, across Canada to the mainland United States.
The plan encourages exploration specifically in the Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa and the Caspian nations. It calls on federal officials to help clear obstacles to construction of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean.
Still, it predicts that Persian Gulf nations will supply as much as two-thirds of the world's oil in two decades and urges officials to seek a better investment climate in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.
The plan urges a comprehensive review of the nation's policy on sanctions, taking "energy security" into account. The oil-producing nations Iran, Iraq and Libya are currently under economic sanctions backed by Washington. CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

HEADLINE: UAL to Provide Private Jets For Businesses 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., May 17 

 BODY:
The board of the UAL Corporation approved plans today for a new business-jet unit that would serve corporate customers and complement its main carrier, United Airlines.
 The company plans to add 200 jets to the unit over five years, with corporate clients sharing ownership of most of the aircraft. The new business will own some of the jets and operate them as part of a unit separate from the main airline. 
 UAL, which is based in Chicago, is turning to the new business-jet service just as the slowing economy is leading corporations to cut their travel budgets. The upscale service also comes at a time of heightened customer dissatisfaction.
"A lot of our big corporate customers are in need of this type of service," James E. Goodwin, the company's chairman and chief executive, told reporters after UAL's annual meeting in Palm Beach.
Executives would not say how much the company planned to invest. UAL found plenty of demand for the new service in research with 400 companies over 18 months and is now in early negotiations with aircraft suppliers, Mr. Goodwin said.
"We don't want this to become a business that is embedded inside the core airline, so it is our intent to operate this as a separate subsidiary with people who know how to run this business," he said.
The new business-jet venture would allow corporate clients to buy portions of a jet and share ownership with other companies -- called fractional ownership -- while the UAL unit operates and provides crews for the aircraft.
The unit would employ a separate work force for the service. While the company would oversee maintenance of the planes, the work may be done under warranty by the manufacturers.
The unit may also provide charter service, link the company's main airline service to hard-to-reach international destinations or act as a corporate shuttle worldwide.
The company will use the new service to offer corporate customers a full package of air travel services and to attract more customers to all the company's services, Mr. Goodwin said.

HEADLINE: Citigroup to Buy Mexican Bank In a Deal Valued at $12.5 Billion 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS and TIM WEINER 

 BODY:
In the biggest Latin American acquisition by a United States company, Citigroup announced yesterday that it would buy Mexico's second-largest bank for $12.5 billion in cash and stock.
 The purchase of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival demonstrates Citigroup's faith in the recovery of Mexico's economy and banking system since the financial crisis of 1994. 
 Citigroup officials said they saw tremendous lending potential in Mexico and hoped to use the company's Banamex brand name to serve the fast-growing Hispanic population in the United States as well.
Citigroup's vice chairman, Robert E. Rubin, engineered the $20 billion bailout of the Mexican financial system when he was United States Treasury secretary and helped put the latest deal together. Officials from Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, known as Banacci, called him about a month ago, he said in an interview yesterday. 
"Today's announcement represents Citigroup's commitment to Mexico and to the belief in the potential of this country, to the belief in the further integration of Mexico and the U.S. economy, and to the grander vision of the North American economy," Mr. Rubin said at a press conference.
"How different the picture is today than it was five or six years ago," he added. Citigroup's announcement helped push the Mexican peso to its highest level since 1998, and Mexican stocks rose 6 percent on the day.
After the Banamex purchase, the three biggest banks in Mexico, representing about two-thirds of the nation's bank deposits, will be controlled by foreign institutions. The transfer of ownership heralds a recovery from a banking crisis that began in December 1994 with the collapse of the peso.
The collapse compelled the Mexican government to put together an estimated $100 billion bailout of the banking system. Foreign investment was then stimulated by the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Citigroup's $12.5 billion deal nearly equals all foreign direct investment in Mexico last year.
Citibank has been in Mexico since 1929, and it has been a favorite institution of the Mexican elite. When the country nationalized the banks, including Banamex, in 1982, Citibank was allowed to remain in Mexico even while most foreign banks were sent packing. In the late 1980's, Citibank was crippled by bad loans to Latin America. 
Citigroup, which is the largest banking company in the United States and owns the Travelers insurance company and the Salomon Smith Barney securities firm, sees room to greatly expand lending operations in Mexico. Loans represent just over 10 percent of gross domestic product in Mexico, said Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, in an interview yesterday. That compares with about 29 percent of Brazil's output and 72 percent in the United States.
Mexico's treasury secretary, Francisco Gil Diaz, noted that it was hard for ordinary people in Mexico to obtain a loan or a mortgage. The deal "should help restore credit," he said, and is a tremendous vote of confidence in the country.
The Banamex purchase will also help Citigroup reach the 21 million people of Mexican descent in the United States, Citigroup officials said, without providing details of their marketing strategy. This group grew 53 percent in the 1990's, according to recent census data.
"There is a very large Hispanic economy in the U.S., which we can reach out to through Banamex," Mr. Rubin said in the interview. "The G.D.P. of that population may be as much as 80 percent of Mexico's G.D.P.," which is about $600 billion, he said.
Among the opportunities is an estimated $8 billion in funds sent home by Mexican workers in the United States each year. Although President Vicente Fox is pushing for lower transaction fees on such wire transfers -- from as high as 25 percent to as low as 2 percent to 3 percent -- it remains a profitable business, said Luis Plascencia, associate director of the Texas office of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. "Citigroup can earn a profit at both ends," he said.
Banamex owns California Commerce Bank, which has two branches in Los Angeles and provides banking services to individuals and companies that conduct business between the United States and Mexico.
The deal will put Banamex and its chairman, Roberto Hernandez, back at the pinnacle of finance in Mexico and Latin America. The company lost its top rank in Mexico in June, when a rival, Grupo Financiero Bancomer, accepted the Spanish Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria's proposal to merge with its local unit, Grupo Financiero BBV-Probursa. That deal created Latin America's largest financial group. Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain controls Serfin, Mexico's No. 3 bank.
Mr. Hernandez said that the deal was not one of weakness. "We're not doing this because we need the capital -- quite the opposite," Mr. Hernandez said. The deal with Citigroup, he said, would provide "the financial integration we need to accelerate economic development" in a world of free trade and globalization.
Mr. Hernandez's stunning rise to affluence parallels that of Citigroup's chairman, Mr. Weill, the Brooklyn-born son of immigrants from Poland. Raised on his father's farm in the state of Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Hernandez came to Mexico City as a teenager more than 40 years ago and sold produce in the streets. He progressed from fruit to financial instruments in 1971, setting up a brokerage house and buying low during the 1980's.
By the early 1990's, when Mexico's stock market was booming, Mr. Hernandez was one of the richest men in Mexico, a billionaire broker with political connections to presidents. In those years, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's effort to convert the country to a free-market system created an unusual alliance between the government and Mexico's wealthiest businessmen, and the government sold off state-owned enterprises and the tycoons bid for the richest prizes.
In 1991, Mr. Hernandez led a group of investors that bought Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex, which had been the government's biggest bank before it was privatized. Along with the name came assets then valued at $29 billion and one of the best private art collections in Mexico. He and his partners eventually bought all of Banamex's government-held shares, paying 2.6 times book value, a full price of $4.61 billion. At the time, the roughly $40 billion in financial assets that Banamex and Accival managed equally accounted for about 40 percent of the assets in Mexico's financial system. Mr. Hernandez and Alfredo Harp, chairman of the parent company, will join the Citigroup board after the deal is completed.
Banacci, with just $35.2 billion in assets, is a relatively small bite for Citigroup, which has $946 billion in assets.
Citigroup's predecessor, Citicorp, has a complicated history in Mexico. Its connections to the ruling class were underscored after the arrest of Raul Salinas de Gotari, brother of former president. Raul Salinas was accused of secretly transferring $90 million to $100 million out of Mexico from 1992 to 1994 using Citibank accounts. A 1999 report by the General Accounting Office said that the agency "could not determine whether Citibank's actions violated law or regulation."
Though Citicorp was crippled by loans to Latin America in the late 80's, Citigroup has been expanding in emerging markets under Mr. Weill, whose penchant for ever-bigger mergers was capped by the combination of the Travelers Group and Citicorp in 1998. With the Banamex purchase, which is expected to be completed by September, Citigroup will get 25 percent of its profits from emerging markets, up from 21 percent, Mr. Weill said. Last year, it acquired Bank Handlowy of Poland.
Analysts praised Mr. Weill's latest deal.
"Citigroup was able to acquire the best banking franchise in Mexico," said Brent Erensel, a bank stock analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "Banamex gains the Citigroup's funding advantage and wide product mix, and Citigroup gains a dominant position in a fertile banking market."
With half of the $12.5 billion purchase price to be paid in Citigroup shares, the bank will apply to become the first foreign company listed on the Mexican Bolsa, Mr. Weill said.
Under the terms of the deal, Citigroup will pay a 43 percent premium for Banacci. It will issue 126.9 million new shares and pay $6.25 billion in cash to Banacci shareholders. Shares of Citigroup fell $1.10 yesterday, to close at $50.69 a share, while Banacci's shares rose 29 percent, to 22.58 pesos, or $2.51 each.

A Perfect Storm?

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
President Bush is not responsible for America's energy crisis, its current economic slowdown or even for all the tension between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and certain allies. What he is responsible for, though, is managing these situations. And that is what's worrying.
 It's not worrying because the Bush folks are incompetent. They are not, as they showed in deftly managing the spy-plane crisis. What is worrying are the combination of three factors that could produce a perfect political storm: 
 First, the Bushies came into office with the attitude that everything Bill Clinton did -- everything -- was wrong and needs to be reversed. Second, they came into office bearing Republican theological positions on tax cuts, the environment and missile defense -- positions that were hatched in conservative think tanks and chanted with religious devotion, but were never tempered by the real world as it has evolved over the last eight years. Yet early signs are that the Bushies will say or do anything to get their radical tax cuts made, their oil wells drilled and their missile shield built -- no matter what's going on in the world. Finally, they came into office controlling the Senate, the House, the White House and the Supreme Court, so there are no brakes.
Let's look at all this in detail. Although President Bush made the obligatory nod to conservation in his energy speech, we know that his real views were voiced by Vice President Dick Cheney. Judging from his sneering remarks about conservation, Mr. Cheney believes that conservation should be a misdemeanor, akin to smoking marijuana. Real men drill wells. Former President Jimmy Carter properly ripped Mr. Cheney apart in yesterday's Washington Post for the V.P.'s put-downs of conservation. Mr. Cheney's dismissals, Mr. Carter indicated, only revealed an ignorance of what conservation and energy efficiency have done since the late 1970's to reduce America's energy bills -- let alone what they could do in the future with some vice presidential leadership.
On the tax cut, we again have the Republican theology that all problems can be solved by slashing taxes. This view completely ignores the fact that the bipartisan fiscal discipline of the last eight years, which was produced by the Clinton team and the Republican Congress and eliminated the deficit, is the centerpiece of everything good that has happened with the U.S. economy. It freed up private capital that financed the biggest investment boom in our history -- just when the information revolution happened to occur -- which has produced a burst of innovation, productivity and wealth that has revolutionized the American industrial landscape. In doing so, it has increased our economic power in the world and our ability to lead.
Why would we risk tampering with such hard-won assets? Do you really believe that the Clintonites had it all wrong on the economy in resisting a large tax cut? As others have noted, Mr. Clinton may have lied about his sex life, but he, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers told the truth about numbers. The Bushies are all good boys who go home to their wives at 6 p.m., but that's after a day of fudging all sorts of numbers to get their mammoth tax cut passed.
Personally, if I have to choose, I prefer people who cheat on their wives to people who cheat on our kids.
On foreign policy, the Bushies are so besotted with the idea of building a Star Wars missile shield now that they are telling the public that it's worth building even if it doesn't fully work. Meanwhile, in their latest budget, they have slashed $100 million from Nunn-Lugar and other programs that help Russia properly dismantle its old nukes and safely store nuclear materials. What kind of "realist" is it who is ready to spend $100 billion on a defense system that may not work against the least likely threat -- a rogue missile -- but won't spend $100 million on the most immediate threat: loose nukes spewing out of Russia to terrorists? That is a realism lost in theology.
I'm not here to refight the election. Mr. Bush won, and he's entitled to push his policies. But we are entitled to be worried. Because there are no brakes here. But guess what? There is a wall. Several, actually. They are called the bond market, the allies and the world at large. And if these guys keep going in the radical directions they are going, at the speed they are traveling, they are going to hit something real hard. Normally, I wouldn't mind. It would serve them right -- except we're all in the back seat.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: THE INDUCEMENTS; 
Hybrid Cars Should Merit A Tax Credit, Report Says

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
People shopping for appliances could find that the canary-yellow energy-consumption stickers now on the front of every new refrigerator and air-conditioner will begin appearing on microwave ovens and clothes dryers as well. 
 Auto dealers could lure buyers with signs on some of the cars in their showrooms advising of thousands of dollars in tax credits. And people considering buying a house that uses solar energy, or adding that capability to their existing houses, might qualify for a tax credit, too. 
 Most of the report from the task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is trickle-down energy policy, proposing inducements for corporations and even changes in foreign policy to try to lower prices, but there are a few proposals for direct impact. Not a one is completely new in character, but experts say one in particular might be more effective than previous efforts: tax help on cars that use less fuel. 
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, signed by the president's father, the government offered tax inducements to buyers of vehicles that ran on natural gas, methanol and other "alternative fuels."
But that tax break did not help much because few of those vehicles were attractive to consumers, said Douglas I. Greenhaus, the director of environment, health and safety at the National Automobile Dealers Association. A tax credit on hybrid vehicles, as proposed in the Cheney report, might have more impact, Mr. Greenhaus said.
"The public is going to be much quicker to adopt these vehicles than those that required a totally different fueling system," he said. "I don't know exactly what proposal will work out in the end, but I see these things flourishing in the middle of this decade."
Hybrid vehicles now marketed by Toyota and Honda, and planned by many other manufacturers, are fueled only with gasoline. But they also carry electric motors and a small battery pack. The batteries are charged when the driver decelerates the car, and the wheels turn the motors, creating current that flows back into the batteries; when it is time to accelerate, the motors draw current from the batteries and help take the load off the gasoline engine.
The report recommends helping the industry get started by offering a credit from 2002 to 2007, but it does not say how big the credit should be; bills already introduced in Congress would offer $2,000 to $4,000. The Clinton administration had proposed credits for cars that got high mileage, but Congress did not go along. 
At the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents major domestic carmakers and foreign companies alike, Gloria J. Bergquist, a spokeswoman, said, "What we're looking for is folks who are predisposed to buy one of these vehicles, the early adopters, and this is the added inducement for someone on the cusp."
A complication for the hybrids is that while the Japanese models are both small sedans, some companies plan hybrid sport utility vehicles. The result could be to help buyers of large vehicles cut their gasoline bills to levels similar to a sedan's, using tax dollars, a subsidy that environmentalists would not favor.
The Cheney report also calls for tax credits for buyers of fuel cell cars, which convert hydrogen to electricity through a chemical process, although the prospects for these vehicles are less certain.
For home appliances, the report suggests expanding product labeling to more products and increasing minimum efficiency standards "where technologically feasible and economically justified."
The Energy Department already has the authority to do that, under laws dating from the late 1980's, but the Bush administration has so far not been aggressive in using the strategy. It recently rolled back a last-minute standard from the Clinton administration to raise the efficiency of central air-conditioners by 30 percent; the new administration picked 20 percent instead.
Existing rules cover clothes washers, window air-conditioners, refrigerators, water heaters and a variety of other appliances. Dan W. Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy under President Bill Clinton, said that the appliances were chosen according that to their potential for improvement and that the ones listed in the Cheney report had such potential.
The report also recommends adding $300 million to help the poor pay their energy bills, and linking financing of the program to the price of oil and natural gas. It would also double money for improving insulation in the homes of poor people.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Plan Colombia 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has proposed a counternarcotics strategy for Latin America that seems to reflect an understanding of the limitations of the plan it inherited from Bill Clinton, which relies overwhelmingly on military aid to Colombia. The Bush proposal wisely stresses a broader regional approach along with economic development and crop substitution. If that approach can lead to a genuine reorientation of drug policy, it will deserve Congressional support. 
 Under current policy and budget allocations, Colombia is the primary recipient of American anti-drug aid. Plan Colombia, as the Clinton administration program was called, provides $1.3 billion in American assistance over two years, most of it for military spending and coca eradication efforts. The new package would provide $882 million to seven countries over several years, divided equally between drug interdiction efforts and economic assistance, which would address some of the social and institutional problems underlying the drug production and political violence in the region. 
 Colombia would still be the largest recipient of American aid, receiving 45 percent. Half of that would go to programs aimed at promoting judicial reform, local government and crop substitution. The balance of the package would provide aid to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela -- longstanding allies in the drug war -- as well as to Brazil and Ecuador, which have increasingly seen their border areas used by Colombian guerrillas and traffickers.
Unfortunately, the Bush administration remains committed to Plan Colombia, and money has already been provided for it. The danger of Plan Colombia remains that it could entangle American military personnel in the stalemated Colombian civil war. It also links the United States with an ineffective and abusive Colombian army, which maintains extensive ties to murderous paramilitary militias. 
Though a more balanced regional approach to combating drugs would be welcome, Washington should be under no illusions about the limitations of such an effort. The United States has spent many billions of dollars on counternarcotics programs abroad, yet the flow of drugs into this country has scarcely abated, and both cocaine and heroin are cheaper and more plentiful than ever. Even the best-designed efforts to stem the supply of drugs abroad are bound to fail without a better-financed effort to curtail demand for them at home.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A New Focus on Supply

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Under federal law, anyone wanting to drill oil wells, lay pipelines or build power plants has for decades been required to prepare an environmental impact statement clearing the project on environmental grounds.
 Now, as a central part of his new energy plan, President Bush is calling for attention to the flip side of that approach. Under an executive order that Mr. Bush is to issue on Friday, any federal agency considering steps that might adversely affect the nation's energy health would have to issue a new kind of impact statement, this one on energy grounds. 
 Together with the calls the administration makes in the report on energy policy it issued today to "streamline," "expedite" or even remove obstacles to energy production, the new directive represents an important shift of emphasis.
Instead of "why drill?" for example, the basic presumption of the Bush team seems to be "why not?" Under that approach, the interior secretary, Gale A. Norton, is being instructed "where opportunities exist" to review and modify restrictions that stand in the way of oil and gas leasing across America's public lands, the report says, adding parenthetically, "consistent with law, good environmental practice and balanced use of other resources." 
In the 170-page report, the administration dismissed as old-fashioned the idea that any tension existed between environmental protection and energy production.
Such a distinction, it said, represented a "false choice" because "an integrated approach to policy can yield a cleaner environment, a stronger economy and a sufficient supply of energy for our future."
But in the swirl of praise and criticism that surrounded the report today, there was considerable debate concerning whether the administration was injecting a much-needed balance into deliberations over new projects or courting environmental risks with can-do rhetoric and recommendations. 
Jerry Jordan, who represents the companies that drill roughly 85 percent of the country's oil and gas wells, defended the Bush plan, saying he believed it would put the country on the right track by interpreting environmental rules in a less restrictive way.
"The net effect, from our viewpoint, will be that things become more reasonable," Mr. Jordan, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said.
But David Alberswerth, who served in the Interior Department during the Clinton administration and now works for the Wilderness Society, an environmental advocacy group, offered a different interpretation.
"The language throughout the report conveys the idea that environmental protections equal impediments and we have to find a way to surmount them," Mr. Alberswerth said. "But we view these protections as necessary to protecting the wildlife, water quality and scenic quality of public lands."
Except for repeating a call to go forward with oil and gas exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a plan that Congress is not likely to approve, the Bush report offers little guide to where the administration might aim in seeking to accelerate energy development. Among the leading targets, though, have been the gas-rich public lands in the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico.
While the administration deferred a decision related to the Clean Air Act, it made clear that it wants the Environmental Protection Agency to soften its interpretation of a provision that coal-fired power plants and oil refineries say has limited their capacity to expand.
The Bush policy is vague about exactly what changes the administration will embrace on projects involving the construction of oil and gas pipelines, hydroelectric and nuclear plants. But the report's tone is consistently bullish and implicitly critical of past approaches that it suggests have been overcautious. 
To help bypass "overly burdensome" restrictions on the construction of power plants, transmission lines, pipelines and refineries, the report says, President Bush plans to issue a separate executive order "directing federal agencies to expedite permits and coordinate federal, state and local actions necessary for energy-related project approvals on a national basis in an environmentally sound manner."
That overall approach drew an objection today from David Hayes, who served as deputy interior secretary during the Clinton administration. "I'm very skeptical about the extent to which environmental regulations have held back any appropriate energy production," Mr. Hayes said.
Bush administration officials emphasized today that nothing in what the president was proposing would take away from the power of environmental impact studies, which have been required since 1970 under the National Environmental Policy Act for virtually any major project that might disrupt natural habitats.
The studies, which must address a broad range of economic and environmental issues, have been the main forum for critics within the government and the public to challenge oil drilling and other projects.
On the other hand, the incorporation of a new energy-impact statement into the Office of Management and Budget's reviews would give energy issues a kind of symbolic parity with environmental ones. 
"This would provide us with the kind of voice in the federal policymaking process that we haven't had before," said R. Skip Horvath, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association.
Some environmental lawyers and others who have fought to protect public lands from development said they viewed the broad thrust of the administration's policy as a plan to open doors that have been closed since Ronald Reagan was president.
"The signal is, let's turn back the clock, get the oil leasing done, get the mining approved and have a holiday of exploitation on public lands," said Todd True, a Seattle lawyer for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fun, an environmental advocacy organization.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: NUCLEAR POWER; 
Technology Called Safer Than in Past

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Nuclear power plant construction has been dormant in the United States for the last two decades, but as President Bush pointed out, existing plants provide 20 percent of the nation's electricity with 103 plants functioning. Still, the last American nuclear power plant to enter operation was ordered in 1973.
 Since then, safety requirements, which increased after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, have kept the industry from expanding. It has also been plagued by financial woes, including high interest rates and long construction times, stretching the average time to put a new plant in service to 14 years and souring Wall Street on financing nuclear power plants. 
 The Bush energy plan could give a substantial boost to the industry. It declares the technology much safer than it was 20 years ago. It says the administration should encourage the relicensing of nuclear plants, which would not require Congressional action, and should seek legislation to reduce taxes that it says impede mergers of nuclear utilities.
But it still has no solution for the complex problem of nuclear-waste disposal. Plants now store nuclear waste on site, waiting for a national repository. "The Department of Energy is over a decade behind schedule for accepting nuclear waste from utilities," the report concedes. Studies to determine whether Yucca Mountain, Nev., is suitable for a repository have dragged on.
The report echoes an industry idea to add reactors to sites that already have them. This approach could eliminate the highly contentious issue of finding new sites for such plants.
"Many U.S. nuclear plant sites were designed to host four to six reactors, and most operate only two or three," the report states.
Polls show that Americans are less concerned about nuclear power than they are about coal, largely because nuclear power is cleaner and does not contribute to global warming. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH, PUSHING ENERGY PLAN, OFFERS SCORES OF PROPOSALS TO FIND NEW POWER SOURCES

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: NEVADA, Iowa, May 17 

 BODY:
President Bush began an intensive effort today to sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the American people, arguing that the country had a future of "energy abundance" if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between energy producers and environmental advocates.
 Mr. Bush's plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals -- many that he can impose by executive order -- for finding new sources of power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies. 
 His critics swarmed over the specifics, noting that the plan set no targets for improved energy efficiency, offered no short-term relief for out-of-control electricity prices in the West and provided only modest financing for research into clean energy technology.
The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near St. Paul that burns a variety of fuels, including oil, coal and waste wood, to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day. The parties in the energy debate have "yelled at each other enough," Mr. Bush said. "Now it's time to listen to each other." Excerpts, Page A14. 
"Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection," Mr. Bush added, before flying here, to a farming town north of Des Moines, to continue his argument at a small biomass plant that makes power by burning materials derived from animal waste and plants. "As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about America's energy future; as if the people who produce America's energy do not care about the planet their children will inherit."
Mr. Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political thread, arguing that if America failed to act now, "this great country could face a darker future, a future that is, unfortunately, being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California." 
Mr. Bush also said rising energy prices had put an intolerable burden on families and farmers. But some of the statistics in his own report seemed to undercut that claim. One chart showed that the share of disposable household income spent on energy had declined to less than 5 percent today from 8 percent during the early days of the Reagan administration. (That percentage has begun to rise again, but only to the levels of the mid-1990's, before a sharp drop in energy prices.)
Mr. Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail, raising the specter of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreign oil suppliers. He argued, for example, that the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, which he wants to open to drilling, can produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 47 years. "That happens to be exactly the amount the United States now imports from Iraq," he said.
Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention with Democrats and some moderate Republicans, many of whom argue that the Bush administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuels at the expense of the environment.
Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced approach, it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and conservation.
"America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. "The energy crisis is not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis."
Republicans offered far more support for the president. Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he planned hearings next week to begin consideration of 25 recommendations in the Bush report that require legislative action.
"Not everyone is going to like this plan," Mr. Murkowski said, "but at least now we have a plan to kick around."
He said the previous administration had failed to grapple with the nation's energy sources through a comprehensive plan. Clinton administration officials disputed the assertion and blamed Congress for failing to enact energy legislation.
Yet even Mr. Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Mr. Bush's approach. He said the report offered few immediate remedies for California's electricity crisis or for rising gasoline prices. He said Republicans might have to consider a gas-tax rollback or the temporary suspension of some environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks.
Mr. Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a long-term energy policy. His report contained 105 initiatives -- although many of them are endorsements of actions already in place. And while in his public comments he always started with talk of conservation, the report itself was much more specific when it came to tapping new supplies.
"No matter how much we conserve, we're still going to need more energy," he said here this afternoon. "The State of California is the second best state at conservation, and yet they are still running out of energy."
Among those who took a different view was former president Jimmy Carter, who wrote in The Washington Post this morning that the United States did not confront an energy crisis comparable to those of 1973 and 1979.
"World supplies are adequate and reasonably stable, price fluctuations are cyclical, reserves are plentiful," he argued. Mr. Carter said "exaggerated claims seem designed to promote some long-frustrated ambitions of the oil industry at the expense of environmental quality." 
Some chapters of the energy plan resemble the annual reports issued by energy companies, with color photos of bears living happily in the wilderness, forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and fly-fishermen wading in pristine water, practicing the favorite sport of the report's main author, Vice President Dick Cheney.
While the report clinically assessed all the available sources of energy and promised to encourage development of those that do the least environmental damage, it fell far short of describing the moon-shot approach to efficiency and renewable energy that was an ambition of the Carter years.
In fact, federal spending on research and development of wind, solar, geothermal and biomass energy sources, as well as on energy efficiency technology, has never equaled the $3 billion spent in 1980, Mr. Carter's final year in office, even after adjustments for inflation.
If the Bush plan were fully put into effect, it would potentially double what the administration had planned to spend over 10 years for renewable energy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energy-efficient products, like hybrid cars.
But the estimated $10 billion commitment over that period is below what the Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period, and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some cutting-edge energy technologies commonplace.
"Americans spend $600 billion a year on energy," said John Holdren, an energy and environmental policy expert at Harvard who helped draft a Clinton administration study of clean energy sources. "The Bush people are proposing to change habits by incentives that amount to about one-tenth of one percent of that amount each year. It's not very significant."
Though the report devotes more chapters and more recommendations to measures related to the environment, conservation and renewable energy than those related to traditional sources the impact of what the administration intends to do to increase traditional energy supplies greatly outweighs what it aspires to do to diminish demand.
The report notes that efficiency in homes and offices could help reduce the need for new power plants, which it says must total at least 1,300 by 2020. But it adopts no goal for such improvements.
In the same manner, addressing auto efficiency standards, the report reviews how Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates improved the performance of combustion engines in the 1980's. But it puts off any decision on whether to raise those standards now, saying the administration would wait for a study to be completed. 
The report is far less tentative in the area regulations it identifies as hindering the oil, gas, nuclear and utility industries.
It mentions about a dozen areas -- including land-use restrictions in the Rockies, lease stipulations on offshore areas attractive to oil companies, the vetting of locations for nuclear plants, environmental reviews to upgrade power plants and refineries -- that could be streamlined or eliminated to help industry find more oil and gas and produce more electricity and gasoline.
California, where soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts have been the main contributor to the idea that the nation faces on energy crisis, gets little in the Bush plan. The report notes that federal agencies have been asked to reduce peak power use in California in coming months, but that is far less than California officials want.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, called the plan "a bible for long-term energy production and not even a pamphlet for the urgent short-term actions needed to help us get out of the crisis" in her home state. She particularly criticized Mr. Bush's refusal to call for electricity price caps in California.
In what seems likely to be one of its most contested recommendations, the Bush team recommends creating a national electricity grid, akin to the interstate highway system, and giving federal agencies the right to take land for electricity transmission by eminent domain. That proposal has already come under attack by Western governors and is sure to be a battle in Congress.

HEADLINE: A Misguided Energy Proposal 

 BODY:
President Bush's long-awaited energy plan is as flawed and one-sided as its advance notices suggested it would be. Its 105 separate provisions include several potentially useful proposals aimed at improving energy efficiency and modernizing the country's power grid and pipelines. It also challenges Congress and the country to a long-overdue debate about nuclear power. But on the whole it is an alarmingly unbalanced piece of work whose main objective seems to be to satisfy the ambitions of the oil, gas and coal industries, either by easing environmental rules or by opening public lands for aggressive exploration.
 The plan fails on an even more fundamental level. It warns that the nation is in the midst of an energy crisis that "will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our national security" -- a point repeated yesterday by Mr. Bush as he took his energy campaign on the road. But nowhere does the report persuasively make the case that such a crisis exists. 
 True, California is in obvious trouble, and rising gasoline prices at the pump are discomfiting. But that is not by any stretch a "crisis" like those confronted by Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. California's problems arise mainly from a deregulation plan gone awry, and gasoline prices are actually lower, in real terms, than they were in the early 1980's. The acute shortage of natural gas that the report complains of is beginning to disappear as more wells are drilled in response to rising prices. Finally, the report's alarming estimates of the growing gap between consumption and production of oil and natural gas over the next 20 years -- bedrock data on which Mr. Bush's drilling strategy depends -- do not take into account any important new programs aimed at increasing efficiency, even though such programs have confounded official predictions in the past by greatly reducing the country's energy use. 
The report is not without value. Though the document was hatched in secret, it could well stimulate an open debate on the country's energy future. More specifically, it proposes some long-overdue capital spending on the country's transmission lines and natural-gas pipeline system. In a nod to the conservationists whom Vice President Dick Cheney has been belittling, it offers hefty tax credits for hybrid cars that run on gasoline and electricity. In addition, the report promises to study possible increases in the fuel economy of the nation's fleet of cars and light trucks -- though nobody really expects Mr. Bush to risk any political capital on changes that the automobile industry opposes and Congress itself has refused to make.
The plan also urges a new look at the potential value of nuclear power, which currently generates about 20 percent of the country's electricity but whose growth has been stalled for decades by legitimate safety concerns over waste disposal as well as by the high cost of building new plants. The plan makes a case for increasing nuclear power to diversify the country's energy base and to reduce the emission of global warming gases, which are a byproduct of plants burning fossil fuels but not of nuclear energy. But it ducks for now the troublesome issue of waste disposal, and it seems almost cavalier in calling for the reconsideration of a quarter-century ban on reprocessing the spent fuel from nuclear plants, a technique that can simplify waste disposal but produces plutonium that can be used to make bombs.
Apart from the tax credits for hybrid cars, however, the plan does little for efficiency or renewable energy. But by far the most controversial of Mr. Bush's proposals are those that would ease environmental regulations and open public lands for more drilling. Although Congress is unlikely to approve his misguided plan to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the president has asked his Interior secretary, Gale Norton, to inventory other federal lands that can be made available for exploration. These include ecologically significant wilderness areas in the Rocky Mountains and part of the outer continental shelf that has been off-limits to the oil companies for a decade. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has asked his Environmental Protection Agency to review clean air rules that, in his view, have placed undue burdens on coal-fired power plants.
The history of most overarching energy strategies is that a few good ideas survive and most of the bad ones disappear. One can only hope that the same fate will befall the Bush program. But it will be up to an attentive Congress to make sure that happens.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN; 
Excerpts From Bush's Speech Outlining a New Energy Policy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech on energy policy yesterday in St. Paul, as recorded by The New York Times:
 To protect the environment, to meet our growing energy needs, to improve our quality of life, America needs an energy plan that faces up to our energy challenges and meets them. Vice President Cheney and many members of my cabinet spent months analyzing our problems and seeking solutions. The result is a comprehensive series of more than 100 recommendations that light the way to a brighter future through energy that is abundant and reliable, cleaner and more affordable. The plan addresses all three key aspects of the energy equation: demand, supply and the means to match them. 
 First, it reduces demand by promoting innovation and technology to make us the world leader in efficiency and conservation. Second, it expands and diversifies America's supply of all sources of energy: oil and gas, clean coal, solar, wind, biomass, hydropower and other renewables, as well as safe and clean nuclear power. Third and finally, the report outlines the ways to bring producers and consumers together by modernizing the networks of pipes and wires that link the power plant to the outlet on the wall. 
Our new energy plan begins with a 21st-century focus on conservation. The American entrepreneurial system constantly invents ways to do more with less. We pack more and more computing power onto a chip; we carry more and more messages over a cable; and we squeeze more and more power out of a barrel of oil or a cubic foot of natural gas. A new refrigerator you buy today, for example, uses 65 percent less electricity than one that was made 20 years ago. Over all, we use 40 percent less energy to produce new goods and services than we did in 1973. 
But this steady improvement slowed in the 1990's. Our energy plan will speed up progress on conservation where it has slowed and restart it where it has failed. It will underwrite research and development into energy-saving technology. It will require manufacturers to build more energy-efficient appliances. We will review and remove the obstacles that prevent business from investing in energy-efficient technologies. . . .
Conservation does not mean doing without. Thanks to new technology, it can mean doing better and smarter and cheaper. Innovation helps us all make better choices. Smart electric meters can tell homeowners how they're using power and how they might reduce their monthly electric bill. Sensors can turn off lights when people leave a room. And innovation is bringing us transmission wires that waste less of the electricity they carry from plant to home or to office.
Conservation on a wide scale takes more than good ideas. It takes capital investment. Outdated buildings and factories have to be upgraded or replaced to consume less and pollute less. And here some well-intentioned regulations have created a Catch-22. Procedures intended to protect the environment have too often blocked environmental progress by discouraging companies from installing newer and cleaner equipment.
Wise regulation and American innovation will make this country the world's leader in energy efficiency and conservation in the 21st century. Our goal is to use less additional energy to fuel more economic growth. And I know we can do so. I also know that conservation is the result of millions of good choices made across our land on a daily basis. Yet even as we grow more efficient, even as this nation achieves the objectives in conservation, we will always require some additional energy to power our expanding economy. We learned that from the California experience.
California has been an impressive conservation leader. It is the second-most energy-efficient state in the union. But California has not built a major new power plant in a decade. And not even the most admirable conservation effort could keep up with the state's demand for electricity.
So the second part of our energy plan will be to expand and diversify our nation's energy supplies. Diversity is important, not only for energy security but also for national security. Overdependence on any one source of energy, especially a foreign source, leaves us vulnerable to price shocks, supply interruptions and in the worst case, blackmail. 
America today imports 52 percent of all our oil. If we don't take action, those imports will only grow. As long as cars and trucks run on gasoline, we will need oil, and we should produce more of it at home. New technology makes drilling for oil far more productive, as well as environmentally friendly, than it was 30 or 40 years ago. Here is a result of one study and I quote: "Improvements over the past 40 years have dramatically reduced the industry's footprint on the fragile tundra, minimized waste produced and protected the land for resident and migratory wildlife."
Those aren't my words. Those are the words of the Department of Energy's study conducted during my predecessor's administration. Advanced new technologies allow entrepreneurs and risk-takers to find oil and to extract it in ways that leave nature undisturbed. Where oil is found underneath sensitive landscapes, rigs can stand miles away from the oil field and tap a reservoir at an angle. In Arctic sites like A.N.W.R., we can build roads of ice that literally melt away when summer comes and the drilling then stops to protect wildlife. A.N.W.R. can produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 40 years. What difference does 600,000 barrels a day make? Well, that happens to be exactly the amount we import from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
We're not just short of oil, we're short of the refineries that turn oil into fuel. So while the rest of our economy is functioning at 82 percent of capacity, our refineries are gasping at 96 percent of capacity.
A single accident, a single shutdown can send prices of gasoline and heating oil spiraling all over the country. The major reason for dramatic increase in gasoline prices today is the lack of refining capacity. And my plan gives the needed flexibility and certainty so refiners will make the investments necessary to expand supply by increasing capacity.
And America needs to generate more electricity. The Department of Energy estimates that America will need between 1,300 and 1,900 new power plants over the next two decades. A high-tech economy is a high-electricity consumption economy. Even the sleekest laptop needs to plug into an electrical outlet from time to time. 
More than half of the electricity generated in America today comes from coal. If we weren't blessed with this natural resource we would face even greater shortages and higher prices today. Yet coal presents an environmental challenge. So our plan funds research into new clean-coal technologies. It calls on Congress to enact strict new multipollutant legislation to reduce emissions from electric power plants.
My administration's energy plan anticipates that most new electric plants will be fueled by the cleanest of all fossil fuels, natural gas. Our nation and our hemisphere are rich in natural gas resources. But our ability to develop gas resources has been hampered by restrictions on natural gas exploration. Our ability to deliver gas to consumers has been hindered by opposition to construction of new pipelines that today are more safe and more efficient. I will call on Congress to pass legislation to bring more gas to market while improving pipeline safety and safeguarding the environment. 
America should also expand a clean and unlimited source of energy: nuclear power. Many Americans may not realize that nuclear power already provides one-fifth of this nation's electricity, safely and without air pollution. But the last American nuclear power plant to enter operation was ordered in 1973.
In contrast, France, our friend and ally, gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. By renewing and expanding existing nuclear facilities we can generate tens of thousands of megawatts of electricity at a reasonable cost, without pumping a gram of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. New reactor designs are even safer and more economical than the reactors we possess today. And my energy plan directs the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to use the best science to move expeditiously to find a safe and permanent repository for nuclear waste.
Our energy plan also supports the development of new and renewable sources of energy. It recommends tax credits to homeowners who invest in solar homes, and to utilities that build wind turbines or harness biomass and other environmentally friendly forms of power. It removes impediments to the development of hydroelectricity. It proposes incentives to buy new cars that run on alternative fuels like ethanol, that consume less oil and therefore pollute less. It supports research into fuel cells, a technology of tomorrow that can power a car with hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, and emit only steam as a waste product.
In all these ways, we will expand the diversity of our energy supply. But as with conservation, new energy supply alone is not the whole answer. There's a third element we must address: modernizing the network that delivers the supply to the point of demand. . . . 
And here, too, technology will make a big difference. Electricity markets used to be localized because wires could not carry electrical current over long distances. More and better wires can efficiently ship power across the country, reducing the threat of local blackouts or outages.
And it's just not our electricity delivery system that has fallen behind. The energy report projects that natural gas consumption will rise rapidly as electric utilities make greater and greater use of this environmentally friendly fuel. We will need newer, cleaner and safer pipes to move these larger quantities of natural gas -- up to 38,000 new miles of pipe and 263,000 miles of distribution lines.

Earnings Are Down a Bit at Dell

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation, the world's largest PC maker and the leader of a grueling pricing war, reported first-quarter earnings yesterday that matched Wall Street's expectations, but the company warned that sales would slow before they improved. 
 For the three-month period ended May 4, Dell reported net income of $462 million, or 17 cents a share, a slight decline from the first quarter a year earlier, when the company earned $466 million, also 17 cents a share. 
 Dell said it would continue to drive prices downward, as it used the efficiency of its built-to-order business model to push the profit margins of its competitors downward. Dell's strategy cut into its own profits. Though net income was flat year over year, revenue increased 10 percent, to $8.0 billion from $7.3 billion during the period a year earlier. 
An expected decline in spending by corporations will probably drive both revenue and earnings down during the current quarter, Dell said. The company, based in Austin, Tex., said revenue might decline as much as 3 to 5 percent from the first quarter. That would leave revenue essentially flat year over year. 
The company said earnings per share would be 15 to 17 cents for the second quarter, depending upon the economy. Wall Street had expected Dell to earn 16 to 20 cents for the second quarter, according to Thomson Financial /First Call. 
The company's stock rose 50 cents yesterday, to $25.88.
Michael Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said he thought the sluggish PC market would begin to recover in the second half of this year, with a possible peak in buying in the second quarter of 2002. He cited increased production of the Intel Corporation's faster Pentium 4 microprocessor, the arrival of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system, and a wave of PC upgrades by people who bought computers in the months before the Year 2000 scare. 
"We see a lot of catalysts that suggest there would be a solid replacement cycle," Mr. Dell said in a conference call with analysts.
In a sharp contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which said on Wednesday that it saw growing weakness in Europe, Dell said revenue increased 11 percent in that region. 
Over all, Dell said it sold 27 percent more computers than it did during the period a year earlier. It managed to do so during a time the worldwide PC market grew less than 3 percent, and the United States market fell nearly 10 percent. Analysts credited Dell's cut-rate pricing.
"I still see evidence that Dell wants to win more share and thinks it can outlast its competitors," said Steve Kleynhans, a vice president with the Meta Group, a market research and consulting firm. "My gut feeling is we've got another three months of price war, then a leveling off."
Dell intends to win customers through attractive prices, then retain their business through strong customer service. The company said its low-inventory model and declining component prices helped keep gross margins at 18 percent of revenue for the second consecutive quarter.
Unless the company's competitors find a way to cut their operating expenses, Mr. Dell said, they will continue to have trouble keeping up in the price war.
"The industry doesn't have a pricing problem; it has an operating-expense problem," Mr. Dell said.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY PLAN: THE STANDARDS; 
Fuel Economy for New Cars Is at Lowest Level Since '80

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 17 

 BODY:
The overall fuel economy of new cars and trucks sold in America, after improving slightly a year ago, has dropped back to the lowest levels since 1980, a new government report indicates.
 President Bush's energy plan called today for improving fuel efficiency, so the report, from the Transportation Department, served to underscore that the auto industry is moving in the opposite direction. 
 The report estimates that the average fuel economy of all cars and light trucks sold in the 2001 model year will be 24.5 miles a gallon, the same as in 1999 and slightly below the 24.7 miles a gallon in the 2000 model year. The peak was 26.2 miles a gallon in 1987, before automakers began selling large numbers of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. 
And those numbers exaggerate fuel economy, because automakers get extra credit for manufacturing vehicles that can run on either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol, even though few of those vehicles are thought to be fueled with ethanol by drivers.
Ford Motor and General Motors have increased their output of the so-called duel-fuel vehicles since 1999, though fewer than one service station in 1,000 sells the ethanol fuel.
Excluding the ethanol credit, the average gas mileage is now lower than in 1999 and at its lowest level since 1980. 
Federal regulations require each automaker to produce cars with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles a gallon. Light trucks -- a category that includes sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans -- must achieve an average of 20.7 miles a gallon. The lower standard for light trucks dates to the 1970's, when it mainly applied to pickups used by farmers and merchants.
According to the Transportation Department report, light trucks from G.M. and DaimlerChrysler were unable to meet even the more lenient standard. The average fuel economy of G.M.'s 2001 light trucks is 20.6 miles a gallon; DaimlerChrysler's average is 20.5 miles agallon. 
Both companies planned to use credits from exceeding the standards in past years to avoid paying millions of dollars in fines for falling short in 2001.
Ford matched the government standard for light trucks, with an overall fuel economy of 20.7 miles a gallon. Most foreign automakers met the regulatory standards by comfortable margins. A few fairly low-volume foreign automakers, like BMW and Ferrari, missed the standards, as they do consistently, and will pay fines as part of the cost of doing business in the United States.
All the automakers' fuel economy figures are calculated using a special methodology that the government allows for regulatory purposes. This methodology produces results that are 18 percent higher than the gas mileage estimates posted on the window stickers of new automobiles. Many drivers complain that they have trouble matching even the window-sticker estimates. 
G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler are producing close to a million dual-fuel minivans, pickup trucks and cars this year, at an extra cost of up to $200 a vehicle for the fuel sensors and stainless-steel fuel lines needed for ethanol. 
The government counts these vehicles as getting roughly triple the fuel economy that they achieve when burning gasoline. The automakers have used the extra mileage credits to sell more full-size sport utilities and pickups while meeting the federal standards for average fuel economy.
David Barthmuss, a General Motors spokesman, said the automaker wanted oil companies to sell more ethanol at service stations. Oil companies have resisted doing so, contending that ethanol can cause problems in their pipelines and is expensive to distribute by tanker truck.
Ford pledged last July to improve the average gas mileage of its sport utilities by 25 percent by 2005, without relying on extra ethanol credits. G.M. responded a week later by vowing to exceed Ford in the average fuel economy of sport utilities and of light trucks over all, also without ethanol credits. DaimlerChrysler said last month that it would keep pace with its main rivals in overall light truck fuel economy, but it had not taken a position on the use of ethanol credits to do so.
In the energy report he released today, President Bush called for improving fuel efficiency through the pursuit of new technologies and subsidies for the sale of hybrid vehicles that use a combination of gasoline and electric propulsion. 
The report acknowledged that few dual-fuel vehicles were actually using ethanol, a type of alcohol produced from corn. The report praised the production of these vehicles, and said without elaboration that further study on ways to increase the actual use of ethanol was needed.
"Reforms to the federal alternative fuels program could promote alternative fuels use instead of mandating purchase of vehicles that ultimately run on petroleum fuels," the report said.
The administration report said the president would review fuel-economy standards in light of a report by the National Academy of Sciences that is due on July 1. Environmentalists have dismissed that report as unlikely to recommend significantly stiffer standards, because its authors include several people who have worked for the auto and oil industries but no environmentalists.
Told of the contents of today's Transportation Department report, Dan Becker, the energy and global warming director of the Sierra Club, said, "It's bad news for the environment that fuel economy has dropped, and it's now up to the president to raise fuel-economy standards that have languished for 12 years."
Mr. Becker also expressed skepticism whether subsidies for hybrid vehicles would do any good, pointing out that automakers could just use hybrid sales to offset the sale of other gas-guzzlers while still meeting federal standards.
The auto industry has been lobbying heavily in recent months for an extension of the ethanol credits, which are currently scheduled to expire in 2004. The legislation that authorized the credits a decade ago, which was strongly backed by farm-state lawmakers, called for the Transportation Department to send a report to Congress on the program by September 2000. The Clinton administration did not finish work on the report before leaving office, however, and the Bush administration has not yet named a new administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Transportation Department agency that must produce the report.
A department official who insisted on anonymity said the report would not be completed until after an administrator had been chosen and confirmed by the Senate.

HEADLINE: If Richer Isn't Happier, What Is? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
One of the most often-repeated parts of the Declaration of Independence may also be one of the least influential. People march in Washington protesting various assaults against the first two unalienable rights, life and liberty. The third, however, rarely merits mention beyond the simple recitation of the Declaration's most famous sentence.
 Instead, the pursuit of happiness is left to the free market. Americans are typically responsible for their own emotional well-being, and, according to economic theory at least, there has never been much mystery about how to achieve it. Textbooks call this well-being "utility," and they say it rises alongside a person's wealth. "If there is a more fundamental idea in economics, I'm not sure what it would be," said Andrew J. Oswald, who teaches the subject at the University of Warwick in England. 
 There is a fundamental problem with the idea, however. Over the last half-century, the United States has become a far richer country, with ordinary people able to afford items -- a second car, a transcontinental plane ticket, a machine to show movies at home -- that only the wealthy owned before World War II. On average, people today can buy better food, better health care and seemingly a better life. 
Yet the nation as a whole describes itself as no happier. In fact, over the last 30 years, Americans have become somewhat less satisfied with their lives, according to an array of surveys. The obvious conclusion is that an everyday cliche may in fact have a more accurate take on modern life than Economics 101: money really cannot buy happiness.
That hardly passes for credible social science, though. And so a growing group of economists are now shedding the profession's traditional skepticism about personal interviews and are scouring survey data in an effort to explain the contradiction. In doing so, they have rejected their discipline's circular view of happiness, that people choose to do what makes them happy and what makes them happy is what they choose to do. Thus, asking them whether they are happy is unnecessary. 
The happiness researchers are joining psychologists and sociologists who have been studying the issue for years. Last fall, for example, the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton opened a Center for Health and Well-Being. Nearly half of the professors associated with the center, including its director, are economists.
One of the field's most intriguing early conclusions holds that money does indeed make people happier but that it is less potent than imagined. When people inherit a large sum of money, for instance, they become more satisfied with their lives, according to recent research. But over the last 60 years, and particularly the last 30, a powerful set of social forces has outweighed the effect that rising incomes have had on people's well-being. People work more hours, lose their jobs more often and, most importantly, get married less and divorced more than they did in the past. 
All that helps explain why the average American family could have received a 16 percent raise between 1970 and 1999, while the percentage of people who described themselves as "very happy" fell from 36 percent to 29 percent. "Money does buy happiness," said David G. Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth, who with Mr.. Oswald has studied well-being in England and the United States. "It just hasn't bought enough."
Statisticians call this Simpson's paradox. In England, for example, married people are as a group happier than they were three decades ago. Unmarried people are, too. But because the ranks of the unmarried have grown and because unmarried people are not as satisfied as married people, overall happiness has still declined. 
In a recent paper, Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Oswald even put a crude cost on certain life conditions. A lasting marriage seems to be worth $100,000 a year, they said, because all else being equal, a married person is as happy as a divorced-and-not-remarried person who makes $100,000 more than the married person. Losing a job and remaining unemployed costs men $60,000 worth of happiness a year. And in what the authors described as yet more evidence of discrimination, being black costs $30,000 a year of happiness.
The research has also found that women remain happier than men today, but that the gap has narrowed as -- and perhaps because -- women have entered the work force in larger numbers. In fact, men are about as happy today as they were in the early 1970's; nearly all of the decline since then is among women. 
The data have even offered a bit of an explanation for the dread with which many people view their 40th birthdays. It turns out that happiness reaches a nadir for most people right around 40. Before then, people seem to focus on all of the possibilities in front of them. After 40, more seem to be satisfied with what their life entails at the moment, Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Oswald say.
(In contrast, two psychologists who have studied happiness -- Ed Diener and David G. Myers -- have emphasized in their work that happiness is actually very similar across genders, ages and races.)
Of course, much of the research is based on self-evaluation. People are considered satisfied if they say they are satisfied, and their analysis can change if their expectations grow or the meaning of the word "happy" subtly shifts. This is one reason many economists have long avoided such research and have instead studied subjects like income, which have a solid quantitative underpinning. Even psychologists, who are more comfortable with survey data, say that the lack of a fixed reference point creates problems.
"It is possible that we're somewhat happier," said Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist at Princeton who sits on the executive committee of the new well-being center, "but because we demand more of life, we don't know we're happier."
"The evidence isn't in," he added.
Still, there is a long line of research that has connected self-reported happiness to more objective conditions, according to a paper by James D. Konow and Joseph E. Earley of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. People who say they are happy tend to have low blood pressure. They more often make a genuine smile (known scientifically as a Duchenne smile, when two different facial muscles fire). And their spouses and friends often describe them as happy. 
Happiness researchers say their biggest problem is that data remain somewhat flimsy. Most surveys on life satisfaction take a snapshot of a population at a given moment rather than conducting longitudinal studies following people over the course of their lives. These longitudinal studies, like one started in Britain in 1989, allow researchers to make better guesses about what causes unhappiness rather than simply what conditions unhappiness is correlated with. 
Take marriage. It could cause people to become happier by giving them companionship. But it is also possible that happy people are more likely to get married because they have an easier time finding a mate or because they are more willing to believe a relationship could last for a half-century. By following a specific group of people throughout their lives rather than interviewing a new sample every year, researchers can more accurately analyze when people's emotional well-being changes.
Though the longitudinal studies are expensive, they are becoming more popular. "There's a whole new field emerging," Mr. Oswald said. "We're right at the frontier."
The current happiness movement has its roots in a 1974 paper by Richard Easterlin that researchers still mention frequently. Mr. Easterlin, then a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed out the same paradox that is keeping economists busy today: even though income had risen dramatically since World War II, Americans said they were no happier. 
In the paper, he said people's expectations were a major reason. Once people acquire something they want, their goals change, and they desire something new. Society lives on a "hedonic treadmill," he said, using a phrase coined by two other researchers.
Mr. Easterlin also drew on the work of James Dusenberry, a fellow economist who said people care more about their income relative to their peers' than they do about absolute income. In recent years, two economists whose work has made it into the mainstream -- Robert H. Frank, the author of "Luxury Fever," and Juliet B. Schor, who wrote "The Overspent American" -- have made similar arguments.
The idea is not necessarily irrational, Mr. Frank says. A family could be able to afford more amenities than its predecessors in an earlier generation, but it might find itself unable to buy a home in a neighborhood with good schools if it does not rate high enough in today's income distribution.
This argument can also offer a fairly benign explanation for the recent decline in happiness, precisely because it has occurred among women. As women have entered the work force in greater numbers, their expectations -- for what kind of job they have or how much money they make -- could have risen more quickly than the quality of their lives. 
Mr. Blanchflower is skeptical, though. He notes that reported happiness among black Americans has risen over the same time period and that they would seem to be in a similar situation as women. A more likely explanation -- although one yet to be supported by data -- is that women have become less satisfied because many of them now work but face responsibilities at home similar to those their mothers did, he said.
In fact, some researchers think the faster pace of life today, as compared with that of recent decades, is a possible cause of the disconnection between income and happiness. Using data from the International Social Survey Program, a research consortium, Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Oswald found that an unusually large percentage of Americans said they wanted to spend more time with their families.
In Japan, 44 percent of people polled fit into this category. In Denmark, Israel and Italy, about 65 percent did. In western Germany and Britain, about 75 percent did. And in the United States, 85 percent said they wished they could be with their families more.
In theory, many Americans today are financially secure enough to make this happen. They could simply work fewer hours and still have enough money to afford not only food and shelter but also a good bit of entertainment. 
All of this is speculation, researchers acknowledge. Even 27 years after Mr. Easterlin noticed the divergence between wealth and happiness, there are no overarching explanations that are firmly grounded in data. Even given the rise in divorce and hours worked, for example, economists say they would have expected income gains to have made people more satisfied than they are.
"We're looking for a big idea, a big breakthrough," Mr. Blanchflower said. "This is hugely important, and we don't know the answer."

HEADLINE: Facing a Teacher Shortage, American Schools Look Overseas 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 18 

 BODY:
In ordinary times, Iris J. Moran, the principal at Oak Knoll Elementary in East Point, Ga., would not have to look far afield to find a Spanish teacher for her fourth- and fifth-grade classes.
 But there is nothing ordinary about the shortage of teachers afflicting American schools these days, particularly in the booming Sun Belt. And that is why Ms. Moran's search ended two years ago with a phone call to Santiago, Chile, where she found an energetic young linguist named Claudia V. Cuervo. 
 Ms. Moran had concerns about hiring a foreigner sight unseen. But she also had far more vacancies than options. And so, like a growing number of other school administrators across the country, she took a risk, a risk that paid off. Ms. Cuervo quickly demonstrated her creativity by shepherding her students on an imaginary two-week trip to Santiago, teaching them the vocabulary of air travel and guiding their journey with photographs and maps. Earlier this year, she was named the school's teacher of the year.
There are now thousands of foreign teachers like Claudia Cuervo in American classrooms. As school administrators struggle to cope with a teacher shortage that ranks among the worst in history, principals and superintendents are increasingly looking overseas for at least a temporary fix. Where it was once uncommon to cross state lines in pursuit of new teachers, recruiters now do not blink at crossing oceans. 
In Palm Beach County, Fla., school officials are planning a recruiting trip to the Philippines later this month. In New York City, the Board of Education has mounted a well-publicized raid on math and science teachers from Austria. Chicago's school system this year has hired 71 teachers from 28 countries, including China, France and Hungary.
Houston officials went to Moscow and returned with 11 signees. School officials here in Fulton County, Ga., the system that includes Oak Knoll, have already traveled to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. A trip to Jamaica is scheduled.
Ms. Cuervo was recruited through a for-profit clearinghouse called Visiting International Faculty, which is based in Chapel Hill, N.C. The program began as a cultural exchange in 1989 when it placed 12 foreign-language teachers in various North Carolina schools. This year, it recruited 1,300 teachers from 35 countries for schools in eight states. In the 2001-02 school year, it expects to place 1,800 to 2,000 teachers.
"We will continue to grow," said David B. Young, the clearinghouse's co-director, "and some of that is obviously due to the shortage. It certainly gives us opportunities."
The widespread growth in the hiring of foreign teachers has raised questions among education experts and teachers' union officials, who are troubled that some foreigners -- like some American-born teachers -- have not met all certification requirements for teaching in American schools.
Some education experts also say the availability of teachers from abroad may reduce pressure on governments to address the teacher shortage with pay increases and other benefits.
"They will always be, at best, part of the solution at the margins," said David C. Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers Inc., a nonprofit group in Massachusetts that promotes the profession.
"The bottom line," Mr. Haselkorn said, "is that we can't run the system if teaching is still considered a philanthropic act."
In the meantime, American schools are focused frantically on the short-term need to fill classrooms each fall. For the last seven years, schools have had to find about 220,000 new teachers a year, compared with about 160,000 a year in the early 1990's, according to the United States Department of Education.
The perpetual problems of relatively low salaries and tough working conditions have been exacerbated by a wave of retirements and by a strong economy, which has lured prospective teachers into the private sector. Simultaneously, immigration and a baby boom have stretched the capacity of schools.
The teacher shortage is likely to worsen before it eases in states like Georgia that have recently reduced maximum class sizes in early grades. Here in Fulton County, the number of new teachers needed has doubled in the last three years and now exceeds 20 percent of the total work force. Rick L. White, the system's personnel director, said he wanted to hire 154 foreign teachers for the fall to help him fill 1,000 anticipated vacancies.
At Oak Knoll, 22 portable classrooms help accommodate a student population that is projected to reach 1,039 in the fall, up from 780 five years ago. The principal, Ms. Moran, had to place substitute teachers in two classrooms for the first half of this school year, and she enlarged several other classes. Three months before the new year begins, she has found only 9 of the 16 new teachers she will need for her staff of 82.
This year, Ms. Moran filled four vacancies with teachers from abroad, and she now hopes to find several more. While she said the real allure of hiring international teachers was to expose students to another culture, she acknowledged that without them she would probably have to resort again to substitutes and crowded classes.
Thus far, desperate school districts have shown little reluctance to pay for the help. Georgia schools pay Visiting International Faculty $11,500 for each foreign teacher they hire, in addition to the salary.
The V.I.F. teachers work on an annual contract that can be renewed for up to three years. The company helps them obtain work visas and find housing and provides a weeklong orientation to American education. It requires that the teachers have at least three years experience, teaching credentials from their home countries, fluency in English and the ability to drive. Some states require a certification test.
The Visiting International Faculty teachers are typically paid a beginner's salary, regardless of experience. For some, like Ms. Cuervo, who makes $34,308, the American salary is well above what she would make in Chile. For others, like Julie J. Brown, who left Derbyshire, England, to teach British and European literature at North Atlanta High School, the pay is roughly equivalent to what she would earn at home.
As her students struggled this week with an exam on Ibsen and Camus, Ms. Brown, 32, said she was inspired primarily by the chance to travel and absorb American culture. But she said she had been pleased to find her students bright and engaged, and only mildly annoying when they imitate her accent.
She has, however, had to make adjustments in the classroom.
"I'm quite reluctant to teach the traditional British canon," Ms. Brown said, "because it's not always very relevant to them. We were reading Orwell, and one of the students asked, 'Where are all the black people in "1984"?' I just had to say that there weren't any in England in the 1940's."
Principals and school administrators seem to have few complaints about the program, except that they occasionally lose a teacher to homesickness or a family crisis. 
"It's been beyond my wildest dreams," said Ms. Moran, the Oak Knoll principal, "not just because they bring another body to the school but because of everything they bring with them."

HEADLINE: Big Jump in Trade Gap in March May Be Sign of Slower Economy 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
After a steep fall in February, the United States trade deficit expanded widely in March, producing a record first-quarter gap, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
 The trade shortfall rose 16 percent, to $31.17 billion in March, from a revised $26.86 billion in February. 
 Consumers developed a taste for imported goods like clothes, toys and electronics in March, after buying instead from American companies in February. Imports, led by a $2.8 billion increase for consumer goods, rose to $120.64 billion, while exports fell to $89.46 billion. 
Economists said the trade figures could be a signal that the economy grew about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 2 percent the government initially reported.
The monthly increase in the trade deficit was the largest in nine years, surprising economists who were expecting a deficit of $27 billion. It represented a return to levels of last year. The February deficit was the narrowest since December 1999.
From September until the end of last year, exports declined slowly and imports declined at a faster pace, causing the monthly trade deficit to shrink as the economy slowed. The figures began to fluctuate wildly starting in December as businesses began to unload excess inventories.
"The strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets means that we are channeling more of our demand into imports," said Richard B. Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The export of capital goods declined $1.6 billion, while imports of capital goods rose $600 million, an indication that businesses around the world are slowing their spending.
For the first three months of the year, the trade deficit was a record $91.3 billion, compared with $85.2 billion for the first three months of 2000. In all of last year the deficit deepened 40 percent as the United States bought $1 billion a day more than it sold.
To bring American imports and exports closer to an even level, either the dollar's value must drop, making American exports less costly in foreign markets, or the nation must sink into a recession, curbing consumer demand, economists said.

HEADLINE: Brazil, Fearful of Blackouts, Orders 20% Cut in Electricity 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: NATAL, Brazil, May 18 

 BODY:
Faced with a rapidly worsening energy crisis that threatens to cripple Latin America's largest economy, the government ordered consumers and businesses today to cut electricity consumption by 20 percent or prepare for California-style blackouts.
 The reduction is to be achieved through rationing that will start on June 1 and includes surcharges for those who do not meet their cutback quotas and rewards for those who do. The restrictions are to remain for at least six months, officials said. 
 "We will save the energy we need if we organize ourselves," President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said in a nationally televised speech tonight. "Everyone has to participate in this national effort if we want to remove the risk of blackouts." 
In an innovative effort to minimize disruption for both industrial and individual users, large companies are to be allowed to sell the energy that they save to others, and small consumers who reduce consumption by 34 percent will receive their electricity free. 
But with the carrot comes a stick. The power of quota violators will be turned off for up to six days at a time.
Initially, the government had envisioned a conservation system based on fines of up to 1,500 percent for those who failed to comply. But a decision was made to "invert the equation," the government's energy crisis coordinator, Pedro Parente, said today, and "seek the cooperation of society" by "rewarding those who are already consuming less and for that reason can't make larger cuts."
The measures announced today in Brasilia fall far short of the rolling blackouts of four to six hours a day that the press has been predicting. Those forecasts had led in recent days to panic buying of candles, generators and flashlights, along with widespread fears that the dimming of street lights would lead to a surge in crime.
On Thursday night, street lighting in most major cities was cut 35 percent, and police night shifts were bolstered. In another sign of the seriousness of the crisis, the government has prohibited night games of professional soccer, the country's favorite sport, and severely restricted concerts.
The announcement of the mandatory plan had originally been scheduled for next Wednesday, but was moved up to quell growing anger at the government's handling of the crisis. More than 130 million of Brazil's 170 million people will be affected when the rationing begins, including all the residents of the Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro-Brasilia triangle, the industrial heartland.
The immediate cause of the crisis is the country's worst drought in more than 60 years. More than 90 percent of the electricity in Brazil is generated by dams. But water levels at hydroelectric plants have fallen to less than one-third of capacity as a result of the prolonged dry spell, which has affected even some tributaries of the Amazon.
The power shortage also reflects what economists and executives describe as a lack of government investment in power supply that dates from the mid-1980's. Numerous state-owned utilities have been sold to investors, with much of the revenue from those sales used to reduce the government deficit instead of being plowed back into building additional plants.
In the 1990's, the demand for electricity grew 45 percent, in part as a result of a successful program to control inflation, an effort that helped millions of poor people buy television sets, refrigerators, air-conditioners and other appliances. But the installed capacity rose by just 28 percent and is now at 74,000 megawatts, according to government estimates.
"This crisis was foreseen in innumerable official technical studies of the supply of energy done over the last five years," a newsmagazine, Epoca, complained this week. "But no one in authority got up out of his chair to seek a solution," and the government "opted for successive cuts in the budget of state energy companies to fulfill commitments made to the International Monetary Fund."
Mr. Parente tried to rebut those contentions today, saying 15 of 21 projects for power plants that were "paralyzed" when Mr. Cardoso took office in 1995 have been built. But Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged in a speech on Monday, "There certainly has been a problem with communication and coordination among various parts of the government."
The government's biggest concern is that the cutbacks will drive the economy into recession, force layoffs, widen the budget deficit and further weaken the currency, which has hit record lows against the dollar this month. The leading economic research institute predicts that at least 850,000 jobs and $14.6 billion in production will be lost to rationing, an estimate that will rise even further if blackouts are decreed.
"If this program works and water levels are as expected, we will be able to diminish to a minimum the likelihood of a reduction of consumption by means of blackouts," Mr. Parente said today. "But if one of these two factors falls short, then we will have to enact blackouts."

HEADLINE: Albany's Spring Freeze 

 BODY:
New York's State Legislature stands still these days, 200 lawmakers on pause while their three leaders circle one another warily. The issue, of course, is the budget, which is late as usual. But even Albany's veterans are finding this year's delay unsettling. Because the state's byzantine education formulas need fixing, and because a federal court order requires more support for New York City schools than upstate legislators want to provide, the budget is stalled, and other legislation is stacked up behind it. The main activity is the scapegoating and finger-pointing over who exactly is responsible for this latest legislative malfunctioning. 
 The three state powers -- the governor and the two legislative leaders -- long ago presented their opening bids in the budget negotiations. Gov. George Pataki, a Republican expected to run for re-election next year, is worried about the economy and says he wants to hold spending to $83.6 billion -- even though he insists on increasing state aid to his suburban constituents in ways that would help them lower taxes. Joseph Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, aims his budget numbers slightly higher, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the only Democrat among the three leaders, is pitching for $86 billion, including a much-needed increase for New York City's struggling schools. 
 Everyone has a grievance. The Republicans are annoyed because Mr. Silver and his Assembly Democrats refuse to meet in budget conference committees with Senate Republicans. They also accuse the Democrats of preferring the more secretive but more efficient system under which important budget matters are decided by the three senior leaders acting alone. For their part, the Assembly Democrats are skittish about compromising with the Senate Republicans, then watching helplessly later when Mr. Pataki, as he did three years ago, uses his veto powers to cancel pet Democratic programs. 
The three leaders now need to find a more artful and democratic way to guide the state out of this budgetary swamp. Mr. Silver's Democrats should go to the conference committees, as should Mr. Pataki's representatives. As happens in most other states, all the parties should compromise more openly instead of arranging their annual back-room deals. 
There is plenty to do once the budget process starts moving. New York's Superfund account has run dry. Auto insurance costs in New York are now among the most expensive in the country, partly because of medical fraud, mainly in New York City. The governor is moving in the right direction by giving Attorney General Eliot Spitzer more authority to go after those who have been bilking the industry, but the state still needs to provide better protection for consumers against unfair rate increases by insurance companies.
Meanwhile, the drive to reform the cruel and outdated Rockefeller drug laws has lost some of its steam as state lawmakers debate giving judges much-needed discretion in sentencing. The governor wants a ban on hand-held cell phones in automobiles, a worthy idea that has some support in the Legislature. Voting reform has drawn attention from all sides in Albany, but it needs to happen quickly enough for voters in New York City to have extra volunteers and maintenance money in city elections that begin Sept. 11.
This is a long and important list, and Mr. Silver, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki should stop their posturing and start open negotiations, beginning with the conference committees.

HEADLINE: Detroit Splits the Difference; 
Car-Based S.U.V.'s Are Unlikely to Stem Slide In Fuel Economy

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 18 

 BODY:
Auto sales are shrinking and discounts have spread even to the largest sport utility vehicles. But sales have nearly tripled this year for one category of vehicles that is being marketed with virtually no discounts at all: sport utility vehicles based on car designs.
 New models like the Toyota Highlander, which shares the mechanical underpinnings of a Toyota Camry, and the Ford Escape, which is based on a Ford Contour sedan, represent a powerful new development in the American auto market. 
 Auto executives say that car-based sport utilities, often known as crossover utility vehicles, have become such a fast-selling new segment of the market that they compare with the advent of minivans in 1984 and the boom in four-door sport utilities built like pickup trucks that began with the introduction of the Ford Explorer in 1990.
The first crossover utility, the Toyota RAV4, went on sale in small numbers in 1996, and the crossover utility market was tiny until last year. Now it is almost as big as the minivan market, which is shrinking fast, and automakers have at least three dozen new models on their drawing boards. 
Crossover utilities offer a smoother ride and better handling than traditional sport utilities, but are generally less capable of ascending rocky dirt trails, towing very large trailers or carrying heavy cargo. While truck-based sport utilities are built for these demanding tasks, industry officials say that most customers never actually use them for these purposes, and many will gravitate to crossover models as a result.
"The handwriting is on the wall as to the desires of consumers who have incorporated sport utility vehicles into their household fleets as family station wagons," George Pipas, the manager of sales analysis at Ford, said.
John F. Smith Jr., the chairman of General Motors, said crossover utilities -- which are also designed to appeal to customers drawn to the higher driving position and rugged looks of traditional sport utility vehicles -- represented a huge opportunity for the auto industry to address the safety and environmental problems posed by pickup-based designs while capturing changing tastes. Traditional sport utilities have been heavily criticized for burning too much gasoline, causing heavy damage to other vehicles during crashes and rolling over too easily.
Mr. Smith said car-based models should pose fewer of these problems, and that this, along with consumer demand, was why manufacturers all over the world were rushing into the market.
"It all plays together, it's hard to separate that out," Mr. Smith said.
Indeed, some of the buyers of crossover utilities are people who used to drive pickup-based sport utilities, like the Ford Explorer and Dodge Durango. Christopher and Catherine Burkett of North Wilmington, Del., bought a black 2001 Honda CR-V last Saturday, trading in a maroon 1992 Chevrolet Blazer.
"It's got a smaller tank and it goes 75 miles farther on a tank, so the difference at the pump is significant," Mr. Burkett, a 46-year-old civil engineer, said. "Plus, the ride is a lot better than a truck."
But many auto marketers now say that buyers of crossover sport utilities are switching not just out of traditional sport utilities but even more from minivans, midsize cars, large cars and luxury cars. Crossover utilities are similar to these vehicles in terms of emissions and often slightly worse in terms of fuel economy, because their high roofs give them poorer aerodynamics. Their safety record is still unclear because little crash data has been gathered yet.
As a result, the latest trend in the market appears unlikely to do as much as expected to improve the worsening fuel economy of American vehicles. A new government report on fuel economy this week showed that the average for the 2001 model year is down 0.2 mile a gallon from the 2000 model year, instead of improving as expected.
American buyers are once again surprising the industry's experts. Late last year, when Toyota introduced the Highlander crossover utility vehicle, it expected to draw sales from traditional sport utilities like the Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer and Toyota's own 4Runner, said Ernest Bastien, the North American marketing manager at Toyota. But that has not proved to be entirely the case.
"The inflow to Highlander is pretty close from midsize sedans and midsize S.U.V.'s, but it's a little more from the sedans," Mr. Bastien said, adding that Toyota planned to do more to promote the fast-selling vehicle to owners of traditional sport utilities.
The minivan market has been devastated in the first four months of this year, plunging 30.2 percent compared with the first four months of last year. The large-car market has fallen 18 percent and the luxury-car market has dropped 11 percent. The overall auto market is down 6.8 percent -- but sales of crossover utilities are up 176.7 percent. 
After a decade of spectacular growth, sales of traditional sport utilities are down 9.8 percent so far this year. The drop is coming entirely in the small and midsize models that compete most directly with the crossover models. Sales of the largest sport utilities are up slightly, although not at nearly the same pace as in the late 1990's. The leveling off has left many dealer lots crammed with big, unsold sport utilities; General Motors has just begun offering $1,000 rebates in Western states through the end of this month on most of its full-size sport utilities.
The shift toward car-based sport utilities threatens to some extent the profitability of General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which have earned up to $15,000 each in profits on some of the pickup-based models, which are much cheaper to design than car-based models and slightly cheaper to manufacture.
Foreign automakers have had little success in the pickup truck market but lots of experience in building cars, and are now using it to sell crossover models like the Toyota Highlander and Lexus RX 300, both based on the Camry.
And some financial analysts worry that the sheer number of crossover utilities coming into the market could prevent the next big thing in automobiles from becoming the next big center of profits.
"Everyone is trying to identify the new growth area -- everyone seems to think crossovers are it," Scott Sprinzen, an automotive credit analyst at Standard & Poor's, said. "It could well be a source of margin pressure."
Crossover utilities appear to be particularly popular in affluent suburban neighborhoods in the Northeast, where they are already being seen in large numbers because many people in the suburbs lease or buy a new vehicle every two or three years, partly to follow the latest changes in automotive style.
Even with the slowdown in sales of traditional sport utilities, the percentage of vehicles on the road that are pickup-based sport utilities is likely to rise sharply over the next decade. Very few are being scrapped each year, because few were made before the early 1990's.
Traditional sport utilities make up roughly 15 percent of new vehicles sold, but only 9 percent of vehicles on the road. For that reason, new model years with a high proportion of pickup-based sport utilities are effectively replacing model years of vehicles from the 1970's and 1980's that had very few sport utilities.
No automaker has announced plans to convert to other uses any of their factories that build traditional sport utilities, and Nissan has just begun construction of an assembly plant in Mississippi that will build full-size pickup trucks and pickup-based sport utilities.
Industry critics question the logic of introducing a new class of vehicles if it contributes to the decline of safer, more fuel-efficient cars.
Daniel Becker, the energy and global-warming policy director of the Sierra Club, said, "If people are trading in a car for a car-based S.U.V., they're trading up in smog, up in gas-guzzling and up in global-warming pollution."
Industry officials say they are doing their best to reduce the environmental consequences of the millions of vehicles they sell every year while responding to the desires and choices of their customers.
The example of the Ford Escape, the nation's best-selling crossover utility, shows the complexity of that issue. It was promoted by Ford at its introduction last autumn as offering better gas mileage than the Ford Explorer. Yet the Escape actually replaced the more fuel-efficient, but slow-selling Ford Contour sedan. It uses the same mechanical underpinnings and is built in the giant assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., that once made the Contour.
The Escape gets 18 miles to the gallon in the city and 24 on the highway, while the discontinued Contour got 20 in the city and 28 on the highway. The Escape has a larger engine, generating 200 horsepower compared with the Contour's 170. Ford says the Escape needs the larger engine because its tall body makes it less aerodynamic than the Contour and because it can tow up to 3,500 pounds while a Contour can tow only 1,000 pounds.
Ford is counting on the Escape for up to a third of the 25 percent improvement in average sport utility vehicle gas mileage that it has pledged to achieve by 2005, while making technological improvements to existing models for the rest of the gain in fuel efficiency.
But to the extent that the Escape expands the sport utility market at the expense of cars, it could actually hurt overall fuel efficiency. And the Escape has exactly the same gas mileage as the larger Ford Windstar minivan.
According to J. D. Power & Associates, 62.4 percent of the vehicles traded in by Escape buyers are cars, while another 8.4 percent are vans, 10.3 percent are pickups and 18.9 percent are sport utilities.
A few people in the auto industry still question whether crossover utilities represent a truly distinct segment from traditional sport utilities, but the emerging consensus is that they are different because their performance and manufacturing are very different.
But crossover utilities are also covered by the more lenient smog and safety regulations that apply to pickup trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles, although some manufacturers, including Ford and Honda, are building their models to car standards anyway.

HEADLINE: Bargain Braiders Battle for Heads; 
Hair Stylists From Africa Arrive, Driving Down Prices

BYLINE:  By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Two decades ago, a black American looking to get her hair braided into a head of plaits thinner than a knitting needle could spend $100. It could, after all, take up to 12 hours to get the job done.
 But African immigrants arriving in New York began to undercut the prices charged by African-American salon owners. The same slender braids can now be had for as little as $125, a lot less than a generation ago when adjusted for inflation. 
 Yet overhead costs have marched steadily higher. Electricity costs and insurance bills went up. And the cost of an 850-square-foot storefront space on 125th Street in Harlem has jumped to $3,500 a month from roughly $1,500, said Inez Dickens, a partner in the Lloyd E. Dickens Company, a real estate concern. 
As more Africans opened braiding salons -- today, there are roughly 130 in the city's telephone directories -- some African-Americans had to expand into other hair services, like colors, cuts and curls. Others went out of business.
But as the waves of immigration continued, it seemed that too many Africans had the same idea, opening shops faster than it takes to get from Nigeria to New York. Competition among braiders has caused prices to drop so low that some salons can no longer afford rent on a decent storefront space. Braiders are out on the street offering their services to passers-by. The business, some say, has been almost crippled by too much competition. 
But many customers are elated by the economic rivalry. "I'm paying about $80 each time I get my hair done," said Shirley Dinolis, 29, a market data billing analyst from the Bronx, as a stylist plaited her hair into 50 to 60 cornrows at Godmother's African Hair Braiding salon in Harlem. "That's the same amount I was paying five or six years ago. The Africans really do a great job."
Braiding establishments can sometimes resemble sweatshops -- jammed with braiders in small windowless storefronts as hot as an African plain. 
At Elegance African Hair Braiding, on 125th Street in Harlem, nine women work elbow to elbow in a dim 18-by-6-foot space. The West African-born owner, Aicha, who goes by only one name, does not have a set price for braiding. She asks a potential customer how much she is willing to pay for microbraids.
Like many braid shops, Elegance hires women to drum up business. They call out softly, "You want your hair braided?" Some braiders stand outside the shops or subway stations to lure customers.
Even immigrants willing to work for slim profits have found it hard to stay in business. Touba Camara, 39, who immigrated from Senegal seven years ago, spent two years working 12-hour days in a factory dying clothing for $225 a week. She set aside every spare cent, and shared a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with the daughter of a neighbor in Senegal. (Her husband and son stayed behind in Dakar.)
With her savings and part of a $3,000 gift from her mother, she opened Touba African Hair Braiding, not far from Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, five years ago. 
But it has been hard to stay open. At busy times, she pays her three braiders $200 for a 40-hour week. But, she said, "some weeks I don't make enough to pay them." If the shop is not busy, she tells one or more to stay home.
Ms. Camara charges $25 (for two French braids) to $400 (for microbraids using human hair extensions). Her rent is $1,000 a month for a small storefront, and her monthly utility bills are roughly $400, in part, because she heats her space with electric heaters. After paying her workers and her expenses, she said, she takes home $15,000 a year.
One reason African immigrants have flooded the industry is that few need to learn the business. "In my country, everyone knows how to braid," said Djeneba Coulibaly, 40, a co-owner of Mali African Hair Braiding in Harlem.
In Mali's capital, Bamako, Ms. Coulibaly, who immigrated to the United States 11 years ago, worked at an outdoor market owned by the government, where more than 150 braiders toiled under the withering sun. She paid a nominal tax, about 25 cents a day, for the spot.
When Ms. Coulibaly came to New York, she braided hair at an African-owned shop on 125th Street. She remembers the days when there were few braiding salons and customers formed lines outside early in the morning. "You would finish one, and another would come in," she said.
Five years ago, she and a sister-in-law opened Mali, in the rear of a barbershop on Eighth Avenue near 135th Street. They pay $900 for rent, utilities included. Business is sluggish, and they cannot afford help.
Sunny Jenkins, 21, a postal clerk and a student at Bronx Community College, has his hair braided at Mali at least once a month. His shoulder-length hair is cornrowed into as many as 10 braids or as few as 2. The cost is $10 to $35. "Braiding really helps my hair grow," Mr. Jenkins said. Some braiders cornrow too tightly and the hair breaks, he said, but at Mali, "I never have to worry."
The influx of cheap labor from Africa has meant that many American-born salon owners and workers have had to rethink the business. Francine Toukou, an African-American who owns Afrigenix, an Upper West Side salon with marble fireplaces, oak pocket doors, stained-glass windows, 12-foot ceilings and iron chandeliers, started off doing just braids. But she has expanded into services like chemical hair-straightening and weaves because of competition from the Africans.
Now only 40 percent of her clients ask for braids, which cost $125 for simple cornrows to $2,500 for dreadlock extensions, which, unlike natural dreadlocks, are braided.
Before opening Afrigenix, Ms. Toukou owned two other braiding emporiums, one in SoHo, the other in Newark, but had to sell the one in Newark because of competition from African-owned salons. "They were charging about half of what we were charging," Ms. Toukou, 34, said. "In fact, we sold to some Africans."
Some people are willing to pay her prices, Ms. Toukou said, because they are concerned about sanitation and braiding practices in many African-owned shops. Indeed, many African salons lack the blue disinfectant found at every station in her salon. And some of her customers, Ms. Toukou said, complain that braiders at the African salons have used dirty combs or braid too tightly. 
Braiders are supposed to have a cosmetology or natural hair styling license. The license for styling requires 300 hours of study and an exam, said Dan Shapiro, a spokesman for the New York Department of State, which regulates licensing programs. Unlicensed stylists risk having their businesses shut down.
There are other advantages to having a license. One unlicensed braider described a situation that she said was all too common. "A woman came in to get her hair done, and she waited until there was just one more braid to do," she recalled. "She said, 'That's it, it's taking too long. I have to go.' She walked out without paying. I was too scared to call the cops because I don't have a license. Some braiders don't have licenses. So it happens all the time."

HEADLINE: Facing Murder Charge in Classmate's Death, Hofstra Student Is Held on Suicide Watch 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., May 18 

 BODY:
The Hofstra University student charged in the murder and mutilation of a classmate was under suicide watch in a jail psychiatric ward today as his lawyer said he was busy preparing a psychiatric defense.
 The lawyer, Eric W. Naiburg, acknowledged that his client, Shaun T. Alexander, "was involved in" and had confessed to the killing of Max B. Kolb on April 25 in a Hicksville motel room. But he said that he would pursue a defense that Mr. Alexander, 23, "is certainly not legally responsible for his acts" and that Mr. Alexander would be evaluated in hope of producing two psychological portraits of him: one before the killing, and one after. 
 Today, as Mr. Kolb's family gathered in Newton, Mass., for his funeral and burial, Nassau police investigators said that the killing was so extreme in its brutality that they were contacting law enforcement agencies in the places Mr. Alexander has been in his life -- in his home state of Georgia, and in Florida, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Jersey -- to determine whether he was involved in any unsolved crimes. But they emphasized that he was not a suspect in any other cases.
In court papers and in interviews with those who know Mr. Alexander, a sketchy portrait has already emerged of a young man from an affluent Atlanta-area family who spent freely and put up a confident front to impress his peers, but who suffered strong insecurities and occasional breakdowns.
Drinking in a bar one time, he suddenly ran out crying, a classmate said. He once bragged of killing a cat, said another. And after he was barred from Hofstra dorms for hazing fraternity pledges in 1998, he filed a suit against the university, saying he had collapsed in his room and been hospitalized because of the resulting stress.
"I lost my appetite, could not go to class, vomited on a regular basis due to stress and suffered severe sleep and anxiety disorders," Mr. Alexander said in an affidavit filed with his lawsuit. "I have lost two years of my education, and I continue intensive therapy and have been diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder, and I will take medication to control this illness for the rest of my life."
In court papers, Mr. Alexander also said that his doctors had diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and had told him to leave school and go home to Georgia so that he could be treated medically.
Mr. Kolb, 20, a quiet but popular student who was on the dean's list, had been missing for three weeks before the police got a tip that he had been seen getting into Mr. Alexander's Land Rover on the morning he was killed. His body was found buried in the backyard of a house Mr. Alexander had rented in Long Beach. Prosecutors said Mr. Alexander told them he had asked Mr. Kolb to the motel to talk privately about a personal problem, made a sexual advance, was rejected and stabbed Mr. Kolb in a rage.
Because he is now under a suicide watch in the psychiatric prison wing of Nassau University Medical Center, in East Meadow, Mr. Alexander was not allowed to attend a felony screening conference in court this morning, said Edward P. Reilly, the Nassau sheriff.
Mr. Alexander, who had tried to commit suicide in the past, failed a routine suicide prevention screening in jail on Thursday and doctors decided to admit him to the six-bed psychiatric unit, Mr. Reilly said.
Mr. Naiburg said he would await an indictment, which he expected in the next 30 days, before ordering his own battery of psychological tests for Mr. Alexander.
"I don't think there is any rational interpretation other than the fact that he hurt this young man," said Mr. Naiburg. "But that is not the issue. The issue is, is he responsible for what he did? Is he legally responsible? And I think that is going to be answered in the negative."
Over recent days, students and others have recalled Mr. Alexander's heavy drinking and his often bizarre or inappropriate remarks and actions.
He spent a lot of time drinking in the bars, said one classmate, John Arena. Mr. Alexander gave out Jell-O laced with alcohol at his parties in his dorm, said another, Richard Iuorio.
Kristen Donahue, a senior who knew Mr. Alexander and had socialized with him and his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers, recalled how he had boasted of killing his cat.
"We were all out for dinner eating, and we were telling stories about high school, and he came out with this story about running over a cat with a lawn mower, and it was really an odd story," she said. "We didn't know if he was serious or joking, but I wouldn't put it past him."
In the fraternity hazing incident, on April 2, 1998, Mr. Alexander forced fraternity pledges to run up eight flights of stairs, eat raw fish, raw eggs and olives laden with Tabasco sauce, a Hofstra administrative hearing board found.
Mr. Alexander was placed on academic probation from April 17, 1998, to May 31, 1999, suspended from all fraternity events for four months and banned from the residence halls for eight days. In his lawsuit, which was dismissed by a State Supreme Court justice, and in a letter to the board, Mr. Alexander denied taking part in any hazing and argued against the discipline.
In addition to the emotional hardships, he complained in an affidavit, "I was forced to live in a hotel for approximately 10 days."
His lawyer in that case, Jason L. Abelove, said today that the murder charge against Mr. Alexander did not make sense to him.
"He is just not the type of kid that you think could do this," he said. "Unbelievable, the whole thing."
Disbelief was the mood at the Econo Lodge motel in Hicksville, too, where the police said Mr. Kolb was killed. After the murder, the police said, Mr. Alexander checked out at 5:40 a.m., signing the $95 Visa bill for a three-hour stay and explaining to a clerk that he had cut his knee and bled on the purple carpet in Room 102.
The motel manager, Amy Sharkey, said the red stain in the middle of the room was as big as a basketball hoop. More blood was speckled on the white sink, but she said she did not suspect foul play and called a cleaning crew instead of the police.
"He apologized to the guy at the desk," she said of Mr. Alexander. "I might have been more curious if he had not checked out or if it was not explained. He did not appear to be concealing anything."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Stocks Climb; Gold Prices Set 11-Month High

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks moved slightly higher yesterday, finishing a positive week highlighted by a big rally on Wednesday, the day after the Federal Reserve made its fifth half-point rate cut of the year. And a new public offering of an electronic stock market, Instinet, went well.
 In commodity markets, the price of gold for June delivery surged $13.80 an ounce, or 5 percent, to an 11-month high of $287.80. Some analysts say that the move could signal a change in the fortunes for gold, which has been struggling just to stay above 20-year lows. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed above 11,000 for the first time since September on Wednesday, closed up 53.16 points, or 0.5 percent higher at 11,301.74. It was up 4.4 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index, which rose 4.3 percent for the week, ended the day 5.20 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,198.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,291.96.
In the bond market, prices were mixed. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 5.40 percent, from 5.41 percent on Thursday, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 2/32, to 97.
The yield on the federal funds futures contract for June, which is a barometer of rate cut expectations, was unchanged but still indicates that some investors are betting on a quarter-point reduction when Fed policy makers meet in June.
Investors seem confident, based on the performance of both stocks and bonds, that the Fed's rate cuts will lead to an economic recovery in the the second half of the year. 
Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, said that based on the history of Fed interest rate cuts back to the early 1970's, the stock market has reached a bottom, on average, about three months after the first rate cut. The current lows for the three main indexes were hit in March and April. After a fifth rate cut, he said, the main market indexes have not dropped below that bottom. 
But the recovery of the technology sector, whose plunge led the stock market into bear territory, still lags that of many old-economy stocks.
While the Dow is over 11,000 again, the Nasdaq composite index, despite this week's rally, is still 4.1 percent below where it was before the first Fed rate cut on Jan. 3.
This split is also reflected in recent data of flows into equity mutual funds. According to AMG Data Services, investors put $825 million of new money into stock funds in the week ended Wednesday. But most of it went into growth and value funds. There were outflows from technology and Internet funds. In April, when nearly $15 billion moved into domestic equity funds, after a $13.2 billion decline in February and March, only $500 million went into technology funds.
In its first day of trading, Instinet, which is controlled by Reuters Group P.L.C., rose $3.15, or 22 percent, to $17.65 from its initial offering price of $14.50. The price got as high as $19.50. There were 32 million shares sold in the offering led by Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
The Instinet offering came as the market for initial public offerings has slowed to a crawl. In the late 1990's and early in 2000, new dot-coms came to market without any sign of earnings and doubled or tripled in price on the first day. Last year, there were 22 new offerings that quadrupled their price on the first day of trading.
Instinet, which offers access to 40 securities markets, had earnings last year of $148 million, which accounted for about 25 percent of Reuters' profits.
The price of gold shot higher, analysts said, after it breached $275 an ounce on the June futures contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. They said this was an important technical level, which set off purchase programs for many money managers. And as these managers acted the price shot higher.
John Hathaway, the senior portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, which runs a gold fund, acknowledged that the move came on a Friday when trading was thin, which would exaggerate the jump. But he still says that it is significant.
"Instead of being in a downtrend, I think we are in an uptrend now," he said. One of his reasons for thinking this, he said, is that it appears that a lot of the investors who shorted gold in the past, adding a lot of downward pressure on the price, are out of the market. When shorting, an investor sells borrowed gold in hopes that the price will fall and he can buy it back at a lower price and, thus, profit.
But gold has flirted with breakouts from the doldrums before, only to fall again. It reached $294.30 last June before falling to $256.60 in April.

HEADLINE: Temporary Jobs Have Become the Victims of a Slow Market 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
For most of the last three years, the dozens of temporary-employment agencies in this city have had a problem. They could not find enough qualified workers for the openings that local companies needed to fill. 
 Renate Hartman, who runs a branch of Snelling Personnel Services, noticed last year that many of the available candidates did not dress up for job interviews. Lee Rachelson, the founder of a small staffing company, said she had to post job listings on the Internet so she could recruit people from other cities to move to Tampa. 
 "I could not find anybody here," Ms. Rachelson recalled. "I was just in a panic." 
Today, however, only five months after the unemployment rate for the Tampa metropolitan area fell to 2.4 percent, a whole new category of people are worried: temporary workers themselves. Across this sprawling region of glass skyscrapers, eight-mile-long bridges and one of the highest proportions of temporary jobs in the nation, workers have suddenly found themselves plentiful and jobs scarce.
The number of applicants at some agencies has doubled, while the number of job listings has fallen 20 percent or more in the last few months. More people with at least a year or two of college education are now looking for temporary jobs, recruiters say.
And while few people here said they expected to remain out of work for long, many have resigned themselves to taking a pay cut for their next job.
"It's just been hard trying to find a job," said Samuel J. Gilbert, a 31-year-old father of two who was recently laid off from his temporary job making pastries and expected that his next job would probably be on a construction crew. "It's just been real hard."
The struggle of the more than three million temporary workers nationwide is perhaps the starkest sign of how rapidly the labor market has shifted since late last year. "For the first time in 10 years, there are more workers than jobs," said Richard A. Walquist, an executive vice president at the American Staffing Association, a Washington group that represents temporary agencies.
In September of last year, when the national unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time since 1970, the number of people employed by staffing firms stood at 3.5 million, three times the level of a decade ago. 
Since then, however, the overall jobless rate has climbed to 4.5 percent, and temporary employment has borne the brunt of it, falling by 20 percent, or 500,000 people. That is more than the combined payroll reductions at automakers, restaurants, hotels and department stores. In the last recession, from the summer of 1990 through early 1991, the agencies' work force fell less than 13 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
"We're seeing a faster reaction," said Jeffrey A. Joerres, the chief executive of Manpower, which on a typical day employs 170,000 temporary workers, some of whom in fact stay on a job for months or even years. Companies are telling Manpower, Mr. Joerres explained, that "we don't have the demand, so we don't need the people."
For companies, the ability to expand and contract a temporary work force can improve efficiency and, in the best case, might allow the economy to rebound more quickly. But even if that happens, a group of people who never fully joined in the long boom, because they tend to make less money and receive fewer benefits than regular workers, will struggle to get by in the coming months, economists say.
At the least, some of the people who were drawn to temporary work during the long economic expansion are having to pay for the flexibility it has given them with a sudden increase in job insecurity.
"This is a perfect example of how the new economy should work," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "It highlights the more flexible nature of the labor market. But there's a lot of pain and suffering."
That these struggles are now common in Tampa's service-heavy economy also indicates that the nation's economic slowdown has spread well beyond the industrial Midwest. The Tampa area, which includes St. Petersburg and the resort towns of the Gulf of Mexico coast, has few corporate headquarters, and it relies on back-office outposts and the tourism industry for many of its jobs. With wages below the national average and a large influx of new residents each year, temporary-staffing companies have thrived.
But even as the region's overall economy continues to grow, many people have found their financial situation becoming more precarious over the last year.
Stacy L. Back graduated from the University of South Florida's Tampa campus in December 1999, and Snelling Personnel Services quickly found her a temporary job at SourceTrack, a local Internet company. It eventually turned into a permanent position, and Ms. Back liked the job so much that she decided she wanted to spend her career working with technology, she said. 
Last month, however, SourceTrack went out of business. "Every door I've knocked on, they say, 'We have a hiring freeze on,' " she said, adding that the few openings she has found are for low-paying clerical jobs. 
"I was living very comfortably, and now I'm very skeptical," said Ms. Back, who is now doing a one-month consulting assignment for another Internet company. "I think it's going to get worse before it gets a little better." 
Part of the problem facing temporary workers is the new competition for jobs. Since the start of the year, for example, Fingerhut, SBC Communications and WorldCom all closed call centers here, eliminating a total of about 1,800 jobs, and Bear, Stearns closed a technology office that employed another 140 people. 
The effect is obvious at A. J. O'Neal & Associates, a local staffing company with three offices around Tampa. The number of people who have walked through the company's doors looking for work has more than doubled recently, from about 20 each week to about 45, Denise R. Sutton, the company president, said.
Other recruiters said people even stream into temp-agency offices on Thursdays and Fridays, days that were quiet last year because job seekers had either found an assignment or decided to wait until the following week.
"The economy has taken a turn, and employers are looking to get more experience for less money," said Dana Kozloski, a 25-year-old who completed her M.B.A. at the University of Tampa after being laid off by a health insurance company last year. 
Ms. Kozloski has registered with a staffing company in the hope of landing a temporary job that would lead to a permanent job paying at least $35,000, the salary she was making in her last job. So far, though, she has had to settle for working as a nanny and using her air-conditioner less often, she said.
One 37-year-old woman said she had made $80,000 a year when working in the human resources department of an accounting firm in Chicago but has been unable to find a job paying $50,000 here. In the meantime, she is earning $12 an hour -- the equivalent of $24,000 a year -- doing a six-month project for a medical laboratory.
"I don't mind taking a step backward, but I'm not going to take four or five steps backward," said the woman, who asked not to be identified because she thought it would hamper her job search.
The effects have also started to spread to Hillborough County's main unemployment-benefits office, on the north side of Tampa, near the Busch Gardens amusement park. Because more people are coming to the office for help in finding a job, job seekers are no longer seen individually when they first arrive. Instead, a government employee gives tours of the office's computers and other resources to groups of about a dozen people at a time, Kym Bandy, who runs the offices, said.
On May 8, 500 people showed up for an all-day job fair at which companies were trying to fill 50 jobs. Coca-Cola did not bring enough applications for the many people in line to fill out, so an employee of the benefits office made copies. 
Besides increasing the supply of temporary workers, the recent layoffs have also reduced the demand for such jobs as companies cut their temporary work forces as well.
Tech Data, a computer company in nearby Clearwater, said in March that it would lay off all of its temporary workers but none of its permanent workers. Instead, it would ask the permanent employees to cut costs by reducing travel and taking the free pens and paper when they stayed in hotels, as The St. Petersburg Times first reported. 
Quality Distribution, a trucking company here, which relied on about 50 temps a year ago, is down to about 15 now. "For the first time in a long time, when we advertise, we just get an overwhelming response," said Barb Keslinke, the company's vice president for human resources. "We get people who are clearly overqualified for the types of positions we're recruiting for."
Many temporary employees, for their part, said they were struggling even to find good jobs for which they can apply. "Everybody I apply to says the same thing: 'June or July. We're going to start hiring in June or July,' " said Jarib A. Rodriguez, who was laid off from his job as a real estate assessor and is now trying to get a temporary job. "I can't wait until June or July."

HEADLINE: Bleak Statistics Tarnish Nevada's Glitter 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, May 12 

 BODY:
In this town of neon rainbows, where money gushes, time stands still and dreams endure despite the obvious odds, it is easy enough to think of Nevada as an adult version of Oz, and Las Vegas as its glittering Emerald City. But statistical realities in the nation's fastest-growing state are sepia-toned and stark.
 Pick almost any index of social well-being, and Nevada ranks at or near the very bottom of the 50 states, though it ranks near the top in personal wealth. Besides having the highest suicide rate (almost twice the national average), Nevada has the highest adult smoking rate and the highest death rate from smoking, the highest percentage of teenagers who are high-school dropouts, the highest teenage pregnancy rate and the highest rate of firearm deaths. 
 Nevada ranked 45th among the states for overall health last year, just above states like West Virginia and Arkansas, according to rankings compiled by United Health Group, a Minnesota-based health care company. 
Over the last 11 years, Nevada has scored between 43rd and 50th in the group's rankings, because of its rate of smoking, lack of health insurance and premature death rate, among other problems.
"You name it, we got it," said Bill Thompson, a professor of public administration at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas and an expert on the state's reigning industry, gambling. "It's no accident that the state that relies on the gaming industry as its essential economy has all these problems. We attract people, many in a positive way, but many in a negative way, people that are down and out and looking for a second chance, third chance. Vegas seems to promise another chance, but people who haven't made it elsewhere usually don't make it here."
The notion of Nevada as the last stop for life's unlucky gamblers is as old as the silver miners and as current as "Leaving Las Vegas," but public officials and health experts say the explanation for the state's low rankings on a range of problems is complex. New Jersey, where gambling is also a major industry, has the nation's lowest suicide rate, for example.
In Nevada, these experts say, a long legacy of low-tax, libertarian government, rural isolation and a steely tradition of self-reliance have combined with a population growth of more than 60 percent in the last decade that has left little sense of community to create a huge range of challenges to the state's mental and physical health.
Nevada has long been dogged by poor health rankings, but officials say that growth has made it even harder to attack underlying causes, since scarce public resources must go to treatment, rather than prevention. And though the state ranks relatively high in personal wealth, (its estimated per capita income of $18,795 in 1997, the last year for which data are available, ranked 12th in the nation), that has not translated into public expenditures.
"There's very little tradition of investment in public health or prevention," said Dr. Mary Guinan, the state's chief health officer who left a career as a pioneering AIDS researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to take her civil service job in Carson City, the state capital, two and a half years ago. "Some federal agency rates you on your investment in prevention, and Nevada was recently 50 of 50 states. There's very little investment in this, and people don't want big government, so this is what you get."
Indeed, Nevadans, content to rely on the $600 million a year in taxes and fees generated by gambling (about 40 percent of the state budget, with sales tax accounting for another 40 percent), pay no state income tax and relatively low property taxes compared with neighboring states like California. A flight attendant for Southwest Airlines bade a cheery farewell to a planeload of travelers from Los Angeles this week by saying, "Welcome to Lost Wages, and thanks for paying our Nevada taxes!"
Conservatives are quick to argue that social pathologies like suicide and smoking are not caused by low taxes or limited government, and that government's ability to solve them may be limited, too.
"There is a very strong political move afoot to increase spending in the state, and that's been rather universal in high growth states," said Stephen Slivinski, a fiscal policy analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington, which gave Nevada's Republican governor, Kenny Guinn, one of only two A's on its recent fiscal report card on the states. "My general concern is that they are not looking for more innovative solutions, a broader, less government-centered approach. There's a limit to what government can do, and it may very well be magnified by the fact that some of these pathologies go well beyond bureaucratic ability to effect change."
In the case of suicide, getting adequate data has been the first challenge. For reasons that are not entirely clear, suicide rates are generally higher west of the Mississippi River, and the eight states of the intermountain West -- Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona -- are all in the top 10. Experts suggest a range of causes, from isolation and depression in rural areas, to easy access to guns.
"There is a western culture that blends self-reliance into day-to-day management of one's life," said Dr. John Fildes, a surgeon who heads the trauma unit at the University of Nevada Medical Center here and is in the middle of a three-year study on suicide prevention financed by a $1.5 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "And sometimes, people can see only one option: ending that life."
In 1999, the last year for which data are available, the suicide rate in Nevada was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 people, almost double the national rate of 11.4. But the rate was highest, 25.6 deaths per 100,000, in the rest of the state outside Clark and Washoe Counties, home to the two biggest cities, Las Vegas and Reno. Roughly 95 percent of those who kill themselves here are Nevada residents, not outsiders who come here just to die.
Dr. Fildes's study is trying to get better information about why people attempt suicide here, and to develop a statewide surveillance system for tracking suicides and attempts. The effort is complicated in rural counties, which may be geographically the size of Rhode Island or Connecticut with populations of just a few thousand.
Gambling, by itself, does not seem to be a dominant factor in driving the suicide rate, Dr. Fildes said. "If you consider gambling to be one of the addictive behaviors, like alcohol or drugs, all addictive behaviors are risk factors for suicide, but as an isolated behavior it doesn't appear to explain it," he said.
Other problems are equally puzzling. Dr. Guinan, the state health officer, said she cannot fathom why Nevada has the highest smoking rate among women, for example, which drives its overall rate to the highest in the nation. She noted that in the 90's, the rapid increase in the state's population was often not fully reflected in population estimates that were used to derive per capita rates for various problems, so Nevada often looked even worse than it should have compared with other states.
But even after adjusting for new population figures, Dr. Guinan acknowledged, Nevada is still at the bottom of many lists.
"We have no comprehensive tobacco prevention program in our state," she said. "In places like California with strong anti-smoking efforts, it's been shown that rates have fallen dramatically. Even our share of the national tobacco settlement money didn't go into prevention per se, but into scholarships."
Dr. Guinan also noted that Nevada has the strictest tobacco "pre-emption" law, which bars localities from enacting any anti-smoking regulations stricter than the statewide standards, which are lenient in a state where casinos, hotels and restaurants are full of the smell of secondhand smoke and businesses are not required to provide no-smoking areas.
But in other areas, Dr. Guinan said, the state compares favorably. It was one of the first to match federal spending for drug assistance to AIDS patients and has among the lowest sexually transmitted disease rates. Its playgrounds were recently rated the safest in a national study. Last year, after an intense battle, the state moved to fluoridate its drinking water for the first time.
Perhaps the biggest challenge for advocacy groups is galvanizing public attention and political support in a state where population turnover has been so rapid.
"We have 10,000 people moving into Las Vegas a month and roughly 5,000 moving out, so lack of community and lack of connection to one another is a huge factor," said Bob Fulkerson, state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, an umbrella lobbying group of 45 liberal organizations from civil rights groups to organized labor. "This is the wild, wild West. The feeling is if you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps, then it's your own damn fault. Combine that with the high turnover in population and you get a state whose political leaders don't want to provide the social services we need."

Bridgestone Disputes Need For a Broader Tire Recall
Bridgestone/Firestone lashed out at Ford Motor for having concluded that there are problems with Firestone tires that were not covered by the recall last August.
 "Let me state categorically -- tires supplied to Ford Motor Company, and other customers, are safe, and the tires are not defective," John T. Lampe, Bridgestone/Firestone's chairman, said in a letter to Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive. Page C2. 

A Huge Jump in U.S. Trade Deficit
The United States trade deficit expanded widely in March, to $31.17 billion from a revised $26.86 billion in February. Imports, led by a $2.8 billion increase for consumer goods, rose to $120.64 billion, while exports fell to $89.46 billion. The monthly increase in the trade deficit was the largest in nine years.

AUTODESK STOCK FALLS 11% AFTER WARNING ON PROFIT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Autodesk Inc.'s shares fell 11 percent yesterday after the company, a maker of design software for architects, said its second-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' estimates. The shares fell $4.02, to $33.60. 
Autodesk is selling less to large corporate customers in the United States and Europe, who have reduced spending because of the slowing economy, said Steve Cakebread, Autodesk's chief financial officer. Some are waiting for new products to be released, he said. The company, which is based in San Rafael, Calif., said late Thursday that it expected earnings, excluding certain charges, of 40 cents to 50 cents a share for the quarter ending in July, below the 56 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Africa On the Agenda

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin Powell leaves on Tuesday for five days in Africa, visiting Mali in West Africa, South Africa, and Kenya and Uganda in the east. The tour of the huge continent is a considerable commitment at a time of stress in the Middle East and elsewhere. Why is he doing it? I asked the secretary that in a telephone interview. 
 "I have a personal interest because I am an African-American," he said. "But beyond that, perhaps the greatest disaster on earth is unfolding in Africa: AIDS. So it seemed to me that I should go to Africa early on." 
 The AIDS crisis is going to be a, perhaps the, dominant subject on the trip. Of the 36 million people in the world who have H.I.V. or full-blown AIDS, more than two-thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa. There are already 11 million AIDS orphans there, and that number is expected to triple within the next 10 years or so. 
"The heart of the next generation is threatened," Secretary Powell said, "people in their 20's and 30's. Because of the general lack of sufficient health care, the AIDS epidemic is liable to open the way for other diseases, like malaria and tuberculosis. But it's not just a health crisis. It's economic, it's social, it's a crisis of democracy.
"We've been talking lately about treatment, getting the drugs to people. But we don't want to lose focus on prevention. The great humanitarian necessity is to get the young generation to protect themselves." 
AIDS will be both an urgent and a ticklish subject in Secretary Powell's talks with President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, which has more AIDS victims than any other country. President Mbeki set back anti-AIDS efforts there by questioning the accepted scientific view that H.I.V. causes AIDS. Even though that issue has now been put aside, his government has been reluctant to use drugs of proven effectiveness in preventing the transmission of AIDS from mothers to babies.
Giving up a legal battle in South Africa, the major international drug companies have agreed to make drugs available at very low prices. But there are still daunting obstacles to the use of those drugs on the scale needed, including the lack of adequate health infrastructures to administer complex dosages. 
Kofi Annan, secretary general of the U.N., has said it will take $7 billion to $10 billion a year in new money to carry out a realistic fight against the worldwide epidemic. Last week President Bush offered $200 million to that new global fund. The amount was immediately criticized as far too small, even derisory.
Secretary Powell seemed to bristle at that criticism. "I think the president should be congratulated, not criticized," he said. "If you add up all we're doing on AIDS, it comes to well over $700 million. The $200 million was a way to get started on the global trust fund. It's like starting an investment fund, and we're going to go on investing." 
Another difficult subject in the talks with President Mbeki will be neighboring Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe has sent thugs to harass businesses as well as opposition politicians and the economy is in ruins. Asked what the United States could do there, General Powell said, "We can lend our good offices, but regional leaders must take the lead." 
The military conflicts that are ravaging parts of Africa will come up in several stops. Among those conflicts are the brutal civil wars in Sierra Leone and Sudan. Secretary Powell will meet representatives of nonprofit groups that try to get food to the starving in southern Sudan. 
Angola's bloody conflict is now 25 years old, and the rebel Jonas Savimbi is still terrorizing civilians. Henry Kissinger and other American conservatives helped put Mr. Savimbi on the map by supporting him as "anti-Communist," though he has always been interested only in power for himself. He now buys arms with illegally mined diamonds. I asked Secretary Powell if he would act to end the conflict. "I'm certainly going to try," he said. 
The Bush administration may not have been expected to pay great attention to Africa, but it has made a point of doing so. President Bush met with African diplomats in the White House Rose Garden this week and announced a summit meeting of African democracies in October. 
Skeptics may see American politics as one reason for the interest in Africa. I prefer to see a chance for this country, especially Colin Powell, to help resolve the profound problems afflicting that vast continent.

HEADLINE: A Gathering Storm in the Mideast 

 BODY:
Whatever illusions the Bush administration may entertain about a more detached American role in the Middle East should be erased by the rapidly escalating violence in the region, including yesterday's deadly terrorist bombing in Israel and the retaliatory Israeli air strikes. Only assertive, sustained American diplomacy is likely to keep the conflict from turning into a ruinous ordeal for both Israelis and Palestinians and a damaging setback to American interests in the region. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is planning to travel to Africa and Europe later this month, should add the Middle East to his itinerary to see if he can at least persuade the two sides to diminish or end the bloodshed. 
 At this point, Israel and the Palestinians are engaged in a limited but ferocious state of warfare that grows in intensity by the week, hardening animosities and playing into the hands of those on both sides who favor the use of force. Recent weeks have brought a new level of killing, including the brutal assault on two Israeli teenagers who were beaten to death with stones, and a seemingly misplaced Israeli attack that killed five Palestinian officers as they were preparing a late dinner at a Palestinian outpost. 
 Yesterday's suicide bombing outside a shopping mall in the coastal town of Natanya killed at least five Israelis and wounded scores of others. The bomber was identified as a 21-year-old Palestinian grocery clerk from Tulkarem in the West Bank, not far from Netanya. For the first time since the 1967 war, Israel used warplanes to attack the West Bank and Gaza. The raids on Palestinian security headquarters in Ramallah and Nablus left at least nine Palestinians dead.
This dynamic must somehow be broken so Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, can move from combat to negotiation. The United States is the only nation with sufficient influence in both camps to ease the tensions. Public calls for restraint and private telephone calls to Middle East leaders by President Bush and General Powell can help, but more active engagement is needed now. It may be inconvenient for the White House to fix its attention on the Middle East at a moment when taxes, the budget and domestic energy issues dominate the Washington agenda, but a diplomatic initiative today could help avoid a foreign crisis that seizes control of Mr. Bush's calendar. 
If the guns can be silenced, there is a basis for renewed peace talks. Jordan and Egypt have offered a peace plan that contains elements attractive to both sides. Next week an international panel led by former Senator George Mitchell will publish a report on the conflict that the Sharon government and the Palestinians have broadly endorsed, though disagreements remain on several important points. One of them is whether Israel, as the Mitchell report proposes, should suspend plans to enlarge existing settlements on the West Bank. Mr. Sharon has agreed not to build new settlements, but he is committed to expanding those already in place as their populations grow.
No president can afford to let the Middle East descend into turmoil. Protecting the welfare of Israel has been a central American commitment since the Jewish state was founded during the Truman administration. All presidents since then have tried to overcome the hostilities in the region, well aware that turbulence and military conflict in and around Israel can ripple through the region, creating instability, slowing economic progress and threatening to disrupt the flow of oil to the West. Mr. Bush must do no less.

HEADLINE: Energy Crisis Levels California Political Playing Field 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 18 

 BODY:
Six months ago, there were few states so dominated by a single party and a single politician as California. Gov. Gray Davis and the Democrats controlled the government to such a degree that the demoralized Republicans could only nod quietly in approval when Mr. Davis dictated that everyone support his top three priorities, all of them, as he liked to say, education.
 Today, not only has the energy crisis replaced schools as the public's top concern but a new survey also shows that Mr. Davis's approval rating has tumbled even before a summer that is destined to bring soaring energy bills and rolling blackouts. The energy crisis may be bad for the state, but it has energized the Republicans in a way that no one here dreamed possible until now. 
 "There's no question things have changed for us in what you could call a favorable direction," said Dave Cox, a state assemblyman who heads the Republican caucus. "We do see an opportunity now that we didn't have before, and I want to make clear that we think we have the wrong governor in the wrong place at the moment."
According to a survey released this morning by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, Mr. Davis' approval rating has dropped to 46 percent from 63 percent in January, the first time it has fallen below 50 percent since he was elected in November 1998.
Strikingly, President Bush's approval rating among Californians is higher, the survey said, at 57 percent, in spite of Mr. Davis's claims that the president is partly at fault for the state's energy problems.
"This crisis is emerging in the public's mind as a bitter, partisan issue," said Mark Baldassare, the survey's director. "There is no sense that this is an emergency that is pulling people together. Davis is taking a hit for the problems, and the president is not."
The survey, conducted by telephone among 2,001 Californians from May 1 to May 9, has a sampling error of plus or minus 2 percent.
Perhaps its most worrisome finding was a sense of pessimism in the state. For the first time since the last recession in the early 1990's, the survey found, more Californians see the state moving in the wrong direction than in the right direction, 48 percent to 44 percent. In January, 62 percent thought the state was moving in the right direction.
This morning, Mr. Davis took what was perceived as a clear political step by bringing on board two former advisers to Al Gore; Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, as a consultant on communications, and Nancy McFadden, Mr. Gore's former deputy chief of staff, to handle negotiations between his office and federal and state agencies.
Those announcements were followed in short order with another denunciation by Mr. Davis of President Bush for not ordering caps on wholesale power prices. Mr. Davis also assailed his predecessors for not encouraging construction of enough power plants.
The day before Mr. Davis also criticized the president for not ordering prompt refunds by the power generating companies for overcharging Californians. And he and his aides have blamed Republicans in the Legislature for frustrating his program to resolve the crisis.
"The Republican Party in this state is at its lowest ebb in generations," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "They think there's a political payoff in letting the governor fail at this. We think they're wrong."
But Mr. Davis's opponents say it is the governor who is doing most of the finger pointing. "He spends more time placing blame than on solutions," Mr. Cox said. 
Whether the energy crisis will threaten Mr. Davis's expected bid for re-election next year remains to be seen, but a race that was expected to be all but moribund now looks, at the least, like it will be lively.
According to the survey, while Mr. Davis's overall standing has fallen, residents do not directly blame him for the electricity shortages. Thirty-two percent blamed the utility companies, 26 percent blamed the former governor and Legislature, and just 10 percent blamed Mr. Davis and the current Legislature.
But the Republicans have clearly sensed an opening that did not exist before. "We are always looking for opportunities to take statewide offices, and this may be one," Mr. Cox said.
The actor Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped out of the nascent gubernatorial race after the publication of some unflattering articles about his personal life, but two other Republicans have announced bids and others are clearly considering runs. The Republican secretary of state, Bill Jones, has announced his candidacy, and William Simon Jr., a wealthy businessman who has never held public office, is planning a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser.
Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles and Peter Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner and head of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, have been mentioned as potential Republican contenders. Neither has said he would consider a run, but the rumors show that the party is searching for a recognizable personality.
Even within the Democratic Party there is talk of a challenge, potentially from the state treasurer, Phil Angelides, or the attorney general, Bill Lockyer, even though neither has commented on a run.
"I think the governor is vulnerable and the sharks are in the water, even in his own party," said Bill Campbell, the former chairman of the Republican caucus in the Assembly. "Things can change in a hurry."

HEADLINE: Tax Analysts See Big Gains For Top 1% Of Taxpayers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Under the tax cut plans now moving through Congress, the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans gain value over time while most of the breaks for everyone else lose value, according to both supporters and critics of these plans.
 Tax analysts say the plans include some protections and favorable provisions affecting the top 1 percent of all earners that do not extend to the other 99 percent. A significant portion of the tax breaks for those not at the top come in the form of tax credits, whose value diminishes with inflation. 
 But the analysts also note that most tax cuts become more favorable to the wealthy over time, since all of their increased income is subject to lower rates. 
Several provisions that preserve or enhance the value of tax breaks for the very wealthy are common to both the House tax plan, which President Bush supports, and the plan developed in the Senate. Under both plans, virtually all taxpayers would receive larger tax cuts every year for the coming decade as more of the cuts are phased in. The Senate, however, would give less to top earners than the House would.
Critics of these plans say the administration designed them to further reward the wealthy over the long run. As John Buckley, the chief tax adviser to House Democrats, put it, "They are using inflation to take away a lot of things from everyone not at the top."
In response, Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said that the Bush tax cuts do not favor the wealthy. "The president's plan is aimed at helping people disproportionately in the lower brackets," she said. "On the whole this plan is targeted toward working families."
For those already in the 39.6 percent bracket, which applies to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, nearly every dollar of additional income, whether from higher earnings or the results of inflation, would be taxed at a lower rate. The rate would fall to 36 percent under the Senate bill or 33 percent under the House bill, though the lower rates would be phased in over 10 years.
Both bills would also create a new 10 percent tax bracket for the first $12,000 of taxable income for a married couple, or $6,000 for singles. These sums are now taxed at 15 percent. But the 10 percent rate would be phased in slowly, taking full effect only in 2007, with no inflation adjustment until then. 
The delays and the lack of an immediate inflation adjustment make this tax break worth less than it appears. For all married couples, the Senate version of this tax cut has a nominal value of $600 a year, or $3,600 in all, from now through 2006. But inflation of 3 percent, the usual assumption among tax analysts, would reduce the real value to $3,340. The House version, phasing in the rate reduction more slowly, would be worth just $2,328.
Under both bills, the child tax credit, which President Bush wants to double to $1,000 a child, loses value in two ways.
First, the full credit would not be available until 2011 under the Senate version of the bill, which is expected to face a vote on Monday. It would then be worth just $737 in today's dollars. The House would provide the full credit in 2006, when it would be worth $859.
Second, the income limits to qualify for the child credit are not indexed for inflation. The ceiling for the full credit is $110,000 in both bills, the equivalent of $81,100 in today's dollars if the full credit is available in 2011, or $94,500 if it is available in 2006. Several million families who would appear to qualify because they make less than $110,000 today would therefore not get the full credit.
The Senate bill, unlike the House version, allows the working poor to claim a portion of the child credit even if they pay no income taxes. The Senate bill, however, includes what amounts to a reverse inflation adjustment, to make sure that inflationary income gains do not help the working poor qualify for larger child tax credits. 
The child tax credit would not otherwise be adjusted for inflation before or after taking full effect in 2011. But the Senate would provide full inflation protection for a tax break pertaining to repeal of the estate tax, which applies only to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
Congress is poised to phase out the estate tax, as urged by President Bush, and also provide a limited exemption from capital-gains taxes. Beginning in 2011, Americans would be able to leave $1.3 million to heirs and $3 million to surviving spouses, free of capital-gains taxes. The delay would make these benefits worth 26 percent less than their value in today's dollars. 
The Senate version of the tax cut provides for inflation protection on these tax breaks beginning in 2012, so that the amounts shielded from capital gains taxes would rise each year.
The tax cut provisions for pensions and retirement savings also have inflation protections that would primarily benefit those with high incomes. The Senate bill, in particular, would index a variety of 401(k) and other retirement savings plans for inflation, allowing the wealthy to put more money away while avoiding or deferring taxes.
The Senate bill would also provide, beginning next year, a tax credit intended to get the working poor to save for retirement, subject to income limits that would not be adjusted for inflation.
That may not be especially significant, however, because, unless Congress extends it, the credit would end on Dec. 31, 2006.

HEADLINE: The Energy Plan: Points of Light, and Heat 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "In Energy Plan, Bush Urges New Drilling, Conservation and Nuclear Power Review" (front page, May 17):
 President Bush's suggestion that money from the proposed tax cut can be used to adjust to rising energy prices is troubling. 
 Now we have a third rationale for the tax cut. The first was that the budget surplus belonged to the people and should be given back. 
The second was that there was an impending recession and that the tax cut would improve consumer confidence and stimulate spending.
Now he says that the tax cut can be used to help us cope with higher energy prices. This suggests that he either has difficulty with the math, since this tax cut cannot possibly be spread across so many different areas, or that he is beholden to special interests that prevent the proposal of viable energy solutions that will benefit the majority of the people.

HEADLINE: THE CLOSE READER; 
Lord, Won't You Buy Me a Mercedes-Benz?

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz 

 BODY:
Our text today is "The Prayer of Jabez: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life." This inexpensive, shirt-pocket-size volume (Multnomah Publishers, $9.99) has sold more than four million copies in the past year, and is the best-selling book in America right now. It has attracted a prodigious following among people who have chosen to repeat every day the one-sentence prayer that gives the book its title. ("Oh, that you would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that your hand would be with me, and that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!") Jabez enthusiasts have risen up in churches and private homes and on the Prayer of Jabez Web site (www.prayerofjabez.com) to testify to the changes the sentence has wrought in their lives. National publications have made note; experts have been consulted; videos have been made; a sequel has been published, and others, including "The Prayer of Jabez for Teens" and "The Prayer of Jabez for Women," have been commissioned. "The Prayer of Jabez" has also been taken up by the mighty. The author, an Atlanta-based evangelical minister named Bruce Wilkinson, who was one of the leaders of the Promise Keepers movement, was recently invited to the White House. 
 What makes "The Prayer of Jabez" so appealing? The easy answer is that the book differs slightly from other how-to guides. Wilkinson has resurrected the once ubiquitous and now mostly forgotten genre of the published Sunday sermon. "The Prayer of Jabez" follows the rules that have governed American preaching since the Puritans came to the New World. It contains Scripture, doctrine and a practical application of both. The style is plain but fiery. 
 The Scripture consists of two verses from the Old Testament book of I Chronicles, a little-studied text otherwise made up of tedious genealogical lists. Wilkinson reads the verses closely and cleverly. They tell the story of an Israelite commoner whose mother gave him the unhappy name of Jabez, which the Bible tells us comes from "pain." (This is a folk etymology; the name is actually an inversion of the letters in the Hebrew word for pain.) Despite his inauspicious start in life, Jabez begs God "to enlarge his territories" and winds up being "more honorable than his brothers." 
That is all we know about him, but for Wilkinson's purposes, we don't need to know more. Jabez's obscurity, textually and socially, makes him an ideal vehicle for the traditional American Christian narrative of conversion and redemption. Jabez is a biblical everyman, vaguely discontented with his lot and ripe for a turn toward God. As Wilkinson puts it: "Things started badly for a person no one had ever heard of. He prayed an unusual, one-sentence prayer. Things ended extraordinarily well."
Wilkinson breaks Jabez's prayer into four parts and turns them into steps to be taken toward the good life. And then -- this is the point at which he turns a little snake-oil salesmanish -- he promises that if you take the steps, results will be yours within days. 
Those steps require remarkably little effort. If you ask for God's blessing (Step 1), he will enlarge your territory -- that is, in the modern American context, grant you success (Step 2). Wilkinson defines success in different ways at different points in the book. Sometimes it seems to consist in being a skillful evangelist. That's how Wilkinson measures his own success -- in numbers of converts and the speed at which he converts them. For other people success manifests itself in wealth and worldly esteem. "If Jabez had worked on Wall Street," Wilkinson writes, "he might have prayed, 'Lord, increase the value of my investment portfolios.' "
Because of remarks like these, Wilkinson has been accused of preaching prosperity theology. This is a serious charge, since the phrase is more commonly associated with the teachings of ministers who grow fat off the pennies of the poor. (The Rev. Jerry Falwell, for instance, once called the disgraced televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker prosperity theologians.) Wilkinson denies the charge, and it does seem a crude way to characterize "The Prayer of Jabez." Though the prayer certainly enjoys brand extension, it is a prayer, not a con game or a pyramid scheme. Wilkinson has a revival-meeting manner that makes it seem as if he's offering a tit-for-tat with God -- you pray to him; he'll make you rich -- but he also says that the Jabez prayer requires an acceptance of God's will whatever its form, not the presentation of an itemized demand. 
On the other hand, Wilkinson makes God's will awfully easy to accept, since he says God wants us to be successful. Indeed, Step 3, Wilkinson says, is to realize that God wants us to take entrepreneurial risks, to pile on more than we think we can handle. If we truly believe in him, he'll back us up. (In Jabez-speak, his hand will be with us.) Is it really God's business to help us avert bankruptcy? Wilkinson says yes. God doesn't want you to fail. He empowers because he is power itself. In fact, the reason to avoid sin (Step 4) is that it separates you from his energy current: "It is as if the electric lines to your house in Phoenix were severed and you were cut off from the immense power generators at Hoover Dam." 
A God who diverts his awesome supernatural force for the sole purpose of giving a jump-start to your personal and professional development may seem disconcertingly crass. But a deity who sounds like a motivational speaker at a business luncheon may also be the right deity for an era when megachurches sprawl across the land and more traditional houses of worship are going into genteel decline. The Jabez prayer grants the supplicant full access to the American cult of success, an adoration of power and material satisfaction untroubled by any sense that the world may be a tragic place or the fear that the enlargement of one's territory might leave others' diminished. That such upbeat theologies of convenience should have mass appeal is neither particular to our time -- think of Norman Vincent Peale, whose 1952 best seller, "The Power of Positive Thinking," was "The Prayer of Jabez" of its day -- nor all that deplorable. It's useful to have these ideas spelled out, rather than at work in the culture but unexamined. Many readers clearly find Wilkinson's worldview to be similar to their own. Those who don't can indulge a voyeuristic fascination with the church of what the Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, in 1950, called the American idolatry. He, however, found it disturbing. "The Gospel cannot be preached with truth and power if it does not challenge the pretensions and pride, not only of individuals, but of nations, cultures, civilizations, economic and political systems," Niebuhr wrote. "The good fortune of America and its power place it under the most grievous temptations to self-adulation."

 THE BRIMSTONE JOURNALS
By Ron Koertge.
113 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Candlewick Press. $15.99.
(Ages 12 and up)
 In "The Brimstone Journals," the novelist and poet Ron Koertge attempts to understand the kind of school violence that has made such shocking headlines in the last few years. Presented as a series of journal entries written by 15 students at the fictional Branston (nicknamed Brimstone) High, the book paints a chilling picture of teenage life in the suburbs.
The students, for the most part confused and isolated, receive little guidance or sympathy from adults. When problems arise, their teachers, their parents and even the police prefer to look the other way, leaving them on their own. The youngsters themselves judge one another harshly, forming alliances on the basis of race, appearance, reputation and athletic ability. Their journals are filled with anger and pain. And no one is listening. 
The opening and closing entries are written by Lester, a fat boy who is mercilessly teased and sometimes beaten by the school jocks. In his journal, Lester confides that he likes to play naked with his father's gun, fantasizing about shooting the bullies who torment him. Guns are disturbingly easy to come by, and several other kids talk about them rather matter-of-factly. The most frightening of them is Boyd, a deeply troubled and lonely boy who begins plotting to destroy his enemies.
Alternately abused and neglected by his alcoholic father, Boyd falls easy prey to Mike, a psychopathic gas station attendant who appears seemingly out of nowhere. When Mike instructs Boyd to gather "foot soldiers," his first recruit is poor fat Lester. Reluctantly, Lester joins Boyd in the hope of getting the bullies off his back. Meanwhile, Boyd and Mike are building an arsenal of weapons and making a hit list.
As the suspense builds, other journal entries give us hope. Unexpected friendships form, a new group starts to play music together, and some of the students begin to understand and support one another. 
Meredith, a sexually promiscuous and sophisticated girl, befriends Lester and persuades him to tell the police about Boyd's plan. The police, skeptical at first, finally investigate; they discover Boyd's arsenal, and tragedy is averted. In the happy aftermath, parents start listening to their teenagers, counselors arrive at the school, and the students finally get the guidance and attention they so desperately need. For Boyd, however, it is too late, and we last see him being led away in handcuffs.
"The Brimstone Journals" is remarkable for its density. Through the very spare and economical text we come to know these 15 children and their lives, and the subplots are surprisingly intricate for such a slim book. While many of the portraits ring true, arousing our interest and compassion, there are some glaring stereotypes that will make readers groan in disbelief.
WHATEVER one may think of the characters, the events in this book are all too believable. In recent years, we have seen administrators adopting "zero tolerance" policies in reaction to school shootings and suspending innocent students for pretending a chicken finger is a gun, or for making harmless lists of people they like or dislike. Koertge, whose other novels include "Where the Kissing Never Stops" and "The Arizona Kid," suggests that we look beyond the guns and the hit lists, and simply listen to our children. Parents and teachers need to know what their children are thinking, and what's happening in their lives. At the same time, young people need to trust and accept one another.
Though I suspect most teenagers will find this novel a little corny, "The Brimstone Journals," if read by youngsters and adults together, might be just the catalyst they need to open an important and meaningful dialogue. It's certainly worth a try.

The Braided Bunch

BYLINE:  By Mary Tannen 

 BODY:
It is an art that has been immortalized in African sculpture for centuries, and yet each work is ephemeral, meant to last a day, a weekend, a week or two at most. Historically, the configuration of coils and curls is a language indicating tribe, marital status, wealth and occasion. In Nigeria in the 50's, the photographer J. D. 'Okhai Ojeikere noticed that the hairdos were disappearing, giving way to glossy wigs. Then, just as suddenly as they started to vanish, they came back, but the language had altered. It was less tied to rural tradition, more in tune with urban life. Jazzy towers of braids mimicked the first skyscrapers in Lagos. There were swirls and spikes, symmetry and asymmetry. Realizing that this evanescent art could vanish again, Ojeikere began documenting it. And last year, his portfolio -- J. D. 'Okhai Ojeikere/Photographs" -- was published by Scalo. 
 African styles are now becoming global, appearing everywhere, on heads of all races. The geometry of these styles is built on a variety of techniques. Sometimes hair is plaited close to the scalp in a pattern of cornrows, or twisted into coils, or rolled into locks. Straight hair extensions can be braided into hair to make long shiny plaits, and wire is sometimes used to make the hair stand up. From these plaits and coils an edifice is built, secured by hairpins or needle and thread. Adornments, like feathers or beads, can be woven in. A do can take from 3 to 16 hours and cost from $45 to $700. 
 When African styles first appeared in America, some interpreted the language as one of militancy; women were even driven to file lawsuits against their employers defending their right to wear them. In time the hairdos won, and the meaning has altered, from defiant to proud. On a recent Friday afternoon, for example, all the clients at Turning Heads Beauty and Barber shop, in Harlem, which offers a full range of services including chemical relaxing, were having braids done, and a good third of them were men. According to Annu Prestonia, whose salon, Khamit Kinks, at 4 Leonard Street in TriBeCa, has dressed heads from Iman to Stevie Wonder, braids are a style whose time has come. She says that black women were so long oppressed by trying to live another aesthetic "they were afraid to swim or sweat because their straightened hair would go back." 
Thelma Golden, a director of programming at the Studio Museum in Harlem, says that braiding fits into the tradition of black body art and is "part of the rich stew of black culture." The stylist creates form, like a sculptor, yet since inspiration comes from both client and artist, and maybe the client's friend and whoever else is nearby, the hairdo is a collaborative work, similar to quilting.
As demand rose in this country, female African immigrants found in braiding a niche for entering the economy. In long, narrow storefronts on 125th Street, the stylists are almost all African and female, and the atmosphere is more African market than American hair salon. Recruiters roam the subway platform in Harlem, ready to pounce on prospective customers as they get off the train. Once a client is brought in, she chooses a style from the plastic-covered album, then sits in one of the folding chairs. Two braiders might work on her at once, chatting in French or a patois. There might be a child running around, and the smell of spicy cooking.
Whether an updo comes from an American salon or African braiding shop, it generates an Old World aura. It encourages a different gait, more measured, more regal. It demands a more studied way of dressing. It restructures demeanor, even interactions, into a new formality -- for as long as the wearer can stand to leave it in.

HEADLINE: Naked Capitalists 

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich; Frank Rich is an Op Ed columnist for The Times and a senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In late January 1998, during the same week that America first heard the ribald tale of the president and the intern, Variety tucked onto Page 5 a business story that caused no stir whatsoever. Under a Hollywood dateline, the show-biz trade paper reported that the adult-video business "saw record revenues last year" of some $4.2 billion in rentals and sales. 
 It soon became clear to me that these bicoastal stories, one from the nation's political capital and the other from its entertainment capital, were in some essential way the same story. 
 In the weeks that followed, Washington commentators repeatedly predicted that the public would be scandalized by the nonmissionary-position sex acts performed illicitly in the White House. But just as repeatedly voters kept telling pollsters that they weren't blushing as brightly as, say, Cokie Roberts. The Variety story, I realized, may have in part explained why. An unseemly large percentage of Americans was routinely seeking out stories resembling that of the president and the intern -- and raunchier ones -- as daily entertainment fare. 
The $4 billion that Americans spend on video pornography is larger than the annual revenue accrued by either the N.F.L., the N.B.A. or Major League Baseball. But that's literally not the half of it: the porn business is estimated to total between $10 billion and $14 billion annually in the United States when you toss in porn networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, Internet Web sites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys and that archaic medium of my own occasionally misspent youth, magazines. Take even the low-end $10 billion estimate (from a 1998 study by Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.), and pornography is a bigger business than professional football, basketball and baseball put together. People pay more money for pornography in America in a year than they do on movie tickets, more than they do on all the performing arts combined. As one of the porn people I met in the industry's epicenter, the San Fernando Valley, put it, "We realized that when there are 700 million porn rentals a year, it can't just be a million perverts renting 700 videos each."
Yet in a culture where every movie gross and Nielsen rating is assessed ad infinitum in the media, the enormous branch of show business euphemistically called "adult" is covered as a backwater, not as the major industry it is. Often what coverage there is fixates disproportionately on Internet porn, which may well be the only Web business that keeps expanding after the dot-com collapse but still accounts for barely a fifth of American porn consumption. Occasionally a tony author -- David Foster Wallace, George Plimpton and Martin Amis, most recently -- will go slumming at a porn awards ceremony or visit a porn set to score easy laughs and even easier moral points. During sweeps weeks, local news broadcasts "investigate" adult businesses, mainly so they can display hard bodies in the guise of hard news. And of course, there is no shortage of academic literature and First Amendment debate about pornography, much of it snarled in the ideological divisions among feminists, from the antiporn absolutism of Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin to the pro-porn revisionism of Sallie Tisdale and Susie Bright. 
I'm a lifelong show-biz junkie, and what sparked my interest in the business was what I stumbled upon in Variety -- its sheer hugeness. Size matters in the cultural marketplace. If the machinations of the mainstream TV, movie and music industries offer snapshots of the American character, doesn't this closeted entertainment behemoth tell us something as well? At $10 billion, porn is no longer a sideshow to the mainstream like, say, the $600 million Broadway theater industry -- it is the mainstream.
And so I went to the San Fernando Valley, aka Silicone Valley, on the other side of the Hollywood Hills, to talk with the suits of the adult business. I did not see any porn scenes being shot. I did not talk to any antiporn crusaders or their civil-libertarian adversaries. I did not go to construct a moral brief. I wanted to find out how some of the top players conduct their business and how they viewed the Americans who gorge on their products.
Among other things, I learned that the adult industry is in many ways a mirror image of Hollywood. Porn movies come not only in all sexual flavors but also in all genres, from period costume dramas to sci-fi to comedy. (One series is modeled on the old Hope-Crosby "Road" pictures.) Adult has a fabled frontier past about which its veterans wax sentimental -- the "Boogie Nights" 70's, when porn was still shot only on film and seen in adult movie theaters. (The arrival of home video revolutionized porn much as sound did Hollywood.) Adult also has its own Variety (Adult Video News), its own star-making machinery (the "girls" at Vivid and Wicked are promoted like bygone MGM contract players), its own prima donnas and cineastes. It has (often silent) business partners in high places: two of the country's more prom-inent porn purveyors, Marriott (through in-room X-rated movies) and General Motors (though its ownership of the satellite giant DirecTV, now probably to be sold to Rupert Murdoch), were also major sponsors of the Bush-Cheney Inaugural. Porn even has its own Matt Drudge -- a not-always-accurate Web industry gossip named Luke Ford, who shares his prototype's political conservatism and salacious obsessiveness yet is also, go figure, a rigorously devout convert to Judaism.
I didn't find any porn titans in gold chains, but I did meet Samantha Lewis, former real-estate saleswoman and current vice president of Digital Playground, whose best-selling "Virtual Sex" DVD's are, she says, "the Rolexes and Mercedeses of this business." I talked with Bill Asher, 38, the head of Vivid, who is an alumnus of Dartmouth and U.S.C. (for his M.B.A.) and Lawry's (the restaurant chain). I listened to the story of John Stagliano, who was once a U.C.L.A. economics major with plans "to teach at the college level" but who instead followed his particular erotic obsession and became Buttman, the creator of hugely popular improvisational cinema-verite porn videos that have been nicknamed "gonzo" in honor of the freewheeling literary spirit of Hunter S. Thompson. A political libertarian, Stagliano was for a while a big-time contributor to the Cato Institute.
If the people who make and sell pornography are this "normal" -- and varied -- might not the audience be, too? It can't be merely the uneducated and unemployed who shell out the $10 billion. And it isn't. Porn moguls describe a market as diverse as America. There's a college-age crowd that favors tattooed and pierced porn performers; there's an older, suburban audience that goes for "sweeter, nicer, cuter girls," as Bill Asher of Vivid Pictures puts it. There is geriatric porn (one fave is called "Century Sex"), and there's a popular video called "Fatter, Balder, Uglier." Oral sex sells particularly well in the Northeast, ethnic and interracial videos sell in cities (especially in the South), and the Sun Belt likes to see outdoor sex set by beaches and pools. 
Yet such demographics are anecdotally, not scientifically, obtained. So few Americans fess up when asked if they are watching adult product, says Asher, "that you'd think there is no business." But in truth, there's no business like porn business. Porn is the one show that no one watches but that, miraculously, never closes.
"Porn doesn't have a demographic -- it goes across all demographics," says Paul Fishbein, 42, the compact and intense man who founded Adult Video News. "There were 11,000 adult titles last year versus 400 releases in Hollywood. There are so many outlets that even if you spend just $15,000 and two days -- and put in some plot and good-looking people and decent sex -- you can get satellite and cable sales. There are so many companies, and they rarely go out of business. You have to be really stupid or greedy to fail." 
He points me toward the larger producers whose videos top AVN's charts and have the widest TV distribution. There are many successful companies, but some of them cater to niche markets (like gay men) that as of yet haven't cracked the national mass market of TV, where pay-per-view pornographic movies, though priced two or three times higher and not promoted, often outsell the Hollywood hits competing head to head. In a business with no barrier to entry -- anyone with a video camera can be a director or star -- there are also countless bottom feeders selling nasty loops on used tape. Whatever the quality or origin of a product, it can at the very least be exhibited on one of the 70,000 adult pay Web sites, about a quarter of which are owned by a few privately held companies that slice and dice the same content under different brands.
Fishbein has a staff of 62 to track it all. He seems smart, sensible and mercurial -- in other words, just like any other successful editor. And like almost everyone else I met in porn, he says he fell into it by accident. While a journalism student at Temple University in his hometown, Philadelphia, he managed a video store and found that customers kept asking him how to differentiate one adult tape from another. It was the early 80's, and the VCR was starting to conquer America, its popularity in large part driven (as the Internet's would be later) by the easier and more anonymous access it offered to porn. Prior to home video, pornography had a far smaller audience, limited mainly to men willing to venture into the muck of a Pussycat Cinema -- the "raincoaters," as the trade refers to that dying breed of paleo-consumer. The VCR took porn into America's bedrooms and living rooms -- and, by happenstance, did so at the same time that the spread of AIDS began to give sexual adventurers a reason to stay home. There is no safer sex than porn. 
As adult titles on tape proliferated, Fishbein started a newsletter to rate them. Other video-store owners, uncertain about which porn films to stock, took a look. Now, some 18 years later, Fishbein runs an empire that includes 10 Web sites and spinoff journals like AVN Online. He also stages trade shows and presents the AVN Awards in Vegas in January. An issue of AVN can run in excess of 350 slick pages, much of it advertising, in which a daunting number of reviews (some 400 a month) jostle for space with sober reportage like "For Adult, Ashcroft Signals Circle the Wagons Time." Fishbein has a soft spot for porn veterans like Al Goldstein, the 65-year-old paterfamilias of Screw magazine who writes a column for Fishbein's main Web site, AVN.com, in which Goldstein sometimes rails against the new corporate generation of pornographers who have no memory of the daring and sacrifice of their elders. "Al Goldstein took 19 arrests for this business," Fishbein says reverently. 
Though he embodies the corporatization of porn, Fishbein exudes a certain swagger. "I'm here by accident, and now that I'm here, I'm proud of what I do," he says. "My mother sits at my awards table each year when girls accept awards for oral sex. Sex sells and it drives the media, and it always has. Billboards, movies, ads, commercials. It's what we're thinking about at all times of the day. We're told it's bad, and it manifests itself as political debates."
Fishbein assures me that he has no "naked girls running through the office," and alas, he is right -- though a staff member does wander in with a photo to ask, "Was that the naked sushi party?" But there's a pleasant buzz and bustle about the place -- one I associate with journalism. "This could be a magazine about pens and pencils," Fishbein says. Maybe.
The browsers on the two computers behind his desk are kept on CNN.com and AVN.com, which is modeled on CNN's as a (porn) news portal. The decor of his large, meticulous office is mostly movie memorabilia. A film buff as well as a news junkie, Fishbein is a particular fan of the high-end comedies of Woody Allen, Albert Brooks and Preston Sturges, and he could be a highly articulate, slightly neurotic leading man out of one of them. He speaks glowingly of having just taken his 12-year-old stepdaughter to "Yi Yi." Does he watch the movies that AVN reviews? He flinches. "I haven't watched an adult movie without fast-forwarding since I saw one in a theater at 18. I watch them for business reasons. My wife and I don't watch them for entertainment. It is hard for me to look at it as more than product."
Many of the top porn producers are within blocks of Fishbein's office in the utterly anonymous town of Chatsworth -- an unhurried, nondescript sprawl of faded strip malls, housing developments and low-slung (and usually unmarked) business complexes that look more like suburban orthodontic offices than porn factories. Everyone in the business seems to know one another. "There's a certain camaraderie among those who are on the fringe of society, a similarity to outlaws," Fishbein says. Yet he seems like anything but an outlaw; he was about to fly off to the Super Bowl and then a skiing vacation. I ask if organized crime is a factor in today's porn world. "When I got here, I heard there were mob companies," he answers. "But I've never even been approached by a criminal element. I've never been threatened or bribed. So if it ever existed, it's part of the history of the business." He almost sounds disappointed. 
Russell Hampshire, who owns one of the biggest companies, VCA Pictures, did do time in jail -- nine months in 1988 for shipping obscene videotapes across state lines to federal agents in Alabama. Somewhat more prosaically, he is also a graduate of McDonald's Hamburger U., which he attended while running McDonald's franchises in El Paso in the 70's. It's business training that came in handy in the porn biz. "I learned about inventory, buying the proper insurance, doing everything by the book, not taking shortcuts," he says.
Hampshire, who runs VCA with his wife of 10 years, Betty, has an Oscar Madison look -- Hawaiian shirts, gym shorts and a baseball cap. I wouldn't want to get on his bad side. He's big and leathery and sounds like Lee Marvin as written by Damon Runyon. Asked why the sign outside says "Trac Tech" instead of VCA, he says he wants to stay "as innoculous as possible." 
He has been in the business since 1978 and waxes nostalgic for the early video days, when you could transfer a prevideo Marilyn Chambers classic to cassette and sell it wholesale for up to a hundred bucks. Now his top movies wholesale for $18 or $19, sometimes lower. "There used to be only 10 to 12 titles to choose from in a video store," he says. "Now there are thousands of titles." A typical release may sell only 2,000 units or less -- 7,500 would be a modest hit -- but thanks to TV and international sales, Hampshire says he makes money "on every title." Though the total income from a hit is pocket money by Hollywood standards, Hollywood should only have such profit margins. An adult film that brings in $250,000 may cost only $50,000 to make - five times the original investment. Production locations are often rented homes, shooting schedules run less than a week, and most projects are not shot on the costly medium of film. There are no unions or residuals. Marketing costs are tiny, since quote ads run in AVN and skin magazines, not in national publications or on TV. Most economically of all, porn movies don't carry the huge expense of theatrical distribution: video killed off adult movie theaters far more effectively than it did regular movie theaters. 
Still, Hampshire resents the lower overhead of porn's newcomers: "I have 80 employees. I have a 100 percent medical plan for everyone's family -- dental and vision care too. Some of my guys have been working here 17 or 18 years. And I'm up against amateurs with $800 Handicams." He also grouses about the new administration in Washington, as many in the industry do, fearing there could be a replay of the war on porn during the Reagan years, when Attorney General Edwin Meese called for restrictions on live sex shows and the dissemination of pornographic materials. "I like the rest of Bush's cabinet -- just not Ashcroft," Hampshire says. 
With the company's in-house press rep, a former preschool teacher named Mischa Allen, in tow, Hampshire takes me on a tour of VCA's 40,000-square-foot operation, proudly showing off the state-of-the-art video-editing bays, the room containing 3,000 video-duplication decks (churning out 400,000 tapes a month) and the prop room in which I spot a neon sign for "Bada Boom" from the set of the recent "Sopornos 2." The mechanized assembly line on which the tapes are boxed and shrink-wrapped is as efficient as that for bottling Coke. 
But more than anything, VCA resembles the corporate headquarters of a sports franchise. Only on close inspection do I realize that a towering glass case full of what look like trophies in the reception area in fact contains awards such as the 1996 Best Group Sex Scene, bestowed upon the "Staircase Orgy" from "New Wave Hookers 4." Hampshire, an avid golfer and bowler, has lined VCA's corridors with his collection of autographed sports jerseys, the latest from Tiger Woods. On one wall are plaques of appreciation from the Hampshires' philanthropic beneficiaries, including a local school to which they donate video equipment and free yearbook printing. 
Hampshire's own office is spacious, outfitted with leather furniture, but -- characteristically for the business -- looks like a bunker. Above his desk is a console of TV screens tuned into the feeds from security cameras. Incongruously, this inner sanctum's walls are festooned with another variety of pompously framed "collectibles" -- autographed letters and photographs from Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon. Hampshire says they're all copies, but he points to a melted-looking clock and says, "I've got Salvador Dalis all over the place -- authentic Salvador Dalis." He also shows off a vintage group photo of Murder Inc.
But Hampshire describes his existence as considerably more mundane than Bugsy Siegel's. He almost never goes to a set, where the hurry-up-and-wait pace makes it as "boring as Hollywood." He ticks off his duties: "Dealing with distributors and OSHA rules and regulations. I have to write reviews of all my department heads and decide raises."
As I leave his office I notice still another framed artifact: a Bronze Star for "exceptionally valorous action on 12/8/67" while serving as a Company C rifleman in combat in Vietnam. The citation says that Hampshire "continually exposed himself to hostile fire" while saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. 
It's the only thing that seems to embarrass him. "I buried it for so long," he says. "When I first came out here, I was ashamed to say anything because people might say I'm a bad person."
Almost every adult company is pursuing innovative media, preparing for Internet broadband and interactive hotel-room TV. At Wicked Pictures' newly revamped Web site, for instance, a visitor can cross-index a particular porn star with a sexual activity, then watch (and pay for) just those scenes that match. Digital Playground's "Virtual Sex" DVD's resemble video games in how they allow the user to control and inject himself into the "action."
As in nonadult video, DVD is cutting into videocassette sales -- even more so in adult, perhaps, because DVD's have the added virtue of being more easily camouflaged on a shelf than cassettes. Hampshire is particularly proud of VCA's DVD technology. With his vast catalog, he is following the model of Hollywood studios by rereleasing classics -- The Devil in Miss Jones 2," "The Opening of Misty Beethoven" -- in "Collectors Editions," replete with aural commentaries from original stars like Jamie Gillis. As with Hollywood's DVD rereleases, they are pitched at nostalgic consumers in the "boomer-retro" market. "These aren't 'adult' -- they're pop culture now," says Mischa Allen.
But VCA aims far higher than merely recycling golden oldies. In a windowless VCA office, I meet Wit Maverick, the head of its DVD production unit. He is 37, and with his blue Oxford shirt, goatee and glasses, he could be a professor somewhere -- perhaps at Cal Arts, where he got a masters in film directing. He ended up at VCA, he says, because it was "the best opportunity to push the envelope of technology." 
Maverick knocks mainstream studios for providing only a linear cinematic experience on their DVD's. "There's a great hubris in Hollywood," he says. "They think the way the director made the film is the only way the story can be told. We have a lot more humility. If a viewer wants something different, we give it to him." As an example he cites "Being With Juli Ashton," VCA's take on "Being John Malkovich." The viewer, Maverick says, "can go inside the head of the person having sex with Juli Ashton, male or female. He can choose which character to follow. He can re-edit the movie. Would James Cameron let anyone do that with 'Titanic'? 
"I feel like filmmakers 100 years ago," Maverick continues. "It's a great technology, but we still don't know what to do with it. A hundred years from now I want grad students to read what I've done on DVD the way I read about D.W. Griffith."
Wit maverick collaborates on his DVD's at VCA with Veronica Hart, 44, one of the business's most prominent female executives and, before that, a leading porn star of the late 70's and early 80's. 
Universally known as Janie -- her real name is Jane Hamilton -- she is typical of the mostly likable people I met in the porn world. She combines hardheaded show-biz savvy and humor with an utter lack of pretension and even some actual candor -- a combination unheard of on the other side of the hills. 
"The difference between us and Hollywood," she elaborates, "is money and ego. We deal with thousands of dollars, not millions. In mainstream, people are more cutthroat and pumped up about themselves. We're just like regular people -- it has to do with exposing yourself. If you show something this intimate, there isn't a lot you can hide behind. You're a little more down to earth. We're not curing cancer. We're providing entertainment."
Hart studied theater at the University of Nevada in her hometown, Las Vegas. After acting leads in plays by Pinter and Lorca -- as far east as Kennedy Center's annual college theater festival -- she passed through the music business in England and worked as a secretary at Psychology Today magazine in New York before ending up in movies like "Wanda Whips Wall Street." While we are talking in her office she looks up Veronica Hart's 100-plus performing credits on the Internet, including some non-hard-core B movies with faded mainstream actors like Farley Granger and Linda Blair. "In this one I played a stripper," she says while scrolling down the list. "That was a real stretch." 
She pulls back from the computer screen and sums up her career: "I was lucky enough to be a performer in the golden age of porn cinema. I'm no raving beauty, and I don't have the best body in the world, but I look approachable. And I've always really enjoyed sex." More recently, she played a cameo as a judge in "Boogie Nights," but she disputes that movie's historical accuracy about porn's prevideo age. "We never shot in L.A. back then, only in New York and San Francisco," she says. Indeed, adult exactly mimicked movie-industry history -- beginning in New York, then moving west. 
In 1982, at the top of her career, Hart fell in love and left the business. "AIDS had just started up, and I lost every gay person I knew," she says, listing close friends who worked on the production side of the straight-porn business. She had two sons and helped support her family in part by stripping. Though not intending to re-enter porn, eventually she did, as a producer and director.
Hart has been in adult longer than anyone I met and has done "everything" in it, she jokes, "including windows." She warns me that "any blanket statement about the business is meaningless" because it's so big that "every conceivable type of person" can be found in it. "You'll find someone who's into it to provide spiritual uplift and educational self-help" she says. "And if you want to find rotten, vicious, misogynistic bastards -- you'll find them. You'll find everyone who fits the stereotype and everyone who goes against the stereotype. In the loop and disposable-porno section of our business, you'll find the carnival freak-show mentality. There has to be a geek show somewhere in our society. What ticks me off is that all of adult is classified according to the lowest that's out there. We've always been legal. Child molestation has never been in mainstream adult. We've always policed ourselves. There's no coerced sex. But there are little pipsqueaks who get their disgusting little videos out there. There's a trend in misogynistic porn, and it's upsetting. I've been in the business for more than 20 years, and I helped make it possible for these guys to make these kinds of movies. I don't believe that's what America wants to see."
As for her own movies, Hart, like many of her peers, is preoccupied with the industry's biggest growth market -- women and couples. The female audience was thought to be nearly nil when consuming pornography required a visit to a theater, an adult book store or the curtained adult section of a video store. But now hard core is available at chains like Tower (though not Blockbuster), through elaborate Web sites like Adultdvdempire that parallel Amazon and by clicking a pay-per-view movie on a TV menu (where the bill won't specify that an adult title was chosen). 
The Valley's conventional wisdom has it that women prefer more romance, foreplay and story, as well as strong female characters who, says Bill Asher of Vivid, "are not only in charge of the sex but the rest of the plot." Hart isn't sure. "Just because women like romance doesn't mean we want soft sex," she says. "We want hot and dirty sex just like anybody else. For instance, many women love the fantasy of being taken -- but how do you portray it without sending a message to some guys to abduct?"
Hart, who thought of herself as a sexual pioneer when she was a porn performer, finds that there is no shortage of women who want to appear in adult now. She never has to search for new talent; willing performers call her "from all over the country." The men? "They're props."
Today's porn stars can be as temperamental as their Hollywood counterparts, or more so. "I assume Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall show up on the set on time," said Paul Fishbein rather tartly when I asked about Jenna Jameson, the industry's reigning It girl of recent years. Though he was trying to give her a free vacation as thanks for her work as host of the recent AVN awards, Jameson wasn't returning his calls. "In adult, they don't show up and don't care," Fishbein says. "Lots of girls in this business -- and guys, too -- are dysfunctional. The girls get here at 18 and aren't mature. They do it because they're rebels or exhibitionists or need money. They think they're making real movies and get really upset when they don't win awards or get good reviews." 
Some porn directors have similar pretensions. They can receive grandiose billing -- A Brad Armstrong Motion Picture" -- and are sometimes grudgingly indulged with a "big budget" project ($250,000 tops) made on film, even though sex scenes are far harder to shoot on film (with its trickier lighting and shot setups) than on video -- and even though adult films are almost never projected on screens. "We have our own Brad Pitts wanting to make 'Seven Days in Tibet,"' said one executive. Performers are paid at fairly standardized rates -- by the day or sex scene, as much as $1,000 per day for women, as little as $200 for men. The contract girls at Vivid and Wicked sign for $100,000 and up a year, in exchange for which they might make nine movies, with two sex scenes each, over that time, along with any number of brand-boosting promotional appearances at consumer conventions and video stores. The top stars double or triple that figure by running their own subscription Web sites, marketing autographs (along with less innocent mementos) and most lucratively, dancing in the nation's large circuit of strip clubs at fees that can top $10,000 a week. 
But porn stars have an even shorter shelf life than Hollywood's female stars and fare worse in love. Though H.I.V. and drug testing, as well as condom use, are rigorous at the top adult companies, one producer asks rhetorically, "Who wants to date a woman who's had sex with 60 people in two months?"
Since I've rarely found actors to be the most insightful observers of the movie business, I wasn't eager to sample the wisdom of porn stars. But I did seek out Sydnee Steele, a newly signed Wicked contract girl who is by many accounts a rarity in the business -- she's happily married. Her husband is Michael Raven, 36, a top adult director. They met in Dallas in the early 90's, when she was a jewelry saleswoman in a shopping mall and he was a car salesman who sold her a mariner blue Miata. Eventually they drifted into the local swingers' scene. (One porn worker would later tell me, "Texas, Florida and Arizona are where all the swingers and strippers come from, though no one knows why.")
"The industry looks up to our relationship," Raven says when I meet the couple, now married nine years, at Sin City, another production company in Chatsworth. Avid porn fans in Texas, they migrated to the Valley to turn their avocation into a livelihood. Like many of the directors and male performers in the business, Raven is a somewhat lumpy everyman, heading toward baldness and sporting a meticulous goatee. A Kandinsky poster decorates the Sin City office. "I've gotten jealous on occasion," Raven allows. "I'm not jealous of her because of sex in movies; I'm jealous when her work takes her away from me. I get lonely if she's gone two weeks on the road."
"Sometimes I'm too tired for my husband," Steele says. "We love what we do, but it's hard work -- lots of 12-hour days." By now, I've watched some of what she does and find it hard to square the rapacious star of "Hell on Heels" with the woman before me, who is softer-spoken, prettier and considerably less animated than her screen persona. Maybe she can act.
The daughter of a college professor, Steele comes from what she calls a "Leave It to Beaver' nuclear family," Raven from a religious one. "I've leaned toward the right in my politics," he says, "but I'm bothered by the Republicans' association with the religious right. I know from my experience of religious people that those who protest and scream the loudest usually have the biggest collection of adult under their bed." He wishes they'd protest violent entertainment instead: "In video games, you're supposed to destroy, maim and dismember an opponent. But if one person is giving pleasure to another in adult, that's evil. Sex on TV is more destructive than hard core. You can depict a rape on TV -- we don't touch that subject."
Like his wife, Raven is increasingly recognized by strangers -- largely because "Behind the Scenes" documentaries about his movies appear on DVD's and on cable erotic networks, much like Backstory features on American Movie Classics. But Raven no longer stays in contact with his own family. And Steele's parents, she says, "don't totally know what I'm doing and don't ask. We don't lie, but they've never really been told."
The secrecy among porn people is so prevalent that it's a running, if bittersweet, gag in a made-for-the-Internet TV series called "The Money Shot" that Paul Fishbein of AVN is producing as a lark. If you care to sample only one product of the adult industry, this is it -- and the episodes can be seen free in streaming video on a nonporn site, moneyshot-theseries.com. But be warned, its rating clocks in at about PG-13. "The Money Shot" is a roman a clef comedy, much in the spirit of HBO's classic "Larry Sanders Show," about daily life in the adult biz, as it filters into the offices of an AVN-like publication called "Blue Movie Guide." In a rather poignant episode titled "The Parents Show," one character dolefully concludes, "Nobody in this business tells their folks nothing." 
Bryn Pryor, 33, is the director and a writer of "The Money Shot." He's an AVN staff member who arrived in the Valley after nine years in the theater, much of it children's theater, in Arizona. "The Money Shot" hits his friends where they live. "Porn is legal now, but it has the mentality of other businesses, like prostitution and gambling, that started with organized-crime connections," he says. "People approach it as if they've done something wrong. If our customers project shame, than you must be doing something wrong. Everyone at AVN writes under a pseudonym. We have people here who don't want anyone to know their real name." Variations on this theme were visible everywhere I went in the Valley. Receptionists at porn companies tend to answer the phone generically: "Production Company" or "Corporate Office." 
Typifying this ambivalence is Steve Orenstein, 38, the owner of Wicked Pictures. He made his accidental entrance into the porn business through his mother -- who got him a part-time job when she worked as a bookkeeper at an adult-book distributor and he was 18. But he does not seem eager to reveal his calling to his 9-year-old stepdaughter. 
"Being in the business you walk that line all the time -- do you say what you do or not?" he says. Orenstein has revealed his true profession to only a handful of people whom he and his wife have met on the PTA circuit. "I'm comfortable with what I do," he says, "but I don't want parents of our child's friends saying their kids can't play with her because of it." His stepdaughter has noticed the Wicked logo on his shirt. "She knows I make something only adults can see." 
The Orensteins have spoken to a therapist about the inevitable day of reckoning with their child. "The counselors say don't tell her yet," he says, "don't overexplain." But surely she'll guess by adolescence? Orenstein, a slight, nervous man with a reputation as a worrier, merely shrugs. For the moment, he's more concerned about protecting the child from prime-time television, citing a recent episode of the sitcom "The King of Queens" on CBS. He recalls: "The guy's rolling off his wife, and my 9-year-old asks, 'What do they mean by that?' Should I be letting her watch it?"
Russell Hampshire's gambit is to tell strangers he's in "the video-duplication business." Allen Gold, a VCA executive with daughters ages 1 and 3, says he's "in the DVD business." Paul Fishbein doesn't bring either AVN or adult product into his house. Michael Raven and Sydnee Steele have decided for now not to have children.
I ask Veronica Hart, whose two teenage sons are at magnet schools for the highly gifted, what they have made of her career. "It's horrible for them," she says. "I'm their loving mommy, and nobody likes to think of their parents having sex and being famous for it. I'm not ashamed of what I do. I take responsibility for who I am. I chose. From the time they were kids, my stripping gear was washed and hanging in the bathtub. At the same time I apologize to my kids for how the choices in my life have affected them. They're well adjusted and can joke with me about it: 'I know I'm going to spend the rest of my life on the couch."'
No wonder the porn industry has its finger on the pulse of American tastes. Not only do its players have a lifestyle more middle class than that of their Beverly Hills counterparts, but in their desire to keep their porn careers camouflaged in a plain brown wrapper, they connect directly with their audience's shame and guilt. Still, the next generation of porn consumers and producers alike may break with that puritan mind-set. The teenagers who grew up with cable and the VCR "come to the table already saturated with sex," says Bryn Pryor. "They've never known a time without Calvin Klein ads and MTV. By the time they see porn, they've already seen so many naked people they're pre-jaded."
This may explain why Americans are clamoring for ever more explicit fare. In mainstream TV, sex is no longer sequestered on late-night public access shows like "Robin Byrd." At HBO, Sheila Nevins, the highly regarded executive in charge of its nonfiction programming, has been stunned by the success of sexual documentaries like "Real Sex," now in its 11th year, and "Taxicab Confessions." Focus groups complain to HBO that another hit series, "G-String Divas," doesn't go far enough. "They know what really happens in a strip club," Nevins says, and find HBO's version "too R-rated." Though HBO, known for its heavy promotions of "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City," spends nothing to advertise its sex series, they always are among the network's most watched. "I can do all the shows I want about poverty in the Mississippi Delta," Nevins says, "but this is what hard-working Americans want to see. At first we were embarrassed by the sex shows, and producers didn't want their names on them. Now we have Academy Award producers, and their names can't be big enough."
At Playboy, Jim English, the head of its TV division, and his boss, Christie Hefner, have felt the heat. Its Playboy and Spice channels have been squeezed from both sides in the cable-satellite marketplace. The softer, if X-rated, cuts of hard-core movies that it runs are no longer much more explicit than regular cable programming at HBO, Showtime ("Queer as Folk") and MTV ("Spring Break"). Even the Learning Channel (with "Bra Wars" and "Wild Weddings") and the History Channel (with its four-part "Sex in the 20th Century") are testing the waters. Meanwhile, erotic networks like Hot and Ecstasy, which run XX films, are cannibalizing Playboy's audience from the other end of the erotic spectrum. The result: This summer Playboy plans to start "Spice Platinum Live," which edges toward XXX. (I'll leave the codified yet minute clinical distinctions separating X, XX and XXX to your imagination.)
Even in an economic downturn, everything's coming up porn. Newly unemployed dot-com techies who can't find jobs in Silicon Valley are heading to Silicone Valley, where the work force is expanding, not contracting. "Vivid overall has doubled, tripled revenues and profits in the past couple of years," says Bill Asher. While he says there's no such thing as a Hollywood-style "home run" in porn -- unless another celebrity like Pamela Anderson turns up in a sex video, intentionally or not -- he sees potentially "a tenfold jump" in profits as distribution increases through broadband and video-on-demand. (Porn executives are no less fuzzy than Hollywood's as to when this might be.) "There are opportunities here that Paramount will never have in terms of growth," Asher says. "Our product travels well internationally and is evergreen. Five-year-old product is still interesting to someone; it's not yesterday's news like a five-year-old Hollywood blockbuster. Our costs are relatively fixed. As there's more distribution, 90 cents of a dollar hits the bottom line." The absence of adult retail stores in conservative pockets of the country is no longer a barrier. "You can get a dish relatively anywhere," Asher says, "and get whatever you want."
When Vivid took over and expanded the Hot Network in 1999, Asher says, "there was no outcry. We got thank-you letters and sales boomed. We put up two more channels in months. Cable companies were begging for them. It doesn't take a genius to do this. Literally the customers say, I like what you've got -- give me some more of it." Entertainment-industry executives not directly involved in the adult business confirm its sunny future. Satellite and cable companies have found that the more explicit the offerings, the more the market grows. AVN reports that TV porn may actually be increasing video-store sales and rentals rather than cannibalizing them -- by introducing new customers to the product. Though some cable companies say they don't want adult, only one of the country's eight major cable providers, Adelphia, forbids it. The others are too addicted to the cash flow to say no. The organized uproar that recently persuaded a teetering Yahoo to drop its adult Web store -- but not its gateways into other adult sites -- is the exception, not the rule. 
And despite a rumor that one porn mogul keeps a Cessna waiting at Van Nuys airport to escape to Brazil if there's a government crackdown, the odds of that look slim. Too many Fortune 500 corporations with Washington clout, from AT&T to AOL Time Warner, make too much money on porn -- whether through phone sex, chat rooms or adult video. At the local level, the Supreme Court's 1973 "community standard" for obscenity may be a non sequitur now that there's a XX national standard disseminated everywhere by satellite and the Web. A busted local video retailer in a conservative community can plead that his product is consistent with what the neighbors are watching on pay-per-view -- as one such owner successfully did in Utah last fall.
Should John Ashcroft's Justice Department go after porn, smart betting has him pursuing shadowy purveyors of extreme porn on the Internet (though it's not clear that the actionable stuff originates in the United States) and child pornography, all of which is condemned by the professional adult industry. "No one in this business will complain if Ashcroft goes for the kid angle," Fishbein says.
Jim English of Playboy suggests that one way to meet the typical American porn audience en masse is to accompany him to a live broadcast of a hit Playboy show called "Night Calls 411." Fittingly, "Night Calls" is televised from a studio in Hollywood, right by the old Gower Gulch, where low-budget studios long ago churned out early features in bulk much as the adult business does now. 
Two underclad hostesses, Crystal Knight and Flower, intersperse wisecracks and sex tips with viewers' phone calls. Though only a few callers get on the air, as many as 100,000 try to get through, with still more deluging the show with "Miss Lonelyhearts" e-mail.
It's not "Larry King Live," but in some ways it could be an adult version of the "Today" show, whose fans cross the country with the hope of being in view as the camera pans Rockefeller Center. The "Night Calls" devotees go further: many of them are engaging in sex when they call. "Having sex is not enough of a turn-on in America -- you have to be on TV too," jokes English. The callers often ask that the hosts talk them through to what The Starr Report called completion, and the women oblige -- hoping for slam-bam speed so they can move on to the next caller. I'm struck by how much the male and female callers alike mimic porn performers, with their cliched sex talk and over-the-top orgasmic shrieks. The adult audience apes its entertainers as slavishly as teenagers do rock idols. 
By now, I've become intimately familiar with the conventions of adult entertainment, having asked those I met in the business to steer me to their best products. I've watched Wicked's "Double Feature," a multiple winner of AVN awards, among them Best Comedy, and found it full of erudite cinematic references, including a campy spoof of Ed Wood films. I've seen Vivid's new "Artemesia," a costume drama set in 16th-century Italy and given AVN's highest rating; it is laced with high-flown ruminations on the meaning of art, somewhat compromised by the tattoos on the performers. From Video Team, a company specializing in interracial porn, there is a thriller called "Westside" with a social conscience reminiscent of "West Side Story," a soundtrack that features music by Aaron Copland and a take on the drug wars that wouldn't be out of place in "Traffic."
It's no wonder, though, that Stagliano's gonzo, in which the performers just get it on, has such a following. All the plot and costuming and set decoration and arty cinematography -- why bother? The acting -- who needs it? (In "Flashpoint," Jenna Jameson, cast as a female firefighter, sounds the same when sobbing over a colleague's death as she does in coital ecstasy.) The films are tedious, and I'm as tempted to fast-forward through the sex scenes as the nonsex scenes. No matter what the period or setting, no matter what the genre, every video comes to the same dead halt as the performers drop whatever characters they're supposed to be assuming and repeat the same sex acts, in almost exactly the same way, at the same intervals, in every film. At a certain point, the Kabuki-like ritualization of these sequences becomes unintentionally farcical, like the musical numbers in a 30's Hollywood musical or the stylized acrobatics in a martial-arts film. Farcical, but not exactly funny. All the artful mise en scene in the world cannot, for me anyway, make merchandised sex entertaining or erotic.
I tell Bryn Pryor of AVN and "The Money Shot" my reaction. He's a professional porn critic. Is this the best that adult has to offer? 
"The top of the heap in porn is the bottom in mainstream," he says. "The sad fact is that while consumers are more aware than they've ever been, nobody cares if it's a good movie, and we all know that. They care if it's hot in whatever subjective way it's hot to them. Most porn directors don't even watch the sex; they just direct the dialogue. They tell the camera people they want three positions and then go off and eat."
He continues: "Porn is not a creative medium.
Everyone in the porn industry says he's on the way to something else, like waiters and bartenders, but it may be that most of us belong here. If we were really good, we'd be doing something else."
Pryor envisions a day when adult and Hollywood will converge, but in a sense that's already the case. If much of porn ranges from silly to degrading, what's the alternative offered on the other side of the hills? The viewer who isn't watching a mediocre porn product is watching -- what? "Temptation Island"? W.W.F.? 
Moralists like to see in pornography a decline in our standards, but in truth it's an all-too-ringing affirmation of them. Porn is no more or less imaginative than much of the junk in the entertainment mainstream -- though unlike much of that junk, it does have an undeniable practical use. In that regard, anyway, there may be no other product in the entire cultural marketplace that is more explicitly American.

HEADLINE: Hanging Out With Butterflies 

BYLINE:  By LISA FUGARD; LISA FUGARD is a short-story writer.

 BODY:
I'VE seen fairies. In the Transvolcanic Mountains in central Mexico of all places. It was late afternoon and thousands of them were flitting among the pencil-straight oyamel fir trees. Now it could be that the altitude of 10,000 feet had made me delirious, but I'm not the first person to think a butterfly might be more than an insect. The Aztecs believed butterflies were the souls of the dead. When I visited the monarch butterfly sanctuary of El Rosario and saw these delicate creatures dancing in the air, a childhood dream of mine was fleetingly realized. I'd stumbled upon a fairy glade.
 Mexico is the destination for several migratory creatures. Gray whales travel from the Bering Sea to the Baja peninsula to calve; sea turtles gather on beaches near Huatulco to lay their eggs; and at the end of each summer some 250 million monarch butterflies from southern Canada and the central and eastern United States fly south to the high altitude oyamel forests on a journey that can span 3,500 miles. 
 Scientists knew that the small population of monarchs west of the Rockies wintered in sheltered bays along the California coastline, but until 1975 they were bewildered as to where the butterflies east of the Rockies migrated. That was when an American salesman in Mexico City, working with a Canadian scientist named Fred Urquart, hiked into the Transvolcanic Mountains in Michoacan and found monarchs clustered thick as bunches of grapes in the oyamel firs. What remains a mystery is how the butterflies return to the same forests year after year. The ones that fly to Mexico each fall have never been there; they are the great-great-grandchildren of the monarchs that left the previous spring.
The Mexican government established the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve, consisting of five sanctuaries in central Mexico, in 1986. A presidential decree passed last year expanded the reserve and connected the five sanctuaries, creating a contiguous corridor of 140,000 acres. The two sanctuaries open to the public -- El Rosario and Chincua -- have become popular eco-tourism destinations. Bringing dollars into the communities helps meet the needs of residents, but the increase in tourism threatens to create new problems for the butterflies.
Last January I visited the sanctuaries on a five-day tour offered by Natural Habitat Adventures, a tour company based in Boulder, Colo. I flew into Mexico City and checked into the Imperial Hotel where I met the eight other tour members, ranging in age from 40 to 70. Our guides were Astrid Frisch, a young Mexican biologist, and her husband, Karel Beets, a founding member of the Mexican Association of Eco-tourism and Adventure Travel.
The next morning we boarded a minibus and traveled west for four and a half hours to the state of Michoacan and a two-night stay in Angangueo, a former mining village snuggled in the folds of the mountains close to both sanctuaries.
Small, brightly painted houses hug Angangueo's steep, narrow streets. Geraniums, irises, roses and nasturtiums bloom in front of the houses, and turkeys forage on hillsides studded with cactuses and maguey plants, a member of the agave family that produces a flower spike resembling a colossal asparagus. When the copper and silver mines were active, Angangueo was home to 35,000 people; now there are 5,000. Most of them are dependent on the tourism that the butterfly migration generates from December to late March. Come April the men must look for work elsewhere. 
We checked into the Posada Don Bruno, a charming, terraced hotel. After a lunch of tortillas, chicken, beans and avocado at Margarita's across the street, we squeezed onto benches in the back of a pickup truck and set off for El Rosario, the most visited of the sanctuaries. 
The 45-minute drive up the rutted dirt road took us past freshly plowed ejidos, plots of land given to the local communities after the revolution of 1912. A young couple made their way up the dirt road in front of us and the woman, astride a burro, gave an adamant shake of her head when one of our group tried to photograph her.
The steep trail through El Rosario begins at 9,530 feet. I can state that with confidence because Elmar, a witty older gentleman on the tour, sported a watch with an altimeter and we requested frequent readings. The hike was less than a mile, but the altitude gave some of us headaches and left all of us breathless. Sadly, one of our group had a bad knee and had to turn back. We rested often while several Mexican families -- obviously used to the altitude -- and a woman in high heels, escorted by a dapper man, whizzed by.
To our delight, monarchs were sighted almost immediately. After a sunny day of nectaring and puddling -- a term used to describe butterflies gathering at damp areas to drink -- they were returning to their roosting area and the forest sparkled with their flitting presence.
We hiked for about 40 minutes, and at 10,120 feet we reached the area where the colony roosted. I found the sight of oyamel trees pendulous with butterflies to be more peculiar than beautiful. Was I really looking at butterflies? With their black-and-orange wings open, monarchs are luminescent creatures; wings closed and bunched together, they resemble patches of lichen and bundles of dead leaves. 
Astrid explained that the oyamel-pine forest creates a perfect winter microclimate for the butterflies. Thinning of the forest is like ripping holes in a sleeping bag, she said. If it gets too cold at night the butterflies freeze to death. And if daytime temperatures are too warm they become overactive and burn up their lipid reserves.
MONARCHS are not endangered, but the oyamels face intense logging pressure and thus the monarch migration is threatened. The lives of the local farmers, the campesinos, are also held in precarious balance. With the creation of the sanctuaries, land that had been communally owned by the campesinos for decades was taken away with no compensation. Logging, a source of income and fuel, was severely restricted. Butterflies threatened to be their undoing.
Developing a tourist-based economy seems to be the answer.
Diego, a shy swarthy man from Angangueo, drove us up to El Rosario in his pickup; halfway up the mountain we paid a toll to pass through one community's land; we hired a local guide, another requirement, even though we had two guides of our own; we bought T-shirts and mugs from the ramshackle wooden stalls at the entrance to the sanctuary.
Until recently there were communities that weren't benefiting from the tourist trade, and land clearing and logging continued. A new program established by the World Wildlife Fund with the support of the Mexican government hopes to put an end to that. Last November the W.W.F. established a trust fund of $6 million: with the interest it will buy logging permits -- in essence paying campesinos not to log -- and finance conservation activities to be carried out by local people. It sounds like a splendid idea but in an interview, Juan Bazaury-Creel, the director of World Wildlife Fund-Mexico warned "New ideas don't get accepted overnight."
The next morning we visited the butterflies at Sierra Chincua, a 45-minute drive north of Angangueo. The trail was over a mile long and took us to 10,700 feet. Young men with horses offered to take us, but, along with four others, I chose to make the hourlong hike accompanied by a local guide, Francisco Ambrosio Martinez.
Chincua is beautiful and feels wilder than El Rosario. Lupines and bright pink thistles flourish on the slopes, along with masses of hoja ancha, a tall plant with yellow flowers that the monarchs frequent. The sanctuary was opened in 1996 but only after intense discussion between the local communities that wanted to benefit from tourism and biologists, like Lincoln Brower, who felt the area should be maintained for research. 
Mr. Brower acknowledges that opening the sanctuaries provides income for the campesinos and raises public awareness. But he is distressed by the wear and tear wrought by the deluge of visitors. Most U.S tour groups schedule their visits on fairly quiet weekdays. Saturdays and Sundays, when the day trippers converge, are chaotic: it is estimated that 10,000 people visited El Rosario on a busy weekend last year. Clouds of dust kicked up by tourists threaten to asphyxiate some of the butterflies, and the horses at Chincua are grinding a track into the mountain that will lead to erosion. Even the food stalls at the sanctuaries are a drain on the natural resources -- every stand selling tortillas needs a wood fire on which to cook them.
We crested Sierra Chincua to find a cold wind buffeting the south western slope and the oyamels festooned in clusters of chilly monarchs. A path off the trail led to the heart of the colony. I longed to stand in a cloud of butterflies but Francisco did not want us disturbing them. With binoculars I watched the huddled monarchs transform into miniature winged stained-glass windows when the sun broke through the clouds and warmed them. 
That afternoon I roamed Angangueo's sleepy, pastel-hued streets until dusk and returned to the hotel in time for Astrid's talk on the life cycle of the monarchs. I can't say that traveling in a tour group is more eco-friendly than visiting the sanctuaries as an independent traveler. But the information Astrid presented and our three visits to the butterflies allowed me to glimpse the complex issues at stake. 
In late February the butterflies mature sexually and whirl together in mating dances that can last for 16 hours. Most of the males die. The females fly north to Texas and Louisiana to lay their eggs on milkweed.
This cycle of females searching out milkweed repeats itself two or three more times during the spring and summer, with each butterfly living no more than eight weeks. The late-summer monarchs put their sexual development on hold and live for six to eight months; they are the ones that migrate to Mexico.
On the third morning we returned to El Rosario for a last visit. The experience was extraordinary, yet it also disturbed me. Sunlit stretches of the trail acted as butterfly funnels and as we hiked up the monarchs streamed past, so close I could hear the pat-pat-pat of their wings. At the roosting area they swirled among the oyamels like embers from a fire.
Monarchs alighted in my hair and clung to my day pack. I felt increasingly oafish among such delicate creatures. Another group, several backpackers and a group of children, hiked up the trail. The air grew dustier and I watched a teenage boy, his arm slung around his girlfriend, step on a butterfly. I know that coral reefs are destroyed if you stand on them, and wandering off trail in alpine areas can impact the plant life, but in El Rosario I had evidence of the effect of my presence on the environment: butterflies floundering in the dust at my feet.
THAT afternoon we drove 70 miles southeast to the resort town of Valle de Bravo, where we checked into the luxurious Avandaro Hotel. The fireside trout dinner was superb, but by the time I settled into bed I wished we had spent one more night in Angangueo.
Eco-tourism is about giving back to the places one visits. I know I received far more. I arrived in Mexico with a head full of facts -- 250 million migrating monarchs, campesinos struggling to survive. I left with something more powerful and challenging: vivid recollections of the young boy from El Rosario who clung to the tailgate of the truck as we drove down the mountain and sang one out-of-tune song after another until we gave him a few pesos, and the shaded oyamels of Chincua wearing their butterflies like widows' weeds.

If you go
Natural Habitat Adventures runs tours to see the monarchs from early January until mid-March. There will be 10 five-day tours in 2002, with starting dates from Jan. 6 to March 10, and the price will be $2,195.

I paid $1,995 plus a single supplement of $300 for the five-day tour. It included transportation in Mexico, accommodations, all meals, all sodas and beers and bottled water, tips and park fees (which are negligible -- $1.60 a person). I got a round-trip ticket to Mexico City on Continental, departing from Newark, for $350. In addition I tipped the tour leaders and our bus drivers. 
The hotel in Angangueo can be a little chilly at night but I packed thermal underwear to sleep in, as advised by Natural Habitat, and I wasn't cold at all. Meals are for the most part simple Mexican fare.

HEADLINE: Rio's Squatters, By Guided Tour 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER; LARRY ROHTER is chief of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
LIKE it or not, Rio de Janeiro is famous not just for its beaches and the giant statue of Christ that looks down on the city from atop Corcovado Mountain but also for its favelas. These hillside squatter slums sprawl over some of the choicest pieces of real estate in Rio and in other Brazilian cities. But as symbols of glaring social inequality and rampant urban violence, they have traditionally been considered off limits to tourists.
 In recent years, though, a pair of for-profit companies -- Jeep Tour and Favela Tour -- have been conducting daily excursions, both focusing on Rocinha, the largest of the city's 800 or so favelas, with more than 150,000 residents. I have often visited favelas as a reporter, but in mid-March, just as Brazil's summer season was ending, I entered Rocinha on trips with both companies, riding as a passenger in a jeep with a group of about 10 tourists from countries like the United States, Germany, Sweden, Israel, Switzerland and Russia. Few knew much about favelas beyond the rather romanticized portrayal offered in films like the 1959 movie "Black Orpheus." 
 After riding with Jeep Tour to the very top of Rocinha, not far from the American School, the first group I accompanied got out, was directed to a narrow concrete passageway and began the steep descent. The stench of urine hung in the air, stray dogs barked at us and each other, garbage was piled on the ground, samba, gospel and Brazilian hillbilly music blared from radios, and all around us the walls were daubed with boastful graffiti: "I love life, but I'm flirting with death," one phrase proclaimed.
But as I soon discovered, not everything the tour groups see is quite so sordid. On both trips, guides pointed out where a private university was about to open. We stopped briefly at a medical clinic, saw banks and supermarkets that were equipped with air-conditioning and computers at the checkout line, and even walked past a McDonald's.
Many of the houses around us were ramshackle, made of bare brick or cinderblock with tin roofs, but most had water and electricity, and the streets were paved. Though fancy cameras and pale skin made our group easy to spot, we moved unchallenged and unthreatened among residents dressed neatly in simple, bright-colored clothes who were hurrying home with shopping bags or on their way to or from school.
"This is not the kind of poverty that you see in the bidonvilles around African cities," the Jeep Tour guide Hans Peter Lauenstein said. "A lot of people in Rocinha have color televisions, refrigerators and even air-conditioners. This is a normal city where you can get anything you want."
Midway through our trek, we paused as our guide knocked on the door of a dilapidated building, and then we climbed a set of stairs to a roof cluttered with water tanks and satellite dishes. It was a clear day and the vista was spectacular, offering views back toward Ipanema and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon and southwest to the seafront apartment towers of Sao Conrado and to Gavea Rock, where hang gliders were launching themselves into the air.
On my second visit, with Favela Tour, our group also visited a much smaller squatter settlement, called Vila Canoas, where we navigated our way through a maze of narrow, twisting pathways, each named for one of Brazil's states, to a preschool paid for in part by a percentage of our tour fee. 
As in Rocinha, the streets of Vila Canoas were teeming with activity. At a bar we passed on our way to the bakery, several men with glasses of beer in their hands were debating soccer and politics, closely observed by a group of young boys in bare feet and shorts who barely glanced at us as we walked by.
OF the two visits, I much preferred that of Favela Tour. At $21 a head, it is not only $9 cheaper than its competitor, Jeep Tour, but it also has Brazilian guides who make a special effort to explain the social and political context of what they show. That made the experience far richer than the one offered by Jeep Tour, many of whose guides are Europeans without an insider's knowledge of Brazilian society.
Even under the carefully controlled conditions of a guided tour, though, I spotted illegal activities that our guides, out of discretion, did not point out. On several street corners, people were lined up to place their bets on the jogo do bicho, the Brazilian equivalent of the numbers game. More ominous was a boca de fumo site, where drugs were being sold openly under the watchful gaze of a bare-chested, heavily muscled young man in sunglasses who was restraining a pit bull on a rope leash and seemed every bit like a drug dealer's lookout.
"We're not there to highlight forbidden things, and my guides are trained not to show that sort of thing to visitors," Bela Catarina Seabra, the director of Jeep Tour, explained when I asked her later why these slices of Rocinha life went unremarked. "Our objective is to show the attractive, functional part. Besides, if you point out a boca de fumo, then people are going to want to photograph them, and I'd be thrown out of Rocinha."
Granted, many people feel that there is something unseemly about touring a favela at all, and my 17-year-old daughter, Sonia, is one of them. Visiting on spring break from her college in New York City, she turned down my invitation to join me on one of the tours. "No way," she answered crisply. "That's so creepy and exploitative. I'd be embarrassed going to stare at a bunch of poor people in their houses."
The Rocinha Residents' Association, however, says it welcomes the tours, which in any case do not go into private homes. The community group operates a stand where handicrafts made by members are sold and has begun training young people in the hope they will be hired as guides by tour operators. In addition, the organization's leaders argue that tourists pump money into the local economy when they stop at shops to buy drinks, snacks or film.
"I'd like every tourist who comes to Rio to visit Rocinha, spend some money and see that we are a place that is growing and flourishing," said Paulo Cesar Martins Vieira, president of the community association. "There is a lot of prejudice against us out there, and so it makes us happy, gives us great joy, when tourists come and see that the reality is different from what they may have been told."
With the exception of a young woman who showed her disdain for us with a rude gesture as we drove into Rocinha with Jeep Tour, I found the residents to be receptive to our presence. We were accompanied nearly every step of the way by young children pleading to have their pictures taken, but there was no begging and many of the adults we came across waved or hailed us in English with greetings such as "Hello, my friend" or "Welcome, brothers."
Marcelo Armstrong, the owner of Favela Tour, said he had been taking tourists to Rocinha for nearly nine years, and in that time "I've never been threatened or had a problem" with the gangs that dominate it. Once or twice, he acknowledged, a neighborhood crime boss has advised him, "Don't let your people film today, don't let them take pictures here, because something is going to be going down." But no client of his has ever been assaulted or robbed, he said, "because the traffickers won't permit it."
In general, Mr. Armstrong said, criminal groups actually welcome the tourist presence, for very practical reasons. "The more that a favela becomes a tourist destination, the more the behavior of the police is likely to change, to become a little less aggressive," he said.
Yet even the most comprehensive tour is still offering a sanitized version of favela life. The weekend before my visits to Rocinha, an American Mormon couple who were in Rio visiting their missionary son took a wrong turn off a highway, entered the Vila Joao favela and were shot and seriously wounded by criminals who hijacked their car; when a pair of television crews went to the same favela the next day to report on the incident, they too were attacked and their cameras taken.
That's why the warning that our guide Alfredo Rocha de Souza issued at the end of Favela Tour's 90-minute visit should always be heeded. "Folks, just because you have now been to one favela, I don't want you to think that you can go to any other favela at any time you want and still be safe," he cautioned. "That's not true. It can be very dangerous, especially at night, so never go on your own, always go with a local person."
After my first tour, I asked the lone American couple who had been part of our group whether they had found the risk worthwhile and the visit illuminating. The two, Craig and Jean Humphries, are a doctor and nurse from Minneapolis, and so had a professional interest in examining conditions in a favela, but they both argued that any American tourist would benefit from seeing Rocinha.
"It's sad to think this is how people have to live, but the visit itself had a very powerful and positive impact on me," Dr. Humphries said. "If you've never seen something like this, you should absolutely go, because it will change the way you feel about things forever. I had the thought, What if I were born in this favela, what would I do? Would I respond to that kind of adversity with the same kind of graciousness?"
Mrs. Humphries said she also had a less idealistic reason for taking the tour, having spent most of her time in a luxury hotel or on the streets of Copacabana and Ipanema. "We've seen the glitzy part of Rio," she said. "I didn't want to go home without having seen the other side, and that's certainly what you see in Rocinha."

HEADLINE: Where Icebergs Are Born 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE recently completed an assignment as Canada bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
FLYING up a fjord, our tour helicopter hovered over diving humpback whales and then skimmed low among icebergs floating in a stately stream from an unseen glacier. Over the rotor noise, our guide, Gitte Johnsen, bantered with her charges in Danish and English, throwing in a few words of her native Greenlandic.
 Then the red and white Sikorsky clattered over land, moving toward the ancient granite blocks of an abandoned Viking farmstead. Below, the treeless, brown landscape was etched with meandering caribou paths. Suddenly, Gitte switched mental gears. Lunging to a window, she raised an imaginary rifle to a gold earring and sighted down an invisible barrel at a caribou standing motionless. "Pow, pow, pow," she cried triumphantly. 
 The vision of a fat, late-summer caribou had peeled away our stylish guide's thin overlay of Copenhagen chic to reveal the hard-wired hunting instincts that for millenniums enabled humans to live in this beautiful and demanding land. 
Greenland, the world's largest island, has always floated in the northern mists of American consciousness as, well, up there. In children's geography games, spoilsports routinely deride Greenland as 85 percent covered by an ice sheet, ignoring the fact that the remaining 15 percent encompasses a land area the size of Norway, with rich cultures and glorious landscapes. But, for the last half-century, virtually the only Americans who visited Greenland were airmen, assigned to the coldest duty of the cold war. Although barely 15 miles east of Canada at the nearest point, Scandinavia's cultural colony in North America remained informally off limits to tourists from North America.
In recent years, Greenlanders have tried to build economic autonomy from Denmark, with hopes of one day attaining full political independence. Today tourism is quietly emerging as one of the island's leading industries. Attracted by pristine fjords to kayak, Viking ruins to hike, or simply icebergs to watch, about 31,000 tourists visited Greenland last year, a large number for an island that has only 56,000 inhabitants. Greenland today offers a basic tourism infrastructure of comfortable hotels, good restaurants, municipal tourism agencies and reliable air and boat service connecting coastal towns. But with Danes accounting for three-quarters of the visitors, the joys of Greenland have remained a Scandinavian secret.
Scandinavians fly from Copenhagen on direct Greenlandair flights to Narsarsuaq or Kangerlussuaq, the island's air hub, or on daily SAS flights to Kangerlussuaq, and then fly north to Ilulissat, to watch icebergs calve from glaciers. 
Every summer, Ilulissat Kangerlua, a fjord two miles south of Ilulissat, presents the spectacle of the world's largest concentration of icebergs outside of Antarctica. From a three-mile-wide glacier, 20 million tons of ice break off each day -- some into pieces as large as city blocks. 
To the south of Nuuk, the area around Narsarsuaq offers Viking ruins, including the preserved 1,000-year-old remains of Brattahlid, the hillside farm of Eric the Red, the Norwegian who led colonization of Greenland, in 986. At their peak, the Viking colonies probably numbered about 3,000 people, enough to prompt the Vatican to appoint bishops regularly for about 200 years. But in the mid-1300's, the Norse started abandoning their colonies around Nuuk, retreating southward. The last written trace of the Norse in Greenland was an Icelandic record of a Greenland marriage in 1408. Archaeologists now believe that the last Viking colonies in Greenland were abandoned around 1450.
To this day, historians argue over the mystery of the vanished Viking colonies -- whether they fell victim to plague, famine, attacks by Inuit or English pirates, or, most likely, were caught in a mini-ice age that cut off supply ships from Iceland, and destroyed Greenland's dairy economy. 
In 1721, after a three-century hiatus, a Danish king sent a missionary to Greenland, believing he would re-Christianize pagan Viking descendants. Instead, he found only Inuit. Had they lasted another 50 years, the Viking colonies could have served as supply stations for Europe's second, and more enduring, encounter with North America.
At Anavik, the Viking farmstead built at the head of a deep fjord east of Nuuk, I sat on a lichen-encrusted granite block, hewed by Viking hands almost a millennium ago. I tried to imagine managing without a windbreaker to ward off the early September chill, or the transportation convenience of a fjord-hopping tourist helicopter. Before me, a view swept down to dark waters, where bluish white icebergs floated serenely. Behind me a fiercely green meadow spread like a carpet up to the bare, rocky mountains. In this Arctic silence, a waterfall could be heard splashing half a mile away. Far below, on an alluvial beach, a cluster of tents signaled the presence of weekend caribou hunters, who had arrived by motorboat from Nuuk, threading their way through the icebergs.
Only a 90-minute jet flight across the Davis Strait separates Greenlanders from their Inuit ethnic and linguistic cousins in Arctic Canada. But different patterns of colonization have created divergent worlds. Walking down a street in Nuuk, a tidy Scandinavian-style coastal village that now markets itself as the world's Cool Capital, I tried to decipher bilingual signs, printed in both Danish and Greenlandic. Asking passers-by for directions, I frequently detected mild panic in the eyes of locals, who searched desperately for English verbs they learned in high school, but never needed to use.
FURTHER confusing visitors, Greenlanders seem to compete with the Welsh in adopting place names that are nigh impossible for outsiders to pronounce, like Ittoqqortoormiit (ee-DOH-grow-doh-meet), or "those that live where there is most peat." In full decolonization mode, Greenlanders also have abandoned the Danish names that once gave some of us a precarious toehold on their island's geography. Nuuk, for example, appeared on children's geography board games until recently as Godthab. American veterans who flew for decades into Sondre Stromfjord, near the island's southwest coast, will search maps in vain for their old base, finally finding the old airstrip under a new name, Kangerlussuaq, the international airport.
But, in an era of globalizing homogeneity, Greenland also offers a throwback to travel circa the 1970's: no CNN on hotel television, no AT&T USA Direct for cheap calls home, no easy Internet access, and people lighting up cigarettes at every turn. Greenland is one corner of the world where American influence has actually receded. 
While the American military virtually ran the island during World War II, the network of bases here has dwindled from 17 stations to one, in Thule, an electronic eavesdropping post in the far north. Contacted by telephone, taciturn United States Air Force officers made it clear that they were not pining for uninvited visitors from the home country. In Nuuk, home rule government's foreign affairs office now occupies a brown wooden cottage that, until 1953, held the offices of the last American consulate in Greenland.
As modern Greenlanders wean themselves from the generous Danish embrace, they hope to draw more tourists from North America -- Viking enthusiasts or simply those eager to explore. With no commercial flights between the United States and Greenland, the roughly 1,000 North Americans who venture to Greenland annually usually come on an Arctic cruise or via Iceland or Canada, the two North Atlantic countries with direct flights to Greenland.
Late last summer, I happened to be working in Iqaluit, so it was a quick hop on what some call "the Eskimo friendship flight" -- a weekly First Air flight between the capital of Canada's new Nunavut Territory and Kangerlussuaq. 
"I have been going for 25 years, and have never missed a year," Kenn Harper, a Canadian author and businessman, told me in Iqaluit. Referring to Nunavut, he added: "Tourism is doing better in Greenland than here." 
Once in Nuuk or Narsarsuaq, visitors who are not in a rush can forgo expensive air travel for Arctic Umiaq Line, a shipping service with two large boats and a small one that regularly link about a dozen towns from southern Greenland up the west coast. From June to mid-August, boats travel three times a week; in spring and fall, twice weekly and in winter once. The ships' slower pace allows visitors to meet local people. The frequency allows visitors to debark in a town for a few days before continuing on the next boat. Increasingly popular, the boats require reservations. (For details, see www.visitgreenland.com/aul.) 
Pressed for time, I hopped around the island via Greenlandair, the state airline, which serves 22 towns, half with fixed wing planes, half by helicopter. After landing in Kangerlussuaq from Canada, I entered Greenland without a passport check. Then, I jumped a quick Greenlandair shuttle to Nuuk, hardly a bargain at $520 round trip for an hourlong flight.
Other visitors later told me I should have stuck around. More than an old military base, Kangerlussuaq is now a base for day trips offered by the municipal tourism agency, Kangerlussuaq Tourism. The most popular is the musk ox photo safari, a 90-minute excursion that takes visitors jouncing across the brown rock landscape to see some of the 4,000 shaggy, sleepy-eyed beasts that graze locally. The agency also offers 15-mile rides to the edge of the nearest glacier, either by jeep or by Icelandic pony. From December through April, dogs pulling sleds in a fantail hitch take visitors on outings across the snow. 
In Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk, visitors may be tempted by boutiques selling elegantly cut coats and jackets made from sealskins. Americans can look but not buy, as Congress forbids United States residents to bring sealskin products into the United States. The legislation was aimed at the baby seal hunt in Canada, but it also swept up Greenland, where an estimated five million adult harp seals swim in the Davis Strait. Although seals in Greenland waters are as threatened as deer in the woods of New England, the law applies equally to them. This irks Greenlanders, who have been hunting seals for about 4,400 years.
Exhibits on sealing, kayaking, dog sledding and other facets of Greenland's cultural history can be found, with English-language texts, at the National Museum of Greenland, in Nuuk, down by the old colonial harbor. Deep in the exhibition rooms is the mummy room, a sad display of a family from the Qilaqitsoq area that died, probably in a boating accident, around 1475 A.D. Their body tattoos, hand-stitched boots and jewelry are little touched by the centuries. Outside, in the fresh air, the wharf is a good vantage point for watching whales and training by a new generation of Greenlanders skillful in the qajaq, or kayak.
A short walk from the museum are a series of restaurants that offer Greenland fare -- from herring to caribou stew. If you try the national dish, suassat, a seal meat stew often served in Greenland homes, make sure it has been fully digested before confronting United States Customs inspectors in Ottawa.
Like the Mercedes cabs at Nuuk's airport, service in restaurants can sometimes seem a little out of sync. On one hand, waiters have a Scandinavian formality that seems out of place in Nuuk, population 13,500. Then they can get distracted. During one lunch at Restaurant Nipisa, a white-tablecloth establishment, the lone waiter stayed on the telephone for 15 minutes.
As lunch stretched into two hours, I was reminded of a study conducted in the late 1990's by Danish doctors intrigued by Greenland's abnormally low heart disease rates. The doctors surveyed Greenlanders about risk factors, including stress. But, even after the word stress had been elaborately translated into Greenlandic, about one-quarter of respondents said they did not know what the doctors were talking about.
Optimists in a land synonymous elsewhere with winter gloom, Greenlanders have chosen as their national flag a red sun rising over white polar ice. Since Greenland has never had a revolution, residents chose June 21 as their national day. In this land of the midnight sun, Greenlanders focus on their longest day of the year, a day without darkness, a day without cold.

Land of glaciers is not all ice and snow

Getting There
For Americans, the easiest access to Greenland is the First Air flight I took last summer from Iqaluit to Kangerlussuaq. This flight begins every Tuesday morning in Ottawa, from which there are direct flights to and from Boston, New York and Washington, and stops in Iqaluit, then Kangerlussuaq and then Nuuk; a return trip is made every Tuesday afternoon. Information: (800) 267-1247; www.firstair.ca. 
Building on this flight, Tour Trends, (888) 318-7233), www
.tourtrends.on.ca, of Newmarket, Ontario, has developed a series of Greenland summer tours. No visas are required of Americans or Canadians.
From Iceland, Icelandair Holidays, (800) 779-2899, www.icelandair
.com, offers flights Monday through Saturday from May 29 to Sept. 29 from Reykjavik to Kulusuk, the largest village on Greenland's lightly populated eastern coast.
This summer, Icelandair will offer charter service to Ammassalik, a helicopter ride of less than 20 miles from Kulusuk; call (800) 779-2899. 
Greenlandair offers flights around the country; (299) 34 34 34; www
.greenlandair.gl.
For general information, contact the National Tourist Board of Greenland, Post Office Box 1615, DK-3900 Nuuk, Greenland; (299) 34 28 20, fax (299) 32 28 77. The Web site, www
.visitgreenland.com, has about 1,800 Web pages of English-language information on flights, hotels, sights, tours and tour operators.

Sightseeing
The one-day helicopter tour over whales and icebergs in Nuuk fjord to the Ilulissat glacier and the Viking ruins cost $238, at 8.38 Danish kroner to the dollar, and was booked at Nuuk Tourism, on the waterfront in the old port; Hans Egedesvej 29, Post Office Box 199, DK-3900 Nuuk; (299) 32 27 00, fax (299) 32 27 10; www

kangerlussuaq/info; about $20.

Where to Stay
I stayed six nights at the 109-room Hotel Hans Egede, at 3 Aqqusinersuaq Street -- Nuuk's largest and most upscale hotel, with a sixth-floor restaurant, the Sky-Top, that affords views of the town and the harbor. In true Scandinavian style, the bathrooms come with elegant fixtures that require a few minutes of study to work. The rate for a single room, with a narrow, spartan bed, is $130; doubles from $146; the two suites are $286. Telephone (299) 32 42 22, fax (299) 32 44 87; on the Web, 
www.greenland-guide.dk/hhe.
More affordable alternatives in Nuuk include four youth hostels, a seaman's home and several bed-and-breakfasts; all can be reached through Nuuk Tourism.

Where to Eat
The Sky-Top restaurant at the Hans Egede offers a quiet atmosphere, beautiful summer sunset views and local specialties. I had tenderloin of reindeer on a bed of carrots for $23. The Greenland archaeologist I met there had roast rib of musk ox, with sauteed mushrooms and asparagus, also for $23. For reservations, call (299) 32 42 22.
Across the street and up a flight, Restaurant Nipisa, (299) 32 12 10, offers more elegant dining, often veering into Scandinavian fish and herring dishes. Though service was slow, I still came back, for the food and for the convenience. 
Cheaper lunches can be had at the airy cafeteria in the town's modern cultural center, Katuaq, on Skibshavnsvej, (299) 32 33 00. Two deli-style sandwiches with juice cost $14. 
A few blocks down from the Hans Egede Hotel, I had dinner -- pasta with three cheeses and a beer imported from Denmark -- for $11 at Rock Cafe, a self-service restaurant in the nonstop music style of a Hard Rock Cafe. JAMES BROOKE

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
Stendhal's Florence, With E-Mail and Pucci

BYLINE:  By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
I HAD no illusions about Florence: It is one of the biggest box office draws in tourism. And while my dream was to wander in silent reverie among Renaissance treasures and elegant palazzi, I knew it was more likely I'd be struck by Stendhal's syndrome in the company of busloads of tourists. Still, I was not prepared for the crowds -- no, throngs -- I encountered in the city on my four-day April visit.
 People spilled into the narrow streets, overwhelming the Vespas and Fiats that gingerly negotiated through the tourist parade. Visitors waited, patiently, and often in long snaky lines, at the doors of Florence's top attractions: the Duomo, the Uffizi Gallery and Prada. It's the kind of scene that usually wrecks my mood and drives me to my guidebooks in search of a Travel Plan B. 
 But not this time. I loved Florence. 
And actually I was glad for the company of so many strangers. In a city overflowing with gorgeous things that you not only can see and admire, but often can also buy and take home (at the fantastic exchange rate of 2,180 lire to the dollar), a certain guilty anxiety sets in after a while. Florence is a city of twin sirens, art and conspicuous consumption. But how do you navigate between them both? 
Stendhal's famous Florentine art attack was the result of aesthetic overload -- so much beauty! So little time! My swoons, on the other hand, tended to occur outside shop windows as I checked and rechecked the zeroes on my calcluator against the ones on the price tags, and a little voice inside my head whispered: "Hey, you can afford this!" In such moments, being surrounded by so many other people struggling under a load of Michelin guides, guilt and shopping bags made me feel much better.
Normally, I'm too busy thinking about travel expenses for luxury items to enter my radar. But getting to Florence, and staying there, was a deal as fantastic as the ones in the shop windows. In March, noticing that air fares to Europe were on sale, I checked around and found a ticket on Lufthansa through the Internet broker Cheap Tickets that would take me in mid-April from J.F.K. in New York to Florence then back from Rome to J.F.K. for only $400.
I flirted with the idea of just showing up in Italy without a hotel reservation, and catching a bargain on the fly. But then I remembered the 27 faxes I had to send to find a hotel room in Venice in 1999. Actually, it was easier to find reasonably priced rooms in Florence than it had been in Venice, even though April is the beginning of the city's high season. Using the Web, and the Florence guidebook from the useful Time Out series, I sent out a half-dozen reservation requests by e-mail, and got two "yes" responses from hotels in central Florence. Using my credit card number, I booked two nights in a single with bath at the Hotel Casci, just north of the Duomo, at $82 a night, and two nights at the Hotel Alessandra, near the Ponte Vecchio, also a single with bath, for $87.
Flying over the Atlantic, straitjacketed in a too-small economy seat in a full 747, my leg muscles paid the hidden cost of my discount ticket, but I consoled myself with the thought of the clean, warm bed waiting for me at the Hotel Casci.
"Hello, my name is Miss McLane, and I have a reservation," I told the desk clerk with a smile. He returned my smile, shuffled through some papers, and then paused uncomfortably. 
"You did not answer the last e-mail," he said.
I pulled out my confirmation letter, which I had printed out from my computer. The clerk frowned. 
"I am so sorry," he said. "We e-mailed you again because your credit card number did not verify. I am afraid we had to let your reservation go."
Despair. I had not slept the previous night, and my internal clock was still set to New York, where it was now 4:30 a.m. I looked at the reservation I'd sent out, and realized that, overeager to respond, I'd reversed two digits in my credit card number. But I'd never received the hotel's follow-up e-mail message. 
"Our e-mail, sometimes it does not work," the clerk admitted. "But don't worry. There is no problem. We find a room for you at the hotel across the street. Same price. It is a family-run hotel, just like this one. Hotel Europa."
He handed me a gift -- a cellophane-wrapped Florence calendar -- but the gesture barely registered as I pondered my bleak future. I hadn't seen the Hotel Europa in any of the guidebooks. Staggering with my bag, I darted through the traffic of the Via C. Cavour, found the address across the street, and went up a floor to the Europa in its small, creaky elevator.
At the desk, a gentle grandfatherly man, who introduced himself as Mr. Gassim, a Somalian who had bought the hotel with his family in the 1970's, had already been informed of my plight by the Casci's desk clerk.
"You must be tired," he said. "Don't worry about filling out the registration, I'll take your passport later after you rest. We have a nice room for you."
Taking my bag with a smile, he led me down the hall, and opened a door to a small room that was spotless, furnished simply with a twin bed, desk and wardrobe. I peeked in the bathroom -- teeny, but also clean, with a bidet, sink, and shower stall -- and felt relieved. This was just fine.
But there was more. Stepping over to the window, Mr. Gassim pulled open the shutters with a flourish, to reveal a postcard-perfect view of a lovely courtyard, and in the background, the Duomo.
"Your room with a view," he said merrily. "Enjoy your rest."
This is too easy, I thought, the next morning at breakfast as Mr. Gassim -- now in a white jacket, bustling about the Europa's lovely breakfast room with its faded frescoed ceiling -- taught me how to use the hotel's cappuccino machine, which, at the push of a button, hissed and sputtered and spat out a perfect latte on demand. I had the same thought as I bypassed a two-hour line and breezed ahead of the crowds into the Uffizi Gallery later that morning.
Before leaving for Italy, forewarned by friends and guidebooks, I'd made a reservation at the Uffizi. You can do this most cheaply by telephone -- it's a $1.50 fee on top of the normal $7 -- but I decided to do it through an agency I found online, www.weekendafirenze.com, which charges a $5 commission, opting for the convenience of e-mail over busy signals and a pricey overseas phone call. Much to my delight, the Internet agency sent my confirmation promptly, with a chit for a free cappuccino in a cafe near the Uffizi.
Getting in was a snap, but it took a while for me to get the hang of enjoying what, as it turned out, was Florence's most packed museum. At first, I used my pushy New York moves, elbowing my way to the Botticellis -- the "Primavera" is definitely worth breaking out the elbows. But then I began to notice how the crowd ebbed and flowed.
If you timed your approach to fit between the large tour groups, you could have those few precious moments alone (well, almost) with Michelangelo's "Doni Tondo." 
And at other museums, the crowds thinned to manageable size. I was astonished by Michelangelo's erotic, compelling "Bacchus" in the Bargello, but even more amazed by my access to it. I could have touched it if I wanted, and no one else was around in this museum that is said to be to sculpture what the Uffizi is to painting.
The historic center of Florence, I found, is the perfect playground for a traveler on a four- or five-day itinerary. The distances are not so large that you need to bother figuring out public transportation (or walking your soles off), but it is big and varied and fascinating enough to wander contentedly on foot.
There are easily learned landmarks -- the Duomo; the Arno River; the Ponte Vecchio, with its profusion of gold jewelry shops; the Piazza della Signoria, with its copy of Michelangelo's "David"; the fortresslike Palazzo Pitti -- to keep you from getting lost. And as I discovered while exploring the Oltrarno, a neighborhood of narrow winding cobblestone streets lined with apartments and artisan's workshops on the south, or left, side of the Arno, there are plenty of nooks and crannies in which to hide from the tour groups.
The Oltrarno became my favorite haunt, when I wasn't gaping at masterpieces or designer handbags. There, I watched elderly artisans rebuilding antique chairs, fitting fabulous heavy Florentine damasks over horsehair cushions. I found one of those hole-in-the-wall Italian lingerie shops where the salesclerk looks you up and down, then pulls out a dusty box from the wall, filled with exquisite silk and lace goodies that fit perfectly.
And I tended to eat on that side of the Arno, for after a day or so, I noticed there was an inverse correlation between the number of non-Italians in a restaurant and the quality of its food. The best meal I had in Florence was a lunch in Alla Vecchia Bettola, a trattoria not far from Oltrarno, in San Frediano. I was the only foreigner, and the staff was not overly friendly when I sat down alone at an outside table. But once I tasted a slice of the restaurant's exquisite beef carpaccio, covered with fresh artichokes and drizzled with rich Tuscan olive oil, I could have cared less about frosty service.
I ate well, though not always so splendidly, in Florence, and wished I had more time (and appetite) to restaurant hop. There were trattorias on nearly every corner with menus in my price range -- a typical meal of three courses and a small carafe of wine was around $25. But the quality varied wildly, even in the same meal. 
At Osteria del Cinghiale Bianco in Oltrarno, I ate an amazing, tangy plate of salami and other assorted cold cuts homemade from wild boar, a house specialty. But it was followed by a humdrum plate of stewed lamb. I yearned to know a local person, who surely would know exactly where to go and what to order.
I had much more success at shopping. I slid my hands into a pair of silk-lined Florentine-red leather gloves ($27) at Madova, just over the Ponte Vecchio in Colli, and said, si. In a boutique on the fashionable Via dei Tornabuoni, I took three tottering steps in black high-heeled mules from the Milan design house Costume National and then took them home, for $134 (in SoHo, at Tootsie Plohound, the same pair cost $235).
And, finally, in my weakest moment, I plunked down my credit card and bought a gorgeous silk scarf, patterned in swirling geometric Op Art pinks, blacks and oranges, at Emilio Pucci. No, it wasn't a bargain, but it appealed both to my 60's nostalgia, and to my growing affection for Florence (the Puccis are a noble old Florentine family).
I MOVED to the Hotel Alessandra, on the Borgo SS. Apostoli, for my last two days. It had no view, and I missed the Gassims' warmth. But my room, again with a twin bed, was a bit larger, and the Alessandra was much closer to the shops. 
Best of all, it had a new marble-tiled bathroom with a long, deep tub. I filled it with hot water and sprinkles of Florentine cologne made from 17th-century recipes (so they say) by the Santa Maria Novella Pharmacy ($27), and lay contentedly, wondering what in the world was turning me into such a fashion princess.
In the royal apartments of the Palazzo Pitti, drifting through room after room decorated with over-the-top velvet wallpaper and can-you-believe-this chandeliers, it hit me: The Medicis. It was all their fault. They surrounded themselves with things of great beauty, blurring the boundaries between art and conspicuous consumption. Now, hundreds of years later, as I walked through their rooms, their collections, their furniture, I understood where my sudden hunger for exquisite, if perhaps frivolous, things was coming from.
That night, in my room at the Alessandra, I deconstructed my haul, taking apart the packages, discarding the shoeboxes and fancy wrappings, and cramming everything into my carry-on. It was then that I noticed that none of the clothes hangers in the wardrobe of my budget hotel matched. And that every one was stamped with designer names: Prada, Gucci, Armani. 
I looked at the cast-off hangers of travelers past, the wastebasket filled with my abandoned shopping bags, then at my bulging suitcase, and I had to laugh. The real peril of Florence is Medici syndrome.

Bottom line in a city of bounty
I spent $118.25 a day during four days and nights in Florence last month, including hotel, food, local transportation, and museum admissions. The exchange rate was 2,180 lire to the dollar. 

Getting There
From Cheap Tickets, www
.cheaptickets.com, I got a ticket to Italy on Lufthansa from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Florence via Frankfurt, then back from Rome to J.F.K. The fare was $400, plus an $11.95 delivery charge.

Where to Stay
My $82 room at the Hotel Europa, Via C. Cavour 14, (39-055) 239-6715, fax (39-055) 210-361, www
.webhoteleuropa.com, was small but clean, with a closet-sized private bath (shower, no tub). The twin bed and other furnishings were Ikea-basic but the casement windows were triple-glazed. The rate included a breakfast of yogurt, cereal, bread, cheese and cappuccino.
The view from my $87 room at Hotel Alessandra, Borgo SS. Apostoli 17, (39-055) 283-438, fax (39-055) 210-619, www.hotelalessandra.com, was of a dark alley. But the room also had a big new marble bathroom with a deep tub and some inkling of Florentine design in the red bedspreads and drapes. Here, too, breakfast was a cold buffet.

Where to Eat
Alla Vecchia Bettola, Viale L. Ariosto 32r-34r, (39-055) 224-158, is a neighborhood trattoria near the Piazza Tasso in San Frediano. Rigatoni with meat sauce and beef carpaccio dressed with slivers of artichoke and olive oil came to $16.50 without wine.
At Le Volpi e L'Uva, a terrific little wine bar at Piazza de Rossi 1, in Oltrarno, (39-055) 239-8132, I had a glass of a velvety Sangiovese that, at $3.50, was the most expensive on that night's list. The bar closes at 8 p.m.
At Trattoria La Baruciola, Via Maggio 61r, (39-055) 218-906, in Oltrarno, I had a solid meal of ribbon pasta in a meat-and-tomato sauce, and arugula salad with tangy Parmesan for $21.55, including a small carafe of wine and dessert.
At Osteria del Cinghiale Bianco, Borgo S. Jacopo 43r, (39-055) 215-706, my big lunch with dessert, coffee and wine was $28.

What to See
I stuck to the major museums. Opening and closing times change frequently, so it's advisable to stop at a municipal tourist office (there's one at the Santa Maria Novella train station) and pick up a listing of hours. The office phone number is (39-055) 290-832.
I reserved my $7 ticket for the Uffizi Gallery, Piazzale Degli Uffizi 6, (39-055) 238-8651-652, through www
.weekendafirenze.com, which charges $5. Tickets can also be reserved by calling (39-055) 294-883.
The lines at the Galleria dell'Accademia, Via Ricasoli 60, (39-055) 238-612, were shorter, and moved faster than at the Uffizi -- most people were waiting simply for a glimpse of Michelangelo's "David," which is exhibited here with his unfinished "Slaves." Entry is $5.50.
The Bargello, Via del Proconsolo 4, (39-055) 238-8606, is a trove of Renaissance sculpture that, oddly, doesn't attract the crowds of the Uffizi. Entry is $3.70.
The Medicis' fortresslike Palazzo Pitti, Via Gucciardini at the Boboli Gardens, (39-055) 238-8614, is home to several museums, including the Galleria Palatina, with its Renaissance paintings, and the Royal Apartments, which provide a giddy glimpse of the high life in Florence, circa 1600. Admission to both is $5.50. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: Uneasy Being Green: Tourism Runs Wild 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN; TIMOTHY EGAN reports for The Times from Seattle.

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, everyone is an eco-tourist, or so it seems. The traveler may be playing shuffleboard on a cruise ship, martini in hand, when a whale passes by, or hunting exotic species in a private wildlife park in Texas. Typical tourists? No, sir. To hear the marketers tell it, these activities are part of the fastest-growing segment of the world's dominant industry.
 A look inside any magazine devoted to travel tells the same story. Up pops the stunning rainbow of pictures of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, billed in an ad as "the last unspoiled Caribbean paradise." Or an enticement from the Florida Everglades, showing beach-lolling laziness alongside gator-gazing in a canoe, with the tag line, "Go Wild . . . Stay Civilized." And then there are expeditions to the coldest places on the planet, the Arctic or Antarctica, sold as Shackleton-era survival adventure with fine cuisine and decent wine. 
 Iceland is hot, with visits up nearly 20 percent last year. Ditto the maturing eco-havens of Central America, which saw an 8.8 percent growth in visitors in 2000 over the previous year. And Qatar, once so anonymous that most Americans probably thought it was a television brand rather than than a Middle Eastern emirate, is enjoying such a boom in nature-based travel the government is planning an eco-tourist resort by the very sea that was the centerpiece of the Persian Gulf war a decade ago. 
Gone is the old image of the green pilgrim, the sojourner with backpack and Tibetan prayer book. It was not long ago that the only people you would see in winter at the soggiest western edge of the Pacific Northwest were those trying to get arrested in an antilogging protest. Now the loggers are largely gone, and local businesses run ads in major newspapers touting old-growth forests and moss as eco-destinations, under a headline, "We'd hug a tree, but our arms aren't long enough."
Just in time, the United Nations has designated 2002 the International Year of Ecotourism. In an age when more than 500 million people travel for leisure, eco-tourism is growing by 20 to 30 percent a year, according to several private organizations that track travel growth. 
Half of all American adults took an "adventure" travel vacation in the last five years, according to the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group that defines adventure as anything from camping to river rafting. About 24 million Americans traveled simply to watch birds or animals, the group says.
But what is good for hotels, guides and sellers of binoculars may not necessarily be good for sea turtles in the South Atlantic, puffins in Alaska or architectural ruins in the Andes. And so, as the green label is attached to all manner of travel, a number of countries and organizations are promoting a system to certify what is good eco-tourism and what is bad. 
They have their work cut out for them, of course, but at least one country -- Australia -- has already gone down the certification road, and has been given high marks by travelers, environmental organizations and tour groups.
Beyond the emerging certification fight is a concern that the world's growing curiosity about, say, blue-footed boobies in the Galapagos or gorillas in the upland mist of Uganda may ultimately put the birds and primates in peril. The second major cause of worry around the growth of eco-tourism, according to proponents of traveling light in the sand, is the question of whether the land, people and biological diversity of a given area can be sustained through waves of outside visitors. 
"We're not going to stop the movement by people to the last unvisited places on the planet," said Martha Honey, author of "Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise?," published in 1999 by Island Press. "But we cannot continue to travel as we have." 
Any corner of the globe can go from hidden paradise to pejorative in little time. People worry that their favorite tucked-away beach or mountain hideaway will soon become Aspenized or Cancunized, to use the terms that have evolved to evoke excess, glitter and crowds where once there was mostly snow or sand. 
Hawaii is the first American state where legal challenges have been brought against using tax dollars to promote more visitor growth. The courts have been asked to decide whether money spent to bring in more tourists requires an environmental impact statement. If the environmentalists prevail, the state would have to weigh the impact of new visitors on the islands in the same way it now looks at proposed power plants or highways.
The flip side of the argument that tourists ultimately degrade a place is that tourists also create market demand and a political constituency for saving a place or a species. River guides in British Columbia, fighting mining proposals and logging in wild places, or even the sea turtle guides in Hawaii can attest to the power of creating instant conservationists out of visitors.
Major hotel chains, cruise ships and megaresorts have been underscoring their earth-friendly practices of late. Some of these enterprises do a commendable job of protecting the local environment, Ms. Honey said, but others are engaged in "greenwashing," promoting themselves as earth-friendly simply because they have small showerheads or do not wash guest towels every day.
"These are cost-saving measures, and they may have very little to do with eco-tourism," Ms. Honey said. 
Even defining eco-tourism, nearly a quarter-century after the term started to appear, is difficult. The most simple explanation is that eco-tourism is nature-based travel. That market is huge, and growing. Bird-watching alone grew 157 percent from 1982 to 1994, according to a study done by sporting goods manufacturers. 
Theme parks may still be big draws, but in survey after survey, travelers say they are looking for authenticity, unfettered nature, or a chance to swim with sea mammals, and to do it with a clear conscience. 
Cruise ship passengers, reflecting the tastes of the middle-age traveler, increasingly want to climb ice walls or visit native villages when they get off the boat in a port like Juneau or Skagway in Alaska. 
"I think we all see ourselves as Robinson Crusoe and we have to get there and be the pioneers," said Megan Epler Wood, president of the International Eco-tourism Society, which has members in 138 countries and is based in Vermont. 
Ms. Wood's organization, founded in 1990 to assist travel professionals, defines eco-tourism as "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of local people."
But determining what kind of travel is good for the environment, and does not turn the local folks into walking props, will be part of the heavy lifting in any certification process. Should travel agencies police themselves? Should government do the certification? Can a global organization like the United Nations decide what is good and what is not, especially when developing nations are starved for foreign currency? 
As those questions are being sorted out, travelers have to do their own homework. In Maui, for example, whale-watching and swimming with sea turtles have become enormous growth industries, with virtually all the services claiming to be whale-friendly. But not all the companies obey the federal regulation that whale-watching boats keep a certain distance, and stay out of the way of the big humpbacks as they go through mating rituals in the warm Pacific. Only an exhaustive search of Coast Guard records would turn up repeat violators. But who wants to spend a vacation going over public documents in a basement room? 
"The best thing a consumer can do is ask a lot of questions," Ms. Wood said. "If consumers are not demanding, businesses can get away with a lot of sloppy practices and broad claims."
Some environmental groups are trying to stimulate eco-tourism rather than simply monitoring tour groups.
A few years ago, the RARE Center for Tropical Conservation, an environmental group based in Arlington, Va., started an eco-tourism development program in some of the countries whose natural areas it was trying to protect. The group now trains former fishermen, hunters, even poachers, as nature, fishing or kayaking guides to give them an economic stake in conservation. More than 200 nature guides have been trained in Honduras, Costa Rica and Mexico, and given assistance on how to set up businesses, the group says. 
"We have turned poachers into nature guides, poachers into ambassadors of the environment," said Brett Jenks, president of RARE. "I don't think there is a better way to create a consituency for conservation than through eco-tourism."
In the Southwestern United States, along the border country where the Colorado River empties into Sonora, Mexico, another group has been trying to build a local economy of eco-visitors in a similar way. La Ruta de Sonora, based in Ajo, Ariz., promotes trips of three to eight days enabling visitors can follow the trade routes of pre-Columbian Hohokam Indians, retrace the footsteps of Spanish Missionaries, or look at migratory birds in the company of people who live in the desert delta. Rather than simply taking tourists to tramp around the desert and gawk at people living in adobe huts, the group has been able to assist those who live on the Sonoran side of the border to become active in the visitor trade.
"It's provided hope and an alternative in areas where agriculture may be marginal and there is a lot of poverty," said Steve Cornelius, of the Sonoran Institute, an environmental group that helped to set up the tours. 
But Mr. Cornelius also worries that too many tourists on the same off-the-beaten-path can be damaging. "Tourism can be a real threat to these areas," he said. "So we have to be careful."
ALREADY, some of the world's most biologically diverse areas have come under heavy regulation, while others are close to choking on the dust of tourist hordes. The Galapagos, Charles Darwin's living laboratory that inspired his theory of evolution, is under a strict quota of 60,000 visitors a year. Only licensed guides can take people to a small part of the national park. 
But the regulations have angered fishermen, who went on a strike last year and held three giant tortoises hostage. The government of Ecuador later increased the fishing quotas, and the tortoises were released, unharmed.
To some travelers, Machu Picchu has lost its mystery and allure since the Peruvian government has done little to slow the stampede to the formerly lost city. There are other ruins in the Andes that could take some of the pressure off Machu Picchu, but they have yet to catch the visitor wave.
Costa Rica is often held up by people in the travel industry as a model of light-on-the-land tourist development. It is known for its clean beaches, mystical cloud forests alive with orchids and butterflies, and well-run national parks. 
"They do eco-tourism very well in Costa Rica," said Ms. Honey, the author, who lived there. "And it has been largely beneficial to local people." 
Though a few major hotels chains along the line of Cancun high-rises have been proposed, Costa Rica has encouraged small-scale development. And the parks are now trying to get more people to come during the off-seasons -- anytime but winter. 
Even with a global economic slowdown, experts predict that world travel is on path to double in 10 years, when an estimated one billion people are projected to take a trip to another country. "Tourism at the turn of the century is growing faster than even our most optimistic predictions," said Francesco Frangialli, secretary general of the World Tourism Organization.
But with optimism also comes a cautionary note from people who have seen their particular paradise in peril. And they say: Be careful what you wish for.

The rules of the off-road
Leave it as you found it. That is the 
underlying theme of the basic rules of
conduct suggested for eco-tourists by various organizations, including the National Audubon Society, World Tourism Organization, Sierra Club, International Eco-
tourism Society and Conservation International.
More specifically, these are their rules: 
* In rural areas stay on designated trails and roads.
* Stay away from breeding sites and fragile environments.
* Do not disturb wildlife or pick plant specimens or other ground cover.
* Do not harass animals or approach them too closely. 
* Whether alone or with a group, be no louder than necessary.
* Do not litter; carry out all trash, garbage and human waste from wilderness areas.
* Do not buy souvenirs or mementos of threatened wildlife and plant populations. 
* Before a trip, familiarize yourself with local customs, as well as possible health hazards or security risks.
* Remember that you are not a guest but one of probably many tourists, so do not expect special privileges.
* Respect sacred sites.
* Dress in ways appropriate to places you visit.
* Do not offend the privacy of people who do not want to be photographed. 
* Learn at least enough words in the local language to be able to greet and thank 
others.
* Where prudent, help local communities by eating at their restaurants and shopping at markets.
* Listen and observe, but do not criticize or act as though you have all the answers.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Exhibit in Bronx on Energy Conservation; 
A Model City Of the Future

 BODY:
Talk about timing. With the nation concerned about the cost and supply of energy, the Cherry Tree Association -- a 500-member nonprofit community group in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx that promotes economic development as well as gardening, arts and cultural events -- is sponsoring an exhibit of a proposed city of the future that will use solar, wind and fuel-cell technology. 
 The exhibit displays the drawings and futuristic designs produced for Cherry Tree by students at the New York Institute of Technology and the City College Architectural Center. 
 By incorporating some of those designs, Cherry Tree expects to convert its own building, Casa del Sol, a six-story, 7,000-square-foot former tenement, into a model of renewable energy production for a cleaner environment and improved quality of life.
Models of the planned conversion are part of the exhibit. The project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2003.
The exhibit at the Casa del Sol, at 672-674 East 136th Street, at Cypress Avenue, near the Cypress Avenue stop on the No. 6 subway line, is open Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4 p.m. through June 23.

HEADLINE: THEATER/THE TONY AWARDS; 
A Couple of Regular Guys Bonding, Onstage and Off

BYLINE:  By JERRY TALLMER; Jerry Tallmer founded the Off Broadway Obie Awards in 1956.

 BODY:
THEY are a couple of unemployed steelworkers kicking around haplessly in Buffalo, their mill closed, their gutted manhood defined by a few lines of Terrence McNally's script right at the top of the show:
 "Hi, I'm Dave Bukatinsky. I just defrosted a refrigerator and vacuumed the living room. And how was your day?" 
 "Hi, I'm Jerry Lukowski. I'm 32, out of work, divorced, in debt . . . if I don't make some money soon they won't let me see my son. I'm fed up, angry and, oh, yeah . . ." 
Dave is the large and, some would say, rotund one. Jerry is the lean and, some would say, handsome one. Before the musical "The Full Monty" is over, they and a few of their equally jobless buddies will have recaptured their manly self-esteem and, in the process, brought certain bare facts into play before an all-female sellout audience in Buffalo and an even larger gathering of males as well as females in a Broadway theater called the Eugene O'Neill. Actually, their show could probably cheer up even Eugene O'Neill.
"You know," said Patrick Wilson, the lean and handsome actor who portrays Jerry Lukowski, "a lot of middle-aged men come up afterward and say, 'My wife dragged me here, but I love it.' "
"The nudity," said John Ellison Conlee, the large, rotund actor who portrays Dave Bukatinsky, "is really a very small aspect of the story. It's not about nudity, it's about bravery -- doing exceptional things." 
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Conlee had never met before taking part in a workshop for "The Full Monty" 14 months ago in New York. Now they have 2 of the 10 Tony Award nominations received by the Broadway hit that has been hatched out of the 1997 British film of the same name.
What had immediately struck Mr. Conlee on his first reading of the script, he said, was that "this was one of the most accurate portrayals of male friendship I'd seen in the theater." He and Mr. Wilson, Mr. Conlee said, "don't talk about it a lot, but" -- as characters in the show and as actors and human beings -- "we do depend on each other."
Most often in such instances, he said, "You have to really make or create that chemistry, but in terms of working with Patrick, we got really lucky."
"At that first meeting at the workshop, we instantly took to one another," he added. "If not, we would have worked on it, but we didn't have to." 
Mr. Wilson agreed. "We clicked from Day 1," he said. "The funny thing is, now that there's talk of tours and so forth, the producers keep saying, 'We've got to find two guys with your chemistry.' Well, the chemistry of Dave and Jerry, or John and me, is more than almost any relationship I've ever had. And it was a total crap shoot; the producers had no idea what they were getting."
Mr. Wilson is up for best performance by a leading actor in a musical. The competition in that category consists of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick of "The Producers," Kevin Chamberlin in "Seussical" and Tom Hewitt in "The Rocky Horror Show." Mr. Conlee has been nominated for best performance by a featured actor in a musical. The competition: Andre De Shields from "The Full Monty" and three candidates from "The Producers": Roger Bart, Gary Beach and Brad Oscar.
"What are the Tonys again?" asked Mr. Wilson, straight-faced. "Will Antoinette Perry be there?"
Earlier this month, he and Mr. Conlee were grabbing some nourishment an hour and a half before curtain time. They didn't look like actors. They looked like, well, maybe not steelworkers, but plain everyday members of the great American work force dressed for a night's bowling.
Except that people quite often ask Mr. Wilson if he knows he looks a little like Paul Newman.
"Interestingly," Mr. Conlee blithely interjected, "that happens to me all the time."
"In a single week," Mr. Wilson declared in bemusement, "one woman came up and said, 'You look like Paul Newman'; a second woman said, 'Did anyone tell you you look like Pat Boone?'; and a third said I reminded her of a young George Bush." 
"That," Mr. Conlee murmured, "is because you're a brilliant transformational actor."
Mr. Wilson briefly met the real Paul Newman -- "my idol," he said, with no irony whatsoever -- late last year. "He had seen the show, and was very complimentary. I wanted to tell him a lot of things. I didn't say any of them. I walked away sweating."
Is there any correlation between the acting profession and the unemployment those steelworkers up in Buffalo are experiencing?
"Sure," Mr. Conlee said, "that's part of our business. I think whether you're employed or unemployed, even successful actors, distinguished men in their 70's, get this, 'Oh, you're that guy . . .' " and the voice, he said, trails off in vague forgetfulness. 
For his part, Mr. Wilson said: "I haven't had a lot of experience with struggling or with being unemployed. Still, if you're in a show and it's closing, when Tuesday night comes around and it's over, you're through. So translate that to blue-collar America." 
Actually, neither man comes out of blue-collar America.
Mr. Conlee was born in 1968 in Atlanta, where his father is in real estate. He went to Centre College "in historic Danville, Kentucky," and then for a bachelor of fine arts degree at New York University. Although he did some acting while growing up in Atlanta, Mr. Conlee said, "It never occurred to me that I could do it for a living until I was halfway through college." The first show he was in at Centre College was "Equus." He played the father. "Most of my work has not been in musicals," he said. In regional theater his shows have ranged from "The Misanthrope" to "The Compleat Works of Wllm Shkspr (Abridged)." 
Mr. Wilson, who was born in 1973 in Norfolk, Va., grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla., where his father and brother were and still are television anchormen. His mother is a singer and teacher "who did church music for about 40 years," and as a boy he sang in a choir. He has a bachelor of fine arts degree from Carnegie Mellon University, and most of his work -- seven or eight shows -- has been in musicals, including "Bright Lights, Big City" Off Broadway and a touring version of "Carousel." 
Despite the fact that Broadway musicals ("The Producers" and "The Full Monty" apart) are usually driven by female stars, neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Conlee believes the business is particularly tougher these days on male musical-comedy talent.
"I really think it's easier for men," Mr. Wilson said, "harder for women. There are just more roles for men. Actually, it's harder for women in all industries."
MR. CONLEE added: "I think the business in general is harder for women. There are much more demands on women, just in terms of looks, for instance." Both men should know what they're talking about: both their girlfriends, they said, are actresses.
Both men had also seen the British film "The Full Monty," starring Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy in the roles they themselves now have, long before they knew the movie would be turned into a Broadway musical.
"To me," Mr. Wilson said, "when I heard that Terrence McNally had done the book, that meant the producers were taking it seriously and not going to splatter the movie up on stage."
It also meant that once Mr. Wilson, who has no children, had read the script, the "idea of having a son, of being able to speak with a son" -- as the character does in the show -- "became exciting." To him, he said, it meant a kind of graduation, "to the next level of parts -- fathers and things -- instead of just tortured heroes."
Both Mr. Conlee and Mr. Wilson have, of course, been in their share of failed shows. "After the first flop," Mr. Wilson said, "you say, 'O.K., I have no idea what makes a hit.' " In this particular instance, Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr -- courtesy of Cole Porter -- gave the answer long ago: "Friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
A Mythical Metropolis Materializes in Queens

BYLINE:  By FRANKLIN SIRMANS; Franklin Sirmans, a freelance curator and writer, is the former U.S. editor of Flash Art International magazine.

 BODY:
IN Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," Marco Polo and Kublai Khan conjure imaginary destinations out of thin air. A similar trick is being pulled off with industrial-strength nylon canvas and aluminum tubing by Alexandre Arrechea, Dagoberto Rodriguez and Marco Castillo, three young Cuban artists known as Los Carpinteros (the Carpenters). Their "Ciudad Transportable" ("Transportable City"), which opens today at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens, is a mythical metropolis situated at the intersection of sculpture and architecture -- a blurry meeting place where distinctions between art and work fall away.
 Abstracting the forms of vernacular Cuban structures -- lighthouse, factory, apartment house, church, jail -- into a collapsible city of tents, Mr. Arrechea, Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Castillo have pared the inessentials and left only sleekly designed metaphors that have the surface clarity of work by Richard Artschwager or Donald Judd. 
 " 'Ciudad Transportable' is our most ambitious piece to date," Mr. Rodriguez said by e-mail from Los Angeles, where Los Carpinteros are working on an exhibition, their second, at the Grant Selwyn Fine Art Gallery; it is scheduled to open June 28. "The original idea has to do with the minimal basic space that any community needs to live, or the environment in which life occurs."
The work's 10 off-white tents, ranging in height from about 6 feet to 15 feet, invite the viewer to walk inside and look out the mesh windows at the other "buildings" of the symbolic city. "They are not being romantic or sentimental," said Alanna Heiss, the director of P.S. 1, who organized the exhibition. "Their sculptures are discreet and intelligent."
Fabricated in Los Angeles under the supervision of Rosa Lowinger, a conservator, "Ciudad" was originally exhibited outdoors on the Havana waterfront this past winter, at the Seventh Havana Biennial. At P.S. 1, it is installed both indoors and out, spread over three floors of galleries and the outdoor courtyard. (After it closes, on Sept. 3, "Ciudad" will be rebuilt again, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where it opens Sept. 23.
It's not an accident that the minimalist forms of "Ciudad Transportable" are both beautiful and functional. Los Carpinteros have from the beginning questioned the validity of the distinctions between high and low, art and artifact. They embraced a healthy ambiguity along with their name, which was given to them by their peers, according to the Havana-based art consultant Cristina Vives, because in their early years they worked in wood so much. 
They adopted the name as their signature, Mr. Arrechea said, because the designation "has nothing to do with art, and mixing it into the world of art creates doubt in and of itself." 
The three met in 1991, at the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana, and first began exhibiting as Los Carpinteros in 1994. Always exploring the meeting ground of art and society, they used their earliest works, figurative portrait paintings, to comment subtly on the status quo.
An early series, called "Interior Habanero" ("Havana Interior"), was linked to the repressive political climate of the years after Cuba's loss of economic aid from the Soviet Union. Stating that the paintings had been commissioned by a fictional Cuban-American collector, Los Carpinteros created purposely equivocal works like "Havana Country Club," a portrait of the artists golfing on the art institute grounds, which had been a country club before the revolution. By February 1995, the three were showing at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. In 1996, they abandoned painting to devote themselves to drawing and sculpture. And by 1998, when they created "Provisionalismo?", a partly built house of bricks and pipes that was shown in New York at the New Museum, their work had repudiated the sculptural object in favor of architectural and furniture-based structures. Working from a mental, if not always physical, base at home in Cuba, Los Carpinteros are exemplary -- in fact, quintessential -- traveling artists in the trade winds of the current global art circuit.
They live in Havana but view themselves as itinerant and typical of the current climate in which, Mr. Arrechea said, "travel has become a routine part of work." In addition to two Havana Biennials, they have been shown at contemporary art spaces in New York, at the 1997 Johannesburg Biennial, and in group exhibitions of Cuban artists around the world. They also figure prominently in the new book by Holly Block, "Art Cuba: The New Generation," published by Abrams.
Like many young artists, especially sculptors, with grand aspirations, much of Los Carpinteros' early work was concentrated in drawings and sketches that craftily illustrated larger sculptural works to come. An examination of images of these early drawings reveals that most of their initial aspirations have been fulfilled. Taking the work to the next level, working sculpture by sculpture, Los Carpinteros still begin each project by imagining it on paper, using the drawings as a kind of internal communication.
They started drawing "Ciudad" in 1997, as an exercise, said Mr. Castillo: "It was a form of training for an emergency that we do not yet know, and that we can't quite predict."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Staying Afoot Amid Upheaval

BYLINE:  By HOLLY WILLIAMS; Holly Williams teaches at the University of Texas at Austin and writes regularly about dance for The Dallas Morning News and The Austin American Statesman.

DATELINE: FORT WORTH 

 BODY:
THE two cities couldn't be more different. Fort Worth "where the West begins," in the words of Will Rogers -- delights tourists with its wood-planked stockyard and cowboy dance halls. Dallas, twice as large and a sleek center for banking and insurance companies -- and just 30 miles east -- offers a labyrinthine freeway system and a John F. Kennedy assassination site museum.
 By tradition, the cities shrug each other off, meeting only where and when they must. One thing they do share, and have shared successfully for seven years, is a ballet company. 
 The Fort Worth Dallas Ballet will perform beginning on May 29 at the Joyce Theater in Chelsea. The program comprises Stanton Welch's "Fingerprints" and Kevin O'Day's "Principia" (both New York premieres) and Peter Anastos's "Yes, Virginia, Another Piano Ballet" of 1974.
But even as it ventures away from home turf, this is a company undergoing major artistic upheaval. In February, the "amicable" departure of the artistic director, Benjamin Houk, was announced by the board. Only three years before, Mr. Houk had replaced Paul Mejia, who departed hastily after 11 years with the company; according to newspaper reports, sexual-harassment complaints had been lodged against him.
A disciple of Balanchine, Mr. Mejia brought a number of the master's works to the company, when it was still based solely in Fort Worth, and helped lift it to artistic maturity. Although Mr. Mejia's own choreography was often criticized (and his ballets were the only other repertory offered), the company established a solid reputation for staging Balanchine works.
"The problem was not that we offered Balanchine repertory," David Mallette, the executive director, said recently, "but that we offered the same Balanchine works over and over."
Now the company is starting a search for a new artistic director. Meanwhile, Bruce Marks, a former artistic director of the Boston Ballet, has been recruited as artistic adviser to help program the 2001-2 season and audition dancers. He will choreograph "Romeo and Juliet" for the troupe. Bruce Simpson, a former dancer and ballet master with the State Theater Ballet of South Africa, is in place to rehearse the company through next season and stage "The Nutcracker." 
"This company has gone through tremendous changes in the last four years," Mr. Marks said, "leaving the dancers, I would say, stretched and somewhat dazed at the same time." In the last three years, 24 ballets have been added to the repertory. For next season, Mr. Marks has revived some Balanchine works, in line with the administrators' commitment to bring back pieces the company has done well in the past. The Joyce program, Mr. Marks suggests, shows the company to best artistic advantage and should be of interest to New York audiences.
As an example of the successful support of a dance company by two distinct cities, the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet has become an anomaly. Most other such experiments have failed.
"In almost every instance, two cities have tried to merge two existing companies, and it just doesn't work," Mr. Mallette said. "One becomes the default company, and the other loses staff and dancers. They also fail because of the enormous costs of hauling people and productions back and forth over long distances."
Neither problem plagues Mr. Mallette's company. It began as a grass-roots regional troupe in Fort Worth 40 years ago; and it has only to load up dancers and sets for a 45-minute trip to Dallas. Housed in a strip mall that could be anywhere but is just outside Fort Worth's distinctive downtown of restored brick, the organization has a school with 140 students, two studios and a core company of 23 dancers with additional apprentices and understudies.
But the story of the Fort Worth company's survival is also the story of Dallas's inability to keep its own ballet company despite several tries. The downfall of the Dallas Ballet in 1988, when Flemming Flindt, formerly of the Royal Danish Ballet, was the artistic director, followed a painful fund-raising campaign that had dancers in tutus panhandling passersby. Another company, Ballet Dallas, emerged from the ashes only to fold several years later, leaving Dallas with no ballet at all.
The path was clear for the Fort Worth company to move into the Dallas market, and its first ventures included a "Nutcracker" production in the Fair Park Music Hall. (Fair Park, in Dallas, is the home of the enormous Texas State Fair every October.) A separate nonprofit company, the Dallas Supporters of Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, was formed to raise the money needed to present the company in Dallas. Since then, the ballet company's budget has tripled, to $4.2 million a year. And under Mr. Houk, repertory broadened to include historical reconstructions ("Billy the Kid," "The Moor's Pavane" and "Rodeo") as well as story ballets and works by contemporary choreographers.
Fiscal caution has guided the company's Dallas season, which offers fewer performances and less repertory than in Fort Worth. "We buy what we can pay for," said Ann Woesser, the president-elect of the Dallas board. "We do think we'll grow, but the slowing economy this year has made it hard for all nonprofits to raise money. We don't want to bite off more than we can chew."
When the company performed in New York in 1990 and 1991, it presented Mr. Mejia's "Cinderella" at the City Center. But the Joyce program, Mr. Mallette said, is calculated to show the company's emergence in a "serious technical and artistic way."
"We are looking forward to the opportunity to bring ourselves above the national radar, even through the company's artistic transition," he added. "Did we consider not going? Sure, but as the dust settled a bit, we couldn't find a compelling reason not to go. We are ready."
Having Mr. Marks and Mr. Simpson in place for the next year removes some of the pressure to complete the search for Mr. Houk's successor quickly, allowing the company time for much-needed soul-searching. Dancers, members of the technical staff and board representatives have all contributed to the discussions, said Ruth Knouse, the Fort Worth board president. "We had to determine what we wanted to be when we grew up."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Town Houses and Apartments Along the River; 
158 Condos Are Going Up in Croton-on-Hudson

 BODY:
Picking up where a previous developer left off during the real estate recession of the early 1990's, the Kalian Companies of Red Bank, N.J., will construct the 158 town houses and apartments left to be built at Half Moon Bay along the water in the village of Croton-on-Hudson in Westchester.
 Joe McGinley, the company's vice president for sales and marketing, said Westchester's housing market was strong enough, even with the current economic downturn, to justify completing the condominium complex. "There's a real lack of housing inventory in the county," he said. The recession a decade ago devastated the real estate market, he said, and many builders of residential and commercial developments were unable to complete them. 
 In its 17-year history, Kalian has developed single-family homes, town houses and condominiums throughout New Jersey. It has ventured into Westchester, Mr. McGinley said, because such scenic pieces of buildable riverside property are rare finds. In 1997, Kalian acquired about 15 acres for $1.975 million from the Half Moon Bay Acquisition Corporation, the original developer, according to the Cortlandt town assessor's office. Site preparation has begun and construction is expected to be completed within two years. 
Kalian's prices for the Half Moon Bay units, which will range from 1,000 to 2,500 square feet, are to start in the low $200,000's for one-bedroom town houses and go as high as the mid-$600,000's for two-bedroom units, he said. Many of the homes will overlook the Hudson. The median sales price for new condominiums in Westchester in the first quarter of this year was $212,000, according to the Westchester County Board of Realtors. Like the 120 existing homes at Half Moon Bay, which were built 10 to 15 years ago, the new units will be clustered in horseshoe-shaped groups that face the river. The new developer will add a second clubhouse and a pool to the existing clubhouse, marina and community center.
Other Kalian projects currently under construction include Carriage Gate, which consists of 239 units in Raritan Township, N.J.; Pine Lake Village, 65 units in River Vale, N.J.; and Brookside, a 394-unit adult community in Monroe Township, N.J.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Warehouse Market, Though Cooling, Is Still Healthy

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE nation's softening economy notwithstanding, warehouse distribution centers the size of football fields continue to sprout around exits of the New Jersey Turnpike, while older industrial buildings in the Meadowlands are being bulldozed to make way for new ones. 
 To be sure, the state's industrial market has cooled from last year's heated pace and tenants are taking longer to make deals. But the market is still healthy, developers and commercial brokers say. And though rents have stabilized, there are at least 20 companies in the market needing 250,000 square feet or more of warehouse space, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate services company. 
 In the last year, the industrial vacancy rate in the 11 northern and central counties rose to 6.2 percent from 5 percent, said the Trammell Crow Company, another real estate services concern. That rate, however, is still considered low in the 725-million-square-feet market. 
The market is in "a period of adjustment," said George P. Malloy, a senior vice president at Trammell Crow in Chatham. "Leasing is good, not great, and there has been a shift in the balance of supply and demand as inventories increase." 
The market continues to draw new players and investors. "Industrial properties have consistently provided safe, if not spectacular, returns, so for many investors it is a defensive play," said Andrew J. Merin, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield who heads its metropolitan-area financial services group. 
Mr. Merin said that investors, particularly pension funds, were forming alliances with developers "to give them instant access" to product to buy. 
One such marriage is that of Keystone Properties Trust, a real estate investment company based in West Conshohocken, Pa., and CalEast Industrial Investors, made up of LaSalle Investment Management, a division of Jones Lang LaSalle, and the California Public Employees Retirement System. Under the venture, they will buy $170 million worth of properties in the next few years in central and northern New Jersey. 
Since entering the state in 1997, Keystone has acquired nearly eight million square feet around the Meadowlands and Exits 8A and 10 of the turnpike. Its first two projects, totaling 983,000 square feet, are under way in the 8A region and they are being built on speculation. In addition, the company has bought or optioned 200 acres on which it could build up to three million more square feet. 
John Begier, Keystone's chief investment officer, said his company was building in the New Jersey market because of its size and diversity. He added that while there are "supply constraints, tenants need modern warehouses to expand." 
Mr. Malloy said that in the next three months there might be be "an opportunity for tenants" to make better deals. But the "market should be up and running again by the third or fourth quarter" as companies expand or consolidate scattered operations under one roof, he said.
There is six million square feet of industrial space under construction in New Jersey. About half of it, including Keystone's two projects, is along the turnpike corridor. 
At Exit 10, Heller Industrial Parks of Edison recently completed and leased a 170,000-square-foot speculative warehouse distribution center and is building one with 968,000 square feet. The two-building, $34 million project is rising on 52 acres at the end of Mill Road.
Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the company's president, said that though the market was stronger than six months ago, it was still uncertain and tenants still cautious. 
Mr. Milanaik said that "to gain some momentum," his company had lowered its asking rent modestly at the larger of the two new buildings to $4.80 to $4.90 a square foot annually from slightly more than $5. In turn, he said, his company is negotiating leases on three deals totaling 600,000 square feet and has two more prospects for 200,000 feet. 
Heller also has approvals to develop four million square feet near Exit 8A in South Brunswick. But Mr. Milanaik said because that market "has an oversupply of space, it does not make sense to add more until the existing space is absorbed."
As of the first quarter, there were some 2.2 million square feet of space under way in the 8A market, which covers parts of South Brunswick, Monroe and Cranbury. But after a lull in leasing, deals are again being made.
AMONG the most recent tenants leasing space is the Fleming Companies, a food distributor in Lewisville, Tex., which is taking 440,000 square feet in a 526,000-square-foot speculative building that Opus East L.L.C. of Bethesda, Md., put up in South Brunswick. The building is the first of three planned at the company's 90-acre park, which will have 1.2 million square feet. 
James Lee, a senior vice president at Opus, said his company was moving ahead on a second speculative building, of 350,000 square feet, at the park. 
At least three more companies plan to lease or buy buildings that will be built for them, commercial brokers said. Among them are Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., the sportswear manufacturer, which is expanding into a 475,000-square-foot building at a planned two-building park of almost a million square feet on Cranbury South River Road in Cranbury. The developer is the Sudler Companies of Parsippany. 
In addition, Pearson Education, a publisher in Upper Saddle River, is taking a 800,000-square-foot building at a 150-acre park, also in Cranbury, that the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation is planning. It will rise on half of a 300-acre parcel owned by the Carter Wallace Corporation. 
Gene Preston, a vice president of the Rockefeller Group, said the proposed park would ultimately have two million square feet. He said he expected state and federal approval in a few weeks of his company's application to open an extension at the Cranbury site of the foreign trade zone it operates in Mount Olive in Morris County. 
A free trade zone, which allows for decreased or delayed custom fees, is new in the 8A region. "It will help attract multinational companies," Mr. Preston said. 
Area landlords at first fought the zone but now may pursue an application of their own. 
Mr. Malloy of Trammell Crow added that it would take just two more sizable deals to reduce the speculative space at 8A to 2 percent from 5 percent. 
Agreeing with that assessment is Charles C. Lee Jr., Keystone's senior vice president for marketing and leasing. Though tenants are taking longer to seal deals, there "are 8 to 10 users in our flight pattern," he said of his company's two 8A projects. 
Mr. Lee said a 473,000-square-foot building rising west of the turnpike was to be completed by July; a 510,000-square-foot project, which is expandable to a million square feet, on the east side of the turnpike, will follow in October. Asking rents are $4.95 a square foot. 
In the Meadowlands, Cushman & Wakefield reports that there are more opportunities to find space today than three months ago. But commercial brokers added that the region, which covers parts of seven communities in Bergen and Hudson Counties, continues to draw attention from tenants, especially those that want to be near Manhattan, keeping the vacancy rate at 4.5 percent. 
Earlier this month, Federal Express leased a 127,000-square-foot warehouse at Chippewa Street in South Hackensack, according to Alexander Summer/Cresa, a commercial brokerage in Paramus. 
To meet the needs of the market for modern space, Forsgate Industrial Complex, a development company based in Teterboro, is razing an empty 128,000-square-foot one-story building with 14-foot-high ceilings at Huyler Street and Route 80 in South Hackensack. The plan is to replace it with a new 140,000-square-foot building, to include a new mezzanine, with a 34-foot-high ceiling, 22 loading docks and floors that can support 2,000 pounds a square foot, said Charles Klatskin, a partner.
He said the project, to be completed by next year's first quarter, cost $100 a square foot to build. But he said he expected tenants will pay up to $13 to $14 a square foot for such space. The average asking rent in the area, Cushman & Wakefield said, is $6.60 a square foot.
"Finding a building in the Meadowlands with both high ceilings and strong floors," Mr. Klatskin said, "is like finding a water fountain in the desert."

HEADLINE: Colonial Revival: Shaping and Reshaping the Island 

BYLINE:  By HELEN A. HARRISON 

 BODY:
WHEN the businessman and philanthropist Ward Melville and his architect, Richard Smythe, mapped out the redevelopment of Stony Brook, they chose the Colonial Revival style for the shopping and service complex that transformed the village in the early 1940's. 
 Starting with what Melville described as a "hodgepodge of structures of no beauty, crowded in among a few residences well built in the Colonial tradition," they fashioned a hybrid community center that not only harmonized genuine 18th- and early-19th century buildings with new construction, but also accommodated modern-day needs and conveniences within an idealized Colonial framework. 
 To make sense of this phenomenon, which by no means was confined to Stony Brook, the Long Island Museum of Art, History and Carriages -- a mere half mile from Melville and Smythe's renovation -- has organized "Improving the Past: The Colonial Revival on Long Island," an exhibition that will remain on view through Nov. 4. 
With paintings, prints, architectural drawings, furniture, photographs, publications and artifacts lent by several museums and drawn from the Long Island Museum's own collection, the show represents the geographical region from Flushing to East Hampton and focuses on the architecture and decorative arts of English heritage. Dutch Colonial references -- like Father Knickerbocker, who invites homebuyers of 1908 to settle in the cozy Dutch-themed community of Jamaica Park South -- are also included, but the emphasis is on the veneration and adaptation of English precedents. 
Nostalgia for America's Colonial past began in earnest in the mid-19th century, when firsthand experience of the Revolutionary War was fading and its veterans were dying off. William Sidney Mount, the Stony Brook genre painter, recorded the new-found reverence for historical continuity in "Great-Grand-Father's Tale of the Revolution," an 1852 canvas on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in which an elderly veteran recounts his wartime exploits to his descendants. As the children listen attentively, the old man delivers his oral history lesson while contemplating an effigy of George Washington, thus linking the Colonial era to the young nation's future through the power of memory.
To set the stage for the revival phenomenon, the museum's history curator, Joshua Ruff, has assembled a sampling of memorabilia commemorating national icons, especially Washington. The armchair in which the general reportedly sat while visiting the Ketchum family of Huntington in 1790, lent by the Winterthur Museum in Delaware, memorializes both Washington himself and the vernacular furniture of the pre-Revolutionary era -- a style later copied in popular reproductions for the mass market. 
Washington's home, Mount Vernon, established a precedent for numerous adaptations of a more genteel sort, including the 1903 James L. Breese House in Southampton. Designed by the firm of McKim, Mead & White, and now known as Whitefields, it is one of the Island's many grand country houses and summer cottages built in the late-19th and early-20th centuries that reflect Colonial influences.
Another outstanding example is Chestertown House, the Southampton retreat of the industrialist Henry F. du Pont. Completed in 1926, the house was designed as a showcase for du Pont's important collection of Colonial antiques, including an imposing late-18th-century wing chair, English prints, a hooked rug and Staffordshire pottery lent to the exhibition by the Winterthur, which du Pont established as a center for the display and study of American decorative arts. According to Mr. Ruff, du Pont originally envisioned his museum in Chestertown House, but ultimately opted for a location near Wilmington, his company's base of operations. Period photographs show the Chestertown interior as a pastiche of real and recreated Colonial elements, in which reverence for the past is wedded to modern comfort.
With its concentration of second homes for wealthy and influential tastemakers, Long Island was at the forefront of Colonial Revival architecture and decoration in its heyday, from the 1870's through the 1950's. Emily J. de Forest filled her Cold Spring Harbor retreat with rare Pennsylvania German artifacts, many of which are now in the Metropolitan's collection. In Oyster Bay, Bertha King Benkard assembled a suite of elegant antiques that might once have graced the town houses of upper-class New Yorkers. One of her acquisitions, a handsome early-19th-century card table on loan from the Museum of the City of New York, was later re-worked by Ernest Hagen, one of the many craftsmen and designers who specialized in high-quality reproductions. In their Flushing workshop, the Company of Master Craftsmen produced replicas of Duncan Phyfe furniture from the Metropolitan's collection for the parlors and board rooms of the elite, while in Sag Harbor, the Alvin Silver Manufacturing Company made elegant flatware based on early American prototypes.
At the opposite economic extreme, the exhibition evokes the rustic simplicity of East Hampton's "Home, Sweet Home," immortalized in John Howard Payne's popular 1822 ballad as a symbol of an increasingly urban and industrialized society's nostalgia for the timeless harmony of rural life. The quaint saltbox cottage, with its fabled stone hearth, had become a tourist mecca even before the railroad made it readily accessible from New York City. William Cullen Bryant praised its unsophisticated virtues in "Picturesque America," his compendium of attractions published in the mid-1870's, and artists made pilgrimages to it. 
One of its most devoted fans was Childe Hassam, the American Impressionist painter. In 1919, Hassam bought an 18th-century home in East Hampton, where he painted "Colonial Quilt," a still life in which the antique coverlet, artfully arranged before a window, is enclosed in an actual window frame. Hassam's views of venerable village landmarks, including "Home, Sweet Home," and the adjacent Mulford farm, attest to his enduring affection for these remnants of the area's New England heritage. Echoes of this admiration can be found in the modern variations on the saltbox and other Colonial-derived vernacular housing designs that are ubiquitous in suburban developments nationwide, with a fair share in 20th-century Long Island communities like Levittown.
As the exhibition clearly shows, Colonial-style revisionism involves a compromise between past and present. Improvements like central heating, electric lighting and modern appliances are integrated into faux 18th-century homes, and stables and outbuildings have been replaced by attached garages. The desire to return a semblance of Colonial charm to Stony Brook village did not deter Melville and Smythe from installing paved roads, parking lots and fire hydrants. Even genuine Colonial survivors, like Williamsburg, Mount Vernon and Monticello, have been adapted to meet contemporary traffic and safety requirements. Paradoxically, the popularity of historical relics threatens their integrity and sometimes even their survival. 
But if the ancient Windsor chair is now too fragile to sit on, countless sturdy replicas are available, and home furnishing outlets offer up-to-date electrified versions of the smelly, dangerous old oil and gas lamps. In "Improving the Past," sales catalogs and promotional brochures tout the tastefulness and charm of period designs, as well as their adaptability to modern living. The exhibition celebrates the Colonial Revival's longstanding appeal and enduring influence on American taste, and illustrates the many refinements that keep it in continual evolution.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Somerset, N.J.; 
Diversity, Stability and Convenience

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
WEDGED between the city of New Brunswick and the more rural southern section of Franklin Township, Somerset, N.J., is a model of diversity. The village's neighborhoods vary from tightly packed urban areas along the New Brunswick city line to sprawling, tree-lined suburban developments of hundreds of houses on half-acre lots. Although one-third of its school population lives in poverty, Somerset is also a magnet for young professionals, who are drawn to its stable neighborhoods, convenient shopping and easy commuting to Manhattan.
 Somerset forms the northeast quadrant of the 47-square-mile Franklin Township in Somerset County. A Chamber of Commerce map shows the village as running from the New Brunswick line to Cedar Grove Lane to the west. The area is home to three-fourths of the township's 51,000 residents and encompasses its business district, most of its major cultural attractions and an 18-hole golf course. 
 Realtors say the housing market is red-hot. "Houses here sell for about one-third less than similar ones in nearby towns like East Brunswick and North Brunswick," said Mary Barrood, a broker who owns the Barrood Real Estate and Insurance Agency on Easton Avenue. "Priced right, a house in good condition on a desirable street will sell within days. Every agent has a list of three to six customers who are ready to buy." 
Michael Santini, a broker who owns Prudential Golden Key Realty in neighboring Piscataway, says Somerset buyers are typically young professional couples who commute to jobs in Manhattan. "They are looking for homes in turnkey condition in stable neighborhoods near shopping, highways and New York City transportation," he said. 
Somerset is minutes from Interstate 287 to the west and the New Jersey Turnpike to the east. Easton Avenue, a section of Somerset County Route 527 along the northern edge of Somerset, is lined with shopping centers, and two major malls -- Bridgewater Commons to the north and the Brunswick Square to the east -- are within 15 miles. 
The neighborhoods most in demand are the 996-unit Levitt Homes, built in the mid-1960's off John F. Kennedy Boulevard and DeMott Lane, and Foxwood, a 300-unit development of three- and four-bedroom split-levels and bilevels built in the early 1960's off Franklin Boulevard. Four-bedroom Levitt Cape Cods, colonials and ranches on streets like Landry or on Renfro Court sell for $200,000 to $280,000. Foxwood houses bring $175,000 to $200,000, Mrs. Barrood said. 
"I love the space and the diversity of the community," said Carol Devine, who has lived in a three-bedroom ranch on five-eighths of an acre in the Levitt section, together with her husband, Jim, and her daughter, Lauren, 15. for the last 14 years. "However, the area has become more crowded and congested lately because of new housing in Franklin and other parts of Somerset County. Jim, on the other hand, misses the feeling of a downtown." 
Harder to sell are older colonials and Cape Cods on streets near the New Brunswick line. "This area of Somerset developed earliest, so its housing is showing its age," said Frank Hasner, township director of economic development for Franklin. "A lot of the property is owned by absentee landlords, so the yards are not as well maintained."
Houses on streets like Main or Kossuth near New Brunswick are priced at $120,000 to $160,000.
Franklin Township has started buying property near New Brunswick as part of a neighborhood redevelopment effort. Kenneth W. Daly, the township manager, says Franklin is negotiating with contractors over the construction of so-called infill housing, new sidewalks and other public amenities. The township is also seeking state and federal funds to provide loans and grants to property owners for renovations and improvements. 
THE first part of the economic redevelopment effort, a $2 million reconstruction of the 13-acre Naaman Williams Park off Matilda Avenue, is under way. When complete this summer, the park will include a swimming pool, a splash area, two basketball courts, a jogging trail, two tennis courts, a multiuse field and a playground.
According to Mrs. Barrood, 46 Somerset single-family homes were listed for sale in the Multiple Listing Service at the start of May. They ranged from $89,900 for a two-bedroom, one-bath older Cape being sold as-is on Frank Street near New Brunswick to $564,900 for a four-bedroom, four-bath colonial on Maher Road.
The largest new development is Glen Eyre, Les Maison Des Artistes, where 78 custom homes are being built on streets named for artists, like Picasso Court and Degas Lane. The houses start in the high $300,000's.
Most of Somerset's condominiums are in the Quailbrook section off New Brunswick Road. It includes 2,213 condos on streets named for the late Challenger astronauts. Prices range from $85,000 for one-bedroom apartment-style units to $280,000 for some three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath town house units with one-car garages and basements. 
Also in the Quailbrook section is the 197-acre county-owned Quail Brook Golf Course, where Somerset County residents who register with the county's Department of Parks can play a round for $14 on weekdays and $16 on weekends.
The largest apartment complex is the 649-unit Franklin Greens off John F. Kennedy Boulevard, where one-bedroom units rent for $895 and two bedrooms bring $150 more. The best-known apartment complex is the 398-unit Somerset Estates, formerly called Edgemere, off Franklin Boulevard, where two-bedroom units rent for $975 and three bedrooms for $1,200. 
Among the new tenants at Somerset Estates are Mary Clinton and her two sons: Keon, 14, and Kendall, 8. "We moved here to be closer to my job as a kitchen supervisor in a New Brunswick hospital," Mrs. Clinton said. "The apartment is large enough for us, the rent is affordable and the neighborhood is clean."
Mrs. Clinton's children attend the Franklin Township public schools, a 6,100-student kindergarten-through-12th-grade system that includes five elementary schools, the Sampson G. Smith Intermediate School and the 1,450-student Franklin High School. However, Mrs. Devine says that, because of concerns about behavioral problems in the school system, she sends Lauren to a private school in a nearby town.
But Sgt. Richard Grammar, head of the Police Juvenile Bureau, says that the schools are extremely safe but suffer from a reputation created 20 years ago when they were more violent. "I send my own child to kindergarten in Franklin," he said. "We have had no serious incidents all year."
Sergeant Grammar heads a 10-officer team that teaches classes and participates in school recreational activities.
The elementary schools are arranged as magnets, with two schools stressing the fine, visual and performing arts; two stressing science and technology; and the fifth stressing the arts, science and technology and international studies.
Enrollment in the system is growing rapidly, with class sizes at each of the schools above the state average of 20.6. The superintendent of schools, Frank V. Pepe Jr., projects that there will be 7,000 students in the system by 2005. Last week, Franklin Township voters approved a referendum for the construction of a new high school, expected to cost $50 million.
Each classroom has at least one computer and each school at least one computer laboratory. The high school has six computer laboratories. At the end of last year, 30 percent of Franklin's classrooms were connected to the Internet, compared with a state average of 70 percent. Mr. Pepe says that all classrooms will have Internet access by the end of this year.
THE student body is diverse, with 57 different languages spoken in the homes and enrollment of 300 in English as a second language courses. Among the highest concentrations are Spanish; Gujarati, an Indian language; Cantonese; and Arabic. Mr. Pepe sees diversity as a strength and says he seeks to "affirm every child in every family." 
On last year's College Boards, Franklin High School students achieved combined verbal and mathematics scores of 956, compared with a state average of 1,012. "The comparison doesn't reflect the achievement of our students in becoming Americans or the fact that 30 percent of our students live in poverty," Mr. Pepe said. Of the 266 members of last year's graduating class, 81 percent went on to two-or four-year colleges.
There are two private schools in Somerset: the 695-student Rutgers Preparatory School for prekindergarten through 12th grade and the 590-student St. Matthias, a Roman Catholic school for prekindergarten through eighth grade. Tuition at Rutgers Prep ranges from $11,500 to $17,150. Tuition at St. Matthias is $4,370. 
A milestone in Somerset's history was the opening in 1834 of the Delaware & Raritan Canal, a 44-mile inland navigation route between New York City and Philadelphia, which runs along Somerset's northern border.
Closed as a freight system in 1933, the canal and its towpath now form the Delaware & Raritan Canal State Park, which is used for canoeing, fishing, hiking and biking. 
Somerset also figured prominently in World War I. In 1913, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company built a giant radio transmission station in Somerset and suspended a milelong antenna from a series of 440-foot-high steel masts along the canal route.
In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson used the station to broadcast an appeal to Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II to abdicate, an address that historians credit with hastening the armistice.
The station has since been dismantled. However the Guglielmo Marconi Memorial Plaza, on the corner of Easton Avenue and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, has been dedicated to the inventor.

A photograph taken of its sitting room in 1938 captured the shadowy image of a young girl in Dutch Colonial dress, standing next its fireplace. In 1976, a couple who bought the house sold it to the township after they said they were spoken to during apparitions and heard radios being turned on at all hours. Among those who later heard unexplained screams in the house was a township manager. The Van Wickle House is featured in "Historic Haunted America," a book by Michael Norman and Beth Scott, and it has been used by the radio station WCTC for Halloween broadcasts. The house, on Easton Avenue, is on the National Register of Historic Places and is used for cultural events. Map of New Jersey highlights Somerset

HEADLINE: The Laptop Idea Is Spreading 

BYLINE:  By DAVID PARKER 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT has not been a leader in classroom technology or, specifically, in giving laptop computers a key educational role, said Nick Caruso, a senior associate at the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education.
 Education Week magazine two years ago ranked Connecticut 42nd among the 50 states in terms of effort on school technology, he said. But across the state's 169 local school districts, plenty of initiatives are in progress, in districts as dissimilar as Greenwich and Hartford. 
 "It's kind of like we're poised to really move ahead," Mr. Caruso said.
Janice Gordon, the mobile learning coordinator for the Hartford school system, said the city launched a laptop program last year in all three high schools to address an alarming dropout rate. 
With 90 percent of students' families at or below the poverty rate, Ms. Gordon said, "we're doing everything we can to motivate the students, to have them see education as relevant."
The leased IBM laptops, now in the hands of more than 350 9th and 10th graders, go home with the students, as they do in Kent and Bloomfield, she said. In most homes they're the first computer the family has had, and while "motivating the students we're also motivating the families."
"They start to get excited by what's going on in the high school," Ms. Gordon said. "Parent participation has usually not been very strong here."
After about 14 months, Ms. Gordon said there was a 92 percent retention rate for students in the program.
In Greenwich, there is a different approach to laptop use. Susan Wallerstein, the technology and media coordinator, said two middle schools had deployed a limited number of laptops for in-school use. The aim is to carefully choose the technology that meets specific educational needs, Ms. Wallerstein said.
Statewide, several magnet schools have also developed laptop programs, and Mr. Caruso predicted the trend will continue, as the educational benefits become more obvious.
For one thing, he said, "what we consider a computer is going to change a lot." He said he thinks that more schools will look favorably at smaller, sometimes less costly laptop models.
Meanwhile, the cost of textbooks, now $60 or more apiece and rapidly outdated, keeps skyrocketing. That will make schools consider the educational and economic alternative of giving students a single three-ounce computer disk, which, with an Internet link, will give them instant access to more material, continuously updated.
"When you look at it that way," Mr. Caruso said, "the cost issue becomes less a deterrent and the digital learning alternative becomes both more timely and appropriate.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Business Centers; 
Modern Office for Rent: Daily Rates Available

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The illusion is quite convincing. The lobby is spacious, with a staffed reception desk, a waiting area with comfortable seating and wide hallways. If a call comes in for the XYZ Corporation, the operator answers, "Thank you for calling the XYZ Corporation."
 There are conference rooms for meetings with clients, file cabinets with digital locks and word processing and other support services. If a visitor arrives, he or she is escorted to an office for a meeting. 
 But what appears to be an bastion of Corporate America may only be a 150-square-foot office rented for a few weeks or months. This is a business center, the modern version of the temporary office suites that have been around for about the last 30 years. 
The offices, operated by the Rockefeller Group Business Centers on two floors of the building at 1180 Avenue of the Americas, have been carefully designed to conceal how big or small their tenants are. There are no names on the doors to the suite or on any individual offices.
"We don't advertise ourselves on the floor because it could be confusing to the guests of our clients," said Frederic Z. Sondik, a senior vice president of the Rockefeller Group. "Our telephone operators have screens, which tell them how to answer calls to our clients. We don't even have numbers on the doors, the way hotels do, that would give an idea of the size of our clients."
Mr. Sondik said his company got into the business center business when it still owned Rockefeller Center and needed to find tenants for some vacant floors in the landmark buildings. The company subsequently lost control of the center but remains in business as a property owner and developer and as the owner of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company.
The business center unit of the company still operates a floor and a half at 45 Rockefeller Plaza in addition to the Avenue of the Americas location. The parent company plans to build a six-story, 100,000-square-foot building in San Jose, Calif., that would have four floors occupied by the business center.
The Rockefeller Group business center operations are small compared with the giants of the industry -- Regus Business Centers and HQ Global Workplaces -- which have a worldwide presence, although the business models are similar.
A business center converts the fixed costs of entering into a long-term lease, designing and building space, acquiring telecommunications and computer equipment and hiring a staff into a variable cost for clients who use the offices for short-term renewable periods. The rental rate for such space is higher than for raw space and all services are additional expenses, but a client has the advantage of buying what it needs and no more.
MR. SONDIK said typical business center clients were management consultants, financial services executives like those in venture capital, executive recruiters and advertising sales representatives. They need furnished offices at a respectable address with support services available, but may not need them for an extended time.
But others in the business say larger companies are being attracted to business centers because they allow them to conserve capital.
"Seventy percent of our clients are national and multinational companies," said Robert R. Gaudreau, executive vice president and head of American operations of the British-based Regus. He said the recent economic slowdown had made companies reluctant to enter into long-term leases, particularly in areas of the country where rental rates remain high.
"Nobody wants to sign a 10-year lease in New York and get locked in at the top of the market," he said. "And why should they tie up their operating capital in Sheetrock, carpet and paint?"
A variation on this theme is Offices2share.com, a Web site that is intended to link companies that have excessive office space with others looking for a short-term space. "We are an aggregator of short-term space, from 80 square feet to over 100,000 square feet," said Jeffrey Landers, the president of the company. He said the site was supported by a fee paid by companies listing available space and by banner advertisements placed by companies seeking tenants, including Regus.
Regus has two locations in New York, one on the 93rd floor of 2 World Trade Center downtown and 70,000 square feet on two floors in the building at 245 Park Avenue at 46th Street in Midtown.
"The executive suite business has been around for about 30 years and evolved from call-answering centers for traveling salesman," said Gary Kusin, chief executive of HQ, which is largely owned by the Frontline Capital Group, an affiliate of Reckson Associates Realty, a real estate investment trust based in Melville, N.Y..
He said the business changed in the mid-1990's toward one that is more service oriented because of three factors. First, he said, was improvement in communications technology, which allowed executives to be based closer to customers and farther from headquarters. Another consideration, he said, was the globalization of business, which required offices around the world. Finally, he said, there was the trend of outsourcing noncore operations, including office space and the associated services.
"That is what converted executives suites to office services," he said.
Mr. Kusin said telecommunications and technology companies, including dot-coms, were the most aggressive in using temporary offices and services. "Through 2000, we had record occupancy, always north of 90 percent," he said.
But that concentration of dot-com and telecommunications tenants has become a problem as the shakeout in those sectors has continued. "We have clearly been impacted by the economy, and our occupancy is down to the mid-70's," Mr. Kusin said.
Nevertheless, he said the downturn in occupancy could be nearing an end, as inquiries from prospective tenants seeking short-term space were picking up again. He said about 2 percent of all the office space in the country was devoted to business centers. HQ has 26 locations in Manhattan, including space in the Chrysler and Woolworth Buildings, in 1633 Broadway at 50th Street and in the Wall Street area.
A business center operator typically leases space on a long-term basis from a landlord and subdivides for clients or enters into a joint venture with the building's owner, which conserves capital and allows more rapid expansion. "We have joint ventures with Equity Office Properties, Crescent Real Estate and, in Canada, with Brookfield Financial Properties," Mr. Gaudreau of Regus said, referring to three large owners of office buildings.
The space is fitted out with offices as small as 150 square feet, which would otherwise be difficult to find. Instead of a thick, complicated lease, the space is rented on a license agreement, like a hotel room, and can be paid for by a credit card.
THE offices are furnished and equipped for telecommunications and Internet access. Typically, the client rents his work space -- Mr. Gaudreau said the typical charge is about $28 a day outside expensive markets like New York and San Francisco -- and pays for other services as needed.
Typically, the rental rate is higher for short-term occupancies than longer ones, but if an executive needs an office for a few hours to conduct job interviews in a given city, business center executives say, they are prepared to accommodate him.
When it comes to services, at the Rockefeller Group business centers in New York, a conference room can be rented for $50 an hour or $280 for a full day. Word processing service can be had for $36 an hour, or if it is a rush job, for $54 an hour. Administrative assistance costs $28 an hour.
"People can come in here and start doing business without any startup costs or delays," Mr. Sondik said. "They don't have to have a lawyer for the lease and an architect for the space. They don't have to purchase equipment and wait three months for a T-1 line to be installed."
He said the center had what he called "virtual office clients" who occupied no space but had an address and telephone number, rented a few file cabinets and used a conference room when they were in town.

Fairfield Market Reacts to Wall St. Ups and Downs

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE single-family housing market in Fairfield County, where shots fired from Wall Street land with particular resonance, is responding to the tumultuous stock market with corresponding ups, downs and inconsistencies. High prices resulting from months of low inventories have led buyers to bid above asking prices, in turn leading to more houses becoming available by newly motivated sellers seeking handsome profits.
 "It's almost unpleasant the way people behave to get the house before somebody else does," said Amy Carter, a broker with William Raveis Real Estate in Wilton. "It's a seller's market," she added, an opinion shared by county brokers, some of whom also hear echoes of the 80's, when the economy sank and overpriced houses bought in boom times were suddenly worth less than their outstanding mortgages. 
 People who are making windfall profits on their homes can pay more for new homes, said Barbara Webski, a broker at William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, "but people who are currently renting are getting a tough education in the bidding wars." 
John Clapp, a professor of real estate at the University of Connecticut's Center for Real Estate and Economic Studies, sees no effect on high-end prices in certain areas. "Over the five months ending in March," he said, "prices in Stamford grew more than 40 percent from the previous year. But in Bridgeport, prices are going down by up to 12 percent a year." A range of $360,000 to $375,000 prevails in Bridgeport and Danbury, he said, "but Danbury is growing rapidly, and a 10 to 20 percent increase in prices is accelerating."
In Greenwich, usually the most resilient of Gold Coast towns, the average price of a home declined by 3 percent last year, to $1,782,885, from $1,842,040, said Russell Pruner, owner of Russell Pruner & Associates, a real estate brokerage company. "We're still getting multiple bids and selling over asking if the house is well priced and in good condition," he said. But his company's statistics show that 61 fewer homes were sold in the first quarter of this year than the 197 sold last year, a 31 percent decrease. Yet the number of available properties rose to 398 from last year's 372. 
The average price of a home in Stamford is now $517,181, while the median price -- with an equal number of houses priced higher and lower -- is $415,000, according to statistics provided by William Pitt. "We have sold 179 houses" in the first quarter, Ms. Webski said. Last year, 292 homes were sold in the first quarter, when the median price was $397,000 and the average was $461,805. "Prices are coming on a little too high," she said, "then dropping down two weeks later and down again in another two weeks." 
Homeowners hopping on the seller's bandwagon in Norwalk have created a very hot market, according to Carol Ann Falasco, a broker at Coldwell Banker. "Prices are outrageous," she said. A two-bedroom, one-bath house of 1,500 square feet sold for $304,000 in January and was resold on April 22 for $335,000. "People come here for a better deal, knowing that prices are lower than in surrounding towns," Ms. Falasco said. "They call from out of town, and by the time they get here the house is bindered. We used to negotiate; now buyers realize they grab it or lose it."
Norwalk's traditionally viable market in the mid-$100,000's to high-$200,000's has shrunk markedly. The first quarter of this year produced 251 listings at a median price of $374,900 and an average of $513,741. Last year's 250 listings over the same period were at a median price of $369,250 and an average of $458,498. 
Rapid growth in Danbury is attributable in part to buyers from across the border in New York State in northern Westchester and southern Putnam Counties, drawn by lower prices and lower taxes. "Normally you would have local people moving up," said Allyson Bernard of Real Estate Professionals of Connecticut L.L.C., a Danbury brokerage, "but we've had an influx of new buyers with money who go directly to the upper levels of housing." But some buyers, she said, are backing off, saying they will wait for a more realistic market.
STARTER homes that were priced at less than $200,000 have jumped to $220,000 and $230,000. A four-bedroom house on the desirable West Side runs from $400,000 to $550,000, and newly built houses are priced at up to $600,000, according to Richard Jowdy at Danbury Prudential Real Estate. 
Just before last Thanksgiving, Warren and Patricia Lee put their Wilton house up for sale. They have been the sole owners since it was built for them 37 years ago. "We had a lot of traffic, but no sale," Mr. Lee said. The price was lowered to $509,000 from $519,000 a month later, and again in March to $495,000. It sold in April at that price. The four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house on 2.3 mostly wooded acres is air-conditioned with a two-car garage, and like most back country homes has a well and septic system. 
The sale price is typical of a decade ago, but in today's Wilton it is almost an anomaly. "A million dollars is the average here now," said Mary Schuler, a Raveis broker. "We have 45 homes priced over $1 million. Within this past year, I had one buyer pay $51,000 over asking on a million-dollar cash sale."
Raveis customers who need a mortgage can use the company's own American Mortgage Services, a component of the Homelink program originated by William Raveis a year ago to provide customers with free mortgage placement involving 30 lenders and 1,500 loan programs. "Our agents are not required to use us," said Jeffrey Stephanoff, a senior vice president of the mortgage service, "but we have captured more and more of the sales." 
Homelink also automatically provides a free personal coordinator who takes over the moving, home inspection, transfer of utilities, choice of vendors for landscaping, alarm systems, pet fencing, newspaper delivery and so on. The system has been adopted by 79 brokerages across the country that are part of his network. Other real estate companies are starting similar services. 
Shopping for homes in Westport, Weston, Fairfield and Stratford is available through the Westport office of Coldwell Banker. Some higher-end Westport deals have fallen through, said Venus Weinrich, the office manager, "because a lot of people who were expecting big bonuses have not gotten them, or they may not have bid enough, or they asked for too much from the inspection." The low end, she said, in the $500,000's and up is selling faster. 
"You get more for your money in Stratford," she said, "especially if you're looking on the water. Prices are 25 to 30 percent lower than in Westport, but of course you don't have the schools." Weston and Easton prices remain stable and high. Fairfield, a five-minute commute beyond Westport, has at its low end three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath Cape Cods that were $200,000 now selling for more than $300,000. In Fairfield's high-end neighborhoods, Southport's waterfront antiques and contemporary homes and Greenfield Hill's properties where homeowners can keep horses continue to sell for millions. 
New Canaan has had a 15 percent decrease in first-quarter sales but a 20 percent increase in prices. "Approximately 30 percent of our active inventory is new construction over $2 million," said GiGi Melillo of Coldwell Banker. Of 140 properties listed, most are between $1 million and $5 million, with only 44 under $1 million.
More than 50 new homes are being built in New Canaan, including one of 22,000 square feet. "There are a lot of knockdowns," said Hiram Peck, the town planner, referring to the practice of buying existing houses, demolishing them and putting up larger, more ostentatious ones, derided by detractors as McMansions. "Empty lots, when you can find one, go for $750,000," he said.
The high end in Darien, "from $2.4 million and up," said Chris Simmers, manager of the Prudential office there, "is a little soft. We've had one buyer drop out because of Wall Street losses, but the stock market really hasn't affected us yet. Properties are still going to multiple offers."
New construction countywide continues at a moderate pace, rarely falling below the million-dollar range in lower Fairfield. In upper Fairfield, Trumbull and Monroe have a dozen new homes for sale by Munson Builders of Fairfield, priced at $500,000 to $700,000. According to Maureen Callaghan, director of sales and marketing, a handful of new Munson-built homes in Westport and Southport are priced at $1.1 million and up.
In Westport, where a battle over McMansions has been raging for two years, stiffer regulations on house size will be presented at a September public hearing. Cathy Barnard, Westport's town planner, said, "We have not seen a slowdown in building permits, but projects are becoming more complicated, requiring protracted review." The reasons are a lack of land except for marginal parcels with slopes and wetlands, and tear-down-and-rebuild projects that challenge planning and zoning concepts.

HEADLINE: Ansonia Gets Hit Where It Really Hurts 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, Latex Foam Products has provided a steady stream of customers for J.R.B.'s Restaurant.
 Located across the street from the Ansonia manufacturing plant, the dimly lighted restaurant and bar has sold pizza and grinders to employees who have stopped by for lunch, played host to going-away parties and or had a drink after work. 
So when Dawn Kahyaoglu, a co-owner of the restaurant, saw flames shooting from the factory's roof last Monday, she burst into tears, fearing first for her customers' safety. She is wondering what impact the fire will have on her business and her tenants who live above the restaurant and work at the plant. 
"I'm not really a money-hungry person," she said. "Just to know that they're all O.K. is enough. This is going to affect a lot."
Ms. Kahyaoglu is one of several business owners in downtown Ansonia who are trying to gauge the impact of the fire that turned a manufacturer of pillows, foam mattresses and cosmetic sponge pads into a mound of twisted metal, charred brick and smoldering debris.
The factory was not only one of the largest taxpayers in this blue-collar town, it also was one of the largest employers, drawing hundreds of people downtown each day.
Company officials have said they would not decide whether to rebuild until they discussed the finances with insurers. But even if they decide to reopen, workers said it would be a long time before the plant would be operational. That means many workers could face long stretches of unemployment or they may have to move to search for work. 
"Just the whole thing is devastating," said Ken Kreiger, co-owner of Spector Furniture on Main Street, which sells the plant's mattresses and pillows. "If people aren't working in the area, obviously it's going to affect everybody."
So while workers like Charlie Ferriolo, a 30-year-old production supervisor at the plant, try to figure out where they will go next, some downtown merchants are wondering how they will survive when the people who used to work at the plant stop coming in.
Paul Ciocca, co-owner of Eddy's Bake Shop on Main Street, is considering reducing his staff.
"We will have to see what the effect is going to be," he said. "It's the last thing we want to do." 
The fire comes at a time when Ansonia is trying to make a comeback. In the heart of the Naugatuck River Valley, the community has been known for years as a place that is not only home to competitive high school football teams, but also a place where weaving mills and factories once flourished.
In the early to mid-20th century, thousands of people came downtown to work at the mills that sit along the Naugatuck River. Charles Seccombe, 75, who owns a downtown men's clothing store, said that when he was a young boy the sidewalks were filled with people.
"You'd always be pushed off the sidewalk," he said.
Over the years, the town faced its share of disasters. On Aug. 19, 1955, a day some residents refer to as Black Friday, a flood devastated the town, causing more than $20 million in damage to commercial and residential buildings, said Phyllis Judd, a historian at the Ansonia Library. And economic downturns forced factories to close, move out of town or reduce staff. Today, hundreds, not thousands, of people, work at the remaining plants.
"It's just been a long slide here," said Bill Bassett, president of the Shelton-based W. E. Bassett Company, which makes everything from tweezers to emery boards. "Ansonia is one of those towns that has certainly been impacted by it. They certainly don't have the employee base that they used to have, and the newer firms aren't coming in." 
Latex Foam, an offspring of the Sponge Rubber Products Company, a factory that burned down in Shelton in 1975, is one company that has managed to survive. The company, which opened its plant in Ansonia in 1984, boasts that it's the world's largest producer of latex pillows and cosmetic sponges. Last year it had sales of about $50 million, a company official said. 
The company developed a reputation of being community oriented, playing a significant philanthropic role in the region. In addition to giving money to social service groups, it has donated mattresses to a domestic violence shelter. Employees have given clothes and other items to My Sister's Place, a nonprofit thrift store whose proceeds benefit the Ansonia-based Birmingham Group Health Services' domestic violence programs. 
"They have just been really, really good community citizens," said Marilyn Cormack, president and chief executive of the Birmingham Group. "They would identify a need and they would be right there to help us." 
Despite the loss, Mr. Kreiger, whose furniture store has existed since 1890, said the town would recover. Ansonia and the Naugatuck Valley have a long history of working together to overcome adversity.
In addition, Ansonia is beginning to experience a turnaround, the Kreigers said. As businesses and people move north from Fairfield County in search of cheaper land, places like Ansonia should benefit. Just last month, Obsidium Antiques opened in a former bank building on Main Street. Across the street, a women's boutique shop, Only For Her, has opened. "It's on the upswing," Ken Kreiger said.
Still, the fire will be likely to affect places like Eddy's Bake Shop. The Main Street bakery sold doughnuts and coffee to employees who stopped by before work and it baked cakes for office functions. 
"You don't know what's going to happen," said Mr. Ciocca, whose family has owned the bakery for about 40 years. "I think time will tell how bad it's really going to be."

HEADLINE: What I Did (for Others) on My Summer Vacation 

BYLINE:  By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
YOU'RE not supposed to work during your vacation.
 So why would anyone want to volunteer to wash dishes, sort cans at a food bank, seat patrons at a theater, tackle painting projects or spend quality time with elderly, disadvantaged or disabled people on their vacation? 
 Here's why, according to Betty Rooney of Ridgewood.
"We are so fortunate in so many ways," she said, "that I want our children to realize how fortunate they are, and to build relationships with families and other people who may not be so fortunate."
Twice a month this summer, Mrs. Rooney expects to take her husband and four children to a soup kitchen, a family shelter or a state park, and help out with what most would call chores. 
Helping out during the vacation season "is even easier because there are more outdoor activities that are really easy," she said. "The family decides what we want to do, when we want to do it and how much time we want to put into it. Then I contact the organization, work out the details, and then we just show up."
In April, for example, the Rooneys showed up at the New Jersey section of Palisades Interstate Park and spent a Sunday morning cleaning up the park's waterfront.
"I had never been there but we picked this because my 6-year-old, Brendan, likes boats," Mrs. Rooney said, "and I heard the park had a marina, I figured, why not?" 
The Rooneys' efforts were supervised by a park ranger "who told us all kind of interesting things about the park, its geology and place in history," she said, adding: "I never expected to learn so much. Things like that happen all the time when you volunteer. There are always unexpected benefits."
Some volunteers have even found love. Synergy, a Monmouth County volunteer group of 80 single professionals, ranging in age from 20 to 65, has recently celebrated its second wedding among its members, though "that's not what we're about," said Rob Rowley, an Atlantic Highlands developer who is also the group's treasurer. 
Members of the group, now in its 11th year, expect to volunteer for as many as 25 events each month this summer, which range from food bank duty to staffing athletic competitions and taking tickets at concerts.
"We work for thank-you's, T-shirts and lunch," Mr. Rowley said. "We don't go into this asking for anything other than an opportunity to help."
Though some members have children, "we usually don't involve children unless there is something that lends itself naturally to them," he said. "Not everything we do is a day at the beach."
Sometimes, though, volunteering really can be a day at the beach.
This summer Clean Ocean Action, a nonprofit environmental assistance group based in Sandy Hook, is sponsoring monthly beach cleanups at numerous beaches on the Jersey shore. To learn about local beach cleanup dates, contact the local beach patrol, or call Clean Ocean Action at (732) 872-0111.
Volunteers get a free T-shirt, a free hat, a bag to put the trash in, "and the gratitude of a lot of people," said Patrick Campitelli of Brigantine's Beach Patrol.
While most shore communities have machines that sift the sand for trash and debris, Lisa Helm of the Brigantine's Marine Mammal Stranding Center observed that "the machines don't get everything."
"A lot of the floating trash that builds up at the tide line gets mixed in with organic debris, where it poses a danger to animals that forage there for food," she said. "To protect those animals, you really need human beings to go over it and collect what might be dangerous."
The Stranding Center, which cares for whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine animals caught in shallow waters off New Jersey beaches, uses volunteers as guides at its museum, but requires prospective volunteers to apply in advance and be able to offer several weeks of part-time service.
"The volunteer work here is very specific," Ms. Helm said. "We don't have one-day or walk-in positions. Even to work in museum as a guide requires extensive education and training. So we need people who can give us a long-term commitment. But if you have the time, and you're willing to give us the commitment, we can give you an understanding of the marine environment, and our relation to it, that you'll never forget."
According to Janet Sharma, executive director of the Bergen County Volunteer Center, an organization that seeks to match volunteers with nonprofit agencies that need their services, New Jersey has some 5,000 nonprofit agencies that need unskilled volunteers "for anything from a few hours a day for as many days that they can spare" for tasks as simple as talking to the elderly to as labor intensive as restoring the Battleship New Jersey on the Camden waterfront.
Of those agencies, Ms. Sharma said, about 1,200 "are family friendly in that they can accommodate families and work with them to make the experience meaningful for teenagers and young children. Some have restrictions in that they might limit participation to children over a certain age. Some organizations, like assisted living facilities, prefer families with young children who can interact with the seniors. I know of some centers that are happy to have mothers with babies come in, to give the seniors a chance to see and maybe hold the baby."
Ms. Sharma, who is also the chairwoman for the National Volunteers Council, said that the idea of including a volunteer experience in vacations is gaining ground "among families and single people who want something more than a typical getaway."
"You get to meet people you wouldn't normally run into, find out interesting things about a community or a place," she said. "The feeling that the people get of knowing that they're helping someone else -- you can't put a price tag on it or measure it in decibels."
Some organizations simply wouldn't exist without volunteers. Cape May's Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts was founded in 1971 by volunteers, who offered visitors walking tours of the city's historic houses as a way of raising money to restore the Emlen Physick mansion.
Currently using as many as 400 volunteers this summer as docents, guides, ushers and event assistants in Cape May and Wildwood, the organization is not only the largest nonprofit cultural group on the Jersey Shore, it also uses the largest number of senior adults.
"We have one volunteer who is 90 and as active as ever," said Mary Stewart, the center's deputy director, who started folding brochures for the organization when her family moved to Cape May. "We almost never use walk-ins, but you never know. I started as a walk-in when my husband and I moved here, and my sons still volunteer for many of our events. If we're lucky enough to be full for the day, we can refer you to other organizations that could use your help."
Sue Adams, an equestrian instructor at the Atlantic Riding Center for the Handicapped in Egg Harbor Township, takes volunteering families, especially on days when inclement weather threatens, though children should be at least 12 years old.
"We are a 100 percent volunteer organization," she said. "Nobody's getting paid for this, not even me. We constantly need help feeding the horses, grooming and tacking and cleaning the stalls. We also welcome volunteers with disabilities. Volunteers are not given a chance to ride the horses, but they can get close to them and learn more about them. There's also the satisfaction of helping people with disabilities enjoy a day of riding."
For information on volunteering in New Jersey call (800) 865-8683. At the Web site www.volunteerconnections.org, visitors can click on the New Jersey location or type their ZIP code (or the ZIP code of their vacation residence) in the search engine. This will supply the addresses and telephone numbers of the nearest of New Jersey's 13 regional Volunteer Centers.
Ms. Sharma recommends contacting the volunteer center "as far in advance of your vacation date as possible because some activities, such as soup kitchens or ushering for special concerts, are quite popular and tend to fill up quickly. There's actually a waiting list at some soup kitchens."
In addition to getting free T-shirts, food and admission to shows, volunteers may also deduct some out-of-pocket expenses from their federal income taxes, such as the cost of transportation to and from the site where the work is scheduled to take place, parking costs, equipment purchased specifically for the activity (trash bags, sponges, gloves and paint brushes) and meals, if these are not provided or paid for by the organization. Volunteers should save their receipts for all out-of-pocket expenses and consult an accountant before filing. 
Here's how to reach agencies mentioned in the article: Atlantic Riding Center for Handicapped, (609) 926-2233. Volunteer Centers of Bergen County, (201) 489-9454. Marine Mammal Stranding Center, Brigantine, (609) 266-0538. Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts, Cape May, Jane Bonner, Volunteer Coordinator, (609) 884-5404, extension 152.

Getting on Board The Mule Train

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
WHEN it came to mules, there was barely a virgin in sight. The women in the second-floor shoe department of Bloomingdale's the other day were mostly mavens appreciating the sexy, backless little shoe that is suddenly de rigueur everywhere from hip bars to hushed offices.
 Going half-shoeless in a city full of grime, glass, potholes and grates would seem counterintuitive, if not downright silly. Black, yes. Barefoot, no. But the mule is now mainstream as New York heats up, and the young and the not so young from Mott Haven in the Bronx to Midwood, Brooklyn, are taking the plunge. 
 Shoe shoppers at Bloomingdale's and other stores in New York admit the mule's obvious drawbacks as city wear. Sidewalks can be booby traps, constant pedicures are a must, and heaven forbid you need to run. But mules are cute, comfortable and glam once you learn how to walk in them, fashionistas say. And, after all, God gave New Yorkers taxis.
"No matter what shoes you wear in New York, you have to walk with your head down anyway," said Berna Goldstein, a chic 40-year-old from Murray Hill who works in the lingerie industry and was shopping at Bloomingdale's with her friend Kathy Morehouse. "There are always crevices, cracks, the different heights of the sidewalk. I have fallen off my mules a little bit." Ms. Morehouse, who is five months pregnant, was trying on a pair of Polo sneaker mules in red and blue canvas. No heels, just wedges, given her condition. 
A question for these women: Is there something antifeminist about the whole "bare" look in women's clothes, from the foot-baring mule to plunging tops to clingy, diaphanous skirts, a look that was daring three seasons ago and seems a fact of life this year? Whatever happened to comfort? To function before form? 
"No one issued an edict," Ms. Morehouse said. "No one is making anyone wear it." 
A few feet away, Eileen Booth, 23, a receptionist at a Brooklyn law firm who has never worn backless shoes before, was checking out a pair of slinky taupe Martinez Valero mules. She put them on and walked with the delight of a little girl playing dress-up. 
"They feel almost like they might slide off," she said, "but I always carry a second pair of shoes in my bag." To be honest, she admitted, " If you dressed the way you should in the city, you would never look good."
The economy faces a downturn, but women still want their mules. Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, marketing and retail consultants in the Flatiron district, says shoes are the new lipstick, a pick-me-up that doesn't involve investing in a new wardrobe.
When the mule first became widely popular a couple of years ago, retailers and social observers talked about how women were influenced by everything from looser office dress codes to television shows like "Sex and the City" that put an emphasis on baring more from head to toe.
There is also a defiance involved in the incongruity of wearing delicate shoes to walk indelicate city streets. Just as New Yorkers picnic on tar beach and kids splash in the spray of hydrants, so there is a certain fantasy element in tottering around town in mules.
Some women are to the mule born. No walking lessons for them.
"Honestly, we don't get, 'How do your wear them?' " said Barbara Parisotto, a spokeswoman for Sigerson Morrison, a hip Prince Street boutique that features pointy-toed mules in colors like orange, mauve and cherry red. Best sellers include an almost flat metallic leather mule in raspberry sorbet and a spectator-style mule in army and acid greens with pedestal heels and a little bow.
Mules go back to 18th-century Europe, where they were worn by men and women alike, although they no longer carry the same overtly sexual connotations they did in the 1950's, when you knew exactly what Marilyn Monroe had in mind when she slipped into hers. Fashion historians suggest that the current popularity of the mule reflects a growing tendency for shoes to show more foot. Even toe cleavage is deeper.
"They're also extremely comfortable," said Valerie Steele, a historian who is acting director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "You just have to learn to grip with the sole of your foot to walk."
Learn to walk?
Ms. Steele laughed. "If a drag queen can learn to walk in heels," she said, "I can learn to walk in mules."

The Boardroom Is Not the Beach

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
HEY, you in the backwards baseball cap! Your image needs some help.
 Yes, everything that Jackie Onassis, Diana Vreeland and your grandmother said was true. To get ahead in this world, you need to put your best foot forward. And if it is unmanicured and wedged in flip-flops, you probably will not get the respect you deserve, especially in a job market that is becoming more competitive as the economy slows. 
 "Image is everything these days," said Ray Drasnin, chief executive of Drasnin Communications, an advertising and public relations firm in San Diego. "Last year, it was hip to be trendy, but in 2001 and beyond you need to be polished, with extraordinary business acumen."
Lauren Solomon, president of the Association of Image Consultants International, with about 600 members worldwide, agreed: "In the past few years, the emphasis was on youth and fast cash, but now there's a return to a traditional approach to getting real money. Your image had better speak volumes."
The role of image consultants has evolved. No longer is the focus on the "outer you" -- what season best corresponds to your eye and hair color, for example. Now the consultants examine the "whole package" -- including attitudes and behavior. Their help can come in handy, whether you're applying for a sales job or seeking money for a start-up. 
"If you want investment capital, you need to look like more than a creative, out-of-the-box thinker," said Mr. Drasnin, who has helped many people in the dot-com world blend into the neo-new economy. "You need to look like a young business person, not like you're ready to spin disks, pour cocktails and drive your Porsche back to the West Coast." (The same rules apply, by the way, to the over-50 crowd that still wears ponytails and combat boots.)
In the neo-new economy, metal hoops cannot protrude from eyebrows (or any other visible body part), at least not in the boardroom. Nor can you zip into meetings on roller blades or wear pants that fall to your knees and T-shirts emblazoned with slogans like "So many beers, so little time."
No one is saying that you have to become a Stepford staffer. But you do need to recognize the fine line between individuality and insolence. Conventionality has its time and place. "If people were more conformist, they'd make their mark later but be more grounded," said Charles Sacarello, founder of Charles & Associates, an international image consulting firm with offices in New York and Europe. Mr. Sacarello and his business partner, David Steinberg, have coached a number of clients from high-technology industries. And many of them "have suffered because they looked geeky or goofy," Mr. Sacarello said.
"They weren't taken seriously by their elders," he added.
To help clients overcome their Rodney Dangerfield complexes, he talks with them for hours, usually on their own turf. Focusing on goals, he asks questions like these: What are your assets and weaknesses? Who are your role models? Which three words describe you? Which three words would you like to describe you? 
He often accompanies clients on shopping trips, to supplant their wardrobes, or to dinner, to offer lessons in cutlery. Sometimes he plays spy, watching clients from afar and later reporting to them on their behavior.
"Some people truly have no idea how others perceive them," he said. For $500 to $10,000, depending on the number and range of sessions, he is happy to tell them. 
Sometimes, the issue is not sloppiness but what can happen after founding a high-tech company in one's early 20's. Richard La China, now 27, was the founder and chief executive of Axxis Computer Technologies in San Diego, which he sold recently. He is now a managing director of the buyer, All Bases Covered, a computer and network support company. Mr. La China said that for years, he had difficulty gaining the respect of his elders. "When they were my age they weren't executives and C.E.O.'s; to them, I was just a kid," he said. "But I was also very confident, which bothered them."
It also didn't help that he spent his first few paychecks on two Mercedes, a 4,200-square-foot home with an ocean view, and a $9,000 Rolex watch. Still, he said, he wasn't aware of the impression he was making until an older executive told him to buy an '82 Buick and dump the gold. "I was upset because I worked hard to get what I had, but people were taken aback by my flashiness," he recalled.
SO he called Mr. Drasnin, who helped him finesse both his appearance and demeanor. They talked goals, desires, humility. They talked branding, marketing, strategy. In 1999, he won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award from Ernst & Young, and he says he couldn't have done it on his own. "Ray helped me figure out what I needed to look and act like to be respected in this world," he said.
Sure, he has kept his watches and cars, and his bathroom still overlooks the Pacific, but he has diluted his look and no longer thinks that he has all the answers. In turn, he lectures to high school students and community youth groups. One of the first things he tells them is this: "Be presentable. That's what's acceptable in the business world."

HEADLINE: CITY LORE; 
A Man, a Span, a Plan

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL MISCIONE; Michael Miscione wrote and directed "The City of Greater New York: The Story of Consolidation," a documentary.

 BODY:
HERE is a modest proposal: Let's rename the Washington Bridge.
 Not that big gray Hudson River bridge that connects Manhattan to New Jersey. That's the George Washington Bridge. 
 The Washington Bridge, built in 1889, goes over the Harlem River and connects Manhattan to the Bronx. But ever since its name was co-opted by its crosstown rival, it has suffered an identity crisis. 
One way to end the confusion would be to rechristen the bridge after the man who first suggested building it, a forgotten 19th-century Gotham hero named Andrew Haswell Green. Green devoted five decades of public service to the city, perhaps influencing its early development more than any other figure. Central Park, the Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bronx Zoo, Riverside Park, the New York Public Library, even the very boroughs that compose New York today, owe their existence, in some measure, to Andrew Green. Yet no bridge, no park, no school, no street, honors his legacy.
Green was born in 1820 in Massachusetts, moved to New York as a teenager, became a lawyer and was president of the Board of Education.
In 1857 the State Legislature, at the urging of prominent citizens who feared that Manhattan Island would one day be carpeted entirely with buildings, appointed a commission to design and build Central Park. Green, a staunch supporter of parks, rose to head it. For 13 years he presided over all park work, kept the project on budget, fended off outsiders' attempts to meddle with the Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux design and coaxed new from the Legislature. Even Olmsted, who often fought ferociously with Green, admitted that the man "did a hundred times more work than all the rest of the commissioners together."
When the commission's authority was extended beyond the park's borders, Green set to work planning, improving and beautifying the city, a task he continued for the rest of his life. He laid out the streets in the undeveloped reaches of town, built more parks and lobbied for new bridges and aqueducts. He fought to preserve natural and historic treasures. He created or built homes for many of New York's greatest cultural institutions.
Green's greatest triumph came late in his career. In the 1880's, merchants thought that New York Harbor, the engine that drove the region's economy, was being mismanaged by the lax, often corrupt municipalities that controlled its waters. So Green championed the idea of consolidating the outlying cities, towns and villages into New York City, which then consisted only of Manhattan and part of the Bronx.
Brooklyn was then the nation's third-largest city, and indignant Brooklynites railed against "Green's Hobby," as they called consolidation. For years they fought Green and his allies. But just when consolidation seemed doomed, the Republican Party boss Thomas Platt embraced the proposal and drove it through the Legislature. In 1898 the five boroughs were born, and Andrew Green was dubbed "the Father of Greater New York."
Green's bizarre death, in 1903, stunned the city. A deranged stranger mistook him for another man and shot him dead on the steps of his home. Several grand memorials for him were proposed, but none were built except for a forlorn granite bench near 104th Street in Central Park -- constructed in 1929 and rededicated in 1998 -- that is so obscure it is not marked on most park maps.
Which brings us back to the Washington Bridge. When it was erected, 14 years before Green's death, it was considered something of an unofficial monument to the man. Why not make it official?

A Valley Lush in Velcro and Baggy Shorts

BYLINE:  By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
TWO decades ago, Robert B. McKnight Jr. was a "surfer dude" who hoped to make a few easy dollars selling Australian-made board shorts, those baggy swim trunks worn by surfers, along the balmy beaches of this Southern California town.
 "We didn't think of this as an apparel business," said Mr. McKnight, now 47, and still tanned and trim. "We thought we'd sell some shorts from the back of the truck, hang out on the beaches and chase women. Then we'd go to work for our dads or I.B.M." 
 But the tide somehow shifted. Mr. McKnight, working from a large office here, is now chief executive of Quiksilver Inc., an apparel powerhouse that expects to have worldwide net sales this year of nearly $600 million, up from $516 million last year and nearly twice its 1998 total. Quiksilver and other apparel companies that have headquarters or major operations in the Orange County suburbs are part of the burgeoning active-sports market, catering to skateboarders, snowboarders and surfers alike. Industry experts estimate nationwide revenue in this segment as high as $2.4 billion.
Mr. McKnight and his competitors credit their success to positioning. They view their businesses not as fashion companies but as promoters of an active lifestyle that they have followed with an almost religious passion themselves. The businesses stand apart from the mainstream garment industries in New York or Los Angeles, relying largely on specialty stores, the Internet or their own outlets to sell their products.
Paul Naude, president of the North American operations of Billabong, an Australian surfwear company with global sales of about $250 million, says the primary task of companies in his industry is to capture the exhilaration and individualism -- the "rush" -- of surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding for the young adults who make up much of their primary market.
"We understand the intangibles that trigger the juices of the youth culture," said Mr. Naude, 45, who got his start building surfboards as a teenager in his native Durban, South Africa, and still has the physique of a serious surfer. "It's all about the freedom of doing board sports -- and the older I get, the more passionate I am about it."
That explains how many of the top companies, like Quiksilver, Billabong U.S.A. and Ocean Pacific Apparel, chose to place their corporate headquarters and design offices in this beach-rich area, about an hour south of the teeming garment district of Los Angeles. So many companies and suppliers have now clustered in this region that it is widely known as "Velcro valley," for the adhesive material commonly used in surfwear shorts and shirts.
"These guys wouldn't be caught dead working out of downtown L.A. or New York; they really are about a completely different approach," said Stuart Berman, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles. "They want a more relaxed, out-by-the-beach lifestyle."
DESPITE their relaxed image, industry executives like Mr. McKnight are not as laid back as one might think. They have steadily built their industry well beyond its roots, Mr. Berman pointed out. What started with boards and shorts has now expanded into goods ranging from T-shirts and shoes to dresses. And their market includes children, teenagers and middle-aged adults.
That expansion, he said, has been greatly enhanced by the rapid growth in recent years of board sports, notably snowboarding and skateboarding. Those sports have driven the industry's appeal beyond its original strongholds in Australia, South Africa and Southern California, to Europe, Japan and even Middle America.
As many as 11 million Americans are now skateboarders, up from five million or six million a decade ago, said Angelo Ponzi, who runs Board-Trac Inc., a market research firm based in Trabuco Canyon, also in Orange County. Snowboarding, which barely existed a decade ago, now has several million active participants in the United States, he said. The numbers for both sports are now higher than for surfing, whose strongholds remain largely in Southern California and Hawaii, he said.
Surfing "is the granddaddy of it all, but you need a beach and a wave," Mr. Ponzi said.
"Skating allows anyone with a street and asphalt to share in that culture," he added. "Then there's snowboarding -- it's all opening up the surfwear experience to lots of people in places like Iowa."
Board-Trac estimates about one in four teenagers and young adults participate in "extreme sports," a category that includes the board sports. But even those who don't participate are influenced by the styles worn by these athletes. "Everyone wants to be like Joe the Surfer or the cool kid on a skateboard," said Hezy Shaked, president of Tilly's, an activewear retailer based in Irvine, with 14 stores in the state.
But no retailer may reflect the growing influence of the "Velcro valley" more than Pacific Sunwear. Started as a small surf shop in Newport Beach in 1980, the chain, based in Anaheim, has more than 600 outlets in 48 states and in Puerto Rico, up from 112 stores just five years ago. Eighty-five percent of the stores are outside California, and the store with the highest sales is in the Roosevelt Field shopping mall in Garden City, N.Y., said Timothy M. Harmon, the company's president.
"This is no longer a California concept," said Mr. Harmon, who has worked for mainstream retailers like Abraham & Straus, Bullocks and Millers Outpost. 
The growth of the industry, however, makes some longtime industry insiders, like Mr. Naude of Billabong, concerned about potential overexposure. But most experts see continuing growth ahead. The popularity of surfwear-inspired products outside California and other traditional strongholds will continue to feed off youth-oriented media, most notably MTV and the Internet, said Richard A. Baker, president of Ocean Pacific.
Mr. Baker, whose company's sales are expected to top $217 million this year, up from $160 million last year, says most conventional apparel makers sell an image of a product that may have nothing to do with their own daily lives. But he said most top surfwear executives, and often their families, still embrace what their products promote. Most rarely miss a chance to catch a wave at home, or to use business as an excuse to visit surfing Valhallas like Hawaii.
"This is still a real passion for most of us," Mr. McKnight said. The industry's success, he added, "is really about the loyalty we have to this active lifestyle and the fact that our customers relate to that lifestyle."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Deft Hand at Helm of Pilots' Union

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FROM his eighth-floor office window here, Duane E. Woerth can see airplanes descending over the Potomac River on their final approach to Reagan National Airport. If a jet is too far above the dome of St. Matthew's Cathedral, a few blocks south of him on Rhode Island Avenue, he says, then it is coming in too high and the crew will "have an interesting landing." 
 That is about as close to flying as he gets these days. A 747 captain for Northwest Airlines, he has taken leave to run the Air Line Pilots Association, the world's largest pilot union and one of the country's richest and most influential labor groups. 
 It is a job that may be more pressure-packed than a difficult landing at National.
Pilots at Comair are in a protracted strike that may kill the regional airline. Pilots at Delta Air Lines, which owns Comair, are about to vote on an agreement that could make them the highest paid in the industry, or could lead to a strike if it is rejected. 
Last year, pilots at United Airlines won huge gains after a work slowdown that forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights, sending it to the bottom of the industry's on-time rankings. Later in the year, Delta pilots tried the same tactic, leading to more cancellations. 
The Bush administration has taken a militant stand against organized labor in the airline business, delaying a strike by Northwest mechanics and promising to prevent other strikes.
Then there is the looming consolidation of the major airlines, uproars in Congress about poor service and air traffic congestion, and a brewing battle with the industry over the government's rest requirement for pilots. 
If anybody is up to the challenge, fellow pilots and airline executives say, it is Captain Woerth. Only the seventh president of the union since its founding in the 1930's, he is admired for his vision and ability to rally fractious members. 
"Duane is a very astute labor leader," said John H. Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest, who served with him on Northwest's board for more than five years. "He listens very carefully to his members."
Capt. Mark Innerbichler, leader of the Minneapolis-based pilots at Northwest and a member of the union's board, marvels at Captain Woerth's skill in winning over pilots. "Nobody gets angry the way pilots get angry," Captain Innerbichler said. "I have seen it when pilots have the tar bubbling and they have the ropes out ready to hang him. But after Duane talked for 20 minutes, they were carrying him out on their shoulders."
Last month, pilots at Continental Airlines voted to merge their independent union with the Air Line Pilots Association, adding 6,500 members to the association's roster of 59,000. It was a victory that had eluded Captain Woerth's predecessor and is part of his plan to increase the association's influence by recruiting as many of the independent pilot groups as possible. 
The 3,800 pilots at FedEx will join the association by October, Captain Woerth said in an interview. And 11,500 American Airlines pilots, who left the union in the 1960's, are considering a return. "The United and Delta contracts are the best organizing tool you can get," he said, referring to increases that enable many senior pilots to earn more than $300,000 a year and retire with a seven-figure nest egg plus a hefty pension. 
Bringing the Continental pilots into the association was controversial, because their union contains many members who crossed the picket line in the 1980's after Frank Lorenzo, then the chief executive, put Continental into bankruptcy court and abrogated its union contracts. 
"Nobody wants scabs in your union," said Captain Innerbichler, who had opposed the merger before Captain Woerth appealed to his sense of duty. "He said, 'Mark, you don't leave people on the battlefield,' " said Captain Innerbichler, a former Marine pilot. "That hit my button, and at that point I started to see the benefits."
Union activism is not in Captain Woerth's blood. He grew up in Scribner, Neb., a farming town of 800 people, where his family still raises corn, soybeans and hogs on the original homestead. "Where I grew up, people thought well of Franklin Roosevelt," he said, "but he was the last Democrat they liked." 
With his unassuming manner, half-moon hairline and bushy mustache, Captain Woerth, 52, could pass for the local insurance agent or John Deere dealer. 
In the Vietnam War, he flew a modified Boeing 707 as an Air Force pilot; that led to a job flying for Braniff. But in 1982 Braniff went out of business. It was a "life-changing event," he said. Because a pilot's pay and schedule are determined by seniority, he was not only out of a job but starting over, at the bottom. 
"It made you think of yourself for the first time as a working person," he recalled. "I thought to myself, 'Maybe I have to look at life differently and at workers' rights and how naked you are out there.' " 
He soon joined Northwest and became involved with the union. In 1986, Northwest merged with Republic Airlines. The two pilot groups were soon at odds. But when forced to choose one union leader, they selected him. 
In 1993, after Northwest's unions won three seats on the board in exchange for economic concessions, Captain Woerth was chosen as the pilot representative. He says his stint, which ended when he became head of the association two years ago, was "the best business education." 
Mr. Dasburg said Captain Woerth was a model director who always did his homework and played a crucial role in many decisions. "As soon as he joined our board, he began to make an impact," Mr. Dasburg said. 
Captain Woerth helped establish a consulting firm owned by the union that has helped train pilots at foreign airlines to negotiate contracts. He wants similar work rules for all pilots so his North American members will be protected in international alliances or mergers. 
Asked to justify some pilot salaries that exceed $400,000 a year, he was unapologetic, arguing that the job had become vastly more demanding over the years. "If you can bargain for it," he said, "you should get it."
What really angers him are contentions by airline executives that the industry's unions have become too powerful and should not be allowed to strike. He accuses the executives of hypocrisy because they say there is more than enough competition to allow major airlines to merge.
"If labor has gotten too big," he said, "then it means that the companies have gotten too big as well and maybe we shouldn't allow any more mergers."

HEADLINE: Business; 
A Better Mousetrap? For This Immigrant, It's a Plastic Bag

BYLINE:  By KATE MURPHY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
A RIVER of clear plastic, destined to become supermarket produce bags, rushes past as Rafael Alvarado yells greetings in Spanish to workers on a noisy assembly line. "Most of them are first-generation immigrants," said Mr. Alvarado, president and chief executive of Better Bags Inc. here.
 An immigrant himself -- he was born in Nicaragua -- he knows what it is like to come to a new country in search of a better life. Still, he said, "no one is here as a favor; we all have to prove our value to the company every day." 
 With that ethic, Better Bags has grown 25 percent a year since 1996. Shoppers at 7,000 grocery stores in 49 states now snatch his plastic bags for their produce. The bags hang from Mr. Alvarado's patented pull-down dispenser, which releases and automatically opens them one at a time.
He invented the dispenser in the 1980's, after fleeing Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution. He was living in Costa Rica, working as general manager for a subsidiary of Plasticos de Nicaragua, which makes plastic liners for the crates used to ship bananas. With a prototype of his dispenser in his luggage, Mr. Alvarado immigrated to Houston in 1984. 
Using credit cards, he and two partners, whom he has since bought out, started Better Bags as a distributor of plastic wrap and packaging. "It was just the three of us working 16-hour days, loading and unloading without a forklift," Mr. Alvarado said. He suffered a herniated disk but still managed to save $150,000. In 1990, he invested every cent, along with $1.5 million in bank loans and $1.8 million in venture capital, to start manufacturing his pull-down bags and dispensers.
"It was my trial by fire," recalled Mr. Alvarado, now 47, who did not tell his wife what he had done with the life savings. "That way at least one of us could sleep," he said. He transformed Better Bags' distribution warehouse into a 50,000-square-foot plant and hired 30 employees -- mostly Hispanic immigrants. He recruited them from nearby churches and, though operating on a tight budget, offered them health insurance, two weeks' paid vacation and the opportunity to advance if they proved their worth.
"It's worked to his advantage," said Roy Serpa, who advised Mr. Alvarado as director of the Houston office of the Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center, which provides low-cost consulting services to small manufacturers and is subsidized by the state and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. "The folks on the factory floor are so motivated it's unbelievable," he said.
Four months into production, local grocers started placing orders after Mr. Alvarado gave them dispensers and refill bags at steeply discounted prices to try in their stores. Offering an inexpensive trial supply is still a marketing tool. Better Bags' most recent account, D'Agostino Supermarkets, which has 23 stores in the New York area, tested the company's bags for four months before signing on.
"You don't like to change stuff in this business," says Daniel L. Steffen, director of purchasing at D'Agostino. "People get used to the way things are and complain when you bring in something new." But customers liked the bags. "There's less waste," Mr. Steffen said, because shoppers do not inadvertently pull off more bags than they need or discard them out of frustration because they cannot get them open.
Mr. Alvarado, who became an American citizen in 1995, said, "There's no way we can compete on price alone." His bags are 20 percent more expensive than the ubiquitous rolls of bags manufactured primarily by the Inteplast Group, of Livingston, N.J., a subsidiary of the Formosa Plastics Group of Taiwan. Inteplast supplies 45 percent of the nation's produce bags, with smaller companies like Better Bags; BPI Packaging Technologies of North Dighton, Mass.; and Crown Poly of Los Angeles, battling for the rest of the market, worth an estimated $170 million to $200 million a year. 
"We don't have the economy of scale to have the best price," Mr. Alvarado said, "so we've chosen to focus on value-added features," like thicker plastic, ease of use, less waste and six-color printing capability. Bags wound on a roll usually accommodate only one color.
Thomas R. Furia Jr., general manager of Penn Jersey Paper in Philadelphia, which distributes bags on the East Coast, says upscale or specialty food markets are generally the only ones interested in such features. "The big stores just want cheap," he said, adding that most shoppers are satisfied with any kind of plastic bag as long as it holds the produce without breaking.
And huge chains like Safeway and Kroger are in a position to use their size to leverage extremely low prices. Bag companies and grocery stores would not discuss prices for fear of tipping off competitors, but industry insiders said they ran from $12 to $24 per 1,000, or a penny or two each. 
"Produce bags are a high-volume, low-margin business," said Howard Rappaport, a plastics industry analyst at Chemical Market Associates Inc., a Houston petrochemical consulting firm. "The only way to get ahead is to serve a lot of smaller chains where you can charge more."
That has been Mr. Alvarado's strategy. Better Bags earned $15 million in 2000, with customers like D'Agostino, Schnuck Markets and Whole Foods Market.
WITH the completion of an additional plant in Toluca, Mexico, Better Bags raised production capacity this year to more than 260 million bags a month, from about 180 million. "We chose to go there because of the geography," Mr. Alvarado said, and not to save on labor costs. The cool, dry climate in the mountainous area around Toluca is easier on the machinery than the brutal heat and humidity in Houston, he said, and the plant's location will provide easy access to the Mexican market when the company is ready.
For now, though, Mr. Alvarado said he was concentrating on the American market, which includes the 1,200 new stores he has landed in the last three months. He aims to double output in the next four years, so that the company can become more competitive on cost and can serve larger chains that he now supplies only on a regional basis.
Mr. Alvarado does not expect to ever overtake a company like Inteplast in volume or revenue. "Our goal is to be the leader in supplying stores who want a high-quality alternative bag, a better bag," he said.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Beneath the Stock-Market Rebound, Hints of Trouble

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ARE happy days really here again for the economy?
 The stock market's impressive rally over the last six weeks -- in which the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 15 percent and the Nasdaq composite has climbed 28 percent -- has seduced unsuspecting investors into believing that they are. But based on the stock market's behavior on just two days during this period, I conclude that the economy most likely is in a recession. 
 Those two days were the first Fridays of April and May, on which the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest job-market data. On both occasions, the picture was far bleaker than what most investors had expected. And on both occasions, the stock market reacted by falling significantly after the figures were announced, though after the May announcement the market rallied later in the day. 
It turns out that such negative reaction is a hallmark of recessions. It is relatively rare during periods of economic expansion, by contrast, when the stock market tends to react positively to weaker-than-expected employment data, historically on the grounds that it will reduce pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
I owe this insight to a recent study by three economists, John H. Boyd, finance department chairman at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management; Jian Hu, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association; and Ravi Jagannathan, a finance professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. (Their paper, "The Stock Market's Reaction to Unemployment News: Why Bad News is Usually Good for Stocks," is available on the Web at http://papers.nber.org/papers/W8092.)
They studied all of the government's monthly employment announcements from 1962 to 1995, focusing on how Wall Street reacted when the employment picture was reported to be either stronger or weaker than Wall Street was expecting.
With regard to weaker-than-expected data, the researchers found that the stock market's reaction depended crucially on whether the economy was in a recession (as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research). During periods of expansion, the average daily reaction of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock list was to gain 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. During recession months, however, the S.& P.'s average reaction was to lose 6 hundredths of a point. This spread of 20 basis points is statistically significant, since the rest of the time the S.& P. 500's average daily gain is less than 3 basis points.
To be sure, these economists are not proposing that investors use their analysis as a market-timing tool to predict how the market will react to the monthly job figures. As they point out, the National Bureau of Economic Research does not know until months after the fact whether the economy is in recession. Even if this obstacle did not exist, you would still not be able to trade on the professors' theory, because doing so would require having advance knowledge of the government's announcement.
We can use the economists' theory, however, to "forecast" the current state of the economy. To do that, we only need to study how the stock market reacts to weaker-than-expected employment data. If it reacts negatively, as it did during April and May, the odds are good that we are in a recession.
You might wonder why the market reaction to rising unemployment is so different in recessions than in expansions. After all, regardless of the state of the economy, rising unemployment lets the Federal Reserve ease monetary policy. Why should that be bullish during expansions and bearish during recessions?
The economists do not deny that monetary easing is positive for the stock market. But they remind us that the unemployment data also conveys a valuable message about future corporate profitability. During recessions, the market concentrates on that message.
Of course, the stock market's reaction in early April and May does not guarantee that we are in a recession. However, it would be an exception to the historical rule for the economy to be expanding. Which way do you want to bet?

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
That Prescription-Drug Trap

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
PRESCRIPTION medicines are among the few consumer products that Americans feel they deserve the best of, yet don't want to pay for.
 A recent study by the National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Educational Foundation shows that spending on prescription drugs in the United States increased last year by 18.8 percent, to $131.9 billion. And there is little sign of a slowdown ahead. 
 At the same time, the budget debate in Washington has turned toward how to include drugs in Medicare, while makers of allergy drugs may soon be asked by the government to offer over-the-counter relief for itchy eyes and sneezing, and presumably at lower prices. 
Drug companies are not interested in watching revenue drop. Managed care companies and employers are not keen on picking up any more of the costs, either. But insured consumers, who had been more or less impervious to this debate by virtue of their $10 and $20 co-payments, are getting a taste of what drugs really cost as insurers increasingly demand that they pay more of the bills.
American drug companies tend to pass along their research, development and advertising costs to consumers in the United States, while giving the rest of the world a subsidized price break. And that infuriates American health insurance companies and some policy makers, who say the impact is harshest on the nation's elderly, who lack prescription benefits under Medicare, and on those with the most severe illnesses. In one Empire HealthCare plan in New York, for instance, 12 people out of the 10,000 in the plan accounted for $1.7 million in prescription costs in one year, or about 15 percent of total drug costs for that plan.
In recent years, the research labs have yielded new and often fabulous drugs that can be used to manage diseases or that offer fewer side effects than their predecessors. But there are times when the benefits of these drugs are slim when compared with their costs, and yet the drugs are prescribed anyway. 
Sometimes, that is because doctors have not researched the best use of the drugs; instead, they have taken a salesman's word for it. And that word may have been shared at a lovely seaside resort town, with all expenses paid by the drug manufacturer.
Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the public hospital system in New York City, has been trying to put together lists of recommended drugs, known as formularies, for purchasing plans for all of the hospitals in his system, and has come up against resistance.
"I have to tell you that it is not easy," he said recently. "You have physicians that don't like to be constrained. The pressures that residents and others get from pharmaceutical companies are there, too." Drug companies often "pay for trips or conferences," he said, and as such "are an obstacle to getting the formularies."
But doctors also say that they are often browbeaten into prescribing a new drug because the patient has seen an advertisement for it or otherwise heard about its efficacy.
"People like to think they are getting the latest and the greatest and want things that sometimes give marginal benefit regardless of the cost," said Dr. Alan E. Sokolow, chief medical officer at Empire HealthChoice.
When the garden-variety antibiotic and the BMW version are both available for the same co-payment, many people, of course, choose the BMW. "The price to them is not apparent," Dr. Sokolow said. "It is just an insurance benefit to them." He also pointed to the overuse of antibiotics, often resulting from patients' insistence on drugs when none are needed, or for stronger, more costly brands.
Patients are learning. Many insurance companies have started to require them to pay a percentage of their drug costs, rather than simpleco-payments. The programs are often multitiered, with name-brand drugs costing more. Public hospitals in New York have begun charging fees for drugs at their hospital pharmacies and community clinics; in the past, those drugs were usually free or sold at nominal prices.
"INSURANCE companies will increasingly put the consumer on notice in terms of what drugs really cost," said Uwe Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton. And that may not be all bad. After all, who wouldn't upgrade his car or dishwasher each year if he saw an advertisement extolling the virtues of a new model, and if someone else was picking up the bill? "Consumers will take a closer look," Professor Reinhardt said.
Of course, people with rare and serious illnesses will be at a constant disadvantage under this system, because drug makers will have no impetus to cut prices. But for drugs like antibiotics and allergy medications, can a price war be coming soon? Some say it's possible. "The drug companies will get really hit with countervailing power," Professor Reinhardt said. "They are not going to get 18 percent increases forever."

A Rate Cut Lifts the Market's Mood

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The verdict on the economy may still be out, but for many investors there seems to be no more doubt about the direction in which it is headed.
 Heartened by the fifth interest rate cut this year, and with most analysts expecting the economy to regain its strength by the fourth quarter, investors plunged into the stock markets last week, driving up all three major indexes and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average above the psychologically important 11,000 barrier. 
 Investors found more to cheer in the report on April consumer prices, which showed that inflation remained tame. Coupled with statements by the Federal Reserve, it signaled that more rate cuts are possible.
 Blue chips led the way, with the Dow industrials finishing at 11,301.74, up 480.43 points, or 4.4 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at 1,291.96, up 46.29, or 3.7 percent. The Nasdaq also rallied strongly, closing at 2,198.88, up 91.45, or 4.3 percent. 
 In the bond market, long-term issues staged a small rally, but they were held down by expectations that the Fed might begin to raise rates as the economy recovered. The yield on the 10-year note slid to 5.40 percent from 5.45 percent the previous week.

We want big. We want fast. We want far. We want now. We want 345 horsepower in a V-8 engine and 15 miles per gallon on the highway. 
 We drive behemoths. We drive them alone. This country was not built on H.O.V. lanes. 
 We don't have limits. We have liberties.
If we don't wear our seat belts, it doesn't matter, because we have air bags. If the air bags don't deploy, it doesn't matter, because our cars are so beefy, we'll never get bruised. If we need to widen the streets for our all-wheel drives, we will. If we need to reinforce all the bridges in the country, so that they don't buckle and collapse under our 5,800-pound S.U.V.'s, our engineers will do that. 
We'll bake the earth. We'll brown & serve it, saute it, simmer it, sear it, fondue it, George-Foreman-grill it. (We invented the Foreman grill.) We might one day bring the earth to a boil and pull it like taffy. (We invented taffy.)
If rising seas obliterate the coasts, our marine geologists will sculpt new ones and Hollywood will get bright new ideas for disaster movies. If we get charred by the sun, our dermatologists will replace our skin.
If the globe gets warmer, we'll turn up the air-conditioning. (We invented air-conditioning.) We'll drive faster in our gigantic, air-conditioned cars to the new beaches that our marine geologists create.
We will let our power plants spew any chemicals we deem necessary to fire up our Interplaks, our Krups, our Black & Deckers and our Fujitsu Plasmavisions.
We will drill for oil whenever and wherever we please. If tourists don't like rigs off the coast of Florida, they can go fly fishing in Wyoming. We won't be deterred by a few Arctic terns. We don't care about caribou. We don't care for cardigans. Give us our 69 degrees, winter and summer. Let there be light -- no timers, no freaky-shaped long-life bulbs. (We invented the light bulb.)
We want our refrigerators cold and our freezers colder. Bring on the freon. Banish those irritating toilets that restrict flow. When we flush, we flush all the way.
We will perfect the dream of nuclear power. We will put our toxic waste wherever we want, whenever we waste it. We have whole states with nothing better to do than serve as ancestral burial grounds for our effluvium. It can fester in those wide open spaces for thousands of years.
We will have the biggest, baddest missiles, and we will point them in any direction we like, across the galaxies, through eternity, forever and ever.
We will thrust as many satellites as we want into outer space, and we will surround them with a firewall of weapons for their protection.
We will guarantee broadband and fast connections to the Internet. We will not permit anybody, anywhere, at any time to threaten the delivery of all the necessities to computers, Palm Pilots and BlackBerrys: stock quotes, sports scores, real estate listings, epicurean.com recipes, porn. (O.K., so we didn't invent porn.)
By arming space, and protecting satellites, we ensure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- our 500 TV channels drawn from the ether.
We will secure the inalienable right of every citizen driving by himself in his big car to be guided by a global positioning system. Nobody should have to call in advance for directions to a party when the satellite can show the way.
We will modify food in any way we want and send it to any country we see fit at prices that we and we alone determine in the cargo ships we choose at the time we set.
Our international banking arm -- the World Bank and the I.M.F. -- will support whatever dictatorships suit us best.
We will fly up any coast of any nation on earth with any plane filled with any surveillance equipment and top guns that we possess.
We will build superduperjumbo jets so Brobdingnagian that runways will be crushed under their weight at the most congested airports in the history of aviation. (We invented aviation.)
We will buy, carry, conceal and shoot firearms whenever and wherever we want, as is our constitutionally guaranteed right. (We invented the Constitution.) We will kill any criminal we want, by lethal injection or electrocution. (We invented electricity.)
We are America.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Doubts After the Layoff 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I'm 46 and a director-level executive with experience in e-commerce start-ups and multinational corporations. I was laid off in February by a company that ceased operations. 
 I know that my time-consuming loyalty and work ethic at that job put me behind the eight ball in searching for different work in advance. I also know that finding a job of comparable pay can now take many months. 
My one and only example of irrational exuberance from those earlier days is a 2000 Porsche Boxster S, with a license plate that reads "IWKHRD." I must admit that it's embarrassing riding around in a nice car with a sign telling people how hard you work and yet you know you are unemployed.
Since the layoff, I have avoided the one thing that made me feel joy in my busy life -- going out to eat. It costs money, and money is precious when you may be unemployed for a while. I feel as if I need to expend all my energy finding a new job.
There has been no sense of finality in any day since I have become unemployed. And it doesn't help when people tell me it should be easy to find other work. It ain't as easy as it looks.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Doubts After the Layoff 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The column rang true for me, a laid-off, 38-year-old, single man. Having been through previous layoffs, I thought this one would be easier emotionally -- not so. 
 After the initial shock wore off, I began the "blame myself" game. Then a car accident left me without a car, much less the ability to buy a new one; my self-esteem dropped. Having no close family nearby, I traveled to get away from the pain of being home alone.
My family, however, has been supportive from Day One. My saint of a mother gave me her car, and bought a new one for herself. As selfless as this was, it was not an easy pill for a grown man to swallow, and my family is not exactly of wealthy means. My lesson in humility, which is invaluable, will be with me forever. I thank God that my family is far more concerned about me than about the number of job interviews I've had so far.
And my friends? Most have been supportive, even former colleagues who are still employed. However, a few are much less tolerant of my unemployment status, choosing to ask about the statistics of my job search instead of about my emotional state. 
The bottom line is that there are silver linings in this cloud. I've grown even closer to my family. I've re-evaluated and set my life's priorities. I've learned how to better deal with stress. I've begun participating in activities that I never took time to do before. I've learned how to literally live below my means. And I've learned who my true friends are.

Holiday Travel May Rise

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
Rising gasoline prices? A slowing economy? They are not expected to spoil most Americans' travel plans during the Memorial Day weekend.
 AAA, in fact, is predicting that travel volume next weekend will slightly surpass the record level last year. 
The group's annual Memorial Day holiday survey, released last week, projects that 34.2 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home, compared with a record 34.1 million last year. 
 Most of the travelers, about 28.5 million of them, plan to drive to their destinations, while 5.7 million are expected to travel by airplane, train or bus, according to the survey, conducted by telephone with 1,300 adults nationwide.
"We don't expect today's economic uncertainty and high gas prices to keep travelers from taking their traditional Memorial Day vacations," said Sandra Hughes, a vice president at AAA. "Americans may not be in a big spending mood, but they will be in the mood to travel."

Your Logo on a Fender: Think of It as an Investment

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
It was not as if he thought my checks would bounce, Dean Noble explained politely, or that he suspected that thelipsite.com was really a porn site; it was about the high standards that Joe Gibbs set for himself. Gibbs, the old Super Bowl championship coach turned Nascar championship owner, wanted to be sure that anyone who became one of his sponsors, no matter how peripherally, would come out a winner, too, and would be ready to invest even more up the road.
 My question had been a simple one: How much would it cost to paint my name or logo on the shiny skin of a Gibbs racing car or truck? Noble's answer -- anywhere from $250,000 to $18 million -- was incentive to write faster so I might join the graffiti of this most cheerfully commercial of major American sports entertainments. 
 "I think the reason race fans are so loyal to the brand names on cars is that they understand how critical the sponsors' money is," said Noble, 41, a former banker who is now vice president for business of Joe Gibbs Racing. "Each team is on its own; there's no N.F.L. revenue-sharing. 
"When we lose a sponsor, as we did, you can start flying commercial instead of private, which we haven't done yet, but you can't cut corners on safety or technology or start using worn-out parts and still be competitive. It sounds tacky when Bobby Labonte wins and the first thing he says is, 'My Interstate Batteries Pontiac was running well,' but he's acknowledging part of the team."
My interest was piqued three weeks ago by a flier I picked up at the Talladega Superspeedway, outside Birmingham, Ala. The boldface, all-caps headline read: SPONSORSHIP AVAILABLE JOE GIBBS RACING. This was a surprise. Gibbs, a leader of the pack, runs five racers in three series. Last season, Labonte won the Winston Cup championship and Tony Stewart won the most Winston Cup races (six).
The car being offered for sponsorship was the No. 20 Busch Grand National Pontiac, driven by Mike McLaughlin, a top money-winner in the series one level beneath Winston Cup. Sponsorship promised "cross-promotional opportunities" with such Gibbs sponsors as Home Depot, Coca-Cola, the credit-card company MBNA, and Procter & Gamble Company, and a spot on Gibbs's Web site. For the right "custom designed package," Joe himself might tour your plant and play joke-a-stroke golf with your top executives and clients.
Nascar, which keeps a tight grip on sponsorship, issues financial guidelines. Painting thelipsite.com on the front hood and rear quarter panels (that's the rear doors on a street car) of a Winston Cup car, usually part of the primary sponsor's package, would cost between $7 million and $12 million. The trunk and TV panel (the backside) cost $350,000 to $1.5 million, and the lower rear-quarter panel (behind the tire) goes for between $250,000 and $1 million.
While a Busch deal should cost substantially less, the chance to hobnob with Gibbs, Labonte, Stewart and their corporate friends could be worth a lot, especially if I wanted to insinuate myself into position to write the authorized company biographies of such front-quarter panel sponsors as Moog chassis parts or Goody's headache powders.
Noble chuckled pleasantly. He was not going to blow me off, but he wasn't going to lead me on, either. "We could always do a cheap deal, race by race, but we don't want to go that route," he said. "And, of course, our other sponsors would want to look you over, too.
"We believe it's much easier to grow an existing sponsor than find a new one, so this is an important, long-haul decision."
Except for a small MBNA patch, McLaughlin's uniform is naked, and his car is clean, an object of competitive delight and empathy in the garage area. Bad times lurk at every turn for everyone. As Noble explained it, the No. 20 Busch car's primary sponsor, Porter-Cable, a division of Pentair, manufacturer of power tools and electrical equipment, began laying off workers in Jackson, Tenn., this year. For reasons of cash and image, running a race car seemed a bad idea in this recession, Noble said. An "arrangement to exit" was worked out.
While the sports marketing budget can be vulnerable during a downturn, Bill Armour, who handles corporate relations for Bill Davis Racing, a two-car team, thinks there are other factors at work. The money poured into Winston Cup this season by two new primary sponsors, Pfizer and U.P.S., "upped urgency and expectations" throughout Nascar, he said, and the engine changes in the Busch series raised costs.
Some companies will back off in hard times, Armour said; others will spend more to reach the young males that Nascar's TV exposure can deliver. Geoff Smith, the president of Roush Racing, an eight-car team, thinks that in an unsettled economy there can be even more of a disparity: the richer teams, which typically dominate victory lane, will be able to maintain their programs even as sponsors cut back or fall away. Roush lost John Deere and two dot.coms after last season but replaced them all. The poorer teams, meanwhile, will have no choice but to cut back on testing or new equipment and become even less attractive to sponsors.
"Performance," Smith said, "is a cruel separator."
As cruel, too, is garage talk. Another front-office executive who didn't want to rile a rival said that "there is no blue sky attached to Mike McLaughlin," an older driver with little potential to move up from Busch to Winston Cup. Even the "Joe Gibbs schmooze factor," he said, can't overcome a lack of charisma in a recession.
Meanwhile, thanks to the volume of e-mail to thelipsite@aol.com, I have felt no contraction. I'll be asking Dean Noble if Circuit City, an associate sponsor with a natural fit for my cyber needs, might like to share its patch of Labonte's B-pillar. That's the strip of metal between the two side windows, which usually costs between $75,000 and $200,000.
Talks will run on.

The Series So Far
This is the 11th article in a series following auto racing. Previous articles were about Nascar's appeal to a crossover audience, death on the track, religion under the checkered flag, the world of midget racing and life in the pits with the crew.

HEADLINE: Change in Plutonium Disposal Plan Draws Complaints 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has postponed a major part of the Energy Department's plan to dispose of plutonium left over from nuclear weapons production, because of budget constraints and technical problems.
 But two states, South Carolina and Colorado, are complaining that the decision violates the federal government's agreements with them to clean up nuclear wastes. 
 Five years ago, the Energy Department, which manages the nuclear stockpile, set out to get rid of 52.5 tons of weapons plutonium as part of a deal with Russia, which agreed to remove the same amount from its stockpile. The plan was to convert some of the plutonium from warhead form into fuel for civilian power reactors. 
But much of the plutonium is in forms not suited for fuel, including a large quantity at the Rocky Flats plant, in the suburbs of Denver. The plan was to bake that plutonium into a ceramic to stabilize it and then to embed it in highly radioactive glass, to protect it from being stolen for weapons use. 
The first part of that plan is moving ahead, although the costs of making reactor fuel are uncertain. But instead of immobilizing the rest of the plutonium in glass, the Energy Department now plans to ship it to the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., and seal it in storage containers.
Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina said this violated an agreement with his state.
"They committed that they would not send it to us unless there was a clear exit strategy for the plutonium," Mr. Hodges said.
Recalling that Cecil D. Andrus, then governor of Idaho, threatened to call out the state police in the late 1980's to block a shipment of nuclear waste to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Mr. Hodges said, "We have troopers in South Carolina, too."
In December 1996, when the Energy Department announced its "dual track" approach of conversion to fuel and immobilization, officials said that they were not sure which approach would prove the fastest, easiest or most economical, but that the prudent step was to do both.
That policy has changed. Two top officials of the agency, speaking on the condition that they not be named, said that getting anything done required concentrating all efforts on one approach. 
Conversion to fuel requires two factories, they said: one to take apart the plutonium at the heart of the warheads and another to turn it from metal to oxide and process it into the proper shape. Immobilizing plutonium would require a third factory.
"We're not so sure Congress can support pursuing three significant facilities simultaneously," one of the officials said.
The department estimates that the immobilization work being put off would cost between $500 million and $1 billion.
At a hearing last month, John A. Gordon, the under secretary of energy for nuclear security, noted that the budget request for the Energy Department's weapons program next year was $100 million less than in the current year.
The Energy Department's plans also trouble some officials in Colorado, who are eager to have the department meet its target of shipping all the plutonium at the Rocky Flats factory out of the state by 2006.
Groups that focus on nuclear proliferation are even more concerned. Tom Clements, the executive director of the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, said technical problems could arise with the plan to use plutonium in civilian power reactors; for example, the reactors might have problems being relicensed for the fuel. But, he said, "immobilization could perform the entire mission, and do it cheaper." 
There is a technical problem, however, with the process for embedding the plutonium in highly radioactive glass. The Energy Department built a $2 billion factory at the Savannah River Site to mix radioactive sludge from its aging underground tanks with molten glass, solidifying the sludge and storing it, perhaps eventually in a proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev.
But the glass is not as radioactive as it is supposed to be to prevent anyone from recovering the embedded plutonium. The recipe the agency wanted to use created benzene, a gas that can burn or explode. Until it can solve this problem, the department has changed the recipe, resulting in finished glass that is not radioactive enough.

HEADLINE: Inmate Rehabilitation Returns as Prison Goal 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Todd Ragsdale is serving a 10-year sentence for assault in the Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem, but he still considers himself lucky.
 Mr. Ragsdale is in an advanced computer class, building customized computers for state agencies, and says he expects eventually "to walk out into the world with a real job," making more than $50,000 a year. It is something Mr. Ragsdale could not have dreamed of before he was sent to prison. 
 Mr. Ragsdale is part of an Oregon program to deal with a serious problem confronting the criminal justice system -- the high and growing rates at which released inmates end up back in prison. Oregon and Missouri, followed more tentatively by several other states, have each begun a comprehensive effort to remold offenders, requiring them to work, study or undergo drug and other treatment sessions full time. 
"The bottom line is, we want inmates practicing on the inside what works on the outside," said Steven J. Ickes, an assistant director of the Oregon Department of Corrections, "to try to undo all the bad crime-inducing habits they learned in the years before they got here." 
In a sense, these new programs represent a major shift in thinking about how to run prisons -- a return to the old notion of rehabilitating prisoners, the idea behind the very term "corrections" that lay at the creation of American prisons in the 19th century. 
Rehabilitation was discredited and largely abandoned decades ago in most state prison systems, said Todd Clear, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. 
"With the huge expansion of prisons starting in the 1980's, most prison systems gave up believing they had any responsibility for changing offenders or what happened after offenders were released," Professor Clear said, adding that some academic research contributed to this by concluding that nothing could be done to reduce recidivism.
"The objective became that prisons should be just for punishment," he said, "and politicians competed to see who could make prisons more unpleasant, by taking away things like television and recreation and education classes."
But the pendulum may be swinging back again, in what prison officials like to call re-entry or transition to the community. And states like Oregon give the process a modern twist. For it was an Oregon voter referendum in 1994 mandating that prisoners work as hard -- 40 hours a week -- as the taxpayers who provide their upkeep that supplied the impetus for putting inmates to work. Given this mandate, prison officials called on Oregon business executives for advice about how to run prisons more productively.
And so Oregon turned from historical vocational training for low-paying jobs to comprehensive inmate training for jobs that companies have open, like telemarketing and using computers to map water and tax districts from aerial photographs. To ensure accountability, inmates are tracked by computer 24 hours a day, and are offered what amount to small monthly bonuses for good work or study. Many inmates now leave prison with a professionally printed resume, including a record of classes passed, and letters of recommendation from prison officials.
"For guys whose lives have been way out of control, a resume puts them back in control of their lives," Mr. Ickes said.
In Missouri, which has a similar program, Dora Schriro, director of the State Department of Corrections, sums up the new approach this way: "People ask, 'How much time is enough?' But they should ask, 'How do you want them when they come home?,' " because 97 percent of inmates are eventually released.
As the movement to revive rehabilitation has spread, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Washington State have also begun programs, though less comprehensive.
Texas, which has the country's second-largest prison system, with 150,000 inmates, has also made rehabilitation a central goal since 1995, said Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, with a requirement that every inmate do a full day's work. Mandatory schooling is required for inmates with less than a seventh-grade education.
Many Texas inmates still work in old-style prison jobs, like stamping license plates, and the state's program does not emphasize inmates' success on the outside as much as Oregon's does. But, Mr. Castlebury said, "What we hope is that we are teaching the work ethic." 
Inmates who refuse to work are not allowed to watch television or buy items in the canteen, he said.
The Oregon program, for men and women, begins upon an inmate's arrival with a battery of tests to identify the mental, social or educational barriers the inmate may face. A detailed plan is then worked out to help the inmate overcome these troubles through literacy programs, drug treatment or job training.
"We try to be outcome-based, like a good business," Mr. Ickes said.
The 1994 measure specified that the work by inmates reduce the cost of prisons to the state government. So, for example, 16 inmates sitting like telemarketers in office cubicles are answering callers' questions to the Department of Motor Vehicles or the secretary of state's office, saving the cost of state employees.
"What makes this so phenomenal," said Mr. Ragsdale, the inmate, as he assembled a computer, "is that a few years ago a guy walking out of here had nowhere to go and no job skills, so they often ended up coming right back to prison.
"At least here they had everything they needed: food, clothes, a bed and their friends."
Now, he said, "There is a waiting list to get into the class, and when guys are accepted, they have to make a commitment to be on a team, or they are out, permanently, even for playing a computer game."
Signs already suggest that the Oregon program is working, state officials say. The percentage of inmates admitted to Oregon prisons in 2000 who were returning parolees was only 25 percent, down from 47 percent in 1995.
Inmate behavior in Oregon's 13 prisons has also improved, prison officials say. Because a disciplinary report can lead to automatic expulsion from the most coveted work assignments -- like the computer program -- there has been a 60 percent reduction since 1995 in major disciplinary reports, including for fighting or attempted escape.
Also, because admission to some of the best prison jobs and classes requires a high school diploma or its equivalent, Oregon's inmates are now completing G.E.D.'s after an average of only 1.5 starts, down from 8.5 starts before 1995. Over all, Oregon prisons have a higher rate of G.E.D. completion than the 17 community colleges in the state that offer the instruction, Mr. Ickes noted.
But Oregon has not yet found a way to gauge perhaps the most important measure of the success of its new program -- how quickly inmates find jobs and how long they hold them. It has been difficult getting money from the State Legislature to set up a tracking system, prison officials say, though they hope to have a system in place soon.
Finding ways to ease the return to society and reduce recidivism "is the hot topic in the criminal justice system, because of the huge costs and numbers involved," said Michael Jacobson, a professor of criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former director of New York City's Department of Correction. 
About 614,000 people will be released from state and federal prisons this year, said Allen J. Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the Justice Department. Within three years, based on studies he has done, Mr. Beck said, 62 percent of them will be arrested again, and 41 percent will be sent back to prison.
In California alone, Professor Jacobson said, about 70,000 people, 75 percent of the state's total number of parolees, are sent back to prison each year for parole violations, like failing drug tests, for periods averaging five and a half months. These inmates take up about 20 percent of all the state prison beds each year, he said, costing California $1 billion.
In the 1990's, when the economy was hot and tax revenue high, politicians could ignore these costs, Professor Jacobson said. But tax revenue is down, and voters want more money spent on education, he said.
"So there is a new environment for looking at how to save money on prisons," and one of the easiest ways, without having to soften popular tough sentencing laws, is to reduce recidivism, he said.
Since the prison boom began in 1980, quadrupling the number of inmates in jails and prisons to two million, the recycling of criminals through prisons has gotten worse. The percentage of inmates admitted to prison who had been there before rose to 36.4 percent in 1998, from 18 percent in 1980, Mr. Beck said.
Still, some prison guards view rehabilitation programs as taxpayer money wasted on criminals, and some labor leaders worry that inmates are taking union jobs.
But in Oregon, even some people in the tough-on-crime camp say they like the state's new approach. Steve Doell, the president of Crime Victims United of Oregon, whose 12-year-old daughter was killed walking home from a school bus stop, said: 
"The thing people need to know is that most of these folks in prison are eventually going to come out again. So we think it's smart policy to try to change them while they're locked up, so that when they return to society there will be fewer victims on the street."

HEADLINE: A Changing Climate In Ideas About Pollution; 
New Research on Region's Air Quality Presents a More Complicated Picture

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The air in the New York region is not what it used to be, and for the most part that's a good thing. Over the 30 years since the passage of the federal Clean Air Act, pollutants like lead, carbon monoxide and especially the gritty black soot that was long one of the region's most hallowed, if hated, symbols, have all sharply declined. The number of days each summer with the most severe ozone smog is typically no more than a third of what it was in the early 1980's.
 At the same time, it became a lot easier to shift the blame elsewhere for the problems that did remain. The industrial Midwest, with its coal-burning factories and power plants, all wafting their toxic fumes east on the prevailing upper air currents, became a handy shorthand for the idea that poor little New York was the victim of someone else's excess. 
 But many scientists and air quality experts say that more and more, the old patterns and assumptions and lines of responsibility about air quality no longer tell the whole story. Some believe that the best years of improvement may be over. Most agree that at the very least, the picture will grow increasingly complicated, as issues ranging from power plant construction to climate change to new ways and ideas for measuring pollution all unfold in the years and decades to come. 
The air that local residents are breathing this spring, the experts say, is already being considered as a kind of case study for the new air-quality equation. For example, in early May -- much earlier in the year than normal -- a sudden surge of hot, humid weather helped create ground-level ozone smog across the region, just as tree pollen was setting records and causing untold headaches for hay fever sufferers.
Unrelated events? The new air science says maybe not. The pollen resulted from a cool early spring followed by a blast of premature summer; the trees reacted to the heat wave with a reflexive spasm of procreation. But new research has also shown that pollen production may be linked in a perverse way to climate change because higher levels of carbon dioxide -- a primary greenhouse gas blamed for planetary warming -- encourage trees to produce more pollen. 
If the meteorological mood swings of April and May were in fact a sign of long-term climate disruption, and not ordinary variability -- still a debatable point among scientists -- then suddenly, nothing about the air looks quite the same. The pollen count itself, once a natural, if annoying, rite of spring, has become tied to human dependence on fossil fuels.
As if that were not enough, recent research has also found that pollen can bind itself to diesel exhaust particles, creating a sort of bio-industrial cocktail. Health consequences of the pollen-diesel combination, if any, remain uncertain, scientists say. 
"What we're seeing is a confluence of issues," said Dr. Paul R. Epstein, the associate director for health and global environment at Harvard Medical School.
Worries about air quality were only part of the agenda for President Bush as he took to the road last week to sell his energy plan to the nation. But many environmentalists say that because the president's energy plan is so weighted toward new production of electricity and petroleum, environmental consequences have been drawn into the spotlight as well, creating the opportunity for a broad public debate that did not exist before.
Meanwhile, some other, older ideas about the environment and air quality are being blown apart entirely. Much new air pollution research is based on the idea that there is no such thing as a regional air supply as it has been traditionally defined, but rather a series of microclimates, differing neighborhood by neighborhood and street by street. Each individual, some research suggests, carries around a personalized cloud of contaminants depending on his or her environment, lifestyle and consumer-products choices -- dubbed the Pig Pen effect, in honor of the famously unbathed character from the "Peanuts" comic strip.
The new focus is on what people actually breathe -- walking around, working, exercising, living their lives -- rather than on what is measured on high-rise rooftops, where most sensors in New York City have usually been placed, even though only pigeons live there.
Two years ago, for example, scientists from Columbia University and Harvard took 40 student volunteers from A. Philip Randolph High School in Harlem and fitted them with special air-sensor backpacks.
The students were asked to wear the six-pound devices, or keep them nearby, even when they were asleep, for 48 hours, wherever they went and whatever they did. The results are still being assessed, said Steven N. Chillrud, an associate research scientist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who led the fieldwork portion of the study, but the early and unquestioned conclusion is that even from one block to the next, the air is different depending on where you breathe it.
"Central monitoring doesn't pick up the full range of exposures for many compounds, and personal exposures are higher still," said Dr. John D. Spengler, a professor of environmental health and human habitation at the Harvard School of Public Health, which is analyzing part of the backpack results. "It's these interactions that we're just beginning to appreciate."
Other investigators are challenging assumptions about where pollution in New York comes from. The conventional explanation of lead in the atmosphere, for example, held that it came mainly from leaded gasoline. In studies around the country, the historical curve was strikingly similar. Leaded gas reached its peak use in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and lead in the air began declining after that period as cars switched over to unleaded gas.
But a recent research project that used core samples of mud taken from the Lake in Central Park showed a different pattern altogether. The study, conducted by researchers from Columbia, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, concluded that garbage incineration in the city had been a major contributor to the lead problem.
The core samples showed high lead levels in New York's air dating all the way back to the 1930's. When the city halted new incinerator construction in 1964, and later federal air pollution laws pushed most existing incinerators to close, the city's lead levels began to decline. In other words, forget the upper air patterns from Ohio or the traffic jams on the New Jersey Turnpike -- the city had at least partly made its own mess. 
The concept of local neighborhood pollution is also emerging as a major political battlefield as residents around the region begin asking questions, and filing lawsuits, challenging plans for new power plants in their communities.
And researchers are scratching their heads over many of the same questions as the residents. How do pollutants from many different sources, especially those clustered in a single community, interact in the air and in the human body? If there are three or four factories or power plants in a neighborhood, is it possible that each one individually may be in perfect compliance on air emissions, but that collectively, they are not? How do you measure the urban world's total impact on one person? And how, especially, do you write policy rules to protect the public health when these questions begin to be answered?
"A place-based approach to air quality regulation, that's the next horizon," said Jason Grumet, the executive director of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an interstate association of the air quality control divisions of the six New England states and New York and New Jersey.
Ultimately, many scientists and public health experts say, the real risk to the New York region is that it will essentially outgrow its existing air quality system. Ray Werner, the chief of the local air programs branch at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, calls this problem "lines of tension." Like a giant ratchet, tighter air quality rules are grinding up against the reality of a region that has boomed economically and grown in population.
The impact of cleaner gasoline, Mr. Werner said, has been offset by more vehicles on the roads, including more sport utility vehicles and light trucks, which pollute the air more than ordinary cars. Cleaner technologies for making electricity using natural gas are countered by the need to build more power plants.
The concept of the tension lines repeats itself again and again. Conservation groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council have contended that if new, cleaner electrical power plants replace older oil-burning ones, they could mean cleaner air for the region. But state officials and administrators of the state power grid, who are responsible for keeping the lights on, have taken steps to allow small private diesel generators -- dirtier electricity sources than anything now operating in the region -- to be switched on at moments of electricity shortage beginning this summer.
"Right now we're the marble in the middle of the seesaw," said Peter Lehner, the chief of the environmental protection bureau at the New York State attorney general's office. "Our air quality could go one way or it could go the other. The answer depends on how we respond."

HEADLINE: Taliban's Ban On Poppy A Success, U.S. Aides Say 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 18 

 BODY:
The first American narcotics experts to go to Afghanistan under Taliban rule have concluded that the movement's ban on opium-poppy cultivation appears to have wiped out the world's largest crop in less than a year, officials said today. 
 The American findings confirm earlier reports from the United Nations drug control program that Afghanistan, which supplied about three-quarters of the world's opium and most of the heroin reaching Europe, had ended poppy planting in one season. 
 But the eradication of poppies has come at a terrible cost to farming families, and experts say it will not be known until the fall planting season begins whether the Taliban can continue to enforce it.
"It appears that the ban has taken effect," said Steven Casteel, assistant administrator for intelligence at the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington. 
The findings came in part from a Pakistan-based agent of the administration who was one of the two Americans on the team just returned from eight days in the poppy-growing areas of Afghanistan.
Mr. Casteel said in an interview today that he was still studying aerial images to determine if any new poppy-growing areas had emerged. He also said that some questions about the size of hidden opium and heroin stockpiles near the northern border of Afghanistan remained to be answered. But the drug agency has so far found nothing to contradict United Nations reports.
The sudden turnaround by the Taliban, a move that left international drug experts stunned when reports of near-total eradication began to come in earlier this year, opens the way for American aid to the Afghan farmers who have stopped planting poppies. 
On Thursday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell announced a $43 million grant to Afghanistan in additional emergency aid to cope with the effects of a prolonged drought. The United States has become the biggest donor to help Afghanistan in the drought.
"We will continue to look for ways to provide more assistance to the Afghans," he said in a statement, "including those farmers who have felt the impact of the ban on poppy cultivation, a decision by the Taliban that we welcome." 
The Afghans are desperate for international help, but describe their opposition to drug cultivation purely in religious terms. 
At the State Department, James P. Callahan, director of Asian affairs at the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs who was one of the experts sent to Afghanistan, described in an interview how the Taliban had applied and enforced the ban. He was told by farmers that "the Taliban used a system of consensus-building." 
They framed the ban "in very religious terms," citing Islamic prohibitions against drugs, and that made it hard to defy, he added. Those who defied the edict were threatened with prison.
Mr. Callahan said that in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, where the Taliban's hold is strongest, farmers said they would rather starve than return to poppy cultivation -- and some of them will, experts say.
In parts of Nangahar province in the east, where the Taliban's hold is less complete, farmers told the visiting experts that they would flee to Pakistan or risk illegal crops rather than watch their families die. 
The end of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has come at a huge cost to farmers, Mr. Callahan and Mr. Casteel said. The rural economy, especially in the usual opium-poppy areas, had come to rely on the narcotics trade. "The bad side of the ban is that it's bringing their country -- or certain regions of their country -- to economic ruin," Mr. Casteel said. "They are trying to replace the crop with wheat, but that is easier said than done." 
"Wheat needs more water and earns no money until it is sold," Mr. Casteel said. "With the opium trade they used to get their money up front." 
The Taliban, who used to collect taxes on the movement of opium, is also losing money, adding another layer of difficulty for a government that is already isolated and not recognized diplomatically by most nations. 
Afghanistan is now under United Nations sanctions, imposed at the insistence of the United States because the Islamic movement will not turn over Osama bin Laden for trial in connection with attacks on two American Embassies in Africa in 1998. 
American experts and United Nations officials say the Taliban are likely to face political problems if the effects of the opium ban are catastrophic and many people die.

HEADLINE: 2 Years Later, Harlem Still Waits for a Supermarket It Needs 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Nearly two years after the city selected developers to build Central Harlem's first full-size supermarket at 145th Street and Bradhurst Avenue, the site remains empty. Two years is hardly a long time when zoning or not-in-my-backyard issues are involved, but in this case, no such thing stood in the way.
 Instead, a project that community leaders say is badly needed has been stalled in part by a political campaign reminiscent of the bitter 1995 fight over the Pathmark in East Harlem, when owners of medium-sized supermarkets in the neighborhood tried to keep out a large competitor. The developers say the project has also suffered because the only two supermarket chains that were interested in the site, first Pathmark and then Big V Supermarkets, the owners of ShopRite stores, withdrew from consideration and then sought bankruptcy protection. 
 Pathmark, now reorganized as a public company, has recently breathed life into the project by once again considering building a 42,000-square-foot store on the Bradhurst site. But the company says the development team -- led by the Related Companies, which is building a retail and entertainment complex at Columbus Circle -- must lower the rent from $30 a square foot to about $20 a square foot, which is what they are paying in East Harlem. To do that, the developers say they will either have to get a $5 million low-interest government loan or raise the price of the 126 condominiums, planned to go for $175,000 up to $295,000, that are part of the $42 million project.
In their bid for a public subsidy, however, the developers have encountered a major roadblock: Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, whose support is crucial for the project to get financing from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a $300 million program intended to foster local economic development. Mr. Washington has resisted freeing up money for the project, and instead he has thrown his support behind Matthew and Mauricio Fernandez, brothers who own seven smaller grocery stores in Harlem and who have said they want to move up to the next level.
"I would like, where it's possible, to see people in that community being able to take advantage of the empowerment zone," said Mr. Washington, the chairman of a board made up of federal, state and city officials whose approval is necessary for empowerment zone grants and loans. The Fernandezes also have the support of Latino politicians outside the neighborhood, including State Senator Olga A. Mendez, who represents East Harlem and part of the Bronx and Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat of Inwood.
Working on behalf of the Fernandezes is Richard Lipsky, the lobbyist who organized the campaign that nearly derailed the East Harlem Pathmark. Mr. Lipsky complains that the Bradhurst developers have been unwilling to negotiate with his clients. Mr. Lipsky argues that the Fernandez brothers deserve to get the site because their father, Mateo Fernandez, a Dominican immigrant, took a chance on Harlem and began opening stores there after the big chains fled to the suburbs. The brothers took over after his death in 1996.
But Gregory O. Watson, the chief operating officer of Harlem Congregations for Community Development, a nonprofit organization that is part of the development team, said that the Fernandezes first offered to pay only $12 a square foot for the supermarket space. They have failed to respond to a request to revise their plans, Mr. Watson said, suggesting that they are not serious about opening a new store but merely want to protect their 12,000-square-foot Pioneer store on 145th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.
Mr. Lipsky denied that his clients were trying to block the Bradhurst store, but said that they would prefer to own the space rather than lease it.
Community Board 10, which represents the Bradhurst area, has not taken an official position on the supermarket. But the chairman, Stanley Gleaton, said that the Fernandez brothers' stores got mixed reviews from residents. He said that after some residents visited ShopRite's Mount Vernon store, the chain became the community's first choice for Bradhurst. "Ideally, I would like to see a viable chain there," he said.
A Big V vice president, Stephen L. Hittman, said his company decided to withdraw from the project several months before it filed for bankruptcy protection in November. "We liked the location, but it was a somewhat unusual configuration," he said.
Similarly, a senior vice president of Pathmark, Harvey Gutman, said his company's bankruptcy had nothing to do with its original decision to back out of Bradhurst. "We passed because of logistical and cost issues," he said. "We and Related are working hard to improve both of those."
Mr. Washington's unwillingness to free up empowerment zone money for the supermarket has put him at odds with city housing officials. Since 1994, the city has built 2,129 units of housing in the Bradhurst area. Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the supermarket was key to her agency's plan to provide a "full-service community" where residents can live, shop and work. "We'd very much like the empowerment zone to participate, but we're committed to the Bradhurst project," she said. "We're not going to abandon it. We're committed to finding funding elsewhere."
Bruce A. Beal, a senior vice president of Related, said his company was also determined to build a supermarket. "It will be the spark that will help everything around it," he said, "and show that development in this neighborhood is feasible and hopefully encourage other developers to follow."

HEADLINE: Buffalo Journal; 
A Striped Parade Comes for the Chicken

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
Theories abound as to why skunks are suddenly sweet on Buffalo.
 The skunks arrived after being displaced from once-pastoral towns in the grip of a building boom at the city's border. They started pawing garbage cans when railroad tracks in the city were torn up to make way for housing -- or was it when a former dog food plant was torn down? Others say it's the raccoons, stupid, arguing that a recent drop in the raccoon population cleared the way for skunks. 
 Frank L. Poincelot, the head pest control and wildlife officer for the City of Buffalo, who once had a pet skunk named Herbie (more on that later), acknowledges all of the above. But he offers a more whimsical hypothesis. He insists that skunks are drawn to the same finger food that put Buffalo on the culinary map. 
"A skunk will eat anything from mice to rats to bugs, but they love chicken wings," he said, with just a trace of facetiousness.
Mr. Poincelot should know. In what has been the worst skunk season in modern memory, he has trapped and destroyed 45 skunks since Feb. 1, using mainly chicken meat and chicken fat for bait. (One skunk would come only for strawberry shortcake.)
Buffalo does not need this now. The city is already smarting from a population drain, and the Buffalo area has one of the highest unemployment rates among major metropolitan regions in the country. But New York State's second-largest city is nonetheless wearing an unmistakably musky cologne these days, particularly in the more modest neighborhoods on the city's west side.
It is a searing aroma, pleasantly associated, in some minds anyway, with balmy nighttime drives through an inky countryside. But in the scrappy neighborhoods where chain-link fences delineate postage-stamp yards, and people plop upholstered couches on listing front porches, the smell is not fleeting, and residents wish it would go away.
Nursing a beer in a corner bar on a recent weekday morning, Martha Benjamin, 55, who lives in the Black Rock neighborhood, said she had armed herself with a can of lilac air freshener, kept by her bedside. "I see the skunks at least three times a week in my backyard," she said, "and the smell goes right into the bedroom." 
Kimberly Hall, 23, who also lives in Black Rock and works in a local day care center, had another, but less effective, weapon: tomato soup. After her German shepherd got into a dust-up with a skunk, she maneuvered him into the bathtub and doused him with 12 cans of tomato soup. "It really didn't work," she recalled. (Mr. Poincelot and other experts say a solution of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and liquid detergent is, if not a magic bullet, more effective than tomatoes.)
Like other Black Rock residents, James F. Strach noticed an uptick in the number of skunks after the demolition of a nearby dog food plant a few years back. Since November, when an abandoned house across the street from his home began attracting illegal dumpers, Mr. Strach has seen even more.
"I've been here 57 years, and I intend to die here," said Mr. Strach, a retired store-window designer. "It's not that I dislike skunks. But I don't like them hanging around my neighborhood because it indicates decay and decline."
Other sections of Buffalo that have proved attractive to skunks include the University and Riverside neighborhoods. "Skunk complaints are outnumbering rat complaints by 3 to 1," bemoaned Betty Jean Grant, a city councilwoman who represents the University district. "People see them at 5 in the morning walking across the street, lined up according to size. It's like a parade."
What most people fear is the spray, an oily, yellowish liquid squirted by the skunk when provoked. "It's toxic," Mr. Poincelot said. "It can take your breath away and burn your skin and eyes. Skunks have excellent aim. When that tail comes up and they look at you, you're already hit." 
Skunks, like rats, are attracted to garbage, whether piled in vacant lots or tied up in flimsy plastic bags left at the curb. The three neighborhoods with the worst skunk problem are also among the last to benefit from a city program to blanket Buffalo with special vermin-proof garbage cans: 95-gallon containers on wheels, with tight-fitting lids.
Mr. Poincelot said the city would finally distribute cans to residents in those areas by July 1. "It will make a huge difference for the entire city of Buffalo," he said. In the meantime, Mr. Poincelot and the nine people on his rodent-control team are bracing for late June, when the recent breeding season comes to fruition.
The baby skunks will pose a quandary for Mr. Poincelot, a former zoo keeper at the Buffalo Zoo who says it pains him to kill anything. After trapping adult skunks, he gasses them with carbon dioxide. But he takes a more humane approach with the young. "Most of the time," he said, "I release the little kids 20 or 30 miles out of Buffalo on state lands."
Mr. Poincelot may be the only rodent-control officer in the country with a soft spot for skunks. He owned Herbie, a pet skunk whose scent glands had been removed, for four years in the early 1970's. "They're really cute and make damn good pets," he said. "He used to sleep in bed with me."

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT; 
Personal Watercraft Stirring Debate

BYLINE:  By HERB McCORMICK; Herb McCormick is the editor of Cruising World magazine.

 BODY:
Considering the factions each represents, the two adversaries share surprising common ground. The lawyer who lobbies on behalf of the personal watercraft industry in Washington and the San Francisco-based ecologist who is on the frontline in limiting certain waterway access to what he calls "thrill craft" are both sailors.
 Monita Fontaine, the executive director of the Personal Watercraft Industry Association, has crossed the Atlantic Ocean and logged some 20,000 miles aboard her custom 34-foot wood sailboat, Hither, Thither and Gone. 
 Dr. Russell Long, the executive director of the environmental organization Bluewater Network, is a veteran America's Cup skipper, a lifelong ocean racer, and the holder of several sailing speed records aboard his hydrofoil-equipped multihull, Longshot. 
During phone interviews last week, it was clear that both Fontaine and Long share a strong affinity for the water. But when it comes to who can play on it and how -- particularly in the national parks system -- they are diametrically opposed.
From sections of Biscayne Bay in Florida to the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest, and in numerous places in between, personal watercraft riders are currently denied access to many waters for a variety of issues including safety and pollution. 
Fontaine contends that personal watercraft, or Jet Skis, are getting a bad rap. "Today's P.W.C.'s are cleaner and quieter than ever before," she said. "They're convenient, affordable and economical, and a great way for families to get out on the water."
But Long sees it another way. "In terms of boating-related injuries, P.W.C.'s are far more dangerous than any craft we've ever seen on U.S. waters," he said. "That's before you examine the water, air and noise pollution issues."
In recent weeks fresh fuel was poured over the frequently heated personal watercraft debate after published remarks and related action by Secretary of the Interior Gail Norton concerning the use of the craft in the national parks.
In March 2000, the National Park Service published a regulation banning personal watercraft in 66 of its 87 parks. Later, the 21 remaining parks became the subject of a federal lawsuit filed against the park service by Long's Bluewater Network seeking an across-the-board ban. In the terms of an out-of court settlement with the park service reached last December, personal watercraft in those parks will also be banned in September 2002, if the individual parks fail to complete and pass an environmental impact study on the effects of continued Jet Ski usage.
But earlier this month, citing "red flags" about how the bans in those 21 parks were instituted, Norton temporarily lifted the restriction in four parks: Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina; Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania and New Jersey; Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in Indiana and Cumberland Island in Georgia.
"My understanding is that the Jet Ski industry has been raising hue and cry over the settlement and has specifically targeted Gail Norton to re-open a number of parks including these four," Long said. "I could definitely see her trying to reverse the Jet Ski regulations."
On the other hand, Fontaine believes that the basis of the settlement -- the individual environmental assessments -- fits a continuing pattern of unfairness. "I don't know if the N.P.S. will be able to afford such an undertaking," she said, referring to the park service. 
"It will be expensive," she added. "And isn't it tragic that instead of those moneys going to improve facilities, or hire more Park Rangers, that taxpayers will be paying for studies that quite frankly will be most difficult to carry out but will prove that the latest P.W.C.'s are superior to other vessels."
Ultimately, assuming the regulation as outlined goes forth without interference, both Fontaine and Long agree that it will most likely come down to the individual superintendents to respond, or not, at their respective parks. Some will simply fail to act and accept the ban. Others, particularly in popular Western personal watercraft waters such as Lake Powell and Lake Mead, will proceed with strong local support.
When putting forth their arguments, both Long and Fontaine also speak of what many hold true as fundamental American tenets. 
"The national parks have the highest protection mandate of all our public lands," Long said. "They're different. There should be a place where people can escape from the stresses and craziness of modern life. By allowing Jet Skis unbridled access to these unique places you give away a fundamental right to these important values."
Fontaine said: "The lockout crowd wants to establish what the appropriate use is for our national parks. It's their vision, not the American vision. These parks were set up for recreation, for Americans to take their families and get away from their computers and televisions and be outside together and play."
The issue is clearly conflicted. Further information is available on the Web sites for Fontaine's and Long's organizations: www.pwia.org and www.bluewaternetwork.org.
Long and Fontaine may have sailing in common, but the issues on the personal watercraft matter are far from resolved. Until they are, the river between them will remain wide and deep.

HEADLINE: French Trains: Fast and Faster 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER 

 BODY:
AAH, springtime in Paris. Sidewalk cafes, music in the air -- and day after day of rain. Luckily, Parisians will soon get relief from one of the wettest years on record. It comes in the form of a new high-speed rail line that will chop more than an hour off travel times from Paris to such sunny southern cities as Nice, Cannes, Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Avignon. 
 The $3.5 billion TGV Mediterranee is really just a 156-mile extension of an existing line that stretches south from Paris beyond Lyon. But it will complete a high-speed link from the English Channel to the Mediterranean, allowing seamless service at 186 miles an hour. 
 The 490 miles from Paris to Marseille -- roughly the distance between Boston and Richmond, Va. -- will be covered in only 3 hours 9 minutes, down from the current 4 hours 20 minutes. From Marseille, trains will continue to run east over conventional tracks, at lower speeds, to destinations along the Cote d'Azur.
The rail line could be bad news for Air France, which dominates domestic travel. The airline acknowledges that it could lose up to 25 percent of its business on Paris-Marseille flights, which take just over an hour. The French national railways, known as SNCF, predict that the market share for the plane vs. train to destinations served by the new line will be reversed from the present 60-40 in favor of air. 
To fight back, Air France briefly cut fares on the Paris-Marseilles route and several others served by the new TGV to as little as $70 for travel this summer. By contrast, the first-class off-peak fare for a Paris-Marseille round trip on the new TGV is $110 (second class is $84), though reductions of 25 and 50 percent are common. 
In addition to speeding up the trains, the SNCF is adding more, to encourage business travelers to use the Paris-Marseille route for one-day round trips. 
Not long ago a business traveler planning a trip to Marseille, known for off-duty sailors, organized crime and soccer, might have been eyed with suspicion. But a rising economic tide in the south of France, led by high technology and pharmaceutical industries, has lifted Marseille's boats as well. 
A more popular destination for many American visitors is Aix-en-Provence. The elegant Provencal city will have its train travel times from Paris the most sharply reduced of any destination on the way south. Previously, travelers had to go first to Marseille for a change of train and a total time of about five hours. On the new line, routed through Aix, the time from Paris is just 2 hours 54 minutes. 
In part because of the prospect of a shorter weekend commute for well-to-do Parisians, prices of second homes in the region are said to be rising sharply. 
Faster transportation links will presumably contribute to the growing crowds along the Riviera. But in the image-conscious region, that means the possibilities for seeing and being seen will only get better, said Brigitte Renaud-Wolter in the tourism office at Aix-en-Provence. "Some people want to be able to sit and watch people walk by, to critique their clothes."

Tracy White, Lakshman Achuthan

 BODY:
Tracy Ann White and Lakshman Radh Achuthan were married last night in Lewisboro, N.Y., at a house owned by the bride's parents, Shelby White and Leon Levy of New York. Rabbi Jon Haddon performed the ceremony.
 Ms. White, who is keeping her name, is a senior producer for Trackers.net, an Oxygen Media site for teenage girls. She is also the creator of "Traced," an online autobiographical animated short that is also shown on the Oxygen cable television channel. She is a member of the board of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. She graduated from Columbia and received a master's degree in professional studies from New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Department. 
 The bride's parents are philanthropists known for their collection of antiquities. The bride's mother is a member of the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Botanical Garden, and is also a freelance journalist and the author of "What Every Woman Should Know About Her Husband's Money." 
Mr. Levy is the chairman of the Oppenheimer Funds, the New York mutual fund management firm that is a successor company to Oppenheimer & Company, in which he had been a partner. He is also the chairman of Avatar Inc., a real estate company in Coral Gables, Fla., and president of the Institute for Advanced Studies, a private nonprofit organization for studies in physics, mathematics, philosophy and social studies in Princeton, N.J. The bride was adopted by Mr. Levy. Her biological father, the late Rodney White, was also a partner in Oppenheimer & Company.
The bridegroom is the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in Manhattan, which forecasts national and international business and inflation cycles. He is also on the advisory board of the New York City Office of Management and Budget. He graduated from Fairleigh Dickenson University and received an M.B.A. from the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. His mother, Joy Mayfield, lives and practices psychotherapy in Wainscott, N.Y. His father, Dr. Radh Achuthan of Southhampton, N.Y., is a professor of physics at the L.I.U. campus there.
Ms. White and Mr. Achuthan met in January 1999 when a mutual friend invited them for dinner at Bar Pitti, an Italian restaurant in SoHo.
"We learned that we had missed meeting each other many times over the years," Mr. Achuthan said.
Both had attended the Putney School, a private boarding school in Putney, Vt., but Mr. Achuthan was two years ahead of Ms. White. A few years later, they narrowly missed meeting at Columbia, where Ms. White was attending the undergraduate school and Mr. Achuthan was a research economist at the Center for International Business Cycle Research at the business school. Two years later, Ms. White had just left a job as the assistant to the producer of "Debates/Debates," a nationally syndicated public affairs program, when Mr. Achuthan joined the program and became a regular guest.
"It took us a few years," Ms. White said, "but when we finally met, it was at the right time and in the right place."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-20-01; 
Lights, Camera, Strike!

BYLINE:  By George Packer; George Packer is the author of "The Village of Waiting" and, most recently, "Blood of the Liberals."

 BODY:
When the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers settled on a tentative three-year contract earlier this month, a nation of entertainment consumers breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks to the work of able negotiators, the citizens of the Republic were spared an undue wait for the next teen gross-out flick, and no executive order was required from President Bush to avert the substitution of reality programming for evening dramas. 
 A curious thing has happened in the past few years: say the word "strike" and you're more likely to think of an expensively dressed member of the N.B.A. Players Association or the Screen Actors Guild than the smudged face of a coal miner. Labor action, to judge by its coverage in the media, has gone so far upscale that it now comes under the heading of entertainment news, with an entirely new vocabulary of industrial relations. One no longer hears much talk of those old staples, wages and benefits. In the case of actors and writers, the grievances revolve around six-figure salaries and a thing called "residuals." During the basketball and baseball strikes of the 1990's, the relevant terms were "salary cap" and "revenue sharing." The workers who showed the most bargaining clout in the past year have been the six members of the International Brotherhood of Situation Comedy Actors, "Friends" Local, who demanded a raise and got $750,000 apiece per episode. 
 Without denying athletes and entertainers their rightful share of the staggering profits they help produce, it is worth asking what the new face of labor -- Patrick Ewing's, Harry Hamlin's -- says about our culture's attitude toward work and pay. The amount of attention given a strike reflects the kind of jobs society regards as truly essential. Once, headlines were made and presidents intervened when steel and coal strikes threatened to disrupt vital national industries. A few years ago, President Clinton tried to mediate the baseball strike. The essential work of our time is the film script, the TV commercial, the split-finger fastball and the slam dunk.
At some point toward the end of the 20th century, the working-class hero died. A certain prestige once attached to labor, even to the worst paid and dirtiest work. "Blue collar" denoted half the entire culture, with its own customs and habits and diversions, its vices and its heroism. In the age before it was covered by "Entertainment Tonight," labor unrest was a drama played out by desperate people facing off against cops with sticks raised. Many Americans feared or even hated the unruly mob, but they were at least aware, whenever it rose up, that their lives depended on labor. Even antilabor violence was a sort of backhanded tribute: Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford noticed the people who worked for them, if only to shoot and club them into submission.
After 1950 or so, unions began to lose their cachet, first through success -- partnerships with big business, ever-expanding contracts, enough cash for large-scale corruption -- and then through failure, as the unionized work force fell from 29 percent of the private sector in 1970 to 12 percent in 1992 and entire industries shut down or moved overseas. Liberal intellectuals who once cast their moral lot with Joe Hill felt no solidarity with the hawkish George Meany, let alone the racist Archie Bunker, and moved on to other causes. By the beginning of the 1990's, there were no more workers -- everyone was a contractor.
The recent high-profile labor disputes in sports and entertainment have restored the notion that industrial relations are adversarial. They haven't resurrected the worker as hero, though; if anything, they have created the impression that labor actions are contests between two equally overpaid, out-of-touch groups, that the strike is the moral equivalent of a technical foul. And perhaps, by association, they make the grievances of America's other workers -- those arguing for an increase of a dollar an hour in wages instead of $1.3 million in residuals -- seem a little less legitimate, if not altogether invisible.
Here is a phenomenon just as strange as the 39-percent-tax-bracket striker: a whole new economy of workers has begun to form unions and even, occasionally, to go on strike, but we almost never hear about them. They aren't miners or steelworkers, but janitors, food service workers, industrial launderers, home health aides. They recently appeared on the national radar screen when a student sit-in at Harvard drew attention to the fact that a university with a $20 billion endowment pays part of its work force less than it can live on. The press took note, the university negotiated and perhaps Harvard's dining hall staff and janitors will see their wages raised. If so, it is because the country's most privileged young people, with the backing of stars like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, took up their cause. Does anyone imagine that Harvard's working poor could have won over the media and brought the university to heel on their own?
Service workers don't occupy a place in the public imagination or the hierarchy of social worth, not even the place once reserved for factory workers. There is no perceived nobility in smearing cream cheese on a bagel, no storied subculture of emptying bedpans. Most of us don't really want to know what makes our civilization possible. We live with a kind of illusion in which hotel rooms somehow clean themselves. Strikes are little eruptions from below, announcing the human foundation that most people walk on without giving it a thought. In the age of reality TV, all-sports cable and stars on strike, it is easier than ever to imagine that we walk on air.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Alternative To a Tax Cut: A Revitalized Public Sector

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
GO back through all the writings on capitalism, back to Adam Smith, and a bedrock principle asserts itself repeatedly. It is that government provides services the private sector cannot provide as well or will not provide at all. Building airports and putting satellites into space are obvious examples. So is financing unemployment insurance. Yet in the current debate over tax cuts versus budget spending, this principle is ignored. 
 The nation, as a result, is being locked into a $1.35 trillion tax cut over the next decade without ever hearing a discussion in Congress of how the government might have spent that money if there were no tax cut. Context is lacking. There is much debate over keeping the tax cut small enough to preserve the budget surplus or big enough initially to stimulate a weak economy. But no one insists on considering the many ways that government spending might be better than a tax cut in bringing Americans greater well-being in the decade ahead. 
 "They are debating arithmetic instead of political economy," said William Niskanen, chairman of the conservative Cato Institute.
There are exceptions, of course, to the bipartisan skittishness toward public spending and Big Government. The most outspoken lately is Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat. In a recent speech, he reviewed the host of ways in which government spending over two centuries had lifted living standards. Almost always in the past, he said, the private sector and the government have acted together to meet the nation's requirements.
Mr. Niskanen, a libertarian economist, is hardly a Kennedy ally. He beats the drums for cutting taxes and shrinking government. But he, too, recognizes the generations-old principle that government spending has a legitimate role in a market economy. His spending would be vastly smaller than Mr. Kennedy's. In only four cases, he said, citing education, highways, public sanitation and mass transit, does some public spending "have a higher level of payoff than private spending." 
"A higher level of payoff." That is the key. If that guidepost could be spread across Congress -- replacing the prevailing view that public spending is by nature wasteful and a drag on the economy -- then tax cuts would cease to be so mesmerizing. In the debate that would follow, the entire tax cut might even give way to public spending that promised a higher level of payoff than giving the money back to the private sector.
Consider child care and care of the elderly, occupations that require warmth and emotional support. These are qualities the marketplace consistently undervalues, says Nancy Folbre, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. There are good reasons. Quality of care is hard to measure in dollars and cents. And consumer preference does not kick in. The consumer is the child or the old person, and in most cases neither one has the leverage to demand quality. A result: Care providers are underpaid and thus often not up to the task.
Raising salaries through public subsidies would help solve the problem, Ms. Folbre contends, and would spread quality care to families that cannot afford it now, even middle-class families. The payoff in well-being and proper child-raising would exceed what private companies, on their own, are willing to provide. "Policy makers have to be thinking much more carefully about market failures in the care sector," Ms. Folbre said.
MARKET failures also show up in health insurance, pension coverage, mass transit, affordable college education and pollution control -- to name just a few of the issues that should make an appearance in a Congressional debate over tax cuts versus public spending. New research, for example, shows that poor children from minority groups are more likely to become productive adults if they are enrolled in small classes during the first three years of elementary school. That requires many more teachers than the private sector is likely to support.
The Democrats once carried the flag for public spending, but Bill Clinton and Al Gore shifted the emphasis to preserving the surplus and keeping government small. And the debate died, although public opinion polls suggest that it should be resurrected. Americans react negatively to questions about "government spending," said Humphrey Taylor, chairman of Louis Harris & Associates, the polling company. But they often favor more spending on services they want: education, health care, medical research, highways, police, air traffic control. 
"It is all in the phrases you use in asking the questions," Mr. Taylor said, "But people are beginning to make the connections. They are becoming aware that big tax cuts mean cuts in the services they want. That is a step forward."

A Retailer's Strategy To Sustain a Revival

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
JUST six months ago, things were looking pretty bleak for investors in Restoration Hardware, the quirky home-products retailer. The stock of this former Wall Street darling, which traded as high as $37 in July 1998, had plummeted to 50 cents, and some people wondered whether it was just another flash in the pan.
 But investors who stuck with the company, based in Corte Madera, Calif., have been rewarded in recent months: the stock now trades at $5.98. 
 So what is next for Restoration Hardware, a chain of 104 stores in 31 states that attracts an upscale urban clientele with merchandise ranging from inexpensive Bite the Man dog toys to reproduction Mission furniture? 
There seems to be some basis for optimism. In the fiscal year ended Feb. 3, during which Restoration struggled for survival, it had sales of $369.5 million, up from $298.9 million a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of a retailer's performance, rose 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter while earnings, at 56 cents a share, beat Wall Street expectations.
"This could have been a 50-cent stock that went to zero," said Barbara Miller, a specialty retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, who has a lukewarm "market perform" rating on the stock. "This is not a stock that anyone is buying for this quarter. This is a stock that people are buying for the potential and the management. If it works, it will go a lot higher than $6."
Investors in Restoration may now be betting on Gary G. Friedman, a veteran retailer who was named chief executive on March 21. That day, Restoration also announced that it had completed a $15 million private placement of preferred shares and had renegotiated credit lines with lenders to give it more flexibility. In two days, the stock jumped to $4 from $1.8125.
Mr. Friedman, 43, had been president and chief operating officer at Williams-Sonoma, the home furnishings and cookware retailer. There, he built up the Pottery Barn brand and expanded stores and the company's catalog. He left when he was passed over for the chief executive's job.
Since taking the reins from Stephen Gordon, Restoration's founder and still its chairman, Mr. Friedman has begun closing unprofitable stores, including one of the company's two stores in New York City. He has said the company will not open any new stores anywhere for two years. "The company was positioned a lot more clearly three to four years ago, but then they got away from the vision," Mr. Friedman said. "That lack of clarity diluted Restoration's message."
One of Restoration's problems is that it grew much too quickly, said Frank J. Pados Jr., the executive vice president at Desai Capital Management, which has been a Restoration investor since before the company went public in June 1998. 
"The number of stores was getting too big and they had to get back to basics," said Mr. Pados, whose firm still owns more than 5 percent of the company's shares.
Management was too thin for the ambitious expansion, analysts said, and made errors like putting popular merchandise on sale when stores could have obtained full price. Sales per square foot slumped 7 percent in 2000, to $520 from $559 in 1999.
Mr. Gordon said that in a growth spurt in 1999 and 2000, the company's stores stocked "too many goods for our customers to focus on."
Mr. Friedman, known for his merchandising skills, plans to start selling more linens and curtains, products that carry higher profit margins and that have been very successful at Pottery Barn. One of Restoration's major problems, Mr. Pados said, has been that its merchandise mix, while interesting, has not changed often enough to keep people coming back to its stores. 
N. Richard Nelson Jr., a retailing analyst at Stephens Inc. who is neutral on the stock, said, "This company isn't out of the woods yet by any means, but he seems to have a good game plan in place."
OF course, analysts and investors say, it will be many months before most of Mr. Friedman's changes take root. They remained calm about the company's report on May 10 that same-store sales for the three months ended May 5 fell 16.2 percent, a result that the company predicted back in March.
Mr. Friedman's effort to remake the company comes during an economic slowdown -- and after many upscale consumers watched investment portfolios shrink in value in the last year. Furniture, always a strong seller at the company, has been particularly difficult, Mr. Nelson said. "The economy," he added, "is certainly not working in their favor."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Betting On Winners And Losers In Energy

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
GREAT fortunes are often made -- and lost -- in times of crisis.
 At the moment, though, it is hard to identify clear investment winners and losers from the 100-odd recommendations that the Bush administration made last week on energy. One reason is that some businesses have already capitalized on the run-up in prices of oil, natural gas and electricity. Another is that it is unclear which of the initiatives will be enacted. 
 Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist who runs his own energy consulting firm, PKVerleger L.L.C., in Newport Beach, Calif., took time to sort some of this out. Here are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Did the president's energy proposal surprise you at all?

A. What surprises me is that in many ways it is so timid. It is a very mild program.

Q. What would have been a bold thing to do in the energy plan?

A. I was hoping for a call for immediate deregulation of electricity generation and associated pricing for consumers nationwide. That would have created some huge windfall profits over the short term, but a windfall-profits tax would have dealt with that.

Q. But you have reservations about whether the situation is as grave as the president suggests, don't you?

A. It doesn't seem to me we really needed an energy message at this point. In 1971, 1973, 1974 and 1977, we were facing a crisis. Supplies were tight, and there were no mechanisms like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to deal with the situation. The circumstances right now are not the same. We are dealing with constraints from volatile prices resulting from structural changes in the economy.
Instead of vertically integrated power companies like Consolidated Edison or Southern California Edison, we have smaller enterprises and horizontal corporations. That change has changed the behavior of markets. The president quite rightly points out the logistical problem we face in terms of not enough pipelines and insufficient electricity transmission facilities. But it is not clear that his solution is the 21st-century solution, which would be to uncouple homes or office buildings from power grids and hook them up to their own generators.

Q. If the electricity problem in California had not developed and oil was $28 a barrel, would President Bush have pushed this program?

A . Mother Nature presented the president with this opportunity, and he seized it. Without California, he would not have had the opportunity. But the problem in the West is due to the drought out here. Water levels have only been this low once in the last 80 years. I estimate the drought in the Northwest reduces the supply of electricity to the Western states by about 8 percent.
To close that gap, we either have to have blackouts, substitute oil-fired or natural-gas generating capacity to make up for the lost hydro capacity, or raise prices.

Q. Which parts of the energy program do you see becoming reality?

A. I think they will get through the things they can do by regulation. For instance, they can resolve the uncertainty for refineries about fuel specifications and requirements they would have to meet in terms of local emission standards. The Environmental Protection Agency under Clinton was unduly nasty. They can open some of the federal lands that were closed off for exploration. And they can get the tax credit for hybrid vehicles.

Q. What won't the administration get?

A. I don't think they will get the Alaska Wildlife Refuge, but they don't really need it. It does nothing to address national supply issues. We will still be subject to blackmail by foreign producers.
And I don't think this giant interstate power grid the president wants is likely to happen. The idea tramples on states' rights.

Q. The president also recommended that automobile fuel-economy standards be reviewed. Will that make a difference?

A. If they make a large-enough tax credit for hybrid vehicles, they don't have to change the standards, because the kick you get from hybrids will improve fuel economy.

Q. From an investment perspective, are there any clear winners?

A. The temptation will be to invest in oil drillers, but I don't think that is the right conclusion, because there is already a lot of drilling going on. The rush to build new power plants will help power generators for a year or so, but then they will be losers because there will be much too much power. Toyota and Honda, which are the two companies with current, marketable hybrid automobiles, are going to be big winners. Other auto manufacturers that have models like that due out soon could also do well. Pure-play refiners like Tosco and Valero may do well.

Everyone's Trying to Fix the Economy

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHATEVER turns out tobe happening to the economy the numbers are still all over the lot, but the general drift remains downward -- government can hardly be accused of standing idly by. 
 Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point for the fifth time this year. The rate reduction of 2.5 percentage points in less than five months is the economic equivalent of applying defibrillators to the patient; if this doesn't jolt the expansion back to life, there's probably little hope. 
 But just in case, Congress was moving with unaccustomed speed toward delivering a stimulant of its own in the form of a tax cut. 
Contained in the $1.35 trillion tax reduction that Congress hopes to deliver to President Bush by Memorial Day is $100 billion earmarked to give the economy a boost this year and next. That is 20 percent more than either party was contemplating a few weeks ago, and may be enough to make a difference.
"The direction Washington is headed is a helpful one," said Thomas D. Gallagher, an analyst at the International Strategy and Investment Group, an investment firm. 
The policy response has been particularly impressive in comparison to previous downturns. It has taken the Fed 19 weeks to cut interest rates by 2.5 percentage points this year, Mr. Gallagher said. The last time the nation was heading into recession, in 1989 and 1990, it took the Fed 80 weeks -- a year and a half -- to cut rates that much. And while Congress has moved speedily to cut taxes this year, in 1990 Congress and the first Bush administration were raising taxes to battle an expanding federal budget deficit.
The problem is that lower interest rates and tax cuts both take awhile to work their magic. In the meantime, the economy could get worse. And there is some doubt as to whether lower rates will be effective in addressing this particular slowdown, which has less to do with a drop-off in purchases by interest-sensitive consumers than with decisions by companies to pare back spending on plants and equipment.
In coming months, analysts expect unemployment to continue rising from its current level, 4.5 percent. And developments like rising gasoline prices and rolling electricity blackouts could create pressure on politicians to "do something."
Mr. Bush says the best antidote to higher energy prices is to give people more money through the tax cut. But not all low and moderate-income workers would gain from the cut, and it would do little to cushion the drag on corporate profits from higher energy prices.
In any case, both parties on Capitol Hill, mindful of the political risks of higher prices at the pump and rising unemployment, have been studying additional steps they could take over the administration's objections. They include repealing the federal gasoline tax, threatening oil companies with price-gouging investigations and imposing price caps on electricity.
For its part, the Fed signaled that it is prepared to keep cutting rates until a recovery is certain. Unfortunately, deciding when it has done enough is tricky, because it takes a while before rate cuts show up in the economic data.
The old rule of thumb was that it takes 9 to 12 months for a change in Fed monetary policy to ripple fully through the economy. By that standard, the rate cuts would kick in only at the end of the year. There is evidence that the process has accelerated in recent years. Still, it will take some time. In the same way, the effect of the tax cuts will be delayed, probably into next year.
Some of the tax cut will be retroactive to the beginning of this year, and some people could benefit from reduced withholding rates starting perhaps this summer. But most people won't get all their money back until early next year, when they file their tax returns.
Whether the one-two punch of monetary and fiscal policy will be enough to avert a full recession and point the economy quickly back toward healthy growth remains a matter of debate among economists. 
One camp argues that this slowdown will not be easily halted by lower rates and tax cuts. In this view, the problem is not the traditional one of inducing the consumer to start buying again. It is, rather, a problem of waiting out a downturn in investment among companies that for years gorged on new computers, telecommunications equipment and more efficient factories.
While perhaps not as effective as they would be in a traditional downturn, monetary and fiscal policy can help in that situation by underpinning confidence and demand for goods and services. Economists who see an investment-led decline tend to think that continued rate cutting will be needed, and that the tax cut could do some good. 
Some investors, however, are betting that this will turn out to be a more traditional business cycle slowdown, and that the policy response has already been overdone. In the futures markets, the mentality now is that the Fed will actually start raising interest rates later this year or next.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Setting Rates By the Numbers

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
ELIMINATE Alan Greenspan.
 It sounds like a line from a cheesy political thriller. But the proposal is serious, an intriguing if flawed pitch for a radical change in the way this nation sets monetary policy. 
 Of course, no one really wants to do away with Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. But 14 years into Mr. Greenspan's tenure at the helm of the Fed, his once unblemished reputation has faded, albeit only slightly. 
The Fed's ability to raise and lower short-term interest rates is its primary control over the economy. An increase in rates raises borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, leading to deferred spending and slower growth and inflation. A cut in rates has the opposite effect. Mr. Greenspan's goal is to keep the economy growing as fast as possible without causing inflation to rise.
The job has always been tricky. And it has become even more difficult as stock investors have intensified their focus on the Fed's interest-rate moves. Rising stocks encourage consumers to spend more, while a falling market dampens consumer spending. That indirect "wealth effect" can overwhelm the Fed's direct control over borrowing costs. But the Fed cannot always predict how stock investors will react to a change in short-term rates.
Mr. Greenspan raised short-term rates too slowly in 1999 and 2000, leading to the Nasdaq's bubble, critics say. He compounded the error, they add, by failing to cut rates last fall, hobbling the economy. Now, by making five rate cuts this year, he has overcompensated and risks another bubble.
Balancing growth and inflation is simply too much for one man, even Mr. Greenspan, says Jonathan Hakala, who spent more than a decade as a bond trader before quitting in 1998 to start a venture capital fund. Rather than relying on Mr. Greenspan, he suggests allowing the market to set short-term rates, as it now sets long-term rates.
Here is how Mr. Hakala's plan works: The Fed would announce a target rate for the 10-year Treasury note of 4 percent. If the Treasury note rate exceeded 4 percent, the short-term rate the Fed controls would be set at 4 percent plus double the difference between the 10-year rate and 4 percent; if the 10-year rate fell below 4 percent, the short-term Fed rate would be 4 percent minus double the difference.
For example, if the 10-year note rate is 5 percent, the Fed's short-term rate would be 6 percent. If the 10-year rate was 3 percent, the short-term rate would be 2 percent. Over the long run, the Fed's goal would be to keep both short-term and long-term rates at 4 percent and inflation as close to zero as possible. And because rules for setting short-term rates would be public, investors would have more certainty about what the Fed wanted.
"There's overwhelming pressure for a market-based, transparent, no- or low-inflation economy, and the people who try to resist it are dinosaurs. It's inevitable," Mr. Hakala said. "We need something that is not a personality cult around one very talented individual."
It is fair to say Mr. Hakala's plan so far has not won much support on Wall Street, where the accepted wisdom is that using a single mechanism to set short-term rates would be a mistake.
The interest rate on the 10-year note does not change solely because of investors' expectations of inflation, said David A. Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's DRI. For example, a financial panic in Japan could cause Japanese investors to sell their American Treasury securities and push up rates on the 10-year note. Under Mr. Hakala's rule, the Fed would raise rates just when it should lower them, Mr. Wyss said. Also, productivity growth changes over time, affecting the inflation-free growth rate. Mr. Hakala's plan does not account for that, Mr. Wyss said.
"Greenspan's done a better job than an automatic rule," Mr. Wyss said. "I wouldn't say he's been perfect, but I'd say he gets at least an A-minus."

Looking to Win The Energy Issue

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN every room at the Holiday Inn Campus in Eau Claire, Wis., a sign implores guests to preserve energy by re-using their towels. But Terri Mertz, the hotel's general manager, said that typically guests in no more than five rooms (out of 137) do so.
 "People probably think, 'I'm at a hotel, so they can pay for my towels,' " Ms. Mertz said. 
 Therein lies a lesson for President Bush and the Democrats, who in releasing competing energy blueprints last week each tried to present theirs as the responsible approach to the nation's twin desires for affordable energy and a clean environment. 
Both parties have commissioned polls that show that Americans (particularly prized independent voters) place a far greater priority on encouraging conservation than on producing more oil and gas. Yet there is a huge gap between what people say they want and how they act. In fact, Americans have long resisted taking steps in their own lives to reduce energy consumption.
This contradiction, ambivalence or hypocrisy could provide a political opening for either party, especially the Republicans, whose energy plan offers only a passing glance at conservation. In the end, Mr. Bush may not suffer politically if, deep down, people are loath to change their lifestyles. The Democrats, in contrast, are asserting that the White House doesn't care about the environment and that its policies would force people to curb their energy use -- or pay higher rates -- not because of any crisis but so that oil companies could reap greater profits. 
Both sides, then, are seeking to exploit an uncertain electorate, an inherently risky game. For Republicans, the challenge is to avoid being seen as despoilers of the Earth; the Democrats need to protect themselves from being portrayed by Republicans as more concerned about championing the spotted owl than people's livelihoods.
"A large fraction of the American public consider themselves to be concerned about the environment," said Cutler J. Cleveland, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University, "yet they also want the freedom to behave in ways that are not constrained by the price or cost of energy. They are outraged with every nickel-a-gallon increase in the price of gasoline."
For generations, Americans have been accustomed to abundant and cheap natural resources. Even today, oil and gas are still relatively affordable compared both to inflation and to prices worldwide. This creates a problem for conservationists because, historically, conservation has really worked only when the cost of profligacy has hit consumers' pocketbooks. Thus, the Arab oil embargo during the Carter administration drove Americans to fuel-efficient cars only because gasoline shot up in price and often was not even available.
For now, despite the specter of rolling blackouts and warnings that gas could top $3 a gallon, most people do not seem panicked enough to change their ways. In California, however, where there is a crisis, two-thirds of the guests at the Westin St. Francis hotel in San Francisco are happily re-using their towels at the management's request. 
Absent a crisis, financial incentives can encourage conservation. If the Holiday Inn in Eau Claire offered a discount for people who re-used their towels -- or even a free cup of coffee -- the response might be better.
"Any time you ask people to do something new, they have a disincentive to do it," said Raymond de Young, an environmental psychologist at the University of Michigan. "If you're basically telling people that there's no pleasure in what we're asking them to do, people are going to ask, 'What's in it for me?' And they're going to be afraid they're going to be taken for a sucker."
American public planning has also discouraged conservation. For example, people might prefer taking public transportation in Los Angeles. But if there are no convenient subway or bus lines, what choice do they have but to drive? Similarly, people may feel embarrassed about driving gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, but if the government is afraid of imposing more stringent fuel economy standards on them, or placing higher taxes on gas (which is far cheaper here than in any European country), why scold their owners? In fact, a Transportation Department study made public late last week found that the average gas mileage of new vehicles in the 2001 model year had slipped back to the level of 1999, which was the lowest since 1980.
If anything, postwar America has encouraged energy consumption, hence the proliferation of highways, suburbs and automobiles, all subsidized. Unlike the Japanese or Europeans, who have limited energy reserves and have had no choice but to do things like flick off light switches, the United States psyche has never been as oriented toward efficiency. The average American uses nearly twice as much energy as the average European, experts say.
LAST week, a conservation-minded customer brought a stack of hangers to a cleaner here for re-use, and was told, "We don't do that." The store clerk threw them out.
Amory B. Lovins, a prominent advocate of energy efficiency, said skinny copper wires that carry electricity to light fixtures can be found above the ceilings in many buildings. If fatter wires were installed, he said, there would be an energy savings of nearly 200 percent.
"It's a subtle but pervasive example of how our market system is not using energy in a way that saves money," said Mr. Lovins, who heads the Rocky Mountain Institution in Snowmass, Colo. "If an electrician were altruistic enough to buy the fatter wire, that electrician would never have gotten the job in the first place because he would not have had the lowest bid."
So it is that, while politicians have been competing to be perceived as pro-conservation (a joke making the rounds here is that Mr. Bush is planning to reinstall solar panels that Jimmy Carter put in the roof of the White House), they have taken care not to suggest anything that would spoil the sacred American way of life. No one wants to repeat the mistake made during the energy crisis of the 1970's by Mr. Carter, whose call for austerity left people wondering whether they would find themselves shivering in the dark under a blanket.
"I reject that term, sacrifice," said Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat. "We're asking people to reduce their personal energy consumption by at least 10 percent. But that is not difficult to do. People don't have to have every light in the house on, every television operating, even when no one's watching and all the computers are on 24 hours a day. That's simply wasteful and unnecessary."
The White House has apparently banned the word sacrifice from its talking points. On the contrary, Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, declared that "Mr. Bush believes that energy use is a reflection of the strength of our economy" and "the American way of life is a blessed one and we have a bounty of resources in this country."
Those remarks and other by Vice President Dick Cheney, while cheered by the energy industry, made the White House appear so blithely indifferent to the environment that Mr. Bush was forced to dress up his energy policy with conservation initiatives.
Predictably, this has not satisfied environmentalists, who note that there are few mandatory conservation measures. "You can summarize the president's energy policy as real men dig, drill and burn," said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, "and conservation is for wimps."
Republicans, well aware that Democrats are widely viewed as more environmentally sensitive, are emphasizing the economy and the consumer. The White House has lined up both conservatives and labor leaders behind its policy to make the point that it would help the economy stay competitive -- and that creating jobs, especially during a time of economic uncertainty, should be the highest priority.
Implicit in this view is that environmentalism is bad for the economy and bad for the average worker. "There is a tremendous opportunity for Republicans to discredit environmentalists," said Myron Ebell, who is in charge of global warming issues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative group. "There is something fundamentally anti-consumer and undemocratic about Democratic coercion to force people to change their lifestyle. The effect of their policies would be to lower the American standard of living."
Democrats counter that people have grown too sophisticated for such scare tactics and that there are enormous hidden costs -- health care, toxic cleanups, loss of tourism -- to a policy that pushes production at the expense of the environment. 
"The Bush people are approaching this as a trade-off: either you sacrifice or you dig in the national forest," said Mark Mellman, a pollster who has conducted surveys on the environment for the Democratic National Committee. "The public says you can have both."
But can people really have it both ways? Advocates on both sides agree that to successfully grapple with the nation's energy needs and the demands for clean air, water and a landscape not utterly despoiled, there has to be some balance between production and conservation. Finding that balance, at least politically, is the big challenge.
"We're all guilty," said Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. "We all want the benefits. But we don't want to make the sacrifices."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 20 about Republican and Democratic efforts to find political advantage in the nation's current energy problems misstated the period of the Arab oil embargo. It was 1973-74, not during the administration of Jimmy Carter, who was in office from 1977 to 1981.

HEADLINE: A Presidency Reconsidered 

BYLINE:  By David Gergen; David Gergen, a professor of public service at the Kennedy School at Harvard and editor at large of U.S. News & World Report, served as special counsel to President Ford from 1975 to 1976.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE , Mass. 

 BODY:
Throwing caution into Boston Harbor, the trustees of the John F. Kennedy Library have made a gutsy decision: they will present their annual Profile in Courage award tomorrow night to Gerald R. Ford. And for what? For pardoning Richard Nixon! In a single, swift stroke, the trustees will thus complete the revival of one president, honor the spirit of another and send a message that should be heard by leaders everywhere.
 A generation ago, Mr. Ford's pardon looked like a one-way ticket to oblivion. He and his team had heavily suggested that he would not even consider a reprieve until prosecutors had brought formal charges against Mr. Nixon, an event that seemed months away, if not years. But then, at 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning just 30 days into his presidency, with church bells pealing in the distance, Mr. Ford went on national television to announce that he had granted "a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States." 
 By the time Mr. Ford reached Burning Tree for an afternoon of golf, it was his presidency that was in flames. His press secretary had resigned. An overnight poll by The New York Times found his approval ratings dropping from a lofty 71 percent to 49 percent. In Pittsburgh the next day, people booed him for the first time and demonstrators shouted, "Jail Ford, jail Ford!" A worker by the airport fence expressed a widespread view: "Oh, it was all fixed. He said to Mr. Nixon, 'You give me the job, I'll give you the pardon.' "
Nearly all of us who had worked for Mr. Nixon in the White House were as surprised as the public. Mr. Ford had disclosed his intent to only a tiny number of us and only at the last minute. I heard his speech while driving and almost veered into a ditch. But we also knew Mr. Ford to be so thoroughly honest that a deal with Mr. Nixon or Alexander Haig, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff, was inconceivable. He had clearly acted out of conviction.
Sadly, we could never convince the public of that. President Ford's honeymoon was irretrievably shattered, and two years later, the pardon cost him the election against Jimmy Carter. For a long while, it appeared Mr. Ford would enter the books as a footnote. He had served in the White House only 895 days. Despite his many good works after leaving the White House, often undertaken in tandem with Mr. Carter, he could not escape the shadows of the past.
Recent years, however, have brought a change in perception. The first signal came in 1996, when Richard Reeves, a journalist who had earlier savaged Mr. Ford as Bozo the Clown, wrote a remarkable article in American Heritage; its title was "I'm Sorry, Mr. President." Lamenting the press's growing penchant for trashing public figures and manfully admitting his own part, Mr. Reeves wrote that Mr. Ford "had done a better job than I had predicted or imagined" and added, "You have my respect and thanks, Mr. President."
This past summer, when Mr. Ford was rushed to the hospital in Philadelphia on the opening night of the Republican convention, a wave of nostalgia swept over the delegates and into the press corps. Television news channels stood poised to break in with specials if his condition turned grave.
But the real U-turn came when George W. Bush began selecting his team. Three of his top choices -- Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul O'Neill -- were properly seen as "Ford men." Alan Greenspan had served as Mr. Ford's chief economic adviser and remains close to the former president. One of the co-chairmen of President Bush's Social Security commission, Richard Parsons, was a senior White House aide in the Ford administration. Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Ford's national security adviser, is the mentor of Mr. Bush's national security chief, Condoleezza Rice. The Ford influence is everywhere.
True, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld and the others today sound more like products of the Reagan years than the Ford era. They, like their party, have moved to the right since the 1970's. Curiously, Mr. Ford himself moved closer to the center after he became president and has remained there since. Perhaps the wider perspective of the office forever changed him.
And now the award in Boston prompts the question: Why this flowering of Mr. Ford's reputation? Why now?
Presidential reputations, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. pointed out some years ago, tend to rise and fall with changes in the political climate. Harry Truman has enjoyed one of the most spectacular comebacks, rivaling his own election victory in 1948. Dwight Eisenhower has also experienced a lift since political scientists have had a chance to look through his private papers, and with the horror of Vietnam fading, Lyndon Johnson is gaining stature for his civil rights bills.
Mr. Ford's revival rests less upon his achievements than upon his spirit of leadership. Historians do not yet grant him the credit he deserves for policy gains like the Helsinki accords he negotiated with Leonid Brezhnev, the first serious crack in the Iron Curtain. Some claim (wrongly) that he had a mediocre mind. But after all the scandals, shenanigans and excessive spin of intervening years, Mr. Ford shines through as a man of honor, decency and plain talk, qualities that look good in the rear-view mirror of history.
Moreover, Mr. Ford's moderation seems close to the mood of the country today. In the early 1990's, Americans rejected the Bill Clinton health initiative as too liberal, and in the mid-90's they rejected the revolution of Newt Gingrich as too conservative. A wide swath of the electorate seems more comfortable these days with the moderate, pragmatic approach that characterized the Ford presidency.
But it was the pardon that most defined Mr. Ford, and now even some of his former critics are finally recognizing how gutsy it was. Mr. Ford said not long ago that as a new president, he was spending 25 percent of his time on the problems of one man, Mr. Nixon, when there was a looming economic crisis, a coming summit with the Russians and a storm brewing in the Middle East. He knew he would be risking his reputation with the pardon, but attending to the problems of the country came first. 
Many today still think he was wrong to let Mr. Nixon off the hook. I happen to think he was right (though he might have stage-managed the decision more adroitly, signaling to the nation in advance where he was heading). But even those who disagree with his pardon should agree that it took real political courage. 
A true democracy, John F. Kennedy wrote in "Profiles in Courage," has faith that its elected representatives "will exercise their conscientious judgment -- faith that the people will not condemn those whose devotion to principle leads them to unpopular courses, but will reward courage, respect honor and ultimately recognize right." The trustees of the Kennedy Library thus salute both President Ford and President Kennedy tomorrow night. But they do more: they are telling leaders everywhere to pay less attention to daily polls and more attention to their inner voices. Give up the slavish obedience to popular opinion so embedded in politics today, and take up the standard of what's right, even when it threatens one's political survival. As Jerry Ford found, you may be condemned by millions but one day -- perhaps a quarter century later -- win an honored place in history.

Is Greenspan's Salary A Bit Irrational?

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Hershey Jr. 

 BODY:
"Irrational exuberance," of course, is the phrase once used by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to allude to the runaway bull market in stocks.
 So how might a rational investor characterize the Federal Reserve salary structure, in which Mr. Greenspan, who sets the nation's main interest-rate benchmark almost single-handedly, earns a smaller paycheck than dozens of his underlings? 
 To be sure, some Wall Street traders and analysts make more money than their bosses because of outsized profits generated by their departments. But there is little doubt that Mr. Greenspan is the Fed's most valuable player and the only one of its officials most people could name.
Mr. Greenspan's salary this year is $161,239, according to the central bank. Although that is an increase from $141,300 in 2000, it is still less than a superstar baseball player makes in a weekend. And it is also less than the annual pay of each of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks (not to mention less than what at least 11 staff members were making as long as six years ago, when the privacy-conscious Fed was forced by a Freedom of Information Act request to disclose salaries, unconnected to names, of various officials).
The other governors of the Federal Reserve Board earn $145,115, while the salaries of the 12 regional presidents -- deemed to require pay closer to that of the private market than the people who labor in Washington -- range from $205,000 to $303,000.
And who gets the top regional presidential pay? Not, as one might expect, William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the permanent vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee and generally considered the system's No. 2 official. He makes $283,300, or $19,700 less than Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who has more seniority. Robert D. Hershey Jr.

HEADLINE: U.S. Germ Warfare Review Faults Plan on Enforcement 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON and JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
A confidential Bush administration review has recommended that the United States not accept a draft agreement to enforce the treaty banning germ weapons, according to American officials.
 The recommendations appear certain to distress allies, who back the draft accord and are concerned that the new administration is concentrating too much on new military programs and not enough on treaties and nonproliferation. 
 After six years of negotiations, diplomats in Geneva have produced the draft agreement, known as a protocol, which would establish measures to monitor the ban on biological weapons. 
A 1972 treaty, which 143 nations have ratified, prohibits the development, production and possession of biological weapons. But the treaty has always lacked a means of verifying compliance. United States support for the protocol is critical to the effort to give the treaty teeth. 
The Clinton administration cast the new protocol as an important tool to stem the spread of biological weapons. And international negotiators in Geneva have been rushing to complete it by November. 
But the new Bush administration has taken a far more skeptical approach. In a unanimous review, its interagency team concluded that the current version of the protocol would be inefficient in stopping cheating, and that all its deficiencies could not be remedied by the negotiating deadline.
"The review says that the protocol would not be of much value in catching potential proliferators," a senior American official said.
The White House has yet to formally endorse the review's conclusions, but since all the relevant agencies agreed to it, the White House is considered virtually certain to go along. The real issue is what steps to adopt in light of the recommendations, and how to proceed diplomatically. Although the review strongly objects to the current version of the protocol, it does not rule out fresh attempts to address monitoring. 
And the review is also emerging as a sensitive diplomatic problem. President Bush heads to Europe next month, and his administration has already been under fire for steering too unilateralist a course on foreign policy, by backing away from the Kyoto accords on global warming and, to a lesser extent, the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. So the White House is eager to avoid a new split.
Tibor Toth, the Hungarian diplomat who has overseen the effort to negotiate the protocol, will fly to Washington this week to try to change the Bush administration's mind, American officials said.
"Different constituencies seem to see different flaws, which indicates it is a pretty good compromise," Mr. Toth said in a telephone interview. "If it still needs to be fixed, we have the time. Barriers have been raised to nuclear and chemical proliferation. If the world community fails to agree on a protocol to strengthen the ban on biological weapons after six years of talks, it will send a very unfortunate message." 
The first step to ban germ weapons was taken when President Richard M. Nixon and other world leaders signed the treaty in 1972, at the dawn of arms control. But the agreement had no means of enforcing compliance. That became an enormous concern after President Boris N. Yeltsin conceded in 1992 that the Soviet Union had violated the accord by maintaining a long-standing biological-weapons program after the treaty went into force. Then evidence was acquired after the Persian Gulf war confirming that Iraq also had germ weapons, heightening fears over biological warfare. Most of the dozen or so countries that are believed to have biological weapons programs -- like Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea -- are members of the 1972 treaty.
So a decade ago, during the administration of Mr. Bush's father, the United States and other nations began studying what could be done to monitor the treaty. Six years ago, they began talks on a new protocol.
There have been many obstacles. China, which has little experience with formal arms-control treaties, is reluctant to allow on-site inspections. Pakistan is concerned that inspectors searching for germ weapons might investigate its nuclear weapons sites. And in the negotiations Iran has been trying to weaken controls on the export of biological equipment and materials, saying they hurt its civilian economies.
The United States, for its part, has had conflicting motivations. On one hand, it has worked to limit the scope of visits by foreign inspectors in order to protect American pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which dominate the worldwide industry and are concerned with protecting their trade secrets. 
And at the behest of the Pentagon, the government tried to limit inspections of American biodefense installations, which develop vaccines and protective equipment and analyze the germ warfare threat. 
As a result, the United States has not been as tough on verification as most of its allies. And yet Washington also hoped that the protocol would discourage cheating. 
Under the 210-page protocol, parties agree to make known their vaccine production facilities, the largest biodefense installations and facilities that do genetic engineering or aerosol studies with germ agents that are most likely to be used in weapons. But it would not require a declaration of all types of facilities that could be used to make weapons, including food and beverage plants and some pharmaceutical plants. 
As for inspections, a new executive council would be established and a majority vote of the body would be required before an investigation of a suspicious plant could be carried out. That procedure, insisted on by American industry, is less strict than a similar provision in the treaty banning chemical weapons, which stipulates that such investigations are to be done unless there is a vote by three-fourths of a similar body to block them. Inspectors under the biological protocol would have to be granted access 108 hours after an inspection was approved.
Defenders say the goal of the protocol was never to provide air-tight verification but rather to increase the chances that cheaters would be caught and thereby deter violations. Some monitoring and openness, they say, is better than none. 
But critics of the protocol say the accord would not really provide much security. A nation that was determined to cheat could find a way to do so and might use the limited inspections to throw other nations off the trail, they say. In this view, the United States would open itself up to inspections and get little in return.
When the Bush administration took office, the issue came to the fore. Donald A. Mahley, the American negotiator at the talks, proposed a review. The interagency group he led included working-level officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Commerce Department, the Energy Department and intelligence agencies.
The review found 38 problems with the protocol, a handful of them serious. But its basic assessment was very critical. It concluded that the verification measures in the treaty were unlikely to detect cheating. At the same time, the review concluded that these same provisions might be used by foreign governments to try to steal American secrets.
The review recommended that the United States not support the draft protocol that Ambassador Toth had overseen. And it concluded that there was not enough time to fix all the problems before the negotiating deadline.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has approved the review, which has been circulating in the administration. Officially, however, the White House insists that the review has not been completed, in part because it has yet to figure out a new policy.
But as word of the review has begun to seep out, it is already prompting debate. Barbara H. Rosenberg, a specialist at the Federation of American Scientists, said the Bush administration should have worked to improve the accord during the last negotiating round if it did not like it. Instead, the United States was passive, with the new administration claiming that it could not act while the policy review was supposedly under way.
"The U.S. sat quietly throughout the sessions and said nothing," Dr. Rosenberg said. "It made no effort to improve the text."
But Michael L. Moodie, a senior arms control official in the first Bush administration, said the protocol was severely flawed and needed to be replaced by a new approach. 
"The protocol was not going to get the job done," Mr. Moodie said. "It is it not going to deter proliferation." And if it was put into effect, he said, "we still would not be confident that there were not major violations going on."
If the White House, as expected, affirms the review, it has several alternatives. One is to try to improve the accord before the November deadline but to accept the fact that the United States is unlikely to obtain all the changes it would like. But there is little or no support for that approach in the administration.
Another is to ask that the deadline be extended so that negotiators would work on a substantially different protocol.
Or the United States could take a significantly different approach. Supporters of that idea, which is being actively discussed in the administration, say Washington should propose a stripped-down version of the protocol that would provide for investigations when violations of the convention are suspected. Such inspections, for example, might be carried out if there was a suspicious outbreak of disease, as happened in Sverdlovsk, Russia, in 1979 when anthrax spores escaped from a biological weapons plant.
There is a recognition within the administration that breaking off talks on biological-weapons monitoring altogether is not feasible because of diplomatic costs. That is especially the case because the administration is already involved in sensitive talks with its allies on the missile defense issue and has been eager to show that it is not ideologically opposed to arms control.
Still, the turnabout in American policy is likely to provoke concern from American allies, particularly the British, who have been very active on the treaty. 
When Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Washington in February, he insisted that the United States promise to pursue nonproliferation measures and not just missile defense, and the Bush administration agreed to mention nonproliferation in the statement that both leaders issued.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article on Sunday about a confidential Bush administration review of policy on the treaty to ban germ weapons omitted a passage in some copies. The affected paragraph, referring to Tibor Toth, a Hungarian diplomat who has tried to negotiate an agreement to enforce the treaty, read: " 'Different constituencies seem to see different flaws, which indicates it is a pretty good compromise,' Mr. Toth said in a telephone interview. 'If it still needs to be fixed, we have the time.' "

GRAPHIC: Chart: "CLOSER LOOK -- A Biological Warfare Sampler"Biological weapons like those listed below are banned under the germ weapons treaty. Anthrax, a bacteria, causes fever, fatigue, cough and other discomforts followed by severe respiratory distress. Shock and death can occur within 24 to 36 hours. Tularemia, a bacteria, can result in fever, headache, weight loss, pneumonia and other symptoms, occasionally leading to death. Smallpox, a virus, causes fever, vomiting, headaches, and in some cases delirium. Patients should be quarantined. Botulinum, a toxin, results in general weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, and leads to paralysis and respiratory failure.(Source: U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases)(pg. 12)

HEADLINE: The World: Of TV and Soccer; 
The Power of Celebrity Hits Italian Politics

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
BOASTING that he alone can straighten out Italy's tangled legal code, Silvio Berlusconi has already compared himself to Napoleon, which takes some of the fun out of finding parallels for Italy's new and unusual prime minister.
 The conservative media baron, who defeated Italy's center-left last Sunday, is short, ambitious and staggeringly self-confident. It is not hard to imagine him snatching a crown away from a pope and placing it on his head with his own hands. Though not an imperial crown, since Italy is a democracy. Something more along the lines of grabbing a laurel offered by the head of Italian state television. 
 As prime minister, he would have influence over the running of Italy's three state-controlled networks, an unsettling prospect given that Mr. Berlusconi already owns Italy's three largest private networks. 
Conflict of interest is now one of the most glaring issues facing his administration, but television alone does not explain his rise to power. Mr. Berlusconi owns Milan AC, the soccer team that won the national championship in 1993 and again in 1994, the year he was first, if briefly, elected prime minister. Even before he entered politics, the tycoon had a hero's status that eludes most American business leaders, except perhaps Ted Turner at his swashbuckling height as founder of CNN and owner of the Atlanta Braves. Soccer is Italy's passion, and soccer built Mr. Berlusconi's image as a winner, a can-do businessman above the clique of grey-faced politicians that had run Italy since the end of World War II. 
Mr. Berlusconi took his party's name from a soccer chant, "Forza Italia," and used his advertising company, his TV stations and his innate talent for communications to introduce American-style campaign kitsch -- anthems, badges, jazzy political ads -- to Italy. 
He used many of the same techniques this time (he got around a ban on TV ads by plastering posters of himself all over Italy and mailing a gauzy 128-page biography to every family). His victory nonetheless stunned the outside world, where the idea that a Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch could become prime minister while retaining his media holdings is unthinkable. The reaction from abroad in many ways echoes the 1980 American presidential elections, when a stunned Europe woke up and wondered, "Americans elected an actor?" 
Mr. Berlusconi has a bit of showbiz in his blood -- he worked his way through law school as a nightclub crooner on cruise ships. But like Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California for eight years, Mr. Berlusconi has spent the last five years in parliament leading the center-right opposition and honing his free-market economic platform as well as his political skills. 
Italians elected him not because they believed he could fulfill all his promises, but because they felt he was bold enough to try. He was also helped by a center-left government that was internally divided after five budget-cutting years in power. 
Mr. Berlusconi sold his vision of a more efficient, less bureaucratic Italy with the simple slogans and enthusiasm that helped him woo advertisers when he began piecing together his TV empire. He now controls 80 percent of that market.
Mr. Berlusconi's legendary business acumen -- he made a fortune in real estate, TV and also publishing, financial services and insurance -- stood him in good stead in politics. He out-negotiated the center-left government, avoiding reforms to the electoral law that could have helped his rival Francesco Rutelli win the election, without yielding on a conflict-of-interest law that would force him to sell off media assets. Now, he says he will pass his own law -- while asserting there is no conflict of interest.
He argues that he is already too rich too steal, and just wants to help other Italians succeed. His economic platform is Reaganesque -- lower taxes, trim the state and coax private investment to help finance huge public works projects. He is conservative, but American-style -- his unabashed embrace of capitalism and the joys of money clash with Italy's traditional right-wing ideology, which is statist, Catholic and suspicious of overnight wealth. 
His appeal to ordinary Italians is also like Mr. Reagan's. He has the high gloss of celebrity, a sunnily confident manner and keeps his programs simple. 
Mr. Berlusconi is too Italian to do his own ranch chores, however. Shots of him at "Arcore," his vast estate outside Milan, are taken poolside, or in gilded salons surrounded by Renaissance paintings. If anything, he has a touch of Nancy Reagan -- Mr. Berlusconi once cited his Albanian servants as proof that he has no bias against immigrants. 
Behind the scenes, he isn't disengaged as Mr. Reagan was. He doesn't delegate, and his hands-on approach is closer to Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s. Mr. Berlusconi's passionate anti-communism, a bit anachronistic now that the cold war is over, is more personal than any American president's. He views all attacks and criminal charges as part of a vast left-wing conspiracy to bring him down. He rarely displays a sense of humor when denouncing his opponents' "Bolshevik" tactics. 
Italy's respected conservative columnist Indro Montanelli, 91, was once close to Mr. Berlusconi. (He quit as editor of his newspaper, Il Giornale, when the boss went into politics and expected his paper to support him.) Asked if there was any connection between Mr. Berlusconi's right-wing populism and Mussolini, Mr. Montanelli, no fan of fascism, seemed insulted on Il Duce's behalf. "Oh no," he said. "I knew Mussolini, and there is a great difference. Mussolini came from politics, and he was as big a historical figure as he was disastrous for Italy." As a better analogy, he suggested, "Bel Ami," Maupassant's Belle Epoque Sammy Glick.
The Italian intelligentsia despises Mr. Berlusconi, for some of the same reasons many Americans were appalled by Mr. Reagan. They see him as vulgar, misguided and, given his control of TV, newspapers and so many businesses, dangerous. Before the election, Umberto Eco called on voters to conduct a "moral referendum" against him.
Mr. Berlusconi says he wants to reform the legal system, a scary notion coming from someone who still faces trials on corruption charges. But changes to the constitution require time and several rounds of voting in Parliament, and can be contested by referendum. 
HE is not going to change Italy's foreign policy, nor can he get away with tax cuts and deficit spending that would drive up the already high public debt. Italy, locked into the fiscal constraints of the euro, doesn't have the freedom to set its own course that Mr. Reagan and Britain under Margaret Thatcher, Mr. Berlusconi's other hero, enjoyed. 
Giuliano Ferrara, a newspaper editor who is an old friend and advisor of Mr. Berlusconi's, argued that Italy and the world should give the new prime minister a break. "The snobbish left blames him for bringing politics down to the lowest common denominator, but that isn't really so bad if it rids Italy of its smothering paternalistic ideology," Mr. Ferrara said. "If Italians will let Berlusconi build his bridges and highways, do his job and pardon him a few exaggerations, then maybe Italy will really get out of its mess."

HEADLINE: Listen Up! It's Time for a Profit; 
A Front-Row Seat as Amazon Gets Serious

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
IT is an unusually sunny day for Seattle, but no one can tell in the narrow, windowless conference room where Russell Allgor is drawing graphs on a white board. Dr. Allgor earned his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developing quantitative methods for making chemical plants more productive. Last summer, he moved from Bayer Chemical to Amazon.com and has built an 800,000-equation computer model of the company's sprawling operation, meant to help do most everything from scheduling Christmas overtime to rerouting trucks in a snowstorm.
 Dr. Allgor's work is part of a major shift in direction for Amazon.com, the online retailing giant. Its watchwords have changed from the buoyant "get big fast" to the pedestrian "march to profitability." And instead of designing zippy new features for its Web site and plotting new industries to conquer, its employees are turning to the tedious work of ordinary companies: cutting costs and raising revenue. 
 On this early Wednesday afternoon in May, Dr. Allgor has set out to answer one of Amazon's most vexing problems: how to keep inventory at a minimum, while ensuring that when someone orders several products, they can be shipped in a single box, preferably from the warehouse -- the company has six -- that is nearest the customer. 
"I can't follow so many numbers," said Lyn Blake, a vice president who previously ran Amazon's book department and now oversees company relations with manufacturers. "Remember, I didn't go to M.I.T. or Purdue, but I control the checkbook here." (The acerbic Ms. Blake has a journalism degree from Indiana University.)
Dr. Allgor's analysis is simple, but to Amazon veterans it is heretical: Amazon should increase its holdings of best sellers and stop holding slow-selling titles. (It would still sell these titles but order them after the customer does.)
"We need your buyoff on this," said Jim Miller, Dr. Allgor's boss, looking cautiously at Ms. Blake. Mr. Miller is a vice president in Amazon's unit that handles distribution and warehouses (and he holds an engineering degree from Purdue).
"You're not going have it," she snapped, "until you show how many items will no longer show 24-hour availability." If a product is in stock, Amazon guarantees customers shipment within 24 hours. For products it must order, it lists longer delays.
"I worry about the customer's perspective if we suddenly have a lot of items that are not available for quick delivery," Ms. Blake added.
Fueled by big dreams and seemingly endless cash from investors, Amazon.com created an almost magical offering for consumers: Tap into a Web site and buy any book -- and, later, music and lots of other merchandise as well -- at a low price, with responsive service and quick shipment.
Now Amazon has assigned people like Dr. Allgor to analyze why it is losing money. What the company is finding, over and over, is what many skeptics have long contended: its magical offering is complicated, expensive and inefficient.
BETWEEN his habitual belly laughs, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, says his company is exactly where he had always wanted it to be. Amazon's plan, imitated by hundreds of other Internet companies -- was to grow first and to figure out how to profit later.
Amazon did get big fast. It opened outposts in four countries. It expanded to become a general store selling electronics, kitchen gadgets and lawn furniture. Last year, 20 million customers bought $2.8 billion worth of merchandise -- more revenue, Amazon says, than for any 5-year-old company in history. But it also lost $1.4 billion doing so.
Nearly all its rivals have vanished or are just limping along, conserving their last drops of cash. And Amazon, with its head start and foresight to raise $2.1 billion, is one of the few dot-coms left that will ever find out whether that that crucial second phase can work.
"We have been planning for a long time for this inflection point, after expanding geographically and our product categories in 1999," Mr. Bezos said. "This is the right time to focus on the fundamental economics of our business, even if it means sacrificing growth."
That is not to say that Mr. Bezos has gotten everything right. Hardly. Amazon promised investors big returns from its deals to promote other Internet companies like Pets.com and Living.com, most of which paid Amazon in stock, not cash. Oops. Those companies are defunct. And last year, Mr. Bezos set an internal goal of $5 billion in sales for 2001; it now expects no more than $3.6 billion.
Mr. Bezos readily acknowledges that he was wrong on Pets.com and the like, and that he underestimated the impact of the economic slowdown on Amazon's sales. But he says that once the company achieves its goal of turning an operating profit in the fourth quarter -- a goal that is hardly guaranteed -- it will concentrate anew on expansion.
"A major focus in 2002 will still be profitability, he said. "We're not in this business to break even. But next year we will pursue a more balanced strategy. Growth is an important factor in our profitability."
Despite Amazon's size, this plan is as provocative and unproven as it was when Mr. Bezos founded the company in 1994. After all, Amazon is at heart a mail-order merchant. And nearly every successful mail-order company has used a variation of the same formula -- a limited selection of unique products. Only the high margins provided by such private-label goods can pay the costs of marketing, warehousing and shipping.
Amazon, instead, wants to be the online equivalent of Wal-Mart, with so much sales volume that it has the buying power and efficiency to sell the same products available everywhere, but at low prices, and still make money.
To Amazon's critics, and there are now many, that is a recipe for mediocrity, if not total collapse.
"The more I learn about the dumb things they did, the more I believe there is room for improvement," said Lauren Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens. She said the company was hobbled by a stagnating book business and low margins in electronics, its second-biggest line. "Once you stop selling 30-pound bags of concrete," she asked, "what can you do to find sustainable and profitable growth?"
AGAINST the rising chorus of criticism, Amazon agreed to a request by Money & Business for a close look at the steps the company was taking to become profitable. The company invited a reporter to spend three days observing a half-dozen meetings on inventory management, marketing, pricing and customer service.
There was much, of course, that Amazon kept off limits -- top-management strategy sessions, discussions about links with outside retailers like Borders and Toys "R" Us, and negotiations, if any are occurring, to raise more capital or restructure its debt.
Even so, a clear picture emerged of a company wrestling at every level with turning growth into profits. Many of the meetings and decisions in the first week of May concentrated on coping with the torrent of data from a new accounting system that for the first time calculates how much money Amazon makes or loses on each product it sells. The system takes into account the company's cost to ship, the frequency of returns and 47 other factors.
Executives found that more than 10 percent of the products sold from the electronic, kitchen and tool departments lost money, while 5 percent of the book, music and video products were losers. So the company is looking for ways to cut those losses. It is pressing manufacturers for better deals and finding more efficient packaging for bulky products. In some cases, it is raising prices or eliminating unprofitable products. And it is looking to have other companies handle warehousing and shipping of some products on its behalf -- something it once rejected outright.
Ananth Raman, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied retailers' operations, said other companies had been able to increase profits by 2 to 19 percent of sales by studying profitability per product and using the other tactics that Amazon is talking about. But such tools are notoriously difficult.
"There is no silver bullet," he said. "They are talking about doing the right things. But that doesn't mean they are doing them right."

9 a.m. Thursday, May 3
"This is a controversial project," Lyn Blake reminds the half-dozen executives she had convened. "The publishers are unaware of what we are doing."
Amazon has worked hard for years to convince publishers and other product makers to sell goods to it directly, rather than forcing it to pay higher prices from wholesalers.
Now, Ms. Blake tells her group, Amazon can actually do better by buying many of its books from distributors, which offer quicker turnaround and allow Amazon to keep less inventory. Distributors are also less prone to making the kinds of shipping errors that wind up costing Amazon much money to sort out, she said.
"Operationally needy," is how Ms. Blake describes the systems of most of the publishing houses.
She would know. Ms. Blake spent 10 years in publishing, most recently as vice president for sales at Macmillan. She joined Amazon in January 2000 as the head of its book business and quickly used her inside knowledge to secure better deals from publishers.
Those moves, along with price increases on best sellers, have substantially improved Amazon's margins. (Its book, music and video business actually started making money last summer and its gross profit -- the markup minus cost of excess inventory -- rose from 20 percent in 1999 to 25 percent last year.) In January, Ms. Blake was put in charge of relations with all vendors.
At the meeting this day, one aide, Michael Seifert, reviews the costs and benefits of using distributors for two dozen major publishers. For all but four, he says, Amazon should deal only with distributors.
"Even for super big items?" Ms. Blake asks incredulously, wondering whether Amazon should rely on a wholesaler for the next Harry Potter phenomenon.
"Yes, that's what the analysis says," Mr. Seifert answers.
Ms. Blake, concerned about possible limits on quantities available from distributors, adds, "If there are any allocation issues at all we go out and buy them directly," from publishers.
Besides having distributors supply books to its warehouses, Amazon is preparing to take the more radical step of hiring the Ingram Book Group, the book distribution giant, to mail books directly to customers.
In some ways, that makes perfect sense. Why should Amazon unpack a book sent by a distributor, only to repack it and send it to a customer? But competitors argue, as had Amazon, that outside arrangements are too risky.
"I can't see entrusting our customer relationships to an outside company," said Steve Riggio, the acting chief executive of Barnesandnoble.com. "If things go wrong you are in for a pot of trouble."
Ms. Blake, however, counters that, "You won't be able to tell if a book is sent from our center in Fernley, Nev., or Ingram in Laverne, Tenn."
While Amazon moves away from direct relationships with publishers, its electronics business has a different problem. It remains handicapped because it is not an authorized dealer for many of the biggest makers of audio and video equipment, and it cannot get expensive products from wholesalers.
"Saying you are in the consumer electronics business without Sony is like being in the sneaker business without Nike," said Greg Drew, chief executive of 800.com, an online electronics store. "Not to have Sony and Panasonic and Kenwood and Pioneer and Toshiba is completely pretending." Amazon contends that as its sales grow, even stubborn manufacturers will have to join in.

10 a.m. Thursday, May 3
Ms. Blake and the others have packed up their notebooks and reconvened in another room on the seventh floor of the office building that Amazon calls "US1," because it houses sales operations for the United States. The rhythm of the day is like high school without the bells. If this is second period on Thursday, it must be the United States merchandising meeting.
Item No. 5 on today's agenda is meeting rationalization. Ms. Blake has handed out an elaborate grid of 26 regular meetings and who attends them. David Risher, Amazon's senior vice president in charge of United States retail businesses, who has popped in to watch, barks out: "You should draw a line through one-third of those meetings."
At the end of the meeting, participants must volunteer some way in which they are contributing to "the march to profitability."
"We've had a much more liberal return policy than our competitors and we may tighten it up a bit," says Cindy Ruppenthal, who works in the electronics area. It is expensive to handle returns of products that may contain dozens of individual parts in a box, she says. If something is missing, Amazon must then fight it out with customers. She says her group is looking to hire an outside company to retrieve expensive returns from customers' homes. That way, there can be no dispute about the product's condition.
There is much discussion about using outside companies at Amazon these days -- for service, for product shipping, and even more broadly, to sell products on its site. Amazon already sells Toys "R" Us products alongside its own. In that deal, Amazon handles toy shipping, but it may not do so with other companies. It may link with another big store chain to add an entirely new department, but it will also turn to smaller companies to fill in corners of its product line it doesn't want to handle.
So a customer may see a VCR sold directly by Amazon, but a large-screen television offered by an outside company. The template for this is already visible in Amazon's used-product offerings. On many Web pages on which it sells books, CD's and other products, an advisory informs the customer that the same product is available used. Clicking a button takes the shopper to a list of individuals and dealers whose prices are often substantially lower. (Amazon earns a 15 percent commission on their sales.) Soon, Amazon will start selling new products using the same format.
"We are committed to universal selection," Mr. Risher said. "But if we can't sell something profitably, we'll find someone who can."

4 p.m. Thursday, May 3
Amazon's corporate headquarters is in the Pacific Medical Center, an Art Deco former hospital perched on a steep hill overlooking Safeco Field. Unlike US1, which is filled with windowless compartments, the headquarters has bright offices with panoramic views of the city.
One such room is occupied by Maryam Mohit, a vice president for Web site development.
When she joined Amazon in 1996, her job was to add features to the site that would entertain customers and sell more merchandise. Now the tasks are more prosaic. They include redesigning the site to reduce the number of times that customers need to contact Amazon customer service.
Eight people are assembled in Ms. Mohit's office to go over problem areas of the site.
"It was really bad," says Jess Scheibach, a project manager who found that three-fourths of customers who had tried to change their passwords had failed to do so. She reports that a few changes in the layout of the password change page doubled the success rate.

10:30 a.m. Friday, May 4
Taymour Tamaddon, finance manager for Amazon's electronics, kitchen and tool departments, is the hero of the day. Using an Excel spreadsheet, he created a system meant to provide a precise proposal for how each product can be made more profitable. It is the culmination of months of work in the company.
Last December, in what has become an oft-repeated story, Mr. Bezos toured a warehouse and noticed that workers needed 15 minutes to assemble a special box to hold the company's best-selling patio chair.
He returned to the office and banned products that were so expensive to handle or ship that they could not be profitably sold. 
Rather than simply searching for a handful of other egregious examples, the company built the computer model that calculates the pretax profit, or contribution margin, for each product. The task was hardly easy. A team spent six weeks weighing and measuring 30,000 products to come up with accurate shipping and packing costs. Others tallied calls to customer service about products. (Complex ones, like digital cameras,generated far more calls, say, than music CD's.) 
This day, Mr. Tamaddon shows how the system analyzed a $10 pack of Polaroid instant film. It starts with a reasonable margin, but after all the costs of handling the product, Amazon loses $1 a pack.
"Consider bundling," the computer read, suggesting that single packs be combined, to sell two or more. Or, the computer program suggested, the company should find another merchant to handle and ship the film. In other cases, the computer recommended keeping tighter reign on inventory, pressing the vendor for more discounts, or raising prices.
Ms. Ruppenthal perks up at the recommendation of price increases, saying there is danger in raising prices too much.
"We need some loss leaders," she says, using the retail term for merchandise intentionally sold at a loss. "It creates customer satisfaction."
But Carl Gish, the manager of the electronics store, complains, "I saw the data, and the number of loss leaders is ridiculous."
He asks if the system could focus more on automatic price raising. "We took our prices down to meet competition," he says. "But we didn't bring prices back up as the competition went away."
Rather than relying only on detailed analysis to find unprofitable products, Amazon also created an electronic form that employees can fill out to describe problem products.
For example, Amazon was selling a $9 candle holder -- a large glass bowl containing rocks. It was meant to be filled with water that would float the candles. One customer returned the product four times because the rocks had shattered the glass during each shipment. That product is no longer part of "earth's biggest selection."
One question raised by this and many other examples, of course, is this: What was Amazon thinking to begin with? In retrospect, a glass bowl of rocks seems an unsuitable product for a mail-order company. Or, why did Amazon build five warehouses when it could easily hire companies like Ingram Books to handle much of its shipping?
Mr. Bezos's response is that, yes, inefficiency was all part of the plan. "We made a very deliberate decision to overbuild, although we hoped we were overbuilding by a little bit," he said. "If we hadn't done that, we would have disappointed customers, as a lot of Internet companies did, and we wouldn't be around anymore."

Profitable or Not? It Depends on Who's Measuring
IT will dominate retailing around the world. Or it will be the Internet's most spectacular flameout.
There are few companies that provoke as wide a range of passionate predictions as Amazon.com. And that is hardly a surprise; few companies have tried to do so much so fast while losing so much money.
The current state of Amazon's finances only intensifies the puzzle. Like many other technology and retail companies, Amazon now says its sales will grow far more slowly this year than it had expected. But at the same time, its profit margins are widening and its expenses are falling faster than it and others expected.
That makes it more likely that the company will meet its goal of breaking even, by its idiosyncratic measure of pro forma operating profit, in the fourth quarter of 2001.
That is not the toughest standard it could set. Amazon's pro forma profit excludes $33 million a quarter in interest on $2.1 billion in debt, severance payments and other expenses from restructuring, and accounting charges related to investment losses, stock options and acquisitions.
Moreover, sales volume drives Amazon's profit, so the holiday season should be its best. (It will not say if it will remain profitable next year.) Then again, its pro forma fourth-quarter loss was $175 million in 1999 and $60 million in 2000, so there is room for improvement.
There are signs that Amazon is moving in the direction it wants. 
Amazon's brightest area is gross profit, or revenue minus the cost of goods sold. Gross profit is reduced by any inventory write-offs and by shipping charges, because shipping fees are included in revenue.
Amazon's gross profit, which was 18 percent in 1999 and 24 percent in 2000, increased to 26 percent in the first quarter of this year.
The margin may be helped by Amazon's effort to cut inventory and to further reduce the number of orders shipped in more than one box.
The company's other costs are declining somewhat. It is sharply cutting back on marketing, and its fulfillment costs -- mainly the expense of running its warehouses -- were at 14 percent of sales in the first quarter, down from 17 percent in 2000.
Warren Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, pointed out that total expenses for United States operations decreased by 9 percent in the first quarter, from the previous year, even as sales increased 11 percent.
While analysts expect a small loss in the fourth quarter, rather than the break-even that Amazon predicts, many say the goal is within reach. 
The far bigger question is whether Amazon can return to growing without sacrificing profitability. 
Its international operations are still a drag, losing $34 million in the first quarter. And it is not clear when they will be profitable. Growth in the United States, meanwhile, is slowing. In the first quarter, its book, music and video sales, still its largest segment, increased by only 2 percent. Analysts have also started to notice a distressing churn in its customer base. One-third of its 30 million customers have not made purchases in the last year.
MANY critics contend that Amazon has fundamentally picked an impossible proposition.
"Their model just doesn't work," said Claire Gruppo, president of Gruppo Levey & Company, a New York investment bank specializing in direct marketing companies.
A good catalog merchant, she said, has fulfillment costs of 11 percent (compared with Amazon's 14 percent) and, more important, gross margins in excess of 50 percent (versus Amazon's 26 percent). 
Mr. Jenson counters that with high volume and rapid inventory turnover, Amazon can make money on far lower gross margins than the typical catalog company.
"You can either charge a lot and sell a few units, or you sell a lot of units with a small margin," he said. "We think the latter is a bigger business." SAUL HANSELL

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Amazon.com's efforts to become profitable misidentified the Tennessee town that is headquarters to the Ingram Book Group, a distributor hired by the company to mail books directly to customers. It is La Vergne, not Laverne. 
The article also misstated the reason an Amazon.com office building in Seattle is named "US1." The name stands for Union Station 1, part of an office complex. It is not Amazon's abbreviation for the building that houses the company's United States sales operations.

Eliminate unprofitable items Amazon will stop selling products that are too bulky, too heavy or too prone to breakage (as with the glass candleholder with rocks, above). Improve the margin For money-losing products, Amazon will try to convince manufacturers to lower prices. If that's not enough it will raise its prices to consumers. Reduce warehouse errors Amazon's six big distribution centers are essentially factories that pack thousands of boxes a day. The company will try anything that speeds the conveyor belt and reduces sorting mixups. Use others to do the dirty work The Ingram Book Group will send some orders directly to Amazon customers. Increasingly, Amazon wants other companies to stock, ship and sell some of its products, like big television sets. Make customers help themselves Amazon has already cut customer service costs by hiring people in India to answer e-mail. It is also redesigning its Web site to prevent questions in the first place.(pg. 14)

HEADLINE: Recasting the Iraq Sanctions 

 BODY:
Recognizing that the international embargo on trade with Iraq has become increasingly untenable, the United States and Britain will soon propose a reasonable narrowing of the sanctions to bar the shipment of arms and weapons-related material to Saddam Hussein's regime. Even nations that are weary of the 11-year ban on trade with Iraq should support restrictions designed to prevent Baghdad from rearming and once again threatening its neighbors. But Washington and London will have to make a concerted diplomatic offensive if they hope to prevail at the United Nations Security Council and gain Mr. Hussein's assent for a plan that would return international weapons inspectors to Iraq. 
 A decade after the Persian Gulf war, most of the world has lost interest in isolating Iraq. Some nations are lured toward complacency by short memories of Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the prospect of profitable business deals with Baghdad. The change in attitude is shortsighted, but with permanent members of the Security Council like France, Russia and China anxious to abandon the embargo, the United States and Britain have no choice but to fashion a new approach. 
 Under the British-American proposal, the Security Council would develop a specific list of military and industrial items that would be banned from sale to Iraq. Iraq would still be required to deposit all its legitimate oil revenues in an escrow account controlled by the U.N. Yet the country would be free to import whatever nonmilitary goods it wished, effectively ending the embargo on civilian commodities. The U.N. has permitted Iraq to import food, medicine and other essential items, but Mr. Hussein has cynically limited such purchases to stoke foreign complaints about the hardships the embargo has inflicted on the Iraqi people.
In return for a relaxation of the trade ban, Mr. Hussein would have to allow the U.N. to resume weapons inspections, which have been suspended since 1998. He is unlikely to accept the deal unless he is convinced that the Security Council is united in its determination to maintain an arms embargo and will not set aside the broader trade restrictions until he lets inspectors back into Iraq to monitor weapons programs. He may well reject the plan even if faced with an undivided Security Council, but there will be no hope of obtaining his agreement if France, Russia and China remain wobbly.
The plan will also prove unworkable if nearby nations like Syria, Iran, Turkey and Jordan are unwilling to enforce the prohibition on arms sales by carefully inspecting overland cargo shipments to Iraq. All these nations now openly permit the smuggling of banned goods in and out of Iraq. 
If the new diplomatic initiative fizzles, President Bush is sure to face escalating pressures to support Iraqi efforts to unseat Mr. Hussein. American financial assistance might be appropriate if there were an organized, well-led opposition within Iraq, or in the Iraqi exile community, but that is not the case. Mr. Bush should not entertain any proposals to use American military forces or weapons in concert with Mr. Hussein's foes. 
Engineering a change in governments is easy to champion but extremely difficult to execute, even in the rare cases when it may be justified and consistent with American principles. A bungled program to remove Mr. Hussein from power would embarrass the United States and recklessly endanger the lives of Iraqis who would like to see a democratic government installed in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: The $4 Trillion Tax Cut 

 BODY:
Soon after the Congress passed President Ronald Reagan's big tax cut in 1981, a few in the administration realized that their achievement amounted to a Pyrrhic victory. The tax cut, as it was taken up by lawmakers, grew out of all proportion, creating huge deficits that strangled the budget and the economy for nearly 15 years. Exactly the same prospect is in store if Congress approves the misshapen, misconceived tax cut now racing through Capitol Hill. The Senate is aiming to conclude its version of the tax cut this week, with President Bush hoping to sign it into law by Memorial Day. Yet with every passing day, the tax cut's flaws become more obvious. 
 A week ago, it looked as if the Senate would approach the tax cut with somewhat more restraint than the House, which rubber-stamped Mr. Bush's original proposal of a $1.6 trillion tax reduction over 10 years. A handful of moderate Democrats led by Senator Max Baucus of Montana persuaded the Republican leadership to scale the size back to $1.35 trillion and add some provisions favoring taxpayers of moderate means. The best amendment they added would make the higher child credit partially refundable as a payment to Americans who pay no income taxes. But upon inspection it is also clear that, in terms of scale, the so-called bipartisan tax cut before the Senate merely purports to be more responsible than Mr. Bush's proposal. In reality, its cost is staggering and it poses a serious danger to the basic federal safety net over the next 20 years. 
 The tax cut's $1.35 trillion price tag is a deception. The figure was calculated with an array of artificial devices that disguise the true cost. Some of the tax cuts to be enacted abruptly expire before the 11-year period is up, even though everyone knows that there will be pressure to let them continue. Other provisions are phased in slowly, with most of them not fully enacted until 2009, 2010 and 2011. This means that although the tax cut technically costs $1.35 trillion in the first decade, its cost in the second decade -- when the baby boomers will all be retired -- is more than $4 trillion. The tax cut cannot be paid for except by raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It is a scheme that seems deliberately aimed at wrecking the basic American retirement programs, perhaps to force their dismantling or privatization.
Most inexplicable is why many Democrats and Republicans who have stood by the social safety net for years seem ready to shred it now. On the Democratic side, Senators John Breaux of Louisiana, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas joined with Senator Baucus to approve this tax cut in the Finance Committee. Some Democrats say cynically that because so much of this tax cut does not take effect until many years from now, there will be plenty of time to rescind its most expensive features, so why not vote for it now? That is not an argument so much as an abdication of responsibility.
In trying to ram this tax cut through, the Republican leadership has made a mockery of Senate rules. When the Senate parliamentarian ruled against several attempts by Trent Lott, the majority leader, to advance the tax cut and budget, Mr. Lott dismissed him. Last week, there was no tax bill available until the night before the Senate was to begin voting on amendments. No time was allowed for the bipartisan Joint Taxation Committee or other outsiders to draw up detailed cost estimates. The White House and Mr. Lott clearly feel that time is their enemy. The more this tax cut is examined, the more its support will erode.
Take the argument that this tax cut is geared to the economy, and to the middle class hit by credit-card debt and energy bills. If that is the argument, why is only a pittance to be distributed in the next year? Why is more than a third of the tax cut going to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, who pay about a quarter of all federal taxes? Why, most of all, the need for haste? This is a tax cut that is so costly, so focused on the wealthiest Americans and so certain to drain vital resources for basic government services that few Americans who had a chance to scrutinize it would let Congress get away with it. Now it is in danger of becoming law without Americans' even realizing its defects.

HEADLINE: The World; 
In a Land of Sun and Music, CD Pirates Play Robin Hood

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
WHEN the United States government and the American recording industry complain about rampant piracy of intellectual property rights, the kind of scene they have in mind is Avenida Paulista, the main shopping street here in Brazil's largest city. The latest releases of Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 or the Back Street Boys can cost up to $14.50 in record shops here, but that doesn't stop anyone from hearing them. Street vendors, operating from simple metal stands, offer the same titles for $2.75.
 As the Recording Industry Association of America and the Bush administration see it, the situation is easily defined: record companies face calamity in Brazil because Brazil's government isn't doing enough to protect copyrights. 
 Ask Brazilians about the problem, though, and you will hear a very different view -- one that offers an insight into the twists that economic logic produces when a third world country confronts globalized pricing and distribution of a product that it consumes with a passion. 
This is, after all, a country that defines and expresses itself through song as much as any other in the world, which means that Brazilians view any attempt to limit access to music as an attack on their culture and national identity. So the battle here over CD pricing is much more than a mere dispute over terms of trade.
In fact, it is Brazil's deep tradition of musicality that has attracted record companies and artists here to begin with. Brazilians have won the Grammy award for World Music for four consecutive years. And foreign performers like Paul Simon, Sting, David Byrne, Peter Gabriel and Rod Stewart have made what the Brazilian pop star Gilberto Gil sardonically calls "cultural safaris" here, looking for exotic rhythms and harmonies to reinvigorate their own music.
All of this figures in the outrage voiced here whenever CD prices are discussed.
"It is the avarice, the unyielding rapaciousness of the record companies that foments the violation of recording copyrights in Brazil," said Nehemias Gueiros Jr., an intellectual property rights lawyer and former record company executive. "When you have a predatory price policy incompatible with the economic reality of a country, then you are simply paving the way for piracy."
In the old days of vinyl, before the record industry had fully awakened to the Brazilian market's potential, local companies had more leeway. So the prices were more in line with what Brazilians earn -- about one-tenth, on average, of what North Americans earn. These days, five major foreign-owned companies dominate the music market here, and on average, a CD costs only slightly less than in the United States.
Typically, hit CD's by American performers cost even more than those of Brazilian artists, a fact that might seem to violate the basic principles of Economics 101.
Theoretically, American companies could discount their offerings here to stimulate demand, since those records long ago paid off their costs with sales at home. But Marcio Goncalves, the director-general of the Brazilian Association of Record Manufacturers, said it doesn't work that way. A higher price is needed, he said, because otherwise "artists would cancel their contracts and move to another label" in protest. In addition, others point out, the globalization of markets makes it possible for a lower price here to undermine prices at home.
"The higher price for recordings here is maintained not so much with Brazil itself in mind, but to avoid sales to the United States and Western Europe," said Antonio Carlos Manfredini, an economist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil's leading economic research institute. "It's simply not worth it to them to threaten their markets in the North by means of aggressive pricing in Brazil."
As a result, record company profit margins in Brazil may be even higher than they are in the United States. Mr. Gueiros, who worked at Sony and BMG before opening his own law firm and boutique record label in Rio de Janeiro, calculates that the average producer's cost of a CD in Brazil, which includes royalties that are kept lower than in the United States, is less than $3.
BUT in another sense, the approach backfires, because it has helped pirates gain an estimated 40 percent of the CD market. Brazil remains the world's sixth-largest market for legal CD'S, with 104 million sold last year, but those numbers work out to less than one for each of the country's 170 million people. Economists and others with market experience argue that sales would zoom and piracy decline if the record companies would trade profit per unit for volume.
"The first thing you learn as a musician in a poor country like this one is that you can charge $2 for a ticket to a show and play to a full house or charge $3 and look at empty seats," said Joao Luiz Lobao, a pop star who is a critic of the recording industry here. "It's a matter of simple economics, but all those highly paid record executives don't seem to understand it."
THE situation has obvious parallels with the Napster controversy in the United States, in which the recording industry is trying to block free distribution of music over the Internet so that record companies can preserve their own ability to sell music for a fee. While court rulings so far have largely favored the record companies, the judge in the case has offered critics of the industry something of a rallying cry. "There is no such thing as a free lunch," Judge Marilyn H. Patel has said. "But sometimes lunch is more expensive than it should be."
The Brazilian government has made similar arguments in another dispute with the United States, over patents on drugs used to treat AIDS -- a global dispute in which American drug companies have recently made concessions on pricing in the third world in light of the health crisis AIDS represents there.
In the less desperate but nevertheless emotional matter of music, just as with pharmaceuticals, Brazilians and other Latin Americans are quick to paint such disputes as the continuation of a pattern that dates to colonial days, in which North America and Europe cheaply obtain raw materials here (for example, musical ideas and rare substances from the rain forests) and sell back finished goods (CD's and sophisticated drugs) at exorbitant prices. 
But if resentment that the record companies are acting like a cartel is strong here, it does not mean there is a likelihood of any firm action soon to solve the problem. 
"Institutions in Brazil are fragile, and they are fragile on both sides," Dr. Manfredini said. "In a low-income country, the regulatory authorities have difficulty protecting the rights of both producers and consumers, and so there is not an institutional structure to control price fixing and other abuses" perpetrated by the same companies that complain that their rights are not being protected when piracy results.
There is also the matter of payola, a practice long outlawed in the United States. "Part of the marketing budget goes to obtain airplay, which not only makes the cost of records higher but results in an artificially imposed cultural dictatorship that distorts the evolution of Brazilian music," said Mr. Lobao.
So the field remains ripe for CD piracy, and there seems little chance that measures like the recent formation of an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Piracy -- one response to the American pressure -- will stem it.
"Any economist recognizes that the protection of intellectual property rights is important, but the situation is far more complicated than the record companies are willing to admit," said Dr. Manfredini. "You can't take the word of the fox when he is talking about the chicken coop."

HEADLINE: Team Bush: Partisan but Nimble 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was the morning after Congress took a big step toward giving President Bush much of his proposed tax cut, but the plan's primary architect, Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief White House economic policy adviser, already had other things on his mind.
 The commission appointed by Mr. Bush to develop a plan for private investment accounts in Social Security needed office space, background material and a schedule, Mr. Lindsey was told at his daily staff meeting on the second floor of the West Wing. 
 Other issues followed in quick succession: Delta Air Lines seemed headed toward a showdown with striking pilots at its Comair subsidiary. And the leading industrial nations were establishing a task force to study how to give low-income people better access to computers. 
A few minutes later, Mr. Lindsey headed into a meeting on the administration's policy toward government-chartered, shareholder-owned corporations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a topic of intense interest to Wall Street, the mortgage industry and financial regulators. That afternoon, he went downstairs to the Oval Office, to brief the president on energy policy, then to a meeting about overhauling Medicare.
Having watched his father lose the presidency in part because of how he handled the recession of the early 1990's, Mr. Bush has kept economic issues front and center in his administration. And that has put a particular focus -- and onus -- on Mr. Lindsey and the rest of Mr. Bush's team of economic advisers, including the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, and the budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.
The president came to office with an agenda full of proposals to reshape economic policy along conservative lines: cutting taxes, restraining government spending, giving people the chance to invest their Social Security money, expanding free trade, reducing regulation. 
Mr. Bush and his advisers also inherited a slowing economy and all the political risk that comes with it. And they have been confronted with the kinds of unexpected challenges -- like threatened airline strikes, rolling blackouts in California and rising gasoline prices -- that can overshadow or derail even the best-planned agenda. 
Four months after inauguration day, it is too early to judge the team's performance. Its ultimate grade may hinge more than anything else on the depth and duration of the current business cycle downturn, something that is largely out of the administration's control. 
"You're asking about a three-point shot that's still in the air," Mr. O'Neill said.
But the team has avoided the distracting stumbles into unwanted controversies that plagued President Bill Clinton during his first months in office. And it has set into motion many of the biggest items on its to-do list, heartening conservatives with its focus on smaller government, deregulation and individual responsibility.
To the president's ideological opponents, the team's approach is fiscally irresponsible, a payoff to its corporate patrons and an effort to repackage right-wing policies in a centrist guise.
But even some of the administration's harshest critics say they have been impressed by the discipline and political touch that the president and his team have brought to pursuing their agenda, especially the tax cut. 
They say the team has been particularly nimble in turning events to its favor. When the economy turned downward, Mr. Bush's tax plan, originally presented as a way to send the federal budget surplus back to taxpayers, became an antirecession program. When gasoline prices surged, the tax cut became a subsidy to help consumers cope with rising energy costs. And Mr. Bush's support for more oil and gas drilling became the solution to the rolling blackouts afflicting California.
"Tenacity and focus and consistency are the most important aspects of a new presidency," said Robert B. Reich, who was secretary of labor in Mr. Clinton's first term. 
"This team has been remarkably effective, unified and focused on getting a huge tax cut," Mr. Reich said. "They've spoken with one voice. They have refused to compromise when that was helpful to them and compromised when they had to. And they've done it without igniting strong public opposition so far."
It is a team heavy on corporate and Washington experience, with a strong ideological bent but no close ties to the epicenter of the market economy, Wall Street. 
While it has championed free markets and sought to portray itself as above special-interest politics, it has proved willing to pursue a limited industrial policy in some cases, as in its support for shielding operators of nuclear power plants from liability or in providing government subsidies for clean-coal technology. And while many of its members came to office espousing a policy of blocking international bailouts of countries that get into financial trouble, the Bush team has already backed new International Monetary Fund loans to one strategically important ally, Turkey, and is supporting a package being negotiated by another economically struggling nation, Argentina.

Getting Their Feet Wet
Most of the economic advisers are still settling into their jobs. At the Treasury Department, Mr. O'Neill spent his first few months on the defensive over his early remarks on the dollar (he is still establishing his credibility with the financial markets as a defender of a strong currency) and a flap over whether he could hold onto his stock in Alcoa, the company he ran for 13 years (he eventually decided to sell it).
At the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Daniels has brought a political sensibility to the often arcane world of spending plans and regulation, but he remains little known outside conservative Republican circles.
Josh Bolten, the deputy White House chief of staff, indulges a renegade streak by riding a motorcycle, but is one of Mr. Bush's most trusted policy advisers. The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, has as much experience in foreign and economic policy as any Republican in Washington, and his behind-the-scenes role in the Florida election uproar showed that he is a skilled partisan as well.
Many other appointees will play important roles, too. John B. Taylor, who is awaiting confirmation as under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, is sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is eager to put economic research to work on behalf of Mr. Bush's professed philosophy of "compassionate conservatism."
The team has two important honorary members. One is Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a voice in nearly all domestic policy matters, as he does in foreign policy. The other is Mr. Greenspan, who has close relationships with Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Lindsey and has made no secret of his support for major elements of the Bush agenda, including tax cuts, Social Security investment accounts and free trade. Indeed, when Mr. Bush made his first trip to Washington as president-elect, Mr. Greenspan was the first person with whom he met.

The Early Leader
The relative influence of the economic team's various members is difficult to assess this early in the administration. But for now, the hub of policy-making is Mr. Lindsey's paneled office a floor above the Oval Office.
Whatever influence Mr. Lindsey wields -- and outsiders who have dealt with the White House say it is considerable -- is partly a function of his role as director of the National Economic Council. The council coordinates policy across cabinet departments and agencies, not only on highly visible issues like tax cuts but also on the full array of economic and business issues that confront the White House, including those involving trade, the financial markets, technology, labor, regulation and the budget.
But Mr. Lindsey's power is derived more from his close relationship to Mr. Bush. A former Federal Reserve governor and a policy aide in the administration of the president's father, Mr. Lindsey, 46, signed on early as the Bush campaign's economics expert and more than anyone else was the author of the tax-cut plan.
He is also ideologically compatible with Mr. Bush, leaning slightly to the left of conservative orthodoxy just often enough to buttress the president's compassionate-conservative theme. He persuaded Mr. Bush to use his tax-cut plan to address quirks in the tax code that take a big bite from the earnings of low-income working people, especially single parents. 
But in most ways, his ideological view is traditional. To a conservative like himself, he said, the greatest threat is "the overweening bureaucrat with the power of the state behind him who may be unchecked in his ability to tell someone how to run his life."
Mr. Lindsey says that any suggestion that he has any particular influence with Mr. Bush is exaggerated, and that his main role is to forge consensus on issues before they reach the president. But people inside and outside the administration say Mr. Lindsey's view on what that consensus should be is often heeded, partly because he has a good sense of what Mr. Bush wants. 
While it is difficult to say when his view is the deciding one, Mr. Lindsey rarely seems to be on the losing side of a debate. This year, he argued in favor of dropping Mr. Bush's campaign position that industrial emissions of carbon dioxide should be regulated -- and the position was dropped. 
Along with Mr. O'Neill, he pushed successfully to withdraw American support for an international push to crack down on tax havens in the Caribbean, saying the effort was intended to discourage competition among nations to offer lower tax rates. 
On many economic issues, Mr. Lindsey is the last to offer an opinion to Mr. Bush. He meets with the president at least three times a week for formal economic briefings, where, he said, Mr. Bush often starts by asking, "Hey Lindsey, when are we going to get some good news?"
Mr. Lindsey has long had a bearish economic outlook. He sold all his stocks in 1998, saying he wanted to be able to sleep at night, and during the campaign he urged Mr. Bush to think about an inevitable downturn.
As a result, the new administration was ready to sell its tax plan as an economic stimulus plan when it became clear that the long expansion was faltering.
"I was somewhat skeptical about the late 1990's, and I had a view that at some point there would be an adjustment," Mr. Lindsey said. "You deal with the hand you're dealt, and one of the first things you do is say, 'This is the hand.' You don't try to bluff your way through. You don't say everything is fine. You say, 'These are the facts, and I have a program that knows how to deal with the facts.' "
For now, he said, he sees the economy balanced between a relatively healthy consumer sector and a downturn in technology investment, yielding "subpar growth, in the zero to 2 percent range." He said that economists should be humble enough not to predict when conditions might change -- but that he was optimistic for the long run.

Not One to Play Games
At a hearing a few weeks ago before a House appropriations subcommittee, Mr. O'Neill was asked about heavy overtime being worked by the Secret Service, which is part of the Treasury Department. Mr. O'Neill, who knows his way around government from a stint in Washington in the 1970's, gave a polished answer, including the news that he had cut back on his own security detail to save money and to free agents for more pressing needs.
But his performance that day was something of an exception. In his first few months on the job, Mr. O'Neill has gained a reputation for blunt talk, impatience with the elaborate political dance that is necessary to get anything done in Washington and a tin ear for the nuances of policy debates.
At his confirmation hearing, he said he was "not going to make a huge case" that Mr. Bush's tax cut was an effective way to keep the economy out of recession -- at a time when Mr. Bush was making just such a case.
On taking office, Mr. O'Neill decided that he should be able to keep the $100 million in Alcoa stock that he had amassed as chief executive, only to change his mind after it became clear that he would face constant questions about potential conflicts of interest. 
As for the debate within the administration on global climate change, he has been criticized by conservatives as not being sufficiently opposed to regulating industrial emissions. And an article in The Wall Street Journal portrayed him as spending considerable time studying worker safety issues at the Treasury Department.
A result has been a sense outside the administration that Mr. O'Neill is less of a force in the big policy debates than many people had expected him to be, given his success at Alcoa and his long ties to Mr. Greenspan, who as an Alcoa director in the 1980's helped Mr. O'Neill land his job there. 
"The perception is that he's not as much involved as one would expect the Treasury secretary to be, given the nature of the agenda," said Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.
The perception is not entirely fair. Whatever his influence, Mr. O'Neill is very much at the center of the action within the administration. He briefs the president regularly and meets for an hour or two a week with Mr. Greenspan, who worked with him at the White House during the Ford administration, when he was deputy budget director. Mr. O'Neill also participates in National Security Council meetings and is host for a regular lunch at the Treasury Department that includes Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Bolten and other officials like Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary.
"I don't feel I've ever been left out of something I should have been involved in, or included in something that was a waste of my time," Mr. O'Neill said. "Having been involved in a lot of other administrations, this one has a nice developing balance about the way we work together. There's a lot of collegiality and volunteered respect among the participants."
So far, Mr. O'Neill has been dealing with an agenda that was set before he joined Mr. Bush's team, especially on taxes. He may have his best opportunity to make his own mark as the administration turns to international economic affairs, particularly its stance toward the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
He is deeply skeptical about trying to prop up the currencies of countries in financial trouble. And while he sees the international financial institutions as having a role to play, he says the I.M.F. in particular needs to do a better job of heading off crises rather than dealing with them after the fact.
The key to dealing with economic problems in developing nations, he said, is "intervening earlier, which means accepting responsibility for being identified with precautionary action rather than waiting until people's economies are down around their ankles and you rush in like some kind of hero."

A Mechanic Who Can Laugh
Economic policy is usually debated at the lofty plane of the macroeconomy, but it is often carried out at a nuts-and-bolts level. And the ultimate repository of policy hardware in any administration is the Office of Management and Budget, which turns ideology and political compromise into hard numbers and concrete regulation.
In the Bush administration, the man with the wrench is Mr. Daniels, and he has been using it to carry out Mr. Bush's priorities of holding down government spending, streamlining management of government programs and lifting the regulatory demands on business.
A political assistant in the White House under President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Daniels subsequently became an executive at Eli Lilly in his native Indiana, but he stayed active in Republican politics and in promoting supply-side economics.
Last year, he helped run a losing campaign for governor of Indiana, for a conservative Republican, David M. McIntosh, but played no role in the Bush campaign. He was recommended to Mr. Bush by Al Hubbard, an Indiana businessman who is a friend of the president, and within weeks he was helping to write the administration's first budget.
He has already drawn fire from Democrats for championing a tax cut that they consider reckless and spending cuts that they say will hurt the government's ability to address social and economic problems. But if nothing else, he has proved that the administration's chief bean counter has a sense of humor.
Asked during a news conference last month about a proposed cut in the budget of the Energy Department, he said the previous year's budget had been higher than normal because of the costs associated with wildfires near some research laboratories in the West. "We had a big debate at O.M.B. and decided not to start another fire this year," he said. "Therefore we did not renew that particular $500 million expenditure."

First Florida, Now the World
Bob Zoellick, a veteran of the White House and the State and Treasury departments in the two previous Republican administrations, spent much of November and December in Florida, helping Mr. Bush capture the final electoral votes he needed. He is now gearing up for a campaign that could be almost as bloody in political terms: winning authority from Congress for Mr. Bush to negotiate trade agreements.
Expanding trade is a core principle in Mr. Bush's economic plan. But there is a bitter divide in Congress over the issue, reflecting the broader debate in the country and around the world over whether governments should manage the globalization of markets to ease the impact of rapid change on workers, industries and the environment.
His job will be all the more difficult if the economy continues to weaken, driving up the unemployment rate.
Mr. Zoellick says that increasing trade by cutting tariffs is the equivalent of a tax cut in terms of helping a slowing economy, and that businesses are increasingly looking at markets abroad as the domestic market cools off. But he knows that he is in for a fight.
"This is a wonderful opportunity for us to shape the future of the international trading systems, and unfortunately, we're falling behind," he said. "We need to regain momentum globally and regionally and bilaterally. A key element is trying to rebuild support with the Congress and the public."

The Rest of the Team
A number of Mr. Bush's economic aides have lower profiles but are also likely to play crucial roles in policy decisions. At the Council of Economic Advisers, R. Glenn Hubbard will develop the economic rationale for many administration plans, including overhauling the social welfare system and dealing with regulatory issues. A former professor at Columbia University, he is best known for his work supporting the theory that reducing the top income tax rate will generate increased economic activity and for studies suggesting that Americans can move up the economic ladder over their lifetimes.
"I can't imagine being more on the front line," he said.
Mr. Bolten, 46, a former investment banker and general counsel to the United States trade representative in the first Bush administration, works a few doors down from the Oval Office as the deputy chief of staff for policy. He ran Mr. Bush's policy development operation during the campaign, and continues to have a hand in almost every decision on economic-related issues, helping to bring together the substance and the politics on any given topic.
As the Treasury Department's top international official, Mr. Taylor, an economist from Stanford University, will be on the spot the next time an international financial crisis flares. In the past, he has expressed support for encouraging the industrialized nations to coordinate, at least informally, their inflation targets, to help stabilize the relative values of their currencies. And he has advocated shifting the focus at the World Bank from supporting social welfare programs in poor nations to helping them improve productivity and economic growth.
But some economists say Mr. Bush put Mr. Taylor on his team at least partly to groom him for a bigger job. A world authority on monetary policy, Mr. Taylor would probably be near the top of any Republican president's list of possible replacements for Mr. Greenspan, whose current term ends in 2004.

He will need all his experience to overcome opposition to expanding free trade, especially if the economy continues to slow. R. Glenn Hubbard -- Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. A specialist in public finance, he has strong views on the benefits of tax cuts and an interest in the economics behind privatizing Social Security and bringing more competition to the Medicare system. His challenge will be to reassert the council's influence in policy decisions. Josh Bolten -- Deputy White House chief of staff. After coordinating all policy development for the Bush campaign, he has landed the same job in the administration. A lawyer and former investment banker, he is involved in discussions on nearly every issue that comes up in the Oval Office, but keeps a low public profile -- except when riding his Victory motorcycle. John B. Taylor -- Awaiting confirmation as under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. He will be the point person on any global financial crises and will guide policy regarding the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. An authority on monetary policy, he is sure to be in the running if Mr. Bush ever has to replace Mr. Greenspan at the Federal Reserve. RICHARD W. STEVENSON(pg. 13)

The Economist Revamps to Compete Better on the Continent

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 20 

 BODY:
Think of The Economist magazine for most of its 157 years and the temptation is to think of monochrome slabs of dense type offering much the same lofty overview as its editor, Bill Emmott, has of London -- on clear days -- from his 13th-floor corner office.
 But, as of mid-May, as aficionados of this particularly British-cum-global institution already know, The Economist has shifted. Full-color images have penetrated its inner pages. A new index and guides to its sections offer a belated acknowledgment that it was not always the most accessible of publications. A list of Internet sites, available to subscribers, provides links to Web sites, including one that is to be updated between weekly issues of print. The redesign is the first in 14 years and comes only weeks after a similar revamping at the London-edited international edition of Time magazine. The changes illustrate the scramble that is under way among international magazines in Britain and America for a slice of an advertising market that increasingly depends on readers among Europe's growing business and entrepreneurial elite. 
 In recent years, Time and Newsweek, American stalwarts of the international magazine business, have sought to expand European business coverage with extra reporting staff. For the last three years, Fortune International, another unit of Time Inc., has been challenged by the relatively new Forbes Global for the market among European and Asian senior executives.
Business Week, a McGraw-Hill publication, assigned an editor to Paris 18 months ago to steer coverage of the Continent. And, in the thick of this American onslaught on Europe's business audience, The Economist has sought to reverse the trans-Atlantic flow: 300,000 of its 760,000 readers, Mr. Emmott said, are in North America. "The pressure," he said, "is to be different, not the same."
At the core of this clash of the weeklies is a perception of fundamental changes, particularly in Europe, the last decade. "'Everyone has more business coverage, and the market is growing every year," said John Rossant, Business Week's Europe editor in Paris. "There is an equity culture. People own stock. They are interested in corporate leaders."
That reflected a basic shift in Europe's outlook. "During the cold war, the prism through which we viewed the world was geopolitical," said Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International, a Washington Post Company publication. "In today's world, its economics and business."
Not only that, said Bob Crozier, the London-based publisher of Forbes Global, which has a circulation of some 110,000. The market for business magazines, he said, is set to grow as more and more Europeans use English as the lingua franca of business. "English as a second-language is spoken by people under the age of 40," he said. "So you have got this under-40 business elite that's educated and fluent in English," often with the backing of a business education in the United States.
That combination of circumstances has left most organizations with healthy advertising growth. According to a recent survey by Competitive Media Reporting, the advertising revenues of just six international publications in Europe -- Time, The Economist, Newsweek, Fortune, Forbes, Business Week and The International Herald Tribune, which is jointly owned by Washington Post and The New York Times Company -- grew from $183 million in 1996 to $251.9 million last year.
Including a broader range of competitors, said Charlie Crowe, editor in chief of Media and Marketing Europe magazine, the size of the potential European advertising market could be around $700 million.
But there may be gloomier prospects ahead as the United States economy slows, pressure for cost-cutting increases and European growth begins to look patchy. Zenith Media, a British media buying company, says the overall size of the total European magazine ad market, which includes publications ranging from trade to fashion magazines, is set for less-than-stellar growth -- from $18.8 billion this year to $19.8 billion in 2002 and $20.7 billion by 2003.
"You have to change just to stay as strong as you are, and you should not change in a panicky way," Mr. Emmott said of the makeover. "If we hadn't made the change sometime soon, we might have been struggling to keep our circulation growth, so it was an unavoidable cost."
In the last decade, he said, The Economist's circulation rose 69 percent. The redesign will add $5 million to its costs, but, against that, its ad revenue in Europe, excluding Britain, has risen from $59 million in 1996 to $72 million last year, according to the recent C.M.R. survey, compared with Time Atlantic with $76.7 million from a higher European circulation and including British revenues.
The positioning is not just in layout and the old adage that all news is local still has a strong pull. The Economist, Mr. Emmott said, is a global magazine and a proponent of economic globalization and free markets with 80 percent of its sales outside Britain. But, with the first, redesigned issue of May 12 to 18, he chose three different covers for three different regions -- a British election cover for Britain, a Timothy McVeigh cover for the United States and a conservation story for other regions.
At Newsweek International, Mr. Zakaria said, he planned to hire columnists like Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair to write a "Letter from America," giving a foreign view of the United States for a foreign audience. At Business Week, Mr. Rossant said, he might add more European voices in book reviews and comment columns, as Time already does in its Europe, Middle East and Africa edition, which has a circulation of some 630,000.
"Other publications within any category you can think of are domestic plus international," Mr. Emmott said. "But we see ourselves as global." Of course, part of the publication's branding has always been linked to its quirkiness -- two things the redesign left unchanged were the slablike editorials and the absence of bylines for even the most egotistical among its 72 staff journalists.
And it is precisely that authoritative tone and sense of mission as capitalism's guardian that gives the magazine its particular cachet. Just recently, for instance, The Economist published a lengthy investigative article about the corruption charges relating to Silvio Berlusconi, the free-wheeling billionaire who is Italy's newly elected prime minister. "We have been founded for all our history on free markets and classic liberalism," Mr. Emmott said. "That makes it incumbent to blow the whistle when businesses are discrediting capitalism and the liberal system." But wasn't there an element of buzz-generation in choosing such a sensational topic? Certainly not, Mr. Emmott said. "I'm not like Vanity Fair or Talk," he said. "I don't measure response to The Economist by buzz."

Rules of TV Business Change as Network Race Tightens

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
As the broadcast networks wrap up another season and simultaneously start pitching new shows for next season, one conclusion is dominant: everything is changing, from the rules of the television business to the fortunes of each network.
 In the season that will finish this week, CBS became younger, ABC grew older, NBC was dented on its mighty Thursday and Fox edged closer to the top than it has ever been. 
 "Survivor," augmented by the season's biggest new hit, "CSI," remade CBS as a network that really could reach young people -- some of the time.
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," which led ABC to decisive victory last season, dropped off under the weight of four-times-a-week exposure, carrying ABC with it.
NBC had almost no success in the fall but hung on to win another season among the young viewers coveted by advertisers thanks to long-running hits like "ER" and "Law & Order." 
Fox added more shows with youth appeal like "Boston Public" and "Dark Angel" and crept within a few tenths of a rating point of NBC.
The season officially ends on Wednesday with the four-network ratings race closer than it has ever been. As the networks unveiled their plans for next season in elaborate, noisy presentations in New York last week, the sound emerging from behind all the loud bands and confident pronouncements was that of a lot of old rules crashing.

Better the 2nd Time Around
The latest breakthrough idea in programming: repeats. At both Fox and ABC, repeats will occupy regular positions on the fall schedule.
Fox, which has regularly run a weekly repeat of its Saturday series "Cops," filled an 8 p.m. hole this season with a repeat showing of its hit, "That '70s Show" -- with great success. Next season, Fox has a new entry: A "comedy wheel" that will consist of "classic episodes" of such established Fox series as "The Simpsons" and "Malcolm in the Middle." ABC will again use a repeat edition of its sketch show, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" every week.
Sandy Grushow, the chairman of the Fox Entertainment Group, said the need to reach ever more fragmented audiences was driving the same-week repeats. He noted that networks were routinely buying third and fourth runs of hit shows rather than just two.
"I think at some point a network is going to take a night like Saturday, where they can't get arrested, and it's going to start looking like double-run theater," Mr. Grushow said.
An even wider trend is called multiplexing, or double-bursting episodes -- shows that play on the network one night and on a cable network, usually also owned by the network's parent company, the same week. The economics are seductive because second runs on a cable network can offset the financial deficit each show carries.
Among the examples expected next season: "Once and Again," on ABC and Lifetime; "CSI" on CBS and TNN; "Gilmore Girls" on the WB and TNT; "Law & Order: SVU" on NBC and the USA network. Fox is trying to work out a deal, probably with its sister cable channel FX, for a second run of its promising suspense series "24."
The moves are reminiscent of the way HBO runs hit shows like "The Sopranos." Mr. Grushow said. "To some degree, we are moving away from the exclusive model to the aggregate model," he said.

Wake Up to Reality
Mainly used in short-run bursts last season, reality shows are essential parts of fall schedules for next season, with "Survivor" and "The Amazing Race" on CBS, "The Mole II" on ABC and "Temptation Island II" on Fox.
On NBC, after disavowing any plan to emulate ABC's multiple weekly runs of "Millionaire," reneged and will show "Weakest Link" twice a week.
The reason, said Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment: the reality-game genre may be fleeting and the networks need to cash in right away. "I just don't think these programs will ever have the same life span as a show like 'Law & Order' or 'ER,' " Mr. Zucker said.
The shows also do not have an afterlife in syndication, but they cost much less than any other hour-long series to produce. "The economic model is really good," Mr. Zucker said.
Of course, that is only true if the shows succeed. The risk is a reality show that is rejected quickly by viewers but must be played to humiliating completion anyway. NBC learned that bitterly last season with the XFL. 
That performed so disastrously that NBC has taken to describing its competitive position two ways: with the XFL and without the XFL.

Comedy Overruled
Comedy, which reached record numbers on the networks less than a decade ago, looks to be in eclipse, CBS, ABC and NBC will introduce only seven new comedies among them, their lowest combined totals since the early 1980's. Fox, which often zigs while the others zag, is adding three, but that will bring the total number at Fox to 11 (Fox says 12 but it is counting the "comedy wheel," which repeats three of the 11.)
NBC, which hit a high-water mark of 18 four years ago, is now trotting out only eight situation comedies. ABC also will have eight, like NBC, on only two nights. CBS will have but six, also on two nights.
"People are tired of the old setup-joke formula, especially young viewers." said one head of a television production studio, who insisted on anonymity. "If you can't come up with a comedy that has a twist, it's not going to make it."
The legal or crime drama is supplanting the sitcom as the favored genre. While only 16.5 hours of sitcoms are planned next season on the four big networks, more than 20 hours of prime time will contain some legal theme, from the hard-edged, as in "Law & Order," to the far softer, as in bowling-alley law on "Ed."

Movies Moving Out
No more ripped-from-the-headlines sagas or disease-of-the-week?
Maybe not. The network television movie, once such a staple it filled two nights a week on various networks, is apparently all but out of business.
Only CBS will cling to a movie night, Sunday, a night when three networks once battled it out with simultaneous movies. ABC and NBC eliminated made-for-television movies from their regular schedule, with Mr. Zucker declaring the institution dead, "a vestige of the past."
Abysmal ratings are the main reason. But competition is another, with movies now being churned out by myriad cable channels. Fragmentation is a factor. With so many shows on television, Mr. Zucker said, it takes an enormous amount of promotion to break through the clutter.

To 'ER' Is Unforgivable
Haunted by the $13 million an episode that NBC was forced to pay to bring back "ER" three years ago, networks are now trying to make deals that protect them from facing monstrous increases in the license fees for hit shows.
When a network installs itself as a co-producer on a series, as many new shows are now constructed, it is asking for extremely long, or even what is being called perpetual, license deals.
These are intended to cap the price a network will have to pay no matter how successful a show becomes. In exchange, shows are receiving bonuses based on ratings. But the studio head said, in practice, the bonuses turn out to be another negotiation, with a network perhaps cutting the promised bonus in half.
Even shows that are not co-productions with a network are being given terms longer than the formerly traditional four-year initial contracts, some as long as eight years.
But there are still some producers who can demand the four-year deals and win them. "You're not going to get a John Wells or a David Kelley to agree to some extended deal," the studio head said.
Indeed, he said, the threat of another "ER" is not entirely over -- and NBC is again the network in the potential vise. Thanks to the power of Mr. Wells, and his partner, Aaron Sorkin, the hit show "The West Wing" received an initial four-year deal; it enters its third season next year.
"I think it could happen all over again with 'West Wing,' " the studio head said.

 The program, eSniff Solution, is a so-called packet sniffer.

The rush to the Web appears to be slowing, but has the audience peaked or will it keep growing?

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
DESPITE the dismal fate of Internet retailers and their counterparts on the business-to-business front, it seemed inevitable a steady supply of new customers would stampede onto the Web.
 That may yet happen, but the stampede seems to have slowed, at least temporarily. A recent report by Telecommunications Reports International, a Washington research firm, said the number of residential Internet customers declined 0.3 percent last quarter, to 68.5 million. It was the first such decline since the company began tracking online use in 1980, when it monitored users of the Source and MicroNet, a predecessor of CompuServe. 
 The report's author, Gary H. Arlen, who is also president of Arlen Communications, a consulting firm, wrote that last quarter's decline was "a statistical aberration," stemming from the demise of free Internet providers like Spinway and 1stUp, which had served millions of customers before shutting down last year. 
Indeed, while the number of subscribers to free Internet services dropped 19 percent, to 10.3 million, in the first three months of this year, the number of paid Internet users increased. Paid dial-up Internet providers added nearly 8 percent in subscribers in the period, while cable modem providers added 18 percent, and digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., services added 2 percent.
Still, the pace of Internet adoption is slowing, said Amy Fickling, who edits a quarterly census on online use for Telecommunications Reports. The slowing economy could be a factor. "We try not to analyze the behavior behind the hard numbers," she said, "but we've found that the number of users tends to track what the general economy is doing."
The results of the latest census are also noteworthy, Ms. Fickling said, because in years past, the post-holiday months have brought brisk business to Internet providers. "There's usually a real uptick in the first quarter because of the deals that computer manufacturers have worked out with I.S.P.'s," she said, using industry shorthand for Internet service providers. "That just didn't happen this time around."
One reason is that consumers have been buying PC's at a slower rate than in the boom times of the late 90's. Whatever the cause, Ms. Fickling said, she thought the total Internet audience was about to reach saturation. "There may be some shifting around in the numbers, as far as how they access the Internet," she said. "But I don't expect the total audience to keep growing."
Ms. Fickling's views are not necessarily shared by other Internet consultants. Forrester Research, for example, predicts that the total number of United States households connected to the Internet will start to level off in 2004, at 70 million, or about two-thirds of the homes in the nation. And James McQuivey, a Forrester research director, predicts that 80 percent of households will eventually be online.
Mr. McQuivey also cautioned against reading too much into the declining number of users of free Internet providers because two-thirds of those were also subscribers to paid Internet services. "The drop in those who switched off their free I.S.P.'s was made up for by the increase in the paid subscribers" in the first part of this year, he said. A trend will be clearer by the summer, he said, but for now, "the growth is continuing."
Executives at AOL Time Warner give little credence to the notion of a slowdown in Internet connectivity. Marshall Cohen, a senior vice president at AOL Time Warner, said AOL added six million subscribers in the last year, pushing membership over 28 million. "We can't wire all of America, but when you add everything up, like satellite and cable modems, it'll certainly be up there."
And Mr. Cohen doesn't think the economy's slowdown will stall that growth, either. "Even in these times, people will give up other things, like going out," he said. "But the things that are almost a necessity will be pretty safe."
Lauren Levitan, an analyst with the investment bank Robertson Stephens, said the recent change in Internet connectivity patterns "is just a normalization of the curve."
"The spikes we were seeing were stimulated by irrational behavior," Ms. Levitan said, pointing to the free I.S.P.'s as an example of irrational business model. But even if there is a slowdown in new residential Internet connections, she said, "the amount of time people spend on the Web every day will be a far more important statistic over time."
High-speed connections like cable modems and D.S.L. have held out much promise, Ms. Levitan said, but that promise remains unfulfilled. Though people generally spend more time on the Internet when they have these so-called broadband connections, she said, the number who have subscribed to these services has lagged behind most predictions. 
Even with such a comparatively slow adoption of broadband connections, though, people with Internet access have been using the medium more. According to Jupiter Media Metrix, those with Internet connections both at home and at work spent an average of 19 hours a month on the Web in January, an increase of 18 minutes from October. Those with Web access only at work used it about 14 hours a month in January, a decrease of 19 minutes from October. But those with only home connections spent 15 hours a month in January, an increase of 27 minutes. 
If Ms. Levitan's hypothesis is correct, e-commerce companies need not worry about the prospect of a slowdown in residential Internet use. Greg Drew, the chief executive of 800.com, an Internet retailer, noted that "while Internet users are still growing in numbers, the growth on a percentage basis has declined pretty dramatically."
Though this can be expected from any medium that is approaching maturity, Mr. Drew said, he finds solace in other statistics, suggesting that more than half of those online have been online for more than two years.
"Our experience is that, as someone has more experience online, they feel more comfortable engaging in e-commerce," Mr. Drew said. "So even though the growth has slowed, the penetration of sales for those customers is still growing at a very nice pace."
Nonetheless, Mr. Drew said, 800.com had hedged its bets against a possible plateau in the Internet population by doing what many other Internet retailers were doing: mailing catalogs. Last week, for instance, it mailed its second catalog to more than a million homes.
"It does protect us," Mr. Drew said. "We think there's enough headroom in the Internet as a channel that we can continue to grow pretty aggressively, but the catalog activities will continue to bolster our growth."
For traditional merchants that have invested heavily in the Web, the prospect of a flattening of Internet growth poses even less of a problem. Tracy Wan, president of the Sharper Image, the specialty retailer, said the number of Internet users "would have to drop a lot for us to worry."
To reach a broader customer base, Ms. Wan said, the company is building more stores while also mailing out more catalogs. Meanwhile, about half of her Web site's customers are new to Sharper Image. 
"As I reach my potential customers," she said, "they see more potential to shop with us, whether it's on the dot-com, or with a call, or in the bricks-and-mortar."

HEADLINE: Pay Teachers Fairly 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Teacher Salaries Are Said to Lag Behind Inflation" (National Briefing item, May 17): Amid all the talk of student testing, accountability and "educational standards," the fact remains that we need upward of a million new teachers in the next few years and, with a few exceptions, little is being done to recruit them. 
 Clearly, local and state resources are insufficient, and a program at the national level is needed to increase significantly the salaries of our teachers. 
 We are long past the day when we can expect teachers to work for re imbursement that is so far out of line with their importance, much less to work for fewer real dollars each year. Leadership from the White House and Congress is needed, and the time is short.

HEADLINE: German Surprise! Who Are the Guest Workers? 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GLAUCHAU, Germany 

 BODY:
Sweaty and covered with cement dust, Volker Stasiak labored to pick up his speed at laying bricks. 
 "I have been in this business for 23 years, but this is entirely new for me," he said as he spread cement over another layer of bricks. "The bricks are different. The tools are different. The whole system is different." 
 Mr. Stasiak, a construction worker who lives near this eastern German town in Saxony, is in training to build walls in the Netherlands. For five weeks, he has been studying Dutch techniques in bricklaying and carpentry. He has taken a crash course in the Dutch language. 
When he finishes his training at the end of May, he expects to work at Dutch construction sites for at least the next several months.
Mr. Strasiak represents Germany's newest version of the "guest worker" -- a word that for decades referred to the millions of foreigners who were drawn to Germany by the promise of highly paid jobs but who had almost no prospect of citizenship.
Now the situation is almost reversed. Here in the formerly Communist eastern half of Germany, nearly 20 percent of the work force is unemployed. And countries like Britain, Ireland and above all the Netherlands -- where unemployment has sunk to just 2.4 percent -- are desperately looking for workers. 
At recent job fairs in Leipzig and nearby Chemnitz, recruiters from at least four Dutch temporary-help agencies competed to sign up construction and factory workers. 
Recruiters from Ireland were looking for German speakers to work at telephone call-centers, where companies like Lufthansa airlines take advantage of Ireland's low taxes and costs to handle calls from customers. And on a bulletin board, companies from as far away as Iceland advertised hundreds of jobs in construction and farm work.
"For the last two or three years, we have not had any spare people," said Carola Jannsen, a recruiter for Randstad, one of the biggest temporary-help agencies in the Netherlands. "Here in the east, there is a big supply of highly qualified workers and their motivation is high."
The inducements offered to these workers are considerably more generous than those that once lured Turkish workers to Germany, or that still attract Mexicans to the United States.
Construction workers in the Netherlands are typically promised after-tax income of about $1,200 a month. They receive free housing -- usually sharing an apartment or house with four or five other workers -- and about $20 more a day for incidental needs. They are also entitled to health insurance, sick pay and most other social benefits that are standard in most European countries. But their families stay behind, one reason that many do not want to go.
The rush of foreign temporary-help agencies into eastern Germany reflects the changes transforming Europe. During the 1970's, economic growth in the Netherlands was so weak that many Dutch workers headed to this country in search of jobs. Germany, with its wealth and its manufacturing prowess, offered relatively high pay and comfortable working conditions. 
Today, Europe is in many respects a single market but with the components out of balance. German unemployment is still about 8 percent in the west and 18 percent in the east, in part because of high taxes, rigid regulations and huge costs associated with rebuilding the formerly Communist east. By contrast, the Netherlands is booming and has virtually no unemployment. Britain has a jobless rate of only 4.6 percent. Tiny Ireland has had Europe's fastest growing economy for most of the last decade.
The problems in eastern Germany are particularly severe, in part because it is still recovering from the euphoric excesses that followed its unification with western Germany in 1990. With more than a half-trillion dollars in assistance and tax breaks from the west, eastern Germany went through a wild boom that led to construction of thousands of new office buildings, shopping centers, museums, industrial parks and houses. 
But the tax breaks ended four years ago, and the economy has been largely stagnant. Eastern German cities are dotted with sparkling new -- but strikingly empty -- office buildings.
Nearly two years ago, officials here in Saxony hit on the idea of hooking up their idle workers with foreign employers.
"We had the idea after a student exchange with the Netherlands," said Heinz Hammer, director of continuing education at the government-financed job-training center in Glauchau. "We saw that there was a great opportunity there, and it was clear the job prospects here were limited. And about the same time, we were getting a lot of requests from Dutch temporary-help companies."
Saxony officials sent 10 construction teachers to the Netherlands so they could study the Dutch system and retrain German workers. They imported Dutch bricks, smaller than German ones, and Dutch trowels. Finally, they recruited Dutch language teachers. The government-financed courses last from four to eight weeks.
Mr. Stasiak, one of two dozen workers who are finishing up the course, quickly discovered the differences. Dutch walls are usually made of exposed brick, which means the bricks and mortar have to line up very precisely in order to look good. German walls, by contrast, are usually covered over with a fine cement and are often made from fairly large bricks or cinderblocks.
"It takes me a lot longer to lay the bricks, because I haven't been doing this for 10 or 20 years," Mr. Stasiak remarked. "The Dutch workers can finish about 800 bricks in a day, but I would be happy to finish 500."
That does not bother Dutch recruiters. "I am looking for as many people as I can find," said Ger Scholte, manager of Bouwflex, a subsidiary of Randstad that is exclusively devoted to drumming up German construction workers. "Right now, I have 30 or 40 people ready to go. My only problem is lining up housing for them, because the early vacation season is under way and a lot of the holiday apartments have been taken."
But foreign recruiters are hardly confined to construction.
Tom Maring, a recruiter for the Dutch temporary-help agency In Person, is scouring eastern Germany for workers in a long list of categories: welders, garden workers, packers, even people who can make plastic forms for making windmill rotors. "Some of the hardest jobs to fill right now are those for relatively unskilled labor," remarked Mr. Maring as he tried to persuade German workers in Leipzig to sign up.
But for signs of how topsy-turvy the European workplace has become, it is hard to match the employee hunters from Ireland. Once one of Europe's poorest countries, Ireland has become a huge customer-service center for European and American companies. Irish workers are well-educated, Irish costs are low and Irish telecommunication services are excellent, and so when customers call an airline in the United States, they often reach an operator in Ireland. 
But now Ireland needs call-center operators who can speak German, because scores of companies need to serve the German customers. Grafton Group, a temporary-service agency in Dublin, is recruiting German speakers for Hertz, Lufthansa and United Airlines. It offers bonuses for people who stay in Ireland six months or a year, free English classes, computer-training and discounted flights between Ireland and Germany.
James Parsons, director of a language school in Leipzig called I.C.C. Sprachinstitut, has teamed up with recruiters and German government officials to train local workers for jobs in England and Ireland.
"You can't find enough engineers, you can't find enough electricians, you can't find any old-fashioned tradesmen anymore," he said. And the demand for telephone call-center operators is unrelenting. "The costs in Ireland are so much cheaper than in Germany that it makes sense to bring over Germans to serve Germans. You just can't find enough English and Irish people who can speak German."
But the big question is whether, despite the prospects for more jobs, many Germans will actually make the move. "German workers don't really like to move away from their hometown, and they will do so only if they are really in an emergency," said Reinhard Baum, an administrator at the job-training center in Leipzig that offers courses on Dutch construction.
"I have absolutely no interest in working in Holland," said Siegfried Muller, an unemployed lathe operator. "I have my family here, and I don't want to go through another round of schooling."
But for people like Wolfgang Schemmel, an unemployed painter with a wife and one child, the prospect of working in the Netherlands is the best option available. "My wife is going along with it, because I either go off or we have to live on social welfare payments," he said. "It is not much of a choice."

HEADLINE: School Budgets: Many Reasons Why Voters May Say No 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: TUCKAHOE, N.Y., May 18 

 BODY:
This year, everybody vowed, would be different.
 The school superintendent, Michael Yazurlo, set aside two hours on consecutive Saturdays and opened his office door to hear the gripes. The Parent-Teacher Association, at the annual winter carnival in March, held a poster contest to promote interest in the election. When negative letters showed up in the weekly newspaper criticizing the district for "excessive and irresponsible spending," dissenters fired back replies. 
 "Progress, inevitably, comes at a cost," wrote Julia and David Lestch, "but one which will pay dividends over and over in the educational growth of our children." 
This year would be different. But it wasn't. By just 43 votes, 547 to 504, the Tuckahoe School District budget was defeated May 15, as it had been the previous two years.
Win, lose or draw, school budget votes in the New York suburbs are an annual ritual that stir one-of-a-kind passions. Schools are paramount, after all, with children's futures -- and real estate values -- at stake. The big day this year in New York State was May 15. So for the weeks before, local newspapers brimmed with editorials and letters pro and con; light poles, lawns and storefronts carried campaign posters, and active participants worked at the phone banks as aggressively as in a presidential race.
Anonymous letters in the weekly Eastchester Record had warned of a budget defeat in Tuckahoe "if you do not significantly lower your administrative costs." A resident in the North Shore School District on Long Island, where the budget was also rejected, planted a lawn sign asking, "Can we afford $20,000 per student a year?" In another Westchester community, Hastings-on-Hudson, a frantic telephone campaign helped avert the defeat of the budget because of anger over the board's considering whether to sell a Jasper F. Cropsey painting it owns.
Most budgets passed, about 92 percent statewide, as they generally do in flush times. By contrast, in the last recession, in 1991, the passage rate was 72 percent. The state's five largest school districts, which are financed in municipal budgets, do not put their budgets up for voter approval.
New York is one of just six states -- all are in the Northeast -- that require some or all school budgets to go before voters. New Jersey and Connecticut do, too, and budgets in both states were also overwhelmingly approved this year. (The other states are Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.)
Like most other districts, Tuckahoe, a southern Westchester village of 6,211, 25 minutes by train from Midtown Manhattan, proposed raising taxes, by 9.7 percent. Unlike voters in most other districts, some of which proposed tax increases up to 25 percent, Tuckahoe voters said no, making this small village with mostly middle- and upper middle-income residents one of only two municipalities in Westchester that rejected school district budgets. The other was Mount Pleasant. Both districts can submit them again to voters for a second try, with another defeat bringing a state-mandated "austerity" budget, possibly, in the case of Tuckahoe, without the extra two teachers whom parents had demanded to reduce class sizes.
There is a broad mix of incomes in the enrollment here: 75 percent of the students are white, 13 percent black, 8 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian and members of other ethnic groups. Students score above state averages on state tests; 83 percent of the fourth graders met or exceeded state standards this year, compared with 78 percent in the county and 60 percent in the state.
To remind people to vote, parents go door-to-door, telephone neighbors and sometimes even set up a lemonade stand -- free, of course -- at the community center.
"As a parent I want our children afforded the possibility to have the best, within reason," said Sheree Raho, a mother of two, who was dumbfounded over the defeat and vowed a strong campaign to pass the budget on a second try. "No one wants to be taxed so it is so much of a burden, but we do want our children to have the best. Even if you don't have children in the schools, it's important for the property values."
The executive director of the New York State School Boards Association, Tim Kremer, said he had seen more districts in recent years writing budgets with double-digit tax increases to pay for rising costs attributed largely to meeting new academic standards required by the state. Labor, health insurance and energy costs have also been rising, he said. (There has been a small recent increase in enrollment in Tuckahoe.)
A more drastic slide in the economy will make it harder to get budgets passed, he said. But his group does not advocate taking the decision out of voters' hands, something editorial writers call for now and then.
"We believe," he said, "that, with all its flaws and with all the possible ambiguities associated with the budget process, we appreciate having an opportunity for the public to become engaged in a conversation regarding the leadership and how much the community is willing to spend and on what priorities." 
In Tuckahoe, that conversation spilled into the school board election, which was held in conjunction with the budget vote. Three people sought two seats, with two candidates supporting the budget and a third openly questioning it. (The two budget supporters won.)
Jennifer E. McNamee, who has a son in the second grade, said she had grown frustrated with what she considered overspending on administration and lax scrutiny of budget increases. Tuckahoe, with about 950 students, proposed a $15.7 million budget, a 9.1 percent increase over the previous year. The proposed tax rate of $584.77 per $1,000 of assessed value represented a 9.7 percent increase. (A typical home in Tuckahoe is assessed at $10,000, meaning a $5,848 school tax.)
Ms. McNamee said she thought that a 7 or 8 percent increase would have been reasonable, but that spending should be shifted from administration and into the classrooms. "There are ways to reduce the budget without having to affect the kids in the district, without cutting books and supplies," she said.
On the other hand, Superintendent Yazurlo said the proposed budget reflected reasonable administrative costs; he has two assistant superintendents and none of the three schools have assistant principals. He said a declining tax base and pressure from the state and district to provide additional instruction to students performing below expectations had helped to raise costs.
"There is no fat here," Dr. Yazurlo said. "We are not out there building athletic fields."
A budget defeat brings a search for explanations, but finding them can be elusive.
Sometimes a defeat is not strictly rooted in finances; voter frustration at the way the West Seneca school board near Buffalo handled the ouster of a superintendent investigated, but not charged with, sexual harassment was said to have contributed to the budget defeat there, and that of two incumbent board members.
Last year, there was much speculation that the budget of a school district serving Mount Kisco was rejected in part to protest expensive services to the children of day laborers. (It passed this year.) And in Mount Pleasant, the only other Westchester district to reject its latest budget, the superintendent attributed the defeat, in part, to a bond measure involving leasing a school building to undetermined outside groups, which was also on the ballot.
In communities like Tuckahoe, which has a large elderly population, there is a perception that many people without children in the school system tend to vote against the budgets. "I did vote against it because I'm sick of the higher taxes I can't afford, but I don't like saying that because people think you're against children," said a 67-year-old woman, who insisted her name not be used. And there is a segment of the community who "are naysayers who are anti-everything," Mr. Vazurlo said.
Whatever the reasons, there is some confidence that the village will approve the budget on a second try. The board is meeting Monday to decide, and Doug Reich, the board president, said it would consider reducing the budget.
Dr. Reich urged abstainers to cast their ballots. "You would think people would have learned from Florida," he said, "but in fact if you don't get out there and vote, when you lose by 43 votes you realize how important every vote is."

HEADLINE: Bible Belt Couples 'Put Asunder' More, Despite New Efforts 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, May 18 

 BODY:
The governor grumbles about how it is easier for Oklahomans to get out of a marriage than a Tupperware contract. The head of the Southern Baptist church complains that pastors are afraid to look love-besotted parishioners in the eye and tell them that they are too immature for marriage.
 A posse of public health nurses, social workers, pastors and extension agents has been deputized to bring down a divorce rate that in Oklahoma, as in several states across the Bible Belt, is among the highest in the country. 
 The governor, the Baptist leadership and the antidivorce foot soldiers are collectively struggling to avert collisions between naive notions of wedded bliss and the reality of marriage.
That is the sort of collision that crumpled the first marriage of Cathryn Hinderliter, a preacher's daughter from Tulsa. She was raised to believe that God, her parents and the State of Oklahoma wanted her married. When the first man asked, she said yes. 
"I had this vision that this is just what people do: Get married, have kids and Christ comes back," she said. "No one asked me, 'Are you sure this is what you want?' The day I got married, my mother came to me and tried to give me the sex talk. I said, 'Lady, go home and get my slip.' "
She and her first husband had a 20-minute prewedding talk with their minister at East Tulsa Christian Church.
"Our pastor said, 'I am really happy for you guys,' " she recalled. "He mentioned a couple of books to read. I never cracked them. It was a joke."
The marriage ended after five years and one child when she ran off to California, where she had an affair.
"Subconsciously, I knew that that was a biblical reason for divorce," she said. "One that my husband couldn't deny. One that my parents couldn't deny."
It has been about four years since politicians here and in several other states began to acknowledge a troubling paradox: The divorce rate in many parts of the Bible Belt is roughly 50 percent above the national average.
In Arkansas, Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, declared a "marital emergency" in 1999 and vowed to halve the divorce rate by 2010. He signed a covenant marriage law last month that allows couples to choose a marital contract that, in most cases, would require a two-year waiting period before a divorce becomes final. Louisiana has enacted similar laws, as has Arizona.
Here in Oklahoma, Gov. Frank Keating, also a Republican, diagnosed divorce as a principal cause of poverty in his state. He started a much-publicized, multipronged campaign, paid for with $10 million in federal welfare money, to cut the divorce rate by one-third in 10 years.
The Oklahoma Legislature, controlled by Democrats, has all but killed the governor's proposals for covenant marriage and the removal of mutual incompatibility as grounds for divorce. But it has passed several of his other proposals, measures that call for creating a statewide network for premarital education and for training secular and religious marriage counselors.
"Seventy percent of our people go to church once a week or more," Mr. Keating said in an interview. "These divorce statistics are a scalding indictment of what isn't being said behind the pulpit."
The Rev. Anthony Jordan, executive director of the Baptist General Convention in Oklahoma, could not agree more. 
"We are responsible," he said. "We are good in helping young people plan a wedding, but not in planning a marriage. And in our desire to be compassionate to those who are going through a divorce, the church has watered down a strong message in regard to the ills and sins of divorce." 
About three-quarters of Oklahomans are married in church, according to state estimates. By far the largest church in the state is the Southern Baptist Convention, with about half of the churchgoing population.
Despite the efforts of the last several years, the institution of marriage by some measures is losing ground. The census found that in the 1990's, the number of unmarried couples living together jumped by 97 percent in Oklahoma, 125 percent in Arkansas and 123 percent in Tennessee. These increases in the buckle of the Bible Belt are well above the 72 percent increase in unmarried couples that the census found in the nation as a whole.
For the first time, the census showed that married couples with children made up less than a quarter of the American population (23.5 percent). In Oklahoma, the percentage of such nuclear families was even lower (23.2 percent).
"Those numbers are a total reflection of marriage as an institution that is losing its appeal," said Jerry Regier, Oklahoma's secretary of health and human services and the governor's point man for defending divorce. "Our society has been overwhelmed by divorce."

An Economic Issue
Demographers say alarm bells ringing in the Bible Belt in the last several years are about 20 years late.
"There is no new emergency, no new crisis," said Dr. Robert Schoen, a professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University and a specialist in the demography of marriage. 
The rate of failed marriages doubled from the early 1960's to 1980, reaching a point where about 43 percent of marriages ended in divorce, Dr. Schoen said. Since then, the rate has leveled off at a historically high plateau. In Oklahoma, as in many states, government figures have since shown a slight decline in the divorce rate, measured as a percentage of the total population. The number of divorces per 1,000 Oklahomans fell to 6.5 in 1998, from 7.7 in 1990. The national average in 1996 was 4.3 divorces per 1,000 people.
"There is no divorce emergency in the sense that divorce rates are going up," said Dr. Andrew J. Cherlin, a family demographer who is a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. "I think what is going on in Oklahoma is part of the aftershocks to the divorce revolution."
Among those aftershocks is a strong national consensus that the social ills caused by divorce are costing federal and state governments huge amounts of money.
"We know what the cause of poverty is in this country and, like it or not, it's divorce and nonwedlock childbearing," said Dr. Steve Nock, a family demographer and professor of sociology at the University of Virginia.
"We know that for every three divorces, one family ends up below the poverty line," Dr. Nock said. "The average woman with dependent children who ends up in poverty stays poor for eight months. The federal government pays for part of that, but states pay the balance. Divorce, by itself, is a major economic issue."

Shepherding a Lost Flock
About 300 ministers met here this week at Oklahoma Christian University for a marriage-saving seminar. Most of them were from small Protestant churches in rural areas, and many said they were in desperate need of advice.
"Divorce has almost become the norm, and we have come to accept it," said the Rev. Duane Schroeder, pastor of Redeemer Lutheran Church in Enid, a town in northwest Oklahoma. "Just about every couple that comes to me -- I'd say about 90 percent -- is living together. It's as if they don't know it is wrong."
Several of the ministers acknowledged in interviews that they had been passive observers as divorce gathered momentum in their congregations. A few said they had encouraged young people to "fix" the sin of premarital sex by marrying. 
"There is a tidal wave of divorce to deal with," said the Rev. Larry Henderson, pastor of a small evangelical church in Mooreland, Okla., a town of about 1,200 people. "The saddest thing is that people are not getting married anymore."
Les and Leslie Parrott, marriage experts imported by the governor from Seattle Pacific University, presided over the seminar. Hired as the state's first "scholars in residence" on marriage, the couple has crisscrossed Oklahoma in the last year, training state employees and ministers in the craft of marriage counseling.
Most of their advice directs counselors to attack myths that hobble marriages from the start -- myths like, "My spouse will make me whole."
"If you believe somebody else can complete you, you are setting yourself up for serious heartbreak," Les Parrott, a professor of clinical psychology, told the ministers to tell couples considering marriage.
After the seminar, the Parrotts said that many of the premarital myths that needed shattering in Oklahoma grew out of "naive and unrealistic" assumptions held by young people who were intoxicated by love and cosseted by a culture that delights in weddings but tolerates divorce.
"Young people tell us that if they are in love and God is with them, then that's all they need," said Leslie Parrott, a marriage and family therapist. "Later, if they are not happy, they say, 'God wants me to get a divorce.' There is very little appreciation that marriage requires hard work and communication skills. They have been shown by the example of friends and family that when things go bad, you just get divorced."

Second Time Around
After the collapse of her first marriage in 1987, Cathryn Hinderliter, who is now 40, became poor and cautious.
She found a job as a medical secretary. With her daughter, Sara, she moved into an apartment in Oklahoma City that cost $199 a month. Every two weeks, after cashing her paycheck and paying her bills, she had $35 left over for food and gasoline, she remembers. She did not go on food stamps, she said, but did declare bankruptcy in 1992.
She also decided to have nothing to do with marriage, unless a suitor committed up front to "an incredible amount of work." 
She knew Mark Hinderliter, a divorced engineer, for three years before she dared date him. They did not live together during their year of courtship, she said, and did not even kiss until they had attended a marriage-and-family seminar. After drifting away from their Christian roots, they say they have renewed their commitment to God, but do not expect him to keep their marriage together. That's their job. 
"The biggest lesson I have learned is don't walk into marriage with a handed-down faith and bunch of dogma," said Mr. Hinderliter, 36.
Ms. Hinderliter's parents, too, say they have learned from her painful divorce.
"We assumed that she was ready," said the Rev. Jack Foreman, Ms. Hinderliter's father, who is a professor of deaf education at Tulsa State University. "In retrospect, we should have asked some hard questions."
The East Tulsa Christian Church has begun to ask hard questions. It refuses to marry any couple that declines premarital counseling. It demands that couples who are living together move to separate residences for six months before they can be married in the church.
Besides Sara, now 17, Mark and Cathryn Hinderliter have a daughter, Greta, who is 3. The couple agree that their marriage is working. Still, they have problems, and Ms. Hinderliter has insisted on working them out in sessions with a marriage counselor, who is also an evangelical Christian.
"How do you do this right?" she said. "Well, basically, I think you just communicate until your knuckles bleed."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the high divorce rate in the Bible Belt referred imprecisely to the Southern Baptist jurisdiction of the Rev. Anthony Jordan, who said pastors were afraid to tell love struck parishioners that they were too immature for marriage. As executive director of the Baptist General Convention in Oklahoma -- the state organization of the Southern Baptist Convention -- he does not head the denomination. It has a president, but member churches are autonomous.

A Polyandry Solution

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: HARPERS FERRY, W. Va. 

 BODY:
For the first time in a half-century, the State of Utah -- eager to polish its image before it hosts the winter Olympics -- decided to crack down on publicized polygamy. 
 Last week a man who lived in a trailer community with 5 wives and 25 children, and proudly boasted of his lifestyle on television, was convicted of the crime of bigamy. An estimated 30,000 other clandestine bigamists in Utah and neighboring states took that as a message to keep their multiple marriages to themselves. 
 Place that event next to another sociological development recently revealed by the U.S. Census. The old "nuclear family" -- a married couple living together with one or more children -- is no longer the norm in the U.S. In two generations, it has plunged from one in two to one in four. That means three-quarters of our households are people living alone, or with only one parent minding the kids, or couples -- straight or gay -- just hanging out together. 
Throw three other facts into the pot. More married couples are splitting up than ever before. Scientific advances in nutrition and genetics, along with cures for diseases, are helping us stay alive longer. And with women living years longer than men, widowhood is increasingly a part of geezerhood. 
What does this combination of events and social trends tell political economists? Because the graduating class of 2001 faces a future of later and ever-shorter family liaisons, it can expect that its grandchildren -- the class of 2050 -- will have their hands full visiting, much less paying taxes to support, a dozen or more direct and step-grandparents. Government will be the transfer agent of wealth, not from rich to poor so much as from young worker to middle-aged retiree. 
And here's another probable outcome: a population out of the habit of lifelong marriage partnerships will likely be made up of old people living alone or forced into some kind of commune or group home. The bleak Hobson's choice will be isolation or regimentation. 
Cheer up; there is a way out of tomorrow's brave new bind. Nobody is talking yet about the most sensible, least costly solution to the long-term loneliness of unchosen singlehood. It has been too revolutionary for the liberals, too offbeat for conservatives, too radical for feminists, too libertine for libertarians. 
No, polygamy is not the answer. Not only has the harem lifestyle too often been associated with physical coercion, but the welfare system would soon be bankrupted. Government would have to step in because it's hard for any ordinary patriarch with 25 kids to make ends meet. 
What is to be done? Time to break the taboo. If present trends continue -- that is, if lifelong marriage further falls from fashion, the population ages and a pervasive societal loneliness becomes the New Great Depression -- will the moment not come for the world to consider the legalization of polyandry? 
As every bigamist should know, polygamy is the condition of having more than one spouse at the same time, while polyandry is sex-specific -- the marriage of a woman with more than one man. 
I estimate that 98 percent of the 30,000 bigamists are males with plural wives, which means that there are probably fewer than 600 polyandrists in active practice today, presumably in a conservative ratio of one woman to two men. These 200 women and their 400 husbands (whose identities are unknown to snooping neighbors) deserve a discreet salute for quietly pioneering America's future lifestyle. 
One woman, in the security of being doubly beloved and beneficiaried, can surely provide life-extending companionship to two men. And when one husband passes on, either to his Maker or to some gold-digging bimbo, the long-lived polyandrist would still have the remaining man for mutual comfort and support.
The Polyandry Movement, first espoused in this space five years ago, met an underwhelming response. Aberrant fogies like me, married nearly 40 years to one woman, are selfishly disinclined to share, but two generations from now -- given the woeful diminution of exclusive marriage commitment and the lengthening of life -- the two-husband home may be the bedrock of the newest morality and the salvation of what's left of the American family.

HEADLINE: In State Legislatures, 2nd Thoughts on Term Limits 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., May 18 

 BODY:
Oregon, which has been in the forefront of many national trends, was among the first of 19 states that jumped on the term-limits bandwagon. But now Oregonians are contemplating a possible countermovement: this year, they are likely to vote on whether to become the first state to loosen or even repeal altogether the time limits voters once imposed on state legislators' terms. 
 With 13 of Oregon's 30 state senators prevented by the term-limits law from running for re-election next year, the State Senate has passed a measure that would ask voters on November's ballot whether to abolish the law. The House is debating that bill and has approved a separate measure to ask voters whether to loosen the limits. 
 While Oregon's lawmakers seem to be further along in trying to undo term limits than other states', they are hardly alone. 
In at least 10 of the 19 states with term limits, there have been proposals this year to modify or repeal the laws. Some of those proposals, including one in Missouri, are pending, while others seem to have been derailed, in part because of vigorous lobbying by the groups that initially promoted the term-limits laws. 
One effort failed recently in New York City, when a City Council committee killed a bill that would have overturned term limits for Council members. 
But it is clear that many lawmakers now believe they can make a case for staying on -- or at least ask voters to consider the idea, since abolishing term limits would require voter approval, except in a handful of states where legislators have gone to court to have them modified or repealed. 
The term-limits movement gained strength in the late 1980's amid the public's frustration with career politicians. But here in Oregon, where there have been five House speakers in the last five legislative sessions, many lawmakers, including some newly elected ones who arguably owe their jobs to the existence of term limits, are surprisingly frank in explaining why they oppose the laws. 
"I think regular people would be alarmed if they really knew how much influence lobbyists now have over this system," said State Representative Mark Hass, a freshman Democrat from suburban Portland. 
"When you need advice," Mr. Hass said, "it would be nice to be able to turn to a legislator with 20 years' experience, someone who could take a new guy like me under his or her wing and say, 'We tried that back in '73, and it didn't work.' There aren't any legislative elders anymore. There's a lot of reinventing the wheel." 
In Maine, where a referendum limiting state lawmakers to four consecutive two-year terms was approved in 1993, many legislators have been questioning the effect of the law. 
"If term limits get rid of the dead wood, the problem is they get rid of the live wood too," State Senator Beverly Daggett of Augusta, the Democratic leader, said in a telephone interview. "When you go anywhere else -- to the heart surgeon or the mechanic -- you don't ask for the person who was just hired today." 
Whether voters will warm to the idea of undoing term limits is a different matter. Several experts said that while the once red-hot ardor in favor of term limits has clearly waned in recent years, that does not necessarily mean people are in favor of repealing them. 
"It would be very easy to put together a campaign saying that legislators are trying to tell the voters they did something wrong" in approving term limits, said James Moore, a political science professor at the University of Portland in Oregon. "But it would be a very complex message for legislators to explain why term limits ought to be altered or repealed." 
In Arkansas, for instance, a proposal to lengthen the time state lawmakers could serve died recently in the legislature, after one term-limits group ran radio commercials mocking a fictional lawmaker pleading for the extension. 
"Well, it's just not long enough for us to get comfortable around here," the lawmaker drawled. "We need to stay in office a lot longer so we can, uh, do the people's business, if you know what I mean."
And so far, legislative efforts to roll back term limits at both the city and state level have almost all failed, perhaps most notably in New York, where the Council committee decided by a 5-to-4 vote in March against a bill overturning term limits. Those limits were approved by voters in 1993 and reaffirmed in a 1996 ballot measure.
Still, some term-limits laws, including those in Massachusetts and Washington State, have been thrown out by state courts, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled that term limits for members of Congress would require an amendment to the Constitution. Efforts to get that amendment approved by Congress have fallen far short of the mark.
In other ways, the movement seems to have stalled -- in part because flush economic times for much of the 1990's cooled voters' anger with politicians, and in part because the very people who rode to office on the strength of the idea are now coming up against the consequences. Only Nebraska has passed a term-limits law in the last six years.
Last fall, George Nethercutt, a Republican from Spokane, Wash., easily won re-election to the United States House of Representatives despite breaking the very term-limits pledge that had once made him a poster child for the movement. (He unseated the incumbent speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, in the Republican tide of 1994, largely because he promised to serve no more than three two-year terms.) 
What Oregon is considering involves not slowing the term-limits movement but reversing it altogether. And term-limits proponents are confident that voters will recoil at such proposals. 
"Attempts to overturn the people's vote on an issue that directly affects the legislators' own power is exactly the kind of thing that gives citizens a low regard for politicians," said Paul Jacob, the national director of U.S. Term Limits, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. "Once voters find out what the legislators are doing, there will be a political firestorm the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time." 
The maneuvering in Oregon is complicated, so much so that it is possible the two houses of the Legislature will not be able to agree on exactly what to ask the voters, or when. The Senate-approved bill would ask voters this fall whether to abolish term limits, while the House-backed bill would wait until 2002 and ask them only whether to amend the law to allow lawmakers to serve up to 12 years in either house. (Right now they are limited to three two-year House terms, two four-year Senate terms, or any combination that does not exceed 12 years.)
Yet another measure, which recently passed both houses and went to Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat who supports it, would move up filing deadlines for office and thus expedite a state court challenge that some lawmakers are hoping to mount to term limits, which Oregon voters approved by 2 to 1 in 1992.
But that bill has caused some dissension. State Senator Steve Harper, a Klamath Falls Republican who is a leading advocate of loosening term limits, derided the measure in an interview as "the back-door lawyer bill" and predicted that it would anger voters. 
Still, several lawmakers here predicted they would come to an agreement on a term-limits bill to bring before the voters. Elsewhere, the debate over that idea has been fierce, and without much agreement on anything to put on the ballot.
In Arkansas, State Representative Jim Bob Duggar, a Republican, said he had tried to get a bill approved that would expand House limits to four two-year terms from three, to match the eight-year maximum in the Senate. But it died amid the radio campaign and a balky Senate. 
"When it came down to it, the Senate didn't want to add any time to the House without the Senate getting some more time also," Mr. Duggar said in a telephone interview. "Anyway, we were not able to get anything done." 
In Arizona this year, the House defeated, 37 to 22, a bill to ask voters to reconsider the term limits they approved in 1992. 
Jennie Drage, a policy specialist with the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, said she expected a rising number of bills to be proposed in coming years to revise or repeal term limits, as more lawmakers confront their consequences, both for themselves and for their legislatures. Whether voters will approve any of these proposals is much harder to predict.
"I don't think lawmakers think that incurring the wrath of voters is all that big a risk," said Ms. Drage, who tracks term-limits legislation. "If voters don't like the idea, they'll just vote it down."

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Global Lists Add Focus to Energy Sector 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The brokerage firm that designs the most widely followed global stock indexes announced a major overhaul over the weekend that reduces the relative importance of telecommunications stocks and emerging markets, and increases that of energy companies.
 The adjustments, by Morgan Stanley Capital International, could prompt a flurry of buying and selling as money mangers adjust to the new indexes. The stock indexes are used as benchmarks for as much as $3 trillion that is actively managed or invested in index funds. 
 The United States and Britain were the winners among leading economies, with increased importance in the indexes, while South Africa and South Korea had big increases among emerging-market countries. Japan was a loser among industrial nations, as were India and Mexico in the emerging markets. 
Analysts and money managers have buying and selling stocks based on predictions of who would be added, who would be dropped and whose importance would be reduced.
But there were no big surprises in the changes that added 357 individual stocks and deleted 130, including three United States airline companies, AMR, Delta and US Airways. Big companies were added as expected, including the Japanese cellular phone giant NTT DoCoMo and Shell Transport and Trading.
The cutbacks also went as expected with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Toyota, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom all being reduced in relative weight in the indexes.
The few surprises, according to an analysis by Sandy Rattray, head of index research at Goldman, Sachs, included a smaller-than-expected reduction in the weight of Japanese stocks, while the 12 euro nations took a substantial hit, as expected. This could lead to a boost for the yen against the euro in currency trading as money managers add some Japanese stocks and sell European issues.
A few companies that had been expected to be added -- like the French-owned cellular phone company Orange, and BMW and Commerzbank of Germany -- were not. These may now face selling pressure.
While the telecommunications sector was reduced in weight, technology hardware and equipment used in computer systems rose sharply in the new All Country World Index Free, mostly because 28 United States companies, including Sun Microsystems and Analog Devices, were added.
The overhaul of the Morgan Stanley indexes included two major changes. First, the weight of a company in the index is now equal only to the value of the shares that are free-floating, or available for foreigners to buy. Companies that are partly owned by governments, have restrictions on foreign ownership, or have large stakes controlled by founders, owners or families are now being given weightings below the full value of all their shares. The old weightings distorted the index movements by giving some companies, like telecommunications providers, a greater influence than they deserved.
The telecommunications sector has many companies with big government holdings still remaining. France Telecom's weighting was cut to 30 percent, Deutsche Telekom to 40 percent and Telecom Italia to 45 percent of their market share values.
The adjustment also reduced the country weighting of Japan, France, Germany and Italy. In Japan, N.T.T. was reduced to a weighting of 20 percent of market value while Toyota fell to 60 percent. In the United States, Amazon.com was reduced to a 70 percent weighting and the Goldman Sachs Group was added to the lists at a 30 percent weighting because of the control of stock by founders and partners.
The free-float provision helped Britain and South Korea because they both have a lower level of government ownership or family control of companies than other countries in their groups.
The other change was increasing the coverage of industry groups to 85 percent from 60 percent in the old indexes. This broader coverage is the reason for the addition of most of the new companies.
Morgan Stanley will begin publishing provisional index numbers based on these changes at the end of May and officially make the changes in two stages, the first in November and the second in May 2002.

HEADLINE: Kazakhs Take Strong Issue With Bush's Missile Project 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: ASTANA, Kazakhstan, May 18 

 BODY:
The president of this Western-leaning, oil-rich country has warned that the Bush administration's determination to erect a broad array of missile defenses and to abandon a major arms control treaty threatens to ignite a deadly new arms race.
 In an interview in the presidential palace here, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev urged President Bush to work with Russia and other states that have nuclear weapons to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals rather than proceed with plans to build the missile defense shield and to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union. 
 "Any state has the right to defend itself as it sees fit," he said. "But such one-sided decisions could launch a new arms race." 
His unhappiness about the planned American actions echoed sentiments from senior Russian officials, other former adversaries, and allies in London, Berlin, Tokyo and Seoul. Russia's military spokesman, Aleksandr Yakovenko, after meeting two weeks ago with Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, criticized the American intentions, saying Mr. Wolfowitz's delegation had not addressed Russia's fundamental concerns.
Kazakhstan was not among the countries visited by three teams of American officials who fanned out earlier this month to discuss the administration's strategic intentions. But Mr. Nazarbayev said his country's views on those questions were made known by the minister of foreign affairs, Erlan Idrisov, who visited Washington earlier this month and met with Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior officials.
The fact that Mr. Cheney received Mr. Idrisov reflects the relative importance of this huge, sparsely populated former Soviet republic. Its vast oil reserves, geographic position in Central Asia and commitment to developing an open, market-based economy give the country added diplomatic importance. 
Mr. Nazarbayev said his was the first of the former Soviet republics to renounce weapons of mass destruction. The country had not yet become independent, he said, when he decided in 1991 to close the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk, the world's largest such site. 
In an interview explaining the step, Vladimir Shkolnik, the minister of energy and mineral resources, said the action was tantamount to "the governor of Nevada announcing that he would close Nevada's nuclear test site."
Soon after independence, Mr. Nazarbayev declared that he would rid his country of what would have been the world's fourth largest nuclear arsenal and the numerous chemical and biological weapons facilities with which, he said, the Soviet Union had "stuffed" his country.
In the interview, he said the decision was made in the face of protests from Moscow and internal opposition from those who argued that the weapons would give his newly independent country international respect. But the residue of the nuclear testing and the presence of chemical and germ weapons facilities, he said, had polluted his country and sickened some of its 16 million citizens.
He contended that the United States was miscalculating by pursuing a nuclear shield because "it perceives that Russia is weak and China is also unable to respond." The Soviet Union was also weak after World War II, "but it recovered and challenged the United States in a fierce arms race," he said. "Russia's weakness is not a permanent condition. And China, too, will respond to unilateral American steps." 
In some respects, Mr. Nazarbayev's criticisms of the plan were more emphatic than Russia's. Kremlin officials uttered similar public complaints after Mr. Wolfowitz's visit. But they strongly hinted that Russia would continue to press in private for a prominent role in a missile defense program that would bind Russia more closely with Europe and the United States, and might leave China more isolated.
Mr. Nazarbayev, by contrast, said he remained committed to a "nuclear-free Kazakhstan, and why not a nuclear-free planet?" 
He stressed his desire for "a high level of cooperation with the United States." But American diplomats have sensed a cooling in American-Kazakh relations as a result of pressure within Kazakhstan for its leaders to seek help from Russia against Islamic radicals tormenting other Central Asian countries, as well as American criticism of Kazakhstan's human rights policy. 
Relations have also been strained by the Justice Department's investigation of whether an American businessman helped Mr. Nazarbayev and other senior officials siphon tens of millions of dollars from American oil companies. Kazakh officials have denied the allegations.

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman is right when he laughs at the Bush administration's attempt to sell the tax cut for all reasons (column, May 16). But there is a bigger issue at stake. 
 Last summer, a major problem for Al Gore's candidacy was his alleged embellishment of stories involving him. What shall we make of President Bush's imputed benefits of his tax cut? Do people really think that it would turn the economy around and make energy prices easier to bear? Or that it would keep the economy strong? Or that it would turn the stock market around? 
 With all these claims of the benefits of a tax cut, it seems as if Mr. Bush is doing just what Republicans loathed about the Clinton administration -- putting his finger to the wind and responding accordingly.

HEADLINE: Grudge Match; 
For Michael Dell and Steve Jobs An Old Rivalry Still Boils

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 20 

 BODY:
They represent the rival styles of the graying personal computer industry, and they don't seem to like each other very much.
 In one corner stands the 46-year-old Steven P. Jobs, co-founder and chairman of Apple Computer, the former prodigy who in 1977 introduced the Apple II, the machine that dominated the first generation of personal computing. In the other corner is Michael S. Dell, 36, founder and chairman of Dell Computer, who as a college student in the 1980's took the anti-Apple machine -- the Intel-Microsoft-based PC -- and began revolutionizing the way desktop computers were sold. 
 But beyond their longstanding business rivalry, the two men seem to harbor a highly personal grudge, which has only intensified as the personal computer industry has started showing its age.
A few years ago, Mr. Dell derided Apple by saying that its shareholders would be better served if the company were to close its doors and they put their money in mutual funds. Mr. Jobs retaliated by drawing a bull's-eye over a picture of Mr. Dell's face, onstage at a Macworld exhibition, and announced that he was coming after him and his customers. 
The trash talk has continued to the present.
Just last month, Mr. Dell, touring the United States and Australia, repeatedly predicted Apple's doom.
Earlier this month, Mr. Jobs, noting that, "Michael Dell has been saying some disparaging things about us," used a boxy portable Dell computer as a foil to show off the features of Apple's sleek new iBook. Mr. Jobs vowed that the new laptop would enable his company to recapture the lead in the school market from Dell.
Some say all this counterpunching is best explained by the fact that the industrial era that the two men did much to create is ending.
"There's nothing like a downturn in the computer industry to turn sunshine boys into grumpy old men," said Richard Shaffer, a veteran industry analyst who is publisher of the Computer Letter newsletter.
Accustomed to 20 percent or higher growth rates the last several decades, the United States personal computer industry has actually shrunk the last two quarters.
Computer executives are hoping that the downturn is merely cyclical. But many industry analysts predict that the industry will never grow as quickly as it did in the past, driven first by the spread of the home computer and then the Internet boom. And they say maybe that is what is eating at Mr. Jobs and Mr. Dell.
Through their public relations executives, Mr. Dell and Mr. Jobs declined requests to be interviewed for this article.
Last Thursday, Dell reported a slight decline in its first-quarter earnings from a year earlier and warned that sales would probably be slower in the current quarter. Dell's earnings were hurt by the price war that recently enabled the company to become the world's largest PC maker according to a ranking compiled by the Gartner Group, surpassing Compaq Computer and increasing its market share to 13 percent. 
In April, Apple reported stronger-than-expected profits for its fiscal second quarter on the strength of brisk sales for its titanium-clad PowerBook G4 notebook computer. But Mr. Jobs said Apple was wary of the tough economic climate. And the chief financial officer, Fred Anderson, lowered the year's revenue forecast to $5.8 billion or less, down from $6 billion that had been predicted in January. 
Apple, which in the early 1990's was the market-share leader in the United States personal computer industry, is now sixth, according to the International Data Corporation.
But then Apple, with proprietary chips and software that have long put it outside the Intel-Microsoft mainstream embodied by Dell, has always stood separate from the pack -- just like its founder, Mr. Jobs. It was not by accident that Apple's advertising campaign a few years ago used the slogan "Think Different."
Since Mr. Jobs returned from exile in July 1997 to lead Apple, the company has regained its reputation as a quirky outsider and a risk-taking innovator, gambling that it can survive outside the mainstream. The man and the company are the business antithesis of Mr. Dell and his company, which has become the Chevrolet of desktop computing: Dell Computer has a reputation for value and reliability but little flair.
Although both men are the stuff of industry legend, they have little in common other than both having inspired callow entrepreneurs ever since they founded their companies as remarkably young men: Mr. Jobs, at 21, in his parents' garage in Los Altos, Calif., in 1976; Mr. Dell, at 19, from his University of Texas dorm room, in 1984.
But the differences are vast. 
"They represent very different generations," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has closely followed the computer industry.
Mr. Jobs is a child of the 1960's and 70's, who once dated the folk singer Joan Baez and even now speaks fondly of the counterculture.
Mr. Dell who came of age in the Reagan 80's, is the quintessential Republican businessman. A vocal backer of George W. Bush's presidential campaign who contributed $266,000 to the party and the campaign last year, he has figured prominently in President Bush's technology advisory meetings since the election.
Mr. Jobs was a backer of Bill Clinton, a White House guest who slept in the Lincoln bedroom and returned the favor by letting Mr. Clinton stay in a mansion Mr. Jobs owns in Woodside, Calif., when Mr. Clinton visited his daughter at Stanford.
People who know both Mr. Dell and Mr. Jobs say they are also very different types of executives.
"Michael has been a pioneer in shaping how people buy," said Andrew Heller, a former I.B.M. computer designer who is an investor in Austin, Tex., where Mr. Dell's company is based. It is Dell Computer that has refined the logistics and inventory-control methods of selling computers by telephone and online, assembling each machine and shipping it within hours of the customer's order. 
"Steve's brilliance has been in determining what people want to buy," Mr. Heller said of Mr. Jobs. He thought a moment and added, "Michael is now a very stable executive, while Steve has remained mercurial."
While Mr. Dell has grown into the consummate high-technology manager, marshaling his troops as effectively as they regiment Dell's just-in-time factories, Mr. Jobs has remained a notorious antimanager. He has often said that he focuses more on leadership than on management. Management, he has argued, tends to be about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things they never thought they could.
Compare that philosophy with the advice Mr. Dell dispensed in his 1999 autobiographical business strategy book "Direct From Dell," in which he wrote, "Mobilize your people around a common goal."
Mr. Yoffie, the business professor, said each executive probably recognized the other's strengths. 
"There probably is a little bit of envy on both sides," Mr. Yoffie said. "Dell has never been as creative in industrial design or the on the leading edge as Apple. And Apple has got to be envious of Dell's business model. Market growth has eluded Apple for a decade."
And despite standing astride the world's biggest PC maker, it would be only human if Mr. Dell envied the media spotlight that has been trained on Mr. Jobs since he reclaimed the leadership at Apple four years ago, after having been forced out in a showdown with John Sculley a decade earlier. 
"My sense is that deep down Michael is insecure," said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. "He's done a wonderful job with logistics but nothing else. He's jealous that Steve Jobs has the limelight in the industry because he's innovating and Dell has problems."
But if Mr. Dell must contend with the profit-eroding effects of a price war with Compaq and a multitude of other makers of look-alike Intel-Microsoft PC's, Mr. Jobs faces the challenge of a magician who is only as good as his last astounding trick. 
In January, Apple reported its first money-losing quarter since Mr. Jobs returned to the company. The April financial report was saved by the success of the crowd-pleasing titanium PowerBook. 
Mr. Jobs likes to compare Apple's status to that of a maker of luxury automobiles, saying that his company has a larger share of the personal computer market than Mercedes and BMW combined have of the car market.
But analysts say that Apple must create consistent sales growth if the company is to retain the support of software developers whose programs are crucial to the company's success. They note that the January loss was the result of disappointing sales of last year's ambitious Apple rollout, the G4 Cube.
Mr. Dell faces a different set of problems. Despite its hard-won No. 1 status, Dell has no monopoly on the title of low-cost producer, and the company may find itself a target of Taiwanese manufacturers or at the mercy of consumer whimsy.
Both Dell and Apple are banking on what some analysts say will be a consumer upgrade cycle in 2002 as PC users buy new machines to run Microsoft's latest operating system software, Windows XP, and Apple's own new OS X operating system.
Where the two companies compete most directly is in the education market, which Dell now dominates but where Apple is trying a comeback.
Mr. Jobs has acknowledged that Apple "took its eye off the ball" in the school market, where as recently as 1997 it held a market share of more than 50 percent. But primarily through low-priced PC's and well-regarded customer support, Dell has made a big push into the education market. Last year, according to International Data, Dell's share of the United States education market grew 5.4 percent, to 34.3 percent, while Apple's share fell 3.3 percent, slipping to 19 percent.
No wonder Mr. Jobs seemed to have a chip on his shoulder earlier this month when he took the stage to deride Dell's school laptop and compare it unfavorably to Apple's new iBook. "Some people have wondered if our commitment to education is as strong as it was," Mr. Jobs said. "I can assure that it is."
