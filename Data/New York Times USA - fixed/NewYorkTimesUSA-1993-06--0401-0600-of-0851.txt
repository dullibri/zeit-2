HEADLINE: Doctors Planning Battle Against Health-Care Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 14

 BODY:
Leaders of the American Medical Association laid the groundwork today for an aggressive legal and political campaign against two important elements of the health plan being developed by President Clinton: limits on national health-care spending and on doctors' charges.
The association's board warned that there would be significant constitutional problems if the Government tried to impose price controls or an overall limit on health spending, both of which have been advocated by the White House. 
 The doctors and their lawyers, from the Chicago-based firm of Sidley & Austin, asserted that "a physician's right to practice medicine is a property right" protected by the Fifth Amendment.
In a report to the medical association, which the board has adopted and was passing along to members at the group's annual meeting here, the lawyers wrote:
"When price controls are imposed on all physicians, there can be no claim that they have been incurred voluntarily. The only way to avoid the controls would be to abandon the practice of medicine entirely. However, physicians make huge investments in specialized training and equipment -- an investment which would have no value if not devoted to the practice of medicine. A decision to abandon the profession would completely wipe out this investment."
 
Facing Unanswered Questions
 In addition, the medical association said that although Congress was free to limit Federal spending for health care and may discourage employers from spending money for employee health care, the Fifth Amendment "prohibits the Government from barring individuals from using their own funds or their own insurance coverage to obtain appropriate medical care, based solely on a governmental desire to limit aggregate expenditures on health care."
Under the developing Administration plan, all Americans would be guaranteed a basic package of health benefits. The Administration says the package will be so comprehensive that there will be no need to buy more, but it has not addressed what position the Government would take if people felt such a need.
In Washington today, White House officials said they were not surprised by the positions of the medical association. Robert O. Boorstin, a White House spokesman, said: "I am sure that Justice Department people have looked at these questions. I don't know their conclusion."
On price controls, Mr. Boorstin said, "I have a sneaking suspicion" that the views of consumers and economists will count for more than the views of the American Medical Association.
 
Support and Opposition
 Addressing the medical association on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton said, "We do have to control health costs." But she did not say how. Leaders of the association gave her a warm welcome and said nothing on Sunday about the many issues on which they disagree with the White House.
But today the medical association's board said it planned "an aggressive lobbying effort," in Washington and across the country, to resist price controls, limits on health-care spending and other Clinton proposals opposed by doctors. The doctors support some of Mr. Clinton's ideas, like a guaranteed package of health benefits for all Americans.
To be sure, the Government already limits doctors' fees under Medicare and Medicaid. But those limits are, in a sense, voluntary: doctors do not have to participate in either program. By contrast, the Clinton Administration is considering limits on fees charged by doctors to private patients, as well as Medicare and Medicaid patients.
"Any system of comprehensive medical price controls must guarantee a fair and reasonable return on physician investment," the lawyers for the medical association said. " Any controls on physician prices must be based on detailed evidence of the representative costs of physicians performing similar procedures in the same geographic area. In addition, all physicians must be afforded an expeditious and efficient mechanism for seeking adjustments in controlled prices based on their individual circumstances."
 
Multiple Hearings Foreseen
 Officials of the medical association said that it would be much more difficult for the Government to set prices for doctors' services than for products like natural gas. The association's lawyers said that any system of price controls on doctors' services "must distinguish between different procedures, different physician training levels and different areas of the country."
The doctors' arguments are based on two parts of the Fifth Amendment. One clause says that no person may be deprived of life, liberty or property "without due process of law." The other clause says that private property may not be "taken for public use without just compensation."
The medical association's lawyers said that if the Government set universal controls on doctors' prices, then under the Constitution each doctor must be given an opportunity at a hearing to challenge the fairness of the limits imposed on him.
Mr. Clinton has advocated a "global budget" for all health-care spending, public and private.
But the medical association opposes such limits, and its lawyers said: "The due process clause protects the rights of individuals to use their own funds to purchase health care for themselves. A generalized interest in reducing total societal spending on medical care is not a sufficient reason to interfere with this important individual right."
Doctors across the country plan to distribute a list of questions to be used by patients in evaluating President Clinton's health-care plan. Among the questions, drafted by the medical association, are these:
"Will I still be able to see my own doctor? Will I have to pay extra?
"I have a group insurance policy through my employer. Will that change? Will my premiums, deductibles and copayments go up?
"Will I be able to choose my own type of health insurance? And can I buy extra insurance if I want it?
"Will the quality of care my family receives be maintained under a new system?
"I'm retired and on a fixed income. Will my Medicare coverage be affected?
"Will everybody in America have health insurance? And if so, how will we pay for this?"

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Is Again Proposing to Regulate Vitamins and Supplements

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration will renew its efforts to control vitamins and other dietary supplements on Tuesday, when it announces plans to regulate health claims. The agency will also seek advice on how to assure the safety of the products in the $4 billion market.
Those plans have been met with a vigorous counterattack by the supplement industry, which opposes any new regulations. 
 Americans are swallowing billions of pills in the belief that they bolster the immune system, help them sleep, induce weight loss, fight heart disease and cure cancer. Unlike drugs or foods, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbal products are barely regulated for safety, nutritional content and health claims.
Tuesday's announcement is to have two parts. The F.D.A. will reissue its proposed rule about health claims that was originally published as part of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which takes effect next year. The rule would require nutritional information on most foods and supplements.
 
Industry Won Moratorium

 
 In response to heavy pressure from the supplement industry, Congress placed a one-year moratorium on the section of the act that applied to dietary supplements. If Congress does not renew the moratorium or write new legislation, the rules could take effect in 1994.
Secondly, the agency will begin an inquiry into the safety of preparations using amino acids and herbs.
"The dietary supplement industry is pushing hard for deregulation of their products," said Dr. David A. Kessler, Commissioner of Food and Drugs. "There are no assurances that these products are appropriately manufactured, that what's on the label is actually in the bottle, that they bear adequate directions for use to insure safety or that basic safety data has been collected and reviewed."
The industry is telling its customers that the agency intends to remove hundreds of products from the market and require prescriptions for dozens more.
"The F.D.A. has had a bias against the supplement industry for 50 years," said Gerald Kessler (no relation to Dr. Kessler), chief executive officer of Nature's Plus, a Farmingdale, L.I., manufacturer of dietary supplements, and the executive director of the Natural Nutrition Alliance, one of the more active groups lobbying to prevent the enactment of any new F.D.A. rules.
 
'Erroneous Impression'

 
 Dr. Kessler said the agency's position had been misrepresented. "The public is under the erroneous impression that we are going to limit access to vitamins and minerals."
Michael Taylor, the F.D.A.'s Deputy Commissioner for Policy, said, "If they want to leave their products on the market, all they have to do is take off the health claims."
Scott Bass, a lawyer who represents the supplement industry, demurs: "If the regulations go into effect, the products will be taken off the market because the manufacturers won't take the health-claim labeling off. They are the lifeblood of the industry."
The labeling act states that health claims can be made only when there is "significant scientific agreement." Based on the standard in the legislation, only one dietary supplement health claim would be permitted: calcium and the deterrence of osteoporosis.
The supplement industry is seeking approval for six other claims, including the use of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects in fetuses and antioxidants as a guard against cancer. The folic acid claim will probably be approved in the near future, the agency says.
 
Example of Debate

 
 The effect of antioxidants -- vitamins C and E and beta-carotene -- on cancer prevention is a prime example of the debate between the F.D.A. and the supplement industry.
"What's clear," Mr. Taylor said, "is that fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants seem to reduce the risk of cancer. What is not clear is whether it is the antioxidants that reduce the risk of cancer or something that goes along in fruits and vegetables. Studies of antioxidants get mixed results."
The industry says there is enough evidence now to permit health claims on antioxidants. "Doctors who study antioxidants are already taking them," the alliance's Mr. Kessler said. . "Why shouldn't the public have the same information and let them make the choice?"
The most militant industry members believe the only solution to their battle with the agency is in Congressional legislation that would permit the industry, not the agency, to decide whether its products are safe and its labeling truthful. Under such self-policing, supplements would be considered safe unless the F.D.A. could prove otherwise.
Such legislation, written with the aid of industry lawyers, has been proposed by Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who said that the manufacture of dietary supplements adds at least $700 million to the state's economy.
 
A Moderate Faction

 
 A less militant faction of the industry is represented by the Council for Responsible Nutrition. It acknowledges that there are illegal supplements and unsubstantiated health claims. But it wants the health claims regulations relaxed.
"The F.D.A.'s interpretation of scientific agreement is too stringent," said J. B. Cordaro, executive director of the council.
In the second part of the announcment, the agency said it wants to address the safety of amino acids. Amino acids are used as muscle builders, diet and sleep aids. There have been reports of adverse reactions. L-tryptophan made headlines a few years ago when 38 deaths and 1,500 cases of a painful muscle disorder were attributed to it.
"The burden is on industry to prove these products are safe and can remain on the market," Dr. Kessler said.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: News Analysis -- The 11th-Hour Scramble;
After Hoping for a 'Home Run' in Choosing A Justice, Clinton May Be Just Home Free

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Last March, when President Clinton was presented with the opportunity to make his first Supreme Court selection, he told aides he wanted to take his time, hit a "home run" with his nominee, and choose someone who would make everyone stand up and say, "Wow."
But what was supposed to have been one of the most personally exciting decisions of Mr. Clinton's early Presidency in the end had the appearance of an 11th-hour scramble, with the bodies of other would-be nominees left strewn on the field and three months' careful deliberations boiled down to 36 hours of rapid-fire decisions. 
 When it was over, the sound emanating from the capital was not "Wow," but "Phew" -- a sigh of relief that the White House's handling of another high-level appointment had not turned into a fiasco, after teetering on the edge for several days.
 
An Account Is Depleted
 What happened between last March and today's ceremony in the Rose Garden, when Mr. Clinton introduced his nominee, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is the story of a President who through a series of stumbles has lost so much political capital that he felt impelled to choose a jurist whom he had previously set aside, a jurist he had met only once at a lecture years ago before interviewing her for 90 minutes on Sunday morning, and one who, however respected, seemed the politically safe choice when Mr. Clinton could not afford anything else.
Judge Ginsburg, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, may turn out to be the outstanding Justice that Mr. Clinton predicted. In her Rose Garden appearance, she gave a personal and poignant talk, touching not only on her legal philosophy but also on lessons learned from her mother. Her reflections had the President and many in the audience moved to tears.
Judge Ginsburg has been hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike. But today's decision was clearly part of a pattern in Mr. Clinton's decision making on Bosnia, on his economic package and for his Attorney General. In the end, he makes what are arguably the right choices. But they are reached by the messiest of paths, along which reputations are damaged, the White House looks slipshod and some of the gloss comes off the results.
The President is clearly sensitive to the mounting impression that this is how he makes too many decisions. When a reporter asked him today to explain his decision making and offered him a chance to "disabuse us of any notion" that he had turned to Judge Ginsburg only after it appeared that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt or Judge Stephen G. Breyer of Boston might prove too controversial, Mr. Clinton angrily cut short his news conference.
 
Adjusting to Reality
 The President's original aspiration was to name a political figure, with real-world experience and a "big heart," not automatically another Federal judge. But in part because some of those who fit that description, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, turned him down, and in part because of his political predicament, those criteria had to be subordinated.
What dominated was his need for a nominee who was risk-free, one who would not only sail smoothly through the Senate but also might eclipse some of his most recent embarrassments, reconfirm his move to the political center and give new momentum to his Administration.
As Fred Greenstein, a Presidential scholar at Princeton University, put it: "Judge Ginsburg is a very solid choice, and had the President gone for her immediately last March, I am sure everyone would have applauded."
But once again, Mr. Greenstein added, Mr. Clinton seems to have backed into this choice -- after dangling the names of Mr. Babbitt and Judge Breyer to test the public reaction, and "then withdrawing them in response to outside pressures and his own indecisiveness." A friend of Judge Breyer complained that the New Englander "got sandbagged at the 11th hour."
 
'In the Right Place'
 On both Bosnia and his economic package, Mr. Clinton started out making grand statements with sweeping promises. These were followed by a very public changing of minds and floating of alternative approaches, all of which tended to make him look not particularly decisive or self-confident and angered some of his would-be allies along the way.
"But in the end, on Bosnia, on the economy and on the Court, he seems to have ended up in the right place," said Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution. "Maybe in the course of his Administration he will improve on the journey as well, so that the process will live up to the outcome."
While the process of Judge Ginsburg's selection may have been messy, Mr. Mann added, the choice itself is what counts: "Instead of looking for someone cute, or of marquee value, or who would be a big surprise, Clinton has gone back to first principles -- picking someone who is absolutely first-rate intellectually, who has a truly distinguished record as a judge and legal scholar and whose thinking is firmly in the centrist philosophical terrain chartered by Clinton in his campaign. To me, it is reassuring."
 
A Political Pauper?
 Reassuring or not, this is a choice that says as much about Mr. Clinton's current standing as it does about his legal philosophy.
In terms of political capital -- that intangible resource of Presidential popularity, credibility and air of invincibility -- Mr. Clinton approached his first Supreme Court choice as a pauper. Partly because of his stumbles in recent weeks, and partly because he has taken on more tough challenges than any other President in years, Mr. Clinton is the least-popular newly elected President since political polling began. He simply could not afford another nomination controversy.
The priority that Mr. Clinton ended up putting on political safety could be seen from the events of the past week, as well as the fact that the President got most of the Senate Judiciary Committee to attend the Ginsburg announcement at the Rose Garden -- just in case anyone doubted her bipartisan support.
Interior Secretary Babbitt, who aides say was really Mr. Clinton's favorite choice, was dropped late last week after resistance from a coalition of environmentalists lobbying to keep him at the Interior Department, from political advisers who did not want the President to risk losing Mr. Babbitt's following among Western states (where Mr. Clinton won one-third of his electoral votes) and from Republicans who questioned his legal credentials.
Late last week, several officials said Judge Breyer, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, had supplanted Mr. Babbitt. But over the weekend, it was disclosed that the judge had failed to pay Social Security taxes for an elderly woman who did housecleaning for him. Most senators and women's groups said the mistake should not be disqualifying. But who could say how the public might have reacted?
Eighty-eight days ago, when Justice Byron R. White announced his retirement and Mr. Clinton had more capital in his political bank account, he might as easily have opted for Mr. Babbitt or Judge Breyer as for Judge Ginsburg. But by today he was convinced it had to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Rose Garden. The President said she was the perfect choice.

HEADLINE: Delinquencies On Loans Fall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The delinquency rate on consumer loans fell during the first quarter to the lowest level in nearly four years, improving prospects for retail spending later this year, a trade group said today.
A seasonally adjusted 2.31 percent of consumer loans were 30 days or more past due at the end of March, down from 2.43 percent three months earlier, the American Bankers Association said. 
 "This is another break in the clouds suggesting fairer weather in the coming months for the economy," said James Chessen, chief economist of the association.
A year earlier, the delinquency rate stood at 2.75 percent. The latest rate, a composite for eight types of installment loans, was the lowest since 2.30 percent at the end of June 1989.
"There's been a conscious effort by individuals to put their finances in better shape," said Robert G. Dederick, economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The eight types of loans included in the composite delinquency rate are: auto loans made directly by banks, auto loans purchased by banks from other loan originators, personal loans, fixed-term second mortgages, home improvement loans, recreational vehicle loans, mobile-home loans and boat loans.
By state, rates varied from lows of 0.61 percent in Florida, 1.04 percent in Arizona and 1.16 percent in Wisconsin to highs of 6.21 percent in Puerto Rico, 4.68 percent in Connecticut and 4.28 percent in New York.
The report also showed that the delinquency rate for bank credit cards -- which are not included in the composite rate -- dropped from 2.93 percent at the end of December to 2.74 percent at the end of March.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rejects Notion That Human Rights Vary With Culture

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 14

 BODY:
Responding to a challenge by some authoritarian governments in the third world, the United States warned today that it would oppose any attempt to use religious and cultural traditions to weaken the concept of universal human rights.
The strong statement set the stage for a intense struggle between Western countries committed to the universality of human rights and countries that oppose what they describe as the imposition of Western values. 
Speaking on the opening day of the first World Conference on Human Rights in 25 years, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the universality of human rights set a single standard of acceptable behavior around the world, a standard Washington would apply to all countries.
Adhering to conference rules that ban criticism of specific countries, Mr. Christopher did not name the nations that challenge the universality of human rights. But he noted, "We cannot let cultural relativism become the last refuge of repression."
Some countries say human rights should be interpreted differently in regions with non-Western cultures. The countries holding this view are led by China, Syria and Iran, and include Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Yemen, Vietnam and Cuba.
The United States and its allies view this position an attempt to win United Nations approval for a delay of democracy and political freedom.
Foreign Minister Ali A. Alatas of Indonesia, the only representative of this group to speak today, rejected the charge that some countries were promoting a concept of human rights "based on some nebulous notion of 'cultural relativism,' as spuriously alleged by some quarters."
But, without mentioning Bosnia and Herzegovina by name, he seemed to accuse Western nations of applying a double standard when he noted that "a few hundred kilometers from here, an entire nation is being subjected to brutal aggression, mass murder, systematic rape and the inhuman practice of ethnic cleansing."
 
Statement of U.S. Policy
 In what was viewed as the Clinton Administration's first major policy statement on human rights, Mr. Christopher acknowledged continued violations around the world, but he also applauded recent successes, like the reversal of a coup in Guatemala and elections in Cambodia.
He made only a brief mention of Bosnia, vowing that those guilty of "ethnic cleansing" there would be punished. But in sharp contrast to his scathing attack on the Serbs in February, today he referred only to "those who desecrate these rights."
A key purpose of Mr. Christopher's speech, and of the United States role at the two-week conference, is nonetheless to defend the universality of human rights. And he pointed out that countries that respect human rights are generally the most peaceful and stable, while the worst violators are the world's aggressors and those who encourage the spread of arms.
 
Specific Steps Urged
 Mr. Christopher, who promoted human rights as Deputy Secretary of State in the Carter Administration, also called for the appointment of a United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights and of a special United Nations envoy to investigate violence against women.
The Administration, which has defined human rights as a focus of foreign policy, will also press for Senate ratification of four treaties -- to eliminate racial discrimination and discrimination against women, to protect the economic rights of the poor and to codify basic human rights and duties.
The Administration seems to be developing a flexible carrot-and-stick approach, using incentives to modify the behavior of countries it considers capable of improvement, like Turkey and China, while punishing those it considers renegades, like Iran. Former President Jimmy Carter, who was in the audience when Mr. Christopher spoke, was more willing to provoke crises with countries that had poor human rights records.
The Clinton Administration's approach has brought a mixed response from human rights organizations.
On the one hand, the Administration has been praised for its decision to ratify the four treaties, for its emphasis on women's rights and for its appointments of longtime proponents of human rights to key positions, particularly John Shattuck as Assistant Secretary of State for human rights issues.
But some human rights organizations have sharply criticized the Administration for failing to fulfill Mr. Clinton's campaign promises on human rights. The most dramatic such example was Washington's decision to forcibly return Haitian boat people seeking political asylum.
As the conference began, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, noted that some countries use the human rights debate as an instrument of national policy.
 
Support From Head of U.N.
 "There is no denying that some states constantly try to hijack or confiscate human rights," he said.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali backed the universality of human rights, even arguing that the international community had a right to intervene if governments "become tormentors" of their peoples. "In these circumstances, the international community must take over from the states that fail to fulfill their obligations," he said.
After policy statements from some 160 governments, the conference is to prepare a final declaration on human rights, which is expected to become the main battleground between "universalists" and those wishing to define human rights in religious, cultural, economic and social terms.
While national delegates are not permitted to criticize countries by name, no such rules bind representatives here from 1,000 non-governmental organizations. Many of these groups deal with specific problems, from discrimination against aboriginals in Australia to child abuse in Brazil.
As delegates arrived for the conference, at the Austria Center, a group of Kurds protested noisily against what they called repression by the Turkish Government, and five Buddhist priests sat quietly with posters demanding "religious freedom for a Free Vietnam."
Twelve winners of the Nobel Peace Prize boycotted the opening to protest the United Nations decision to ban the Dalai Lama from addressing the non-governmental organizations during their three-day forum here last week.
And on the edges of the conference, Mr. Christopher met with the foreign ministers of Israel, Syria and Egypt. Despite the Administration's concerns about human rights abuses in these three countries, the talks focused on the Middle East peace talks, which are to resume Tuesday in Washington.

HEADLINE: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- Third of six articles.;
Few Emigres Can Fight Mistreatment on the Job

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Last August, when K. Shah worked at a construction site renovating brownstones in Brooklyn, he complained to his bosses that he was suffering shooting pains in his arm. The illegal Pakistani immigrant, assigned to heave 70-pound concrete blocks from the sidewalk to the fifth floor using a rudimentary block and tackle, was told to keep quiet and keep working.
Two days later, Mr. Shah, 37, suffered a heart attack on the job. It felt like his chest was on fire, he said. Reluctantly, after warning him not to tell hospital officials where he worked, his bosses allowed him to leave and take a subway to North Central Bronx Hospital. Two weeks later, he underwent bypass surgery. 
 When Mr. Shah, who would not provide his first name because of fear of deportation, was released from the hospital, he requested his $1,500 in back wages. To date, his bosses have refused to pay.
 
Condemned to Exploitation
 Although the city's growing underground economy provides jobs and opportunities for some, it condemns an increasing number of immigrants to a life of ever-worsening exploitation. Pressed by unscrupulous employers, they labor under conditions that most Americans, aware of their rights, would not tolerate.
Experts believe that this exploitation results from ruthless cost-cutting during the recession, rising anti-immigrant sentiment and a new immigration law that unintentionally gives employers more power over their immigrant workers.
While no statistics measure immigrants' exploitation, advocates insist that the mistreatment is growing more and more routine.
"I am seeing consistent, recurring abuse that worries me," said Jennifer Gordon, a lawyer who runs a work-place project at the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, L.I. "It is in the nature of these underground work places, which tend to be very small. The employers feel that nobody sees them, that their workers are invisible, and that they have license to act as they feel without repercussion."
The degree of mistreatment varies, from the recent, extreme case of the anguished Chinese immigrants kept in indentured servitude in a locked warehouse in New Jersey to the perpetual frustrations of the many immigrant workers denied proper pay.
But most commonly, immigrants working underground, typically as garment workers, restaurant busboys and day laborers, are denied minimum wage and overtime or are kept waiting months for their wages. They are frequently dismissed, and occasionally turned over to immigration officials, for complaining or contacting union organizers. And because illegal construction workers receive little training, and underground factory workers get paltry protection from the chemicals they handle, immigrants are frequently sickened or maimed on the job.
"What happened to this Pakistani man is any day in the week in New York, an absolute working nightmare," said Brian O'Dwyer, a lawyer and immigration specialist who represents Mr. Shah. "Have human lives and human labor become so cheap and expendable that we can now operate a construction firm like a third world company in the middle of New York?"
Generally, those legal and illegal immigrants who get exploited do not speak English, possess little education and few skills, and do not understand their considerable rights as underground workers. Many accept mistreatment as the price they pay for coming to America.
However, labor laws protect illegal as well as legal immigrants, underground and mainstream workers. Anyone can file wage claims and press abuse charges with local district attorneys, and their immigration status remains confidential.
Still, immigrant workers are reluctant to speak up. The Federal and state Labor Departments collected more than $7.7 million in unpaid wages for 11,000 workers in New York City last year. But the authorities consider that a "dent" in the amount owed, most of which was never reported, said Mark Molisani, a spokesman for the New York State department. And they believe that only a fraction went to new immigrant workers, the least likely to file claims.
Many new immigrants are frightened to seek redress for their grievances because they so often are threatened with deportation or dismissal. In fact, the threat often comes from older, more established immigrants, since they control many of the work places where newer immigrants find their first jobs -- like the Brooklyn site where Mr. Shah worked for legal Pakistani immigrants.
Still, some immigrants, like Mr. Shah, Henry Yu, Antonio Bueno and the garment workers at S.T.C. Knitwear in Queens, stand up for themselves. Theirs are four typical examples of the warped dynamic between employers and their immigrant workers that haunts underground work places across the city. The only thing atypical is that they spoke out.
 
Construction Worker
Waging a War Over Back Wages
Mr. Shah, a former soldier in the Pakistani Army, spent his life savings and then some -- $12,000 -- to pay a smuggler for a plane ticket and a tourist visa to travel to the United States. His dream was to become legalized and join the United States Army.
But with virtually no command of English and no working papers, Mr. Shah took what he could find, construction jobs offered by contractors who spoke Urdu, his language.
Last summer, Alpha Construction, an unincorporated company in the Bronx, hired Mr. Shah and several other illegal Pakistani immigrants to rehabilitate a city-owned brownstone on Stockholm Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn. They were promised $8 an hour.
None of the men was happy with the primitive working conditions, but their bosses warned them that any complaint would result in their eventual deportation, Mr. Shah said.
 
A Will to Press On
 "They said, 'We are holding green cards, so nobody will do anything to us,' " Mr. Shah said.
After he recovered from surgery, Mr. Shah, penniless with hospital bills of $50,000, sought to prove his former bosses wrong. He found a savvy Pakistani immigrant who helped him contact the Center for Immigrant Rights, which referred Mr. Shah to Mr. O'Dwyer, the lawyer. And in mid-April, a judge ordered Mr. Shah's former bosses -- Mohammed Aftab and Boota Mohammed -- to pay $7,300 in back wages to him and his fellow workers.
Leslie Maron, a lawyer for Mr. Aftab, said his client maintained that he did not owe Mr. Shah and the others any money. But Mr. Mohammed said he and Mr. Aftab were also victims of nonpayment. He said that Alpha Construction was never paid by the construction company that subcontracted the work to them. He said that they and their workers are owed about $65,000.
Whether Mr. Shah ever collects his due remains to be seen. Meanwhile, immigration officials, who do not seek out the immigrant plaintiffs of lawsuits, have not attempted to deport him. And Mr. Shah said his bad experience was not enough to force him back to Pakistan voluntarily.
Like many disillusioned immigrants, Mr. Shah refuses to leave until he has at least recuperated his initial investment -- and his pride.
 
Clothes Pressers
Conditions Cause Illness and Revolt
Four of the clothes pressers at S & T Cleaners in Long Island City were concerned. By 8 P.M., the end of the work day, they usually felt giddy, light-headed and nauseous. Their skin was dotted with water blisters.
Henry Yu, a legal immigrant from Hong Kong, and three co-workers asked the boss of the commercial dry-cleaning company to improve the ventilation because the chemicals used were backing up into the overheated plant. They also wanted the steam pipe insulated because they worked crowded around it "like sardine fish," Mr. Yu said. At the least, they believed, they should be given information about the chemicals to which they were being exposed.
For their concerns, they were dismissed.
Mr. Yu and the other pressers, with the help of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association in Chinatown, filed two complaints with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration: one for their retaliatory firing, the other for reportedly hazardous conditions.
An investigation of S & T is under way. The owner, William Shui, declined to comment. And at the steamy plant in the Queens neighborhood of warehouses and factories, he replaced Mr. Yu and the others with illegal immigrant workers, Mr. Yu said.
 
Sweater Makers
Using I.N.S. Law Against Workers
 As a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires employers to check the immigration status of all employees, most bosses now know who is legal and who is not. That knowledge gives heft to a club that employers have long brandished over immigrant workers, the threat of reporting insubordinates to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
What happened at S.T.C. Knitwear demonstrates how the new immigration law provided a pivotal turning point in a confrontation that ended in losses for both the company and the workers. Six S.T.C. workers and several union officials gave this account. Michael Cooper, a lawyer for S.T.C., said his clients did not want to comment.
At first S.T.C., was a model, non-union shop in an airy new complex in Long Island City. The sweater factory paid its mostly Hispanic immigrant workers minimum wage and overtime, afforded them medical benefits, holidays and vacation days, and gave them two breaks a day, plus lunch.
"We had a family-like environment with no fear in our throats," said Cristina Chavez, a Peruvian immigrant who trimmed the excess threads from sweaters and packed them for shipment.
 
New Manager Brings Change
 But when a new manager took over the company at the end of 1991, everything changed.
Bit by bit, the owners -- who sold sweaters to Macy's, Caldor, Kmart, J. C. Penney and Alexander Julian -- sought to take the shop underground. First, the medical benefits went, then the vacations, then the holidays, then the work breaks. The paychecks no longer bore stubs that indicated taxes were being withheld.
And finally, on May 7, 1992, as the women sat before their knitting machines and irons, the forewoman announced the institution of the "Korean work week," a mandatory 49 hours with no overtime pay.
That was the last straw. After the meeting, most of the workers huddled, then walked out. On the advice of a "colonizer," a union member placed in the factory as a presser, about 30 S.T.C. workers took the subway to an office of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Joseph Lombardo, a union official, was impressed by their spirit and returned with them to the plant.
"I been doing this all my life and this is the gutsiest group of women I ever met," Mr. Lombardo said.
The company manager, informed that S.T.C. would be picketed, told the union representatives he had never approved the announced changes and promised to treat the workers like family if they returned. They did, but the treatment was anything but familial, they said.
 
Both Sides Lose
 "We were barely allowed to talk to each other, and when the boss came by we were supposed to salute him like a king," said Blanca Julian, an Ecuadorean.
In September, the union won an election to represent the workers at S.T.C., 36 to 10. A month later, on Oct. 19, the day before contract negotiations were set to begin, immigration agents showed up at the shop at the request of the owner. The names of 11 union advocates, illegal immigrants like most others at the shop, were called. And 10 of the 11 were handcuffed to one another and taken into custody. (Ms. Chavez hid under a table and escaped arrest.)
"They corralled us like animals, and we thought, well, we're going to the airport, time to say goodbye to New York," said Montserrat Arias, a 20-year-old Mexican immigrant.
But the workers were only taken to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, and eventually their deportation hearings were postponed until August 1994. I.N.S. officials, embarrassed that they had been used by S.T.C., even gave the workers temporary working papers until that time, a union official said.
As a result, five of the workers have since found steady work, Ms. Chavez is studying English, and Ms. Julian is enrolled in "super sewer" classes at a garment industry school. All the workers are contemplating their experience, which both disillusioned them about their place in this country and gave them faith in the system's willingness to undo wrongs.
As for the company, S.T.C. Knitwear closed shop in April, days before it was supposed to sign a final union contract with the remaining immigrant workers. The company eventually paid the immigrants apprehended by immigration officials an undisclosed settlement.
 
Factory Worker
A Dream Deferred By Wage Dispute
Antonio Bueno, a 46-year-old teacher, had not come to the United States to stay. A year ago, he traveled from his native Honduras for a vacation. But fellow Hondurans, successfully squirreling away money that could buy them a nice little house back home, convinced Mr. Bueno to try his luck.
A friend took him to the small factory, Minuteman Manufacturing Inc. on Long Island, where she worked, and he began that day with an offer of $5 an hour for threading screws and other machine work. In May 1992, Mr. Bueno said, he worked virtually around the clock, enough hours to earn him $2,240. He was paid $1,000, and promised more in subsequent months, he said.
In June, Mr. Bueno and the other workers were not paid anything, he said. The others, who had worked there longer, quit in July. Mr. Bueno, promised pay at the end of July, stayed on as the sole worker. He also moved into the factory at the owner's suggestion. Mr. Bueno slept on the rug in his boss's office. He could not go out at night because he did not know the code for the burglar alarm, he said. The owner brought him food, and told him to think about his unpaid wages as a savings plan, he said.
In December, eight months after his last paycheck, Mr. Bueno decided that he had had enough, and he announced his intention to report his boss to the Government. Mr. Bueno said his boss then threatened to report him to the immigration service.
 
Lawsuits From Other Workers
 Mr. Bueno sought counsel from a priest, who directed him to the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead. In late February, Jennifer Gordon, a lawyer based there, filed claims with the state and Federal Labor Departments to recover $12,573 in back wages for Mr. Bueno.
Mr. Bueno's boss, Steven Nicastro, said his former employee was a "pathological liar" who was paid for every minute he worked. But four other former employees, all Hispanic illegal immigrants, have filed or are preparing to file wage claims or suit against Mr. Nicastro, demanding another $12,500 in back pay. They confirmed Mr. Bueno's charges of systematic nonpayment, Ms. Gordon said.
Mr. Bueno, meanwhile, has lost faith in the feeble dream he had of making it in the United States. His wife died on May 25, but he did not have enough money to fly home for the funeral. Utterly defeated, he now plans, unlike Mr. Shah, to give up on the United States and return to his children, he said.
"I came with money, I will leave without money," Mr. Bueno said. "So many of my compatriots seem to have succeeded here, but I, I have failed."

Georgia High Court Rules Fleet Loan Practices Legal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 14

 BODY:
Fleet Finance Inc.'s widely criticized second-mortgage loan practices may be morally wrong but are legal, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled today.
Fleet, accused of trapping poor people in high-interest loans laden with expensive fees, did not violate Georgia's usury laws when it spread closing costs through the life of its loans, the court said. 
 "Although we do not condone Fleet's interest charging practices, which are widely viewed as exorbitant, unethical and perhaps even immoral, and suggest further regulation of the lending industry is needed by our General Assembly . . . we are constrained to hold that the loans in question are legal," the court said.
Fleet is the largest second-mortgage lender in the state and has operations in 22 other states. Fleet, based in Atlanta, is a subsidiary of Fleet Financial Group Inc., based in Providence, R.I. Fleet Financial Group is the nation's 14th-largest banking company.
 
 
'Clears the Air'
 Fleet called the ruling a complete vindication for the company.
"This decision clears the air of Fleet's alleged usury violations," R. Harold Owens, the president of Fleet Finance, said.
Fleet has been at the center of an uproar over so-called predatory lending, a controversy that led to hearings before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington earlier this year. Fleet is named in three other lawsuits in Georgia and is the subject of a state investigation.
At issue in the case before the Georgia Supreme Court was Fleet's practice of charging high up-front fees at the closing of a loan and then spreading them at high interest rates, up to 19.9 percent a year, throughout the span of the loan. Many of Fleet's customers are people who do not qualify for regular bank loans.
Dissenting, Justice Robert Benham warned of "chaos" resulting from the decision. He also said the court's interpretation would attract unscrupulous lenders to Georgia.

HEADLINE: Gore Promises U.S. Leadership On Sustainable Development Path

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 14

 BODY:
The United States emerged from the Earth Summit last year in Rio de Janeiro, in the view of many delegates who attended, not as global leader on the environment but rather as global foot-dragger. Today, exactly a year after the meeting adjourned, Vice President Al Gore told a new United Nations commission charged with carrying on the gathering's work that those days are over.
At Rio, nearly 180 nations committed themselves to policies that would enable them to develop their economies while preserving the environment and the renewable natural resources on which future prosperity depends -- "sustainable development," it was called. They also put together a broad blueprint, called Agenda 21, for arresting environmental degradation. 
 "If there is any doubt about the support of the United States for that commitment, let me lay it to rest right here and now," Mr. Gore told representatives to the first substantive meeting of the 53-nation Commission on Sustainable Development, created by the United Nations General Assembly to translate the Rio accords into action. "This administration not only supports that commitment," Mr. Gore said, "we intend to join with all those determined to demonstrate real leadership."
 
New Presidential Panel
 In one of a series of new actions and positions taken by the Clinton Administration on the international environmental front, Mr. Gore told the delegates that the United States was creating a 25-member President's Council on Sustainable Development to create new approaches for combining economic development with environmental protection at home.
One of its functions will be to come up with a plan for the nation's role in fulfilling the Rio accords. President Clinton formally established the council this afternoon. Its members are to come from government, industry and environmental groups.
The 12-day meeting here is "an opportunity for us to publicly resume the leadership that the world expects of us," said Timothy E. Wirth, a former Senator who is counselor to the State Department and is scheduled to become Under Secretary for Global Affairs. Recent Administration actions make it clear, Mr. Wirth said, that "we have sharply changed U.S. policy."
In April, Mr. Clinton announced that the United States would go beyond the Bush policy on global warming by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Bush Administration had rejected this timetable, advocated by the Europeans, and insisted that weaker provisions be included in a treaty negotiated before Rio but signed there.
 
Treaty to Rescue Species
 Mr. Clinton announced that the United States would sign a treaty, signed by more than 150 other countries in Rio, and also negotiated in advance, to protect the world's dwindling stock of living species. In an action that perhaps more than anything else contributed to the Bush Administration's obstructionist image, the United States had been alone among large countries in refusing to sign the accord. The biodiversity treaty, as it is called, was signed here on June 4 by Madeleine Albright, the American representative to the United Nations.
In April, the United States also overturned another Bush policy by declaring itself open to a broadening of an agreement to protect tropical forests exploited in the international timber trade. Developing countries, where the tropical forests are situated, want the agreement expanded to include forests in temperate countries as well. The tropical countries have protested that the existing agreement discriminates against them by excluding temperate forests.
In early May, Mr. Wirth announced here that the United States, again reversing the Bush and Reagan positions, would put control of the exploding world population high on its agenda and would increase foreign aid for population programs. At the same meeting, Mr. Wirth acknowledged that the consumption patterns of industrial countries like the United States contributed disproportionately to the degradation of the global environment, a view fervently held by developing countries but minimized by the Bush Administration.
Mr. Gore today re-emphasized the industrialized countries' impact on the environment, declaring that "a child born in the United States will have, in his or her lifetime, 30 times more impact on the earth's environment than a child born in India." He asserted that "the affluent of the world have a responsibility to deal with their disproportionate impact."
In late May, the Clinton Administration held out another olive branch to the developing countries in Beijing at a meeting of delegates to the Global Environmental Facility. This is a relatively new organization created by the World Bank and the United Nations to channel money from rich countries to poor ones for environmental projects.
Developing countries have feared that they would have little say over the financing; that the industrialized countries would call the tune through the World Bank. At Beijing, the United States supported a move for more independence from the World Bank and more democratic governance of the global environmental fund, to the delight of both Southern countries and environmentalists.
The Clinton Administration is also seeking to redirect some of its foreign aid toward sustainable development projects and is lobbying the World Bank toward the same end.
The United States "is extending a friendly hand for the first time in a long time to the developing world," said Liz Barratt-Brown, a specialist in global environmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy organization. "Clearly," she said, "the U.S. is the key to resolving all these issues."
But while "the rhetoric is great in these international forums" Ms. Barratt-Brown said, the Administration must still back up its aspirations for renewed leadership with concrete actions to fulfill its own environmental responsibilities. What is important she said, "is what's going to happen on the ground" in the United States.
One of the first indications of this is to come in August, when the Administration presents its detailed plan for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels.
 
U.S. as a Bridge
 The new opening to what used to be called the third world is deliberate. "We can be the bridge" between the rest of the industrialized world and the developing countries, said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I would hope we would see more of that" at the New York meeting.
As the Earth Summit adjourned last year, delegates recognized that its goal of sustainable development and improved environmental protection would not be achieved quickly. Still, the rich industrialized countries of the North and the poor developing countries of the South struck a bargain in which the North pledged financial and technological aid to the South in a mutual effort to achieve sustainable development. And there was a general feeling that with the cold war over, the environment had joined economics and military security at the top of the international agenda.
But in the last 12 months, the global recession and the emergence of regional conflicts like that in the Balkans have eclipsed the environment as an object of international attention. In this climate, some diplomats expressed modest expectations for what the Commission on Sustainable Development might accomplish in its first meeting.
The meeting is nevertheless expected to tell much about whether the fragile bargain struck at Rio between Northern countries anxious about the global environment and Southern countries jealous of their right to develop as they see fit will hold together, and whether the work of Rio will be carried forward in any tangible way.
Not least of the underlying issues is a fear among developing countries that the Commission on Sustainable Development might become a watchdog that could make financial aid conditional on a country's environmental policies. At the same time, some environmentalists and industrialized countries want greater assurance that money and technology given Southern countries to promote sustainable development is actually used for that purpose.
 
Lack of Enforcement Power
 The commission has no power to enforce anything. It will reach decisions by consensus and rely on publicity and international pressure to make countries keep their promises under Agenda 21. The climate and biodiversity treaties are legally binding and have their own governing organizations.
Razali Ismail, the Malaysian representative to the United Nations, who is the commission's chairman, said that if the issues of finance and technology transfer could be addressed at the New York meeting without "negativism," it would be "a major accomplishment."
The critical issues of financing, technology transfer and reporting of progress by individual countries will be considered by the commission at annual meetings. The question of reporting is sensitive because of some countries' fears that environmental progress will outweigh financial considerations in dispensing aid. Specific issues dealt with in Agenda 21 -- from water quality to desertification, forests and species protection, to the atmosphere and oceans to toxic chemicals -- will be taken up once every three years.
Environmentalists have suggested that the new commission might go far toward establishing its credibility by dealing with a hugely important but noncontroversial issue: water quality and supply throughout the world. This is an especially critical matter in developing countries, where contaminated water is the norm and millions of people die every year as a result.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Conference Ends With Little Hope For AIDS Cure

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 14

 BODY:
Only an eternal optimist would have left the ninth international AIDS meeting here last week believing that new drugs will be available anytime soon to save the lives of the 14 million people now infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Or believing that a vaccine would be developed in time to prevent the number of those infected from soaring to at least 30 million by the year 2000, as the World Health Organization predicts.
A realist, on the other hand, would be heeding the one clear message sounded at the meeting: prevention is the only way to stop the alarming spread of the virus, H.I.V., throughout the world. 
 "The AIDS epidemic is an emergency, but society is responding as if it were not," Dr. Lars O. Kallings, a Swedish AIDS expert, told colleagues at the meeting.
The sad fact is that many believe the huge spread of the virus over the last decade could have been thwarted by wider application of what has been known since the earliest AIDS meetings.
Health workers have emphasized the multiplier effect of prevention: each case prevented reduces the chance of further spread and more deaths. The most compelling argument for prevention is humanitarian. But to political leaders concerned about cost, the economic aspect of prevention is crucial, because each case costs tens of thousands of dollars to treat.
Dr. James W. Curran, who heads the AIDS program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he left the meeting "dispirited by the relentless assault of the virus."
Dr. Curran urged that a national meeting, focused entirely on prevention, be held in the United States. One purpose of the meeting would be to unite the many disparate groups devoted to family planning, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, H.I.V. prevention, public health and similar fields, all of which seek a common goal but work separately. Another aim would be to duplicate successful programs and identify barriers to prevention.
Scientists have much to learn about AIDS. Yet experts feel certain they have accumulated more than enough evidence about steps that can vastly reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. These include sex education, promotion of condoms and safer sex, improved diagnosis, needle exchange programs and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.
"How many times do we need to prove how frank and effective messages can bring about safer sexual behavior in young people, especially if the education starts early enough?" Dr. Michael H. Merson, who heads the World Health Organization's AIDS program, said at the close of the meeting.
"If we do not insure that they have the knowledge and skills they need," he went on, "we betray young people, and the planet they will inherit."
It will be decades at the earliest before scientists come up with the ideal AIDS vaccine, one that is safe, inexpensive, swallowed and, in a single dose, provides lifetime protection against all strains of H.I.V., said Dr. Peter Lemptey of Family Health International in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
No standard vaccine against any infection achieves that degree of prevention. But even if a less than ideal AIDS vaccine were available tomorrow, it could be the second decade of the 21st century before it began to reduce the toll from AIDS.
"We must understand that despite a vaccine, AIDS will not go away," said Dr. Walter Dowdle, the deputy director of the disease-control agency.
The news was equally bleak about anti-H.I.V. drugs, both the standard drug AZT and experimental ones.
AZT does not prolong life for symptomless infected people, preliminary results of a European study found in April. At that time, many Federal health officials and other American experts were defensive about their earlier recommendations for AZT. Some dismissed the study as flawed.
But much more data of the study were reported here, and the debates about the early use of AZT became a main subject of the meeting. Now, although the final report is months from publication, even most critics say the study seems to have no major flaws.
Many American experts, while disputing the findings, also said they were not surprised by the European findings because they knew that AZT had limited benefit for a limited time. It is for that reason, the European authors of the study said, that they prefer to wait until symptoms develop and a patient needs the drug, rather than to start treatment at an early stage. Next week, the National Institutes of Health is holding a meeting to discuss early treatment for H.I.V. infection, which is expected to include a discussion of the optimal time to start AZT treatment.
American doctors have also said that the European study findings are outdated because treatment with more than one drug, in sequence or combination, is the wave of the future in AIDS. So far, no study has documented the validity of such an approach. And the report on one such study presented here by Dr. Margaret A. Fischl of the University of Miami was disappointing. Dr. Fischl's N.I.H.-sponsored study was one of the first to assess the effectiveness of combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs. It involved 991 patients whose AIDS condition worsened despite treatment with AZT. No improvement was found when AZT was combined with another drug, DDC, compared with DDC alone or after continued treatment with AZT.
The need for increased preventive efforts, particularly sex education, is underscored by data from the World Health Organization showing that half of new H.I.V. infections are occurring among people who are 25 or younger. As Dr. Karen Hein of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and others said at the meeting, the great fear is that teen-agers represent the next wave in the AIDS epidemic.
Dr. Mariella Baldo, an Italian scientist, said she had reviewed 19 studies of sex education for W.H.O., which found that sex education led not to more sex but to more responsible sex. It also led to postponement of first intercourse, safer sex and fewer unwanted pregnancies. Dr. Baldo also found that access to condoms did not encourage teen-agers to have more partners. School-based sex education programs were more effective if started before a student's first intercourse.
Preventing H.I.V. infection in women is a top priority because they are a fast-growing group in the epidemic and because they can pass on the virus to their children. The risk of transmitting H.I.V. from mother to child ranges from 25 to 30 percent in developing countries and from 15 to 30 percent in developed countries; the reason for the difference is unknown.
Participants also said that sex education was imperative if the condition of women in the world was to improve. Because women have little control over the use of condoms and because the female condom has not been proved effective against transmission of H.I.V., the World Health Organization has made the development of a vaginal foam that can kill H.I.V. a top research priority.
Because progress in science is usually slow, it should not be surprising that research on AIDS, which was first recognized in 1981, has yielded limited achievements. Centuries of intensive research on cancer and many other diseases have produced some effective treatments, but rarely cures and vaccines.
But because researchers have boasted about learning more about H.I.V. at a faster pace than with any other microbe, implying that cures and vaccines are around the corner, expectations have been high. The public has looked to the international AIDS meetings for scientific breakthroughs.
At times scientists have been perceived as more interested in competing for awards and public attention than in battling AIDS. In emphasizing the importance of prevention, Cindy Robin of Toronto, who is president of the Global Network of People Living With H.I.V./AIDS, a co-sponsor of the meeting, said that scientists should be aware that "there is a much more important prize available than the Nobel one; it's the saving of millions of lives, and that is an award a lot of people can share" for efforts in prevention.
The international AIDS meetings have come under attack from many critics as counterproductive because of their huge size and circuslike atmosphere. On the eve of this meeting, Nature, a leading British scientific journal, for example, called for their end.
But Dr. Kallings, the Swedish expert, defended the meetings, saying they served a valuable function, in part because the degree of involvement by people with AIDS as well as scientists distinguished the international AIDS meeting from virtually all others.
"Scientific conferences on cancer, heart disease or sexually transmitted diseases do not regularly include patients in their conceptualization and planning," Dr. Kallings said.
Moods vary after each AIDS meeting. A few have been upbeat. Others, like this one, have been discouraging.
The challenge, Dr. Kallings said, is whether people can come to the next meeting, which will be held in August 1994 in Yokohama, Japan, with "positive examples of how policies have been changed" and proof that such change reduced high-risk behavior and H.I.V. infection.
Meanwhile, millions more will become infected.

Decline of America's Landscape and the Blame

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
The Geography of Nowhere
The Rise and Decline of America's Man-Made Landscape
By James Howard Kunstler
303 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23.
"Eighty percent of everything ever built in America has been built in the last 50 years," writes the novelist and reporter James Howard Kunstler in his stimulating new book, "and most of it is depressing, brutal, ugly, unhealthy and spiritually degrading: the jive-plastic commuter tract home wastelands, the Potemkin village shopping plazas with their vast parking lagoons, the Lego-block hotel complexes, the 'gourmet mansardic' junk-food joints, the Orwellian office 'parks' featuring buildings sheathed in the same reflective glass as the sunglasses worn by chain-gang guards, the particle-board garden apartments rising up in every meadow and cornfield, the freeway loops around every big and little city with their clusters of discount merchandise marts, the whole destructive, wasteful, toxic, agoraphobia-inducing spectacle that politicians proudly call 'growth.' " 
 Just how the American landscape got to be this way and what can be done about it are the subjects that Mr. Kunstler tackles with considerable energy and wit in "The Geography of Nowhere."
As Mr. Kunstler sees it, the main culprit responsible for the deterioration of the American landscape is the country's ethos of individualism, a belief he says degrades "the idea of the public realm and hence of the landscape tissue that ties together the thousands of pieces of private property that make up a town, a suburb, a state." The American dream of owning a house (and an automobile too) has led, he argues, to a nation of isolated and alienated individuals, who spend more and more time commuting to work and much of their remaining time at home alone with their televisions.
Whereas early 17th-century New England towns (which were modeled on late medieval towns in England) were tiny, self-contained communities centered on a church or meeting house, today's suburbs tend to be sprawling collections of houses, connected to one another only by networks of streets. The mixture of income levels and of business and residential neighborhoods that used to be found in American towns and cities has diminished, because of restrictive zoning laws and the middle-class migration to outlying suburbs. What's more, Mr. Kunstler says, the sense of community fostered by personal and business relationships within a town has been undermined by the tendency of Americans to move every four years and by the displacement of small, privately owned businesses (the corner grocery, the local bookstore, the neighborhood five-and-dime) by chain stores that neither pump their profits back into the town nor promote longtime loyalties with customers.
Human beings, Mr. Kunstler says, need a sense of their connectedness to others, a sense of shared purpose, and in his view, this vital need has been poorly served by American architects and city planners. Because American cities "flourished almost solely as centers for business," he says, because state capitals were often exiled to the provinces (Albany, Springfield, Sacramento), fewer ceremonial spaces and monuments have been built here than in Europe.
In addition, Mr. Kunstler says, as tax revenues were poured into the construction of an elaborate highway system, less and less money was made available for other forms of public building. He writes that this is the reason that "every town hall built after 1950 is a concrete-block shed full of cheap paneling and plastic furniture, why public schools look like overgrown gas stations, why courthouses, firehouses, halls of records, libraries, museums, post offices and other civic monuments are indistinguishable from bottling plants and cold-storage warehouses."
As such passages indicate, Mr. Kunstler has a taste for hyperbole that makes for lively reading, but that also makes for some dubious generalizations. A chapter that owes a decided debt to Tom Wolfe's "From Bauhaus to Our House" uses simplistic and overly reductive terms to assail modernism as the "fraudulent and barbarous" doctrine behind the ugly, cookie-cutter architecture that has defaced the American landscape.
In fact, Mr. Kunstler displays a penchant throughout the book for delivering broad, debatable assertions with the air of received truth. He insists that new housing starts are not a positive economic sign but a symptom of the growing defacement of the American countryside; and he argues that children are "the biggest losers" in suburban life. They are trapped in a "one-dimensional world," he says, and their inability to drive "impairs their developing sense of personal sovereignty"
Still, there are lots of interesting nuggets in "The Geography of Nowhere": a pithy if familiar analysis of the automobile's impact on American life; some amusing reflections on the collective fantasies promoted by places like Disney World and Atlantic City, and a series of highly subjective observations on changing fashions in architectural style. Indeed, if one approaches "The Geography of Nowhere" not as an objective assessment of our national landscape but as a kind of impassioned jeremiad, it makes for provocative and entertaining reading.

Sports Rule: Always Root For Visitors

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WHAT a great game in Chicago on Sunday. The world champions taking on the upstarts. Huge, knowledgeable, boisterous crowd. Mood swings in the high-scoring game. The outcome in doubt until the final seconds.
There was also a basketball game. 
 That's just my little joke to make the point that soccer and basketball co-existed quite nicely on Sunday. Germany, the World Cup champion, held off the United States in soccer at Soldier Field in the afternoon, and Phoenix outlasted the champion Bulls at Chicago Stadium in a three-overtime epic that evening.
I kept telling my National Basketball Association friends that I volunteered to write a sidebar on the basketball so I could see Lothar Matthaus and Jurgen Klinsmann. They looked at me nervously, hoping I was kidding.
Americans like to put down soccer for the low scores and the riotous crowds, but the only concern I heard in Chicago was not for the soccer crowd or even the basketball crowd, but for what might transpire if and when the Bulls clinch their third straight title at home.
There was some heavy-duty mischief last year when the Bulls won, and Chicago officials are said to be on guard this time around. The problem is not the fans streaming out of the arena, or even the innocent crowds who come to cheer a victory parade, but the thousands of louts waiting to tear up the town for the slightest excuse.
I saw it first-hand in Montreal last week, and I don't care to see it again too soon. In the glare of the arc lights around the Forum, you could see the glitter of bottles hurled by sneaks in the shadows. The bottles were crashing around the assembled police officers.
This was a bilingual riot. It is just not true that people in Quebec cannot agree on anything, because I saw French-speaking louts and English-speaking louts lurching around Rue Ste.-Catherine last Wednesday night, turning over police cars and cursing and breaking windows and looting beer. There was no cause. They just did it because it was cool. The game was a pretext for taking out their antisocial feelings.
The police looked like buffoons, standing around without a plan. They couldn't say they weren't warned, either. They had a riot in 1986 when the Canadiens clinched, and there was plenty of talk around the city.
This is what it has come to: sport as an excuse to trash your own town. I saw it in Detroit after the 1984 World Series. People burned cars and broke windows on their own streets. Explain it to me.
There is an old-sportswriter theory that you always root for the visiting team to clinch the championship. First of all, it means fewer politicians using their clout to squeeze into antiquated dressing rooms, and it also means fewer hometown camera crews whacking you topside the head with their equipment. And when you escape the arena, you don't have local goons tearing up the town to "celebrate."
I have mixed feelings about Game 4 tomorrow in Chicago. I don't think the Bulls really wanted to give Charles Barkley's elbow time to recuperate. It would be safer for Chicagoans if the series finished in Phoenix, but this season has gone long enough. Pro basketball is currently the best sport in North America, but it is mid-June. Get the troops out of the hot sun. No, get the troops out of stuffy arenas and into the hot sun.
Free Michael Jordan. Let's give the poor guy some time off so he can spend the summer making peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and reading books to his two sons. What? You suspect Michael's quality time is spent on the golf course being hustled by creeps who may do him harm? David Stern has reassured us there is no problem, and the flat-earth society has spoken. See me in five years on this one. Maybe two.
Jordan is not the only athlete who has taken a financial hit from unsavory types, by the way. Julio Cesar, the great defender for Brazil, had an estimated $150,000 taken out of his hotel room while he was playing in Washington last week. He was bringing the dollars home from Italy, where he plays during the league season. Who says international soccer is not going to be a boon to the American economy?
Ever since the 1990 World Cup in Italy, Americans have been telling stirring tales about the gypsies who hit them in the train station, or the pickpockets who got them on the 64 bus between the Vatican and the train station. We may not be a world-class soccer power yet, but we've got some hotel thieves who can carry a master key with the best of them.
There is good news on the soccer front. England may not qualify for the 1994 World Cup. We may not have to deal with their hooligans strutting through American cities. We've got our own hooligans. So does Montreal. Small world.

HEADLINE: Needed: More High School Graduates

 BODY:
Good news: For the third year in a row, more New York City students are staying in school and not dropping out. But there's a catch. Even after spending up to seven years in high school, fewer than 60 percent of students receive a diploma. That poses a real test of Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez's theory that students are more likely to succeed in smaller high schools. It also poses a challenge to his successor: to push the graduation rate up while keeping the dropout rate down.
Deciphering New York's dropout rate has become an annual ritual. In the early 1980's it was calculated to be as high as 42 percent. Since 1986, however, the Board of Education has tracked through graduation the entire group of students entering ninth grade each year. That at least has made year-to-year comparisons uniform. 
 For those who entered ninth grade in 1988, the dropout rate was 16.2 percent. That's an improvement over 17 percent for the previous class, and it marks the third year in a row the rate has declined.
Why are more students staying in school longer? The economy isn't healthy, there aren't many entry-level jobs around, and the state and Mr. Fernandez have stiffened graduation requirements.
But are students who remain in school just marking time? Nearly 43 percent of the class of 1992 graduated in four years, about the same percentage as the class of 1991. Fifty percent graduated within five years. For other classes since 1986 the graduation rate, even after seven years, hovers around 56 percent.
One of Mr. Fernandez's key ideas for improving that rate is to create 50 small, theme-oriented high schools that will more closely match students' interests and pay closer attention to their needs. It's expected that the specialized schools will draw students from some of the most crowded neighborhood high schools, which also have some of the lowest graduation rates.
About 38 of the new schools will be open in September, but they can't be expected to produce results overnight. In the meantime, Mr. Fernandez's emphasis on identifying problem students in early grades and giving them intensive help should continue. If the new chancellor can also rescue students early enough, then both the graduation rate and the dropout rate will probably improve.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: Woman in the News;
Rejected as a Clerk, Chosen as a Justice: Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
In 1960, a dean at the Harvard Law School, Albert Sachs, proposed one of his star students to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court as a law clerk. Justice Frankfurter told Professor Sachs that while the candidate was impressive, he just wasn't ready to hire a woman and so couldn't offer a job to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Judge Ginsburg, who now sits on the Federal appeals court and was chosen today by President Clinton for the Supreme Court, recently told that story to her own law clerks to explain how she became interested in the role of women in the eyes of the law.
 
Force Before the Court
 In the years between that rebuff by Justice Frankfurter and her appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980, Ruth Ginsburg was a major force on the other side of the Supreme Court's high bench. 
 From 1973 to 1976 she argued six women's rights cases before the Court and won five of them, profoundly changing the law as it affects women.
"She is the Thurgood Marshall of gender equality law," said Janet Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, an abortion-rights advocacy group, repeating a common description of Judge Ginsburg. Like Justice Marshall, who shaped the legal strategy of the civil rights movement for the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund before he joined the Court, Ruth Ginsburg organized the cases, found the plaintiffs and delivered the oral arguments.
As the director of the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, Ms. Ginsburg adopted a strategy intended to convince the Justices that laws that discriminated between men and women -- even those laws that were meant to help women -- were based on unfair and harmful stereotypes and were in most cases unconstitutional. To do that, she often used men as plaintiffs, showing that both men and women suffered from such stereotypes.
"Her strategy was an especially ingenious one, relying on male, often married, plaintiffs," said David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law School who recently wrote a law review article discussing Ms. Ginsburg's approach to the Supreme Court.
He said many of the regulations or laws she opposed ostensibly helped women, giving them some extra benefit in recognition of the prevailing notion that women were generally dependent on men.
"But she set out to prove that those kinds of laws in fact harmed women by contributing to a stereotyped view of their role," he said.
The first case she argued and won before the Court, in 1973, involved a female Air Force lieutenant, Sharron Frontiero, and her husband, Joseph, who challenged a statute that treated male and female service members differently. Under the law, a serviceman could claim his wife as a dependent and qualify for increased housing even if she did not depend on his income, while a woman in uniform had to show that her husband received more than half his support from her to qualify for the extra housing allowance.
 
A New Jurisprudence
 In her brief and argument, Ms. Ginsburg presented the Court with an array of evidence that women were branded inferior through such treatment. The Justices voted 8 to 1 in her favor, embarking on the road to a new jurisprudence that made it harder for the law to treat women differently.
In 1976, in another case in which Ms. Ginsburg had filed a brief, the Justices set a standard that is still used today in sex discrimination cases. In that case, Craig v. Boren, the Court struck down an Oklahoma statute that said women as young as 18 could buy 3.2 percent beer while men had to be at least 21.
In its ruling, the Court declined to impose what is known as "strict scrutiny" of such discriminatory laws, which places a high burden on a state to justify making distinctions. But the Court did create a category known as "intermediate scrutiny," meaning that states could not enact laws that discriminated on the basis of sex without showing a substantial government interest.
Behind all the categorizing, the ruling's effect was to make it far harder to enact laws based on sexual stereotypes.
"Ruth Ginsburg was as responsible as any one person for legal advances that women made under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution," said Marcia Greenberger, the co-president of the National Women's Law Center. "As a result, doors of opportunity have been opened that have benefited not only the women themselves but their families."
 
Remembering Her Mother
Ruth Joan Bader was born March, 15, 1933, in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and graduated from James Madison High School. Her father, Nathan Bader, owned small clothing stores. Her mother, Celia Bader, died of stomach cancer when Ruth was 17; at the White House today, Judge Ginsburg paid tribute to her mother.
At Cornell University, she met Martin D. Ginsburg, a fellow pre-law student, and they were married in June 1954, the same month she graduated from college. "They had a marvelous romance in her senior year," recalled a cousin, Jane Gevirtz of Manhattan.
Ms. Gevirtz said she recently came upon a letter that Ms. Ginsburg had written to her in 1953 in which she said she wanted to be a lawyer but had deep doubts on whether she had sufficient aptitude for the law. Ms. Gevirtz said her cousin nonetheless wrote that she was determined to see if she could get into law school, despite being told from all sides that it was more appropriate for a woman to be a teacher.
Her first child, Jane, was born the year after she married. Her aptitude for the law was sufficient for Harvard Law School, and she found herself caring for an infant and attending Harvard for the next two years.
When her husband found a job in New York, she transferred to Columbia Law School. Ms. Ginsburg was elected to the law reviews of both Harvard and Columbia.
Years later she became the first tenured female professor at Columbia University Law School, where her daughter, Jane, an authority on copyright law, is now on the faculty. She also has a son, James.
Mr. Ginsburg, an expert on tax law who has been Ross Perot's tax lawyer for years, was an economic adviser in Mr. Perot's Presidential campaign.
While Judge Ginsburg is modest in demeanor, even shy, her husband is an ebullient sort, friends said.

 
Views on Roe
Despite her long record as a champion of women's rights, Judge Ginsburg has occasionally disappointed some of her former allies in the liberal advocacy groups. In her 13 years on the appeals court, she has often gone out of her way to mediate between the court's warring liberal and conservative factions.
But what has most dismayed some of her natural allies are her comments criticizing some aspects of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that declared there was a constitutional right to abortion.
In a speech in March at New York University, Judge Ginsburg outlined her objections to the 1973 ruling, which she said was too sweeping and thus contributed to the bitter debate over the last 20 years.
In essence, Judge Ginsburg argued that it was unwise of the Court majority to impose a detailed scheme prescribing how states may regulate abortion in each trimester of a pregnancy. Instead, she suggested, the Court should simply have overturned the law at issue, a Texas statute that outlawed nearly all abortions.
"Suppose the Court had stopped there, declaring unconstitutional the most extreme brand of law in the nation and had not gone on, as the Court did in Roe, to fashion a regime blanketing the subject," Ms. Ginsburg said, adding that a narrower ruling would have "served to reduce rather than to fuel controversy."
In that case, she went on, states would have more latitude to resolve the public dispute about abortion by creating their own abortion statutes, testing the Court's limits on how far they could go to restrict abortion.
Judge Ginsburg also said she believed the decision should have been grounded in a broad concept of equality for women. The Roe v. Wade decision was based instead on the idea that there is a constitutional right of privacy, which she did not discuss in the speech. Some abortion-rights advocates said today that the speech gave them concerns about her position in disputes over whether states can inhibit abortions with restrictions like waiting periods.
Kate Michelman, the president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, hinted at her group's displeasure with Judge Ginsburg's reservations about Roe. "Judge Ginsburg has been a strong advocate for women's equality," she said, "but her criticism of Roe v. Wade is cause for concern. We look forward to a thorough Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to determine whether Judge Ginsburg will protect a woman's fundamental right to privacy."
Supporters like Ms. Benshoof insist that Judge Ginsburg is a reliable supporter of abortion rights. In a 1989 opinion, in fact, Judge Ginsburg dissented from a ruling that allowed the Bush Administration to continue its policy of denying financing to international family planning groups that counsel abortion.

HEADLINE: Tune In to Democracy

BYLINE: By Joshua Muravchik; Joshua Muravchik, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, advised the Clinton Presidential campaign on foreign policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Over the next two days, House appropriations and Senate foreign relations subcommittees will begin deciding whether to create Radio Free Asia -- to do for such tyrannies as China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Burma what Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe did for Communist Europe.
The Administration is expected to weigh in with a recommendation. If President Clinton, who chose to extend China's most-favored-nation status without any human rights conditions, wants to retain credibility as an advocate of global democracy, he'll want to make sure a robust plan for Radio Free Asia goes forward. In de-fending his decision, he said we have an interest in China's modernization. But this is true only if China's political development goes hand-in-hand with its economic development. A China that grows rich and powerful without becoming democratic will be more of a menace than a blessing. 
 Economic growth will not necessarily lead to democratization, as in South Korea and Taiwan, which have democratized under optimum conditions: affluence and U.S. influence. Japan modernized around the turn of the century, but the impetus toward liberalization could not overcome authoritarianism and militarism.
Before M.F.N. is extended again next year, we must obtain substantial concessions on political prisoners, forced labor, emigration and the jamming of American broadcasts.
Despite jamming, Voice of America reaches a large Chinese audience with world news and programs in limited-vocabulary English that help Chinese learn our language. Radio Free Asia would broadcast entirely in Chinese dialects (and in other native languages to other countries) and would focus on news about China (and in broadcasts to other countries, on their national news). Pioneered by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, such broadcasting provides the information that would be available in the domestic press if it were free.
Of course it is hard to gather domestic news in an unfree country, and the target countries can make it harder by not accrediting Radio Free Asia correspondents. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty operated under the direst constraints, gathering news of Soviet bloc countries during the worst of the cold war. They compensated by employing hundreds of researchers who interviewed travelers, collected unofficial publications and scoured the official media.
After the Soviet empire fell, we confirmed how effective this was, as the new Eastern European leaders -- Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel, Boris Yeltsin and even Mikhail Gorbachev -- offered glowing testimonials to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
Candidate Clinton declared strong support for a Radio Free Asia, and $30 million to launch the service has been included in his fiscal 1994 budget. But Congress will trim the budget, and Radio Free Asia is nobody's pork.
The new "China lobby" -- businessmen and diplomats who oppose anything that will roil Beijing -- are trying to scuttle Radio Free Asia just as they torpedoed human rights conditions on trade. They have proposed adding a few hours of news about China to Voice of America's broadcasts. This would be a weak substitute for an independent Radio Free Asia. In Europe, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty operated side by side -- each performing its distinct mission -- with proved effectiveness. In Asia, we should do no less.

HEADLINE: Pursuing Tax Cheats in Land of Opportunity

SERIES: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- Fourth of six articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
They tailed him for several weeks, and then they laid their trap. On a tranquil avenue in Elmhurst, Queens, two nondescript cars and a van melted into the buzzing traffic. Wedged inside were the enforcement officers, their faces graven with patience, their eyes trained like cameras on a basement apartment. It was early morning, and in the air a chill lingered. A half-hour passed, an hour.
At a little past 9, the door of the apartment opened and the target marched out. Car doors swung open and the men moved fast. As he bent over the trunk of his Buick, an unsmiling, shocked Hange Lai, a Chinese immigrant, was set upon by the officers. They rummaged through his car and found 109 cartons of cigarettes stamped from Virginia. Satisfied, the enforcement officers escorted him to a nearby police station for booking. 
 The officers worked for New York City's Finance Department. They were after taxes.
Mr. Lai was charged with possession for the purpose of sale of cigarettes from Virginia. He said he was innocent. The authorities, however, said they had amassed evidence that he was selling the packs to delis while evading New York's excise tax.
Mr. Lai's case is by no means rare -- many merchants are cited for evading taxes. But he is just one of a substantial number of immigrants who the Finance Department says are getting ahead in part by swindling the city of tax money. Sometimes it is ignorance, sometimes it is greed and sometimes it is the two forces cross-fertilizing.
But trying to police the city's swelling underground economy and the multiplying number of immigrants in it is grueling work nettled with frustration. The realm is too large, too amorphous, too slippery. Finance Department officials often brood about how outnumbered they are. Tax cheating, they find, knows no respite. To make a dent, officials say they need to go after major offenders and those whose convictions will frighten others, simply because there are far too many violators to catch.
"It's like fishing in a hatchery," said Thomas Stanton, the Finance Department's director of enforcement. "It's a matter of catching the biggest fish and getting the biggest bang for the buck."
A melange of law-enforcement agencies and industry organizations on the city, state and Federal level make lurching and imperfect efforts to throttle the underground economy. In New York City, the Department of Finance has emerged as perhaps the most active and persistent combatant dedicated to trying to recover the owed tax dollars. In recent years, troubled by lost revenue, it has become more aggressive in chasing tax cheats and in putting flagrant offenders in jail.
All sorts operate in the underground economy, but many of the Finance Department's cases involve new immigrants. "Many immigrants come over here with the idea in mind to cheat on their taxes, because it's part of their culture," Mr. Stanton said. "In their countries they must cheat as a matter of survival. We're trying to break that cycle."
 
Simple Tactics
 City efforts to recover taxes from the underground economy were stepped up in 1986, when the Finance Department formed a brigade of auditors whose mission is to identify businesses and individuals who fail to file income tax schedules. Often it succeeds with the most ordinary tactics: auditors will root for names of businesses in newspaper advertisements, the Yellow Pages, incorporation documents or simply by copying them off the sides of trucks. They then check the tax rolls to see if those companies have been filing tax returns. A surprising number turn out not to be. In the last fiscal year, the unit collected $32 million from 9,900 non-filers. Officials cannot say how many of those were immigrants.
Most of the Finance Department's work entails audits and cases that are settled civilly without involving jail terms. For instance, it just ended an evasion case against a group of about 10 Chinese laundries that did not report more than half of their receipts. Increasingly, though, it has pursued criminal investigations against evaders in the hope that meting out prison time will deter others. Since 1981, the department has had armed investigators who can make arrests. As Bruce Kato, the assistant commissioner of enforcement, put it, "We want it understood that people do go to jail for evading taxes."
 
Gone Forever
 Still, there is only so much that the department and other agencies like the Internal Revenue Service can do. Much of the unpaid money is irretrievable. The Finance Department estimates that it loses $5 billion a year in income-tax revenue to the underground economy, not to mention many millions more in sales taxes and excise taxes. Only a small fraction of that is recovered, said Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Commissioner of Finance, and she said a democratic society made it difficult to get a lot more. "I think you're walking a thin line between a system of voluntary compliance and police state tactics," she said.
Her objective, she said, is to attack the more entrenched and egregious abusers. She understands that many impoverished immigrants need to avoid taxes simply to get businesses on their feet and to pull together strands of life. "I think some of it is rational economic behavior," she said. She describes this as "unconscious tax evasion."
Secrecy pervades the underground economy, especially among immigrants, who transact so much of their business in cash, often buying merchandise from wholesalers for cash and then selling it to consumers for cash, making it difficult to establish money trails. To crack open this world, investigations often span years and require lucky tips and undercover operations during which inlaw-enforcement officers pose as consumers, business tycoons, taxicab drivers.
 
Sales Taxes
Tracking The Merchandise
 When you go down rackety 74th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens, you get a sense you might be in India. Flung out along the block are sari stores, Indian grocery stores, jewelry shops and appliance and electronic outlets. There is a vivid street scene brimming with scintillating signs and sari-wrapped pedestrians. Like the proprietors, most of the customers are Indians. Even back in India, the congested strip is well known as Little India and is promoted as a tourist attraction as heavily as the Statue of Liberty.
Several years ago, when the Finance Department hired an Indian investigator named Dinesh Parikh, he was asked where he thought he might help. He pointed them to 74th Street.
Mr. Parikh and another Finance Department investigator journeyed to 74th Street and pretended to be customers. They bought a television set. They bought a VCR. As money got tight, they settled for batteries. In each instance, they said they were told that there would be no sales tax charged if they paid cash.
"Mostly the merchants wanted cash, and they wouldn't charge you tax," Mr. Parikh said. "If you paid by charge, they would apologize and say, 'Sorry, I'm going to have to charge you tax.' "
Mr. Parikh also interviewed scores of employees of various businesses, who he said told him of routine sales-tax evasion.
 
Various Dodges Uncovered
 Various dodges were uncovered, he said. As it happened, the department has seen them used again and again in numerous businesses throughout the city. No sales tax is due if merchandise is shipped out of state. However, the department said that some businesses claimed that merchandise was shipped when it was actually taken by the customer. Sometimes, to cover their tracks with postal receipts, investigators said businesses mailed empty boxes to customers' homes.
According to investigators, when some of those individuals were contacted, they confirmed that they had actually taken the merchandise with them. Officials also said that lists of supposedly out-of-state customers kept by some businesses were bogus.
One appliance store offered a list said to be of out-of-state customers that was written in Hindu. Investigators said they translated it and found that the names were curse words.
Merchants on the street are circumspect about their dealings. V. M. Gandhi, who runs a gold coin store on 74th Street and is president of the Jackson Heights Business Association, said, "My sense is everyone here pays sales tax." However, he said it was not a topic he discussed with his colleagues.
 
8 Names Turned In
 A long-time Indian merchant on 74th Street, who spoke on condition of anonymity, admitted that for years he and others had not paid some sales tax, but he attributed this to faulty advice. He said that when he started his business he was told by merchants on Canal Street in Manhattan that if a customer indicated that he was taking merchandise out of the country then no tax had to be paid. Not until the Finance Department arrived, he said, did he and other merchants realize that this was wrong. He said he was unaware of deliberate fraud, but said it might have occurred among a "few greedy people."
Mr. Kato acknowledged that immigrants often did not understand the tangle of American tax laws and might unknowingly break some of them. But he said that did not explain the extent of evasion his department found on 74th Street.
About six months ago, the Finance Department completed its investigation and turned over the names of eight businesses to the Queens District Attorney and the state Attorney General for prosecution. Charges, however, have yet to be filed.
The investigation alone, the Finance Department believes, has achieved some good. Tax payments have accelerated lately from 74th Street businesses. Some began paying twice as much in sales tax. But, as time has elapsed, the department said, some of the stores seem to have reverted to their old ways.
 
Corporate Taxes
'Buyer' Stops Beer Wholesaler

It was late in 1989 when the Finance Department thought it would try to enter the beer industry.
Hama-Lee Distributing was a beer wholesaler in Long Island City run by a Korean couple, Chong Kak Lee and Sang Ok Lee. From outward appearances, it was doing nicely. One of the largest beer distributors in New York, it had 800 customers, most of them Korean-owned delis. Budweiser was its big brand.
The owners, however, had become rather unpopular with certain of the delis, Mr. Kato said, because they were lending money to them at usurious rates. One day a disgruntled person reported to the Finance Department that Hama-Lee was cheating on its corporate taxes. He also let the department know that the Lees wanted to move to the south and had the business up for sale.
So Bruce Kato decided to pose as a buyer. To be convincing, the department rented a limousine to transport Mr. Kato to meetings and had another investigator pretend to be his accountant.
In September 1989, the accountant made the initial contacts, and Mr. Kato met with Mrs. Lee at a local McDonald's.
 
2 Sets of Books
 In a subsequent meeting with Mrs. Lee in October 1989, to which Mr. Kato brought along a $5,000 check to cement the deal, he got evidence of the core of the swindle. A second set of books was trotted out, which Mrs. Lee said were the actual records of the company. They revealed much higher revenue than the fake books the company used to base its tax returns. Mr. Kato said that the books indicated that only about half of the company's revenue was actually reported to tax authorities. In the company's records, he said, delis that paid for their beer in cash were underlined in red, and that money generally was not reported.
At the final meeting, Mr. Kato was wired, and enforcement officers from the Manhattan District Attorney's office were listening in nearby. When Mr. Kato said, "I think this is a buy," that was the code phrase for the investigators to barge in and arrest Mrs. Lee. Her husband was arrested that same day at another location.
Confronted with the tapes and two sets of books, the Lees agreed to a plea bargain. Mr. Lee pleaded guilty to two counts of offering a false instrument for filing and was sentenced in September 1990 to two years in prison. Mrs. Lee pleaded guilty to one count and received probation.
The Lees also agreed over time to pay $650,000 to the city and state. A lien was put on their apartment in Fort Lee, N.J. Hama-Lee went out of business.
 
Income Taxes
Taxi Sting Brings Fraud Charges
 Sometimes it comes down to whom you listen to. A common way that new immigrants descend into the underground economy, the Finance Department says, is through the counsel of unscrupulous advisers. In recent years, the department has tried to root out accountants who it believes teach new immigrant entrepreneurs how to skirt the tax laws, and it has put several of them in jail.
In Federal court in Brooklyn, a 67-year-old accountant named Harold Wapnick and three associates -- his sons, Jon and Seth Wapnick, and another employee named Steve Wolfson -- are now on trial on charges of defrauding the I.R.S. The case was brought by the Federal Government and grew out of a protracted City Finance Department investigation.
Over the years, the Wapnick firm had become one of the accountants of choice among immigrant taxi drivers. Word had seeped through the industry, prosecutors said, that you would pay low taxes if you saw Harold Wapnick. In fact, investigators estimate that he did the returns for 13 percent of the city's taxi drivers, many of them from Haiti, Russia and Israel, among other countries.
In spring 1988, a Finance Department investigator named Joseph McQuillen borrowed a cab from the Taxi and Limousine Commission and went undercover as a taxi driver. While wired with a tape recorder, he drove the cab to Mr. Wapnick's office in the basement of his Brooklyn home. He told Mr. Wapnick that he had received a notice from the city requesting taxes due from 1986. He said he had filed no tax returns. Without asking him what his income and expenses were, the investigator testified, Mr. Wapnick's office prepared tax returns for him for 1985, 1986 and 1987.
 
Back-Dated Diaries
 For proof at an audit of his 1986 return, Mr. McQuillen testified that Jon Wapnick advised him to buy a diary and fabricate maintenance expenses for that year. Mr. McQuillen said he was told at the Wapnick firm to pour coffee on the diary, bend it or scrape it against a brick wall to make it appear authentic.
A number of immigrant taxi drivers also took the stand and told similar stories. Among other things, they said that the Wapnick firm understated their fare income by stating on the tax returns that mileage the drivers registered was actually run up by others to whom they leased their cabs. Yet the drivers said that they did not lease their cabs or tell the Wapnicks that they had. Mr. McQuillen said he was advised by the Wapnicks to tell tax officials that he had leased his cab to someone named Vladamir Stanislausky who must have gone back to Russia.
Investigators said they felt that some clients knew they were breaking the law, while others did not know what Mr. Wapnick was doing.
For their part, the defendants say they are not guilty. Harold Wapnick, who is representing himself, said in an interview that he was convinced that his tribulations were the result of the city's trying to exact revenge against him because he had been such a feisty advocate for taxi drivers with the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "They want to get me because I'm in their craw," he said.
Mr. Wapnick said he would show that the investigator's tapes don't really imply what they seem to. If there were mistakes on any of the immigrants' tax returns, he said, that was because clients lied to him. "When people come into my office, it's absolute bedlam," he said. "How do I know what these guys are doing? They come in and you can hardly understand them."
Then how did he understand them? "Body language," he said.

HEADLINE: Lobbying Rule of 1990's: Show the Most Vulnerable

SERIES: Special Pleaders -- A periodic look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Jan Bergwall, a waitress from a small town in Maryland, drove down to Washington this morning and, at a news conference, stood before a microphone to say she feared that she might lose her job if Congress approved President Clinton's proposal to reduce the tax deduction for business meals.
Lobbyists and other officers in the National Restaurant Association's Washington office recruited Mrs. Bergwall a few days ago. They put her in a commercial that is set in the restaurant where she works and is being televised in four states. Then they put on the news conference here this morning. 
 As Mrs. Bergwall spoke, the association's representatives stood in the back of the room, quiet and inconspicuous, obediently following the lobbying model of the 1990's. The chief rules are these: Move the debate out of Washington and place it in the mouths of the most vulnerable, sympathetic supposed victims you can find.
 
A 'Fat-Cat' Perception
 The restaurant association's officials are especially eager to follow those rules now because the tax provision they are trying to protect -- keeping the deduction for business meals at 80 percent of a meal's cost instead of the 50 percent that Mr. Clinton proposes -- is perceived to benefit the lobbyists themselves, among others.
"There is a perception, a sincere perception, that it's a fat-cat issue," said Stephen E. Elmont, the association's president. So the strategy is to present the proposed change as a problem for everyman. The victims would include "women, minorities, first-time job holders and people with disabilities" who work in restaurants, an association statement says.
Mr. Clinton proposed the change as part of his deficit reduction package and it was approved in the House with little debate. The Administration says the provision would raise $16.3 billion over five years. So far it has not been a subject of much discussion among senators working to modify Mr. Clinton's plan, a Senate aide said today. But then the association's new campaign began only this morning.
 
Darkest Projections
 The association has put together dark projections of the provision's effect on the restaurant industry: The nation's restaurants would lose $3.8 billion a year and 165,000 restaurant workers would lose their jobs.
Some of the assumptions behind those projections are questionable, and the logic is tortured in spots. But even if the data were unassailable, the association would be reluctant to promote the numbers on its own.
"We've been hesitant to be pro-active on this," Mr. Elmont said, in part because "the Administration has singled out lobbyists as bad."
And Wendy Webster, a spokesman for the association, said: "This issue doesn't have much sympathy. It's painted as benefiting lobbyists and lawyers."
But in Mrs. Bergwall, Mr. Elmont said later with a bounce in his voice, "we have a real live person" to promote the case.
"My husband's out of work," she said at the news conference. If the business-meal deduction is reduced, "not only will I not receive tips, I'll be sent home because the business will not be there."
After she spoke, the ad was shown. The commercial lasts 30 seconds and shows her at work in a restaurant in Olney, Md., some 20 miles north of Washington.
"I'm a waitress," Mrs. Bergwall says on camera, "and a good one. I'd better be, because my three sons depend on me. But I might not have a job much longer. President Clinton's economic plan cuts business-meal deductibility. That would throw 165,000 people out of work.
"I need this job," she goes on. "We have too many people out of work as it is." Then she hands interested viewers back to the association by giving a toll-free telephone number they can call. Answering the phones is a professional telemarketing concern the association has hired to direct callers to the offices of their home-state senators.
 
'A Grass-Roots Thing'

"We haven't hired any high-powered former senators or other lobbyists for this," said JoAnn Emerson, an association official. "It's really a grass-roots thing." And to bolster that perception, the association is promoting numbers intended to demonstrate that it is not lobbying on behalf of "fat cats" who dine twice a week at restaurant tables set with linen and crystal.
The association says its own national survey found that the cost of an average business dinner is $19.58. For lunch the figure is $9.39, and for breakfast is $6.29. The average business diners, the association adds, do not buy $100 bottles of wine. Their tastes are more ascetic. They may not be ordering prune juice, but they are "more likely to order soda water, cola or other non-alcoholic beverages."
What is more, the survey found, "most of those purchasing business meals do not do so often -- 72 percent purchase lunch 12 times or less a year, and 78 percent purchase dinner 12 times or less."
But this everyman argument is dual edged. If most people rarely buy deductible meals, and then order only inexpensive dishes, the average restaurant may not stand to lose much after all.
If the tax deductibility fell from 80 percent to 50 percent, and if a businessman with a tax bracket of 34 percent followed the association's model and ate 12 dinners a year costing $19.58 each, the change in the rules would cost him an additional $23.88 a year. For lunch, the added annual cost would be $11.40.
 
'Not That Big a Jump'
 "The question you have to ask yourself," said a senior Congressional aide who is following the issue, "is whether the incremental cost really is all that significant, enough to cause business to fall off.
"It's not that big a jump," he said, but referring to the proposed change in the meal-tax deduction, he added, "I suppose this could be the straw that broke the camel's back."
The association's estimate that the nation's restaurants would lose $3.8 billion a year, forcing 165,000 restaurant workers out of their jobs, is based on the assumption that business people would reduce their spending on meals by the amount of money they would lose once the tax deduction was lowered.
This, the association acknowledges, "is the upper logical limit of loss."
 
Slower Growth Cited
 The association's officials say the rate of growth in their industry has slowed significantly since 1986, when Congress lowered the deductibility of business meals from 100 percent to 80 percent.
That lowering of the business meal deduction, the association says, was "one of the causes for this faltering of the industry."
But Jeffrey Prince, another spokesman, acknowledged that the decline "may have included other causes as well." In fact, the recession did serious damage to the restaurant business nationwide.
Telcasts of the ad featuring Mrs. Bergwall began this morning in four states: North Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana and Maine, all of them home to influential senators on the Finance Committee who "have been friends in the past to the food-service industry," Mr. Prince said.
Later this week, he said, the association may buy time on television stations in the Washington area.


GRAPHIC: The National Restaurant Association yesterday began televising a 30-second advertisement intended to keep the tax deduction for business meals at 80 percent of a meal's cost, instead of lowering it to 50 percent as President Clinton has proposed. The ad is running in four states that are home to senators the association hopes to influence: North Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana and Maine.
 
On the Screen: Jan Bergwall, a waitress, is at work at the Silo Inn in Olney, Md. The camera follows her as she says:
Chart/Photo: "Ad Campaign: To Lunch or Not?"
"I'm a waitress, and a good one. I'd better be, because my three sons depend on me. But I might not have a job much longer. President Clinton's economic plan cuts business meal deductibility. That would throw 165,000 people out of work. I need this job. We have too many people out of work as it is. If you agree, call 1-800-999-8945 now, and you'll be connected to your U.S. senator. Tell your senator to vote to save jobs. Keep the business meal deduction."
 
Accuracy: The projected loss in restaurant jobs assumes that business diners would reduce their spending on meals by the amount of money they would lose once the tax deduction was reduced, a questionable assumption. Further, the association contends that most such diners are small-business men who buy business meals only infrequently and even then spend little on them. If the association's estimates are accurate, then the average businessman would stand to lose roughly $35 a year under the new rule -- suggesting that most diners would not find the change so onerous that they would radically change their dining habits.

HEADLINE: CLINTON, DEFENDING HIS RECORD, INSISTS HE HASN'T WAVERED

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
President Clinton today presented his first six months in office as an aggressive and largely successful attempt to reinvigorate government, dismissing all assertions that he had been indecisive and portraying himself as a world leader penalized for making tough calls at home and abroad.
"No President's budget has been taken seriously in this town for a dozen years," Mr. Clinton said. "Three-quarters of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against President Bush's last budget. I sent a budget up there that passed -- the budget resolution passed on time for the first time in 17 years. And we're out here fighting for these tough decisions.
 
Shining Up His Image
 "This is the most decisive Presidency you've had in a very long time on all the big issues that matter," he continued. "And I might say, all the heat we're getting from people is because of the decisions that have been made, not because of those that haven't." 
 Mr. Clinton's appearance today at a hastily called news conference was part of a coordinated public relations offensive by the Administration. He came clearly prepared to strike out on his own behalf and counter criticism about his performance after weeks of watching passively, and relatively quietly, as his approval ratings slid under an onslaught of critical assessments about his performance. [Excerpts from the news conference, page A20.]
 
Touting World Leadership
 "There is no wavering," he said, boasting that under his leadership interest and unemployment rates have dropped and housing sales have risen. He said he had taken the lead on the world stage, signed several pieces of significant legislation and made progress on gaining a budget agreement that will reduce the deficit.
The President's remarks were but the latest sign of anxiety in the Administration. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was moved to send all American ambassadors a confidential cable listing what he said were Mr. Clinton's achievements around the world. [Page A13.]
The President's news conference came one day after he selected Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to serve on the Supreme Court, a process that took nearly three months to conclude and that fueled discussion of the President's apparent indecisiveness.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said David R. Gergen, the former Reagan aide whom Mr. Clinton recruited to reshape his public relations strategy, suggested taking Mr. Clinton to the White House's informal press briefing room -- a site he seldom uses -- to give him a chance to capitalize on good economic news by making headlines and the evening news.
She also said they hoped his readiness to answer questions would defuse bad feelings left from the previous day's news conference, which Mr. Clinton cut short after accepting only one question that he considered cynical.
"It gave us a good way to put it all behind us right away," Ms. Myers said.
White House officials said Mr. Clinton planned to increase his public presence in coming weeks by holding a prime-time news conference or delivering a televised Oval Office address in defense of his economic plan.
As Mr. Gergen stood by beaming today, Mr. Clinton strode into the briefing room with a smile and quickly set out to redress Monday's tensions. After a brief opening statement, he turned to Brit Hume, the ABC News correspondent whom he had snapped at the day before and suggested that he owed him a follow-up to the question Mr. Hume had asked in the Rose Garden.
"You know what I'm really upset about?" he said to Mr. Hume, who was recently married. "You got a honeymoon and I didn't."
 
'I Regret the Leaks'
 In the general laughter that followed the President's joke, Mr. Gergen turned to Ms. Meyers and was heard whispering, "That was perfect."
Mr. Clinton's appearance seemed deliberately designed to extend the favorable publicity he received on Monday with his announcement of a Supreme Court nominee. The President's search for a new Justice had stretched from days to weeks to months, as he came under new criticism for hesitating over his choice while prominent candidates watched their fortunes rise and fall on a very public stage.
But Mr. Clinton said today that he never meant to embarrass the other candidates. "First of all, I strongly dispute that I hung them out," he said. "I regret the leaks. But it's not fair to say I hung them out."
Last week Mr. Clinton did not discourage senior White House advisers from telling reporters that the likely nominee was either Judge Stephen G. Breyer or Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
 
Claiming Some Credit
 Mr. Clinton pointed to reports like Friday's figures on producer prices, which indicate inflation is slowing. He also said he had received insufficient credit for the decline in interest and unemployment rates, increased housing sales and the enactment of several pieces of significant legislation.
Although those economic indicators have improved since Mr. Clinton took office, some economists hesitate to link the improvements to actions taken by this Administration other than to give President Clinton credit for maintaining stability in the long-term bond markets. The last recession officially ended in March 1991.
President Clinton was not the only member of the Administration to go on the offensive today. In a speech to the American Truckers' Association, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that the President was "sure not getting much credit" for the good economic news.
At his news conference, President Clinton also touted his record on foreign affairs.
He said that the plan he presented to European leaders on the fighting in Bosnia was still the best approach to solving an intractable crisis. His plan would have initiated multilateral military action against Bosnian Serb targets and lifted the arms embargo to help Bosnian Muslims.
"On Bosnia, I made a decision," Mr. Clinton said. "The United Nations controls what happens in Bosnia. I cannot unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I didn't change my mind. Our allies decided that they weren't prepared to go that far at this time."
He also said that the decision to send 300 American soldiers to help keep the peace in Macedonia, which borders Bosnia, "carries minimal risk and carries maximum gain" for United States forces. He defended the United States' participation in bombing sites controlled by the leading Somali warlord, saying that humanitarian relief efforts there had "opened up the country again to the beginnings of civilization."
"I am very sorry about what happened this last week," he said, "but we cannot have a situation where one of these warlords, while everybody else is cooperating, decides that he can go out and slaughter 20 peacekeepers. And so, yes, there have been some tensions as a result of that, but we had to take appropriate action."

HEADLINE: Christopher, in Unusual Cable, Defends State Dept.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
In an effort to reassure his diplomatic corps that the Clinton Administration is capable of leading the world, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has sent a classified cable to all ambassadors listing what he described as several important accomplishments.
In his cable, dated June 7, Mr. Christopher all but conceded that President Clinton had got off to a slow start in foreign affairs, but he said problems inherited from the Bush Administration forced the new team to navigate "between submerged rocks and whirlpools on every continent." 
 Among the nine accomplishments of the new Administration, Mr. Christopher said, was the withdrawal of United States forces from Somalia, an achievement that was diluted almost immediately when a Somali clan leader ordered an attack on United Nations peacekeeping troops, and the United States and its allies launched retaliatory strikes.
 
The Balkan Puzzle
 Action to end the war in the Balkans was notably absent from Mr. Christopher's list, and the Secretary's statement on Bosnia appeared to be contradictory.
Mr. Christopher argued that the conflict in Bosnia was a "difficult and unique" issue that was "not central to our vital interests." But he also said Washington was a leader in finding peace there and expressed confidence that the United States and its allies were on a course that "can eventually lead to a political settlement for the tormented peoples" of the Balkans.
In contrast, President Clinton expressed concern today that the political situation in Bosnia was deteriorating.
Some diplomats who received the unusual cable greeted it with a mixture of surprise and bemusement. One senior diplomat, who said it was the first time ambassadors had got such a message, described the cable as "part apologia, part pep talk."
 
Keeping the Lines Open
 One ambassador said the message was defensive in tone and appeared to reinforce the impression that Adminstration was unsure of itself on foreign policy. "Anytime you have to list your accomplishments, you know you are in trouble," the ambassador said.
Michael McCurry, a spokesman for Mr. Christopher, said the Secretary had sent the message to keep the diplomatic corps informed of his thinking. "The Secretary feels that it is important to have regular communication to our diplomatic posts around the world regarding our achievements and the thrust of foreign policy," he said.
In recent weeks, critics have called the Administration's foreign policy weak and vascillating. This impression was reinforced when Peter Tarnoff, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, told diplomatic reporters that Washington planned to reduce its leadership role because of economic weakness at home.
Even within the Foreign Service, there has been mounting apprehension that the White House has concentrated too much on domestic issues and that the State Department has been preoccupied with responding to crises instead of developing new policies.
In speeches and interviews, Mr. Christopher has tried to dispel the notion that the Administration has backed away from Washington's traditional leadership, and his message to the ambassadors, drafted by Samuel W. Lewis, the department's head of policy planning, appeared intended to persuade his diplomatic team as well.
In the cable, described by officials who had received it, Mr. Christopher wrote that the Clinton Administration had been dealt a bad hand by its predecessor and had worked hard to transform foreign policy.
"When we took office on Jan. 21," he wrote, "we found the agenda overflowing with crises and potential disasters. A substantial proportion of time and energy have gone to navigating between submerged rocks and whirlpools on every continent, while putting in place an outstanding team of senior officials that is now nearly complete."
Like a mantra, Mr. Christropher repeatedly invoked "the leadership role" being played by the United States around the world.
Mr. Christopter provided a list of nine accomplishments that the diplomats could cite:
1. "First and foremost, President Clinton rallied the allies to support the course of reform and democracy in Russia at a crucial juncture with strong, unflinching support for President Yelstin."
2. "The stalemated, nearily moribund Middle East peace negotiations were rescued and relaunched with some delicate diplomacy and a strengthened United States role as a full partner."
3. "We have been and are working with the United Nations and the Organization of American States to restore democracy in Haiti and to reverse the new threat to democratic institutions in Guatemala."
4. "In close cooperation with key Congressional leaders, the President has conditionally extended most-favored-nation [trade status] for China in a manner which will also advance the cause of human rights and our non-proliferation goals, while serving the best interests of American business and workers."
5. "We have phased out the American-led mission in Somalia, and taken the lead in passing responsibilty to a United Nations peackeeping force, in which for the first time there will be a sturdy American role to help the United Nations rebuild a viable nation-state."
6. "We have stepped up support for Iraq's democratic opposition elements."
7. "With careful but determined diplomacy, we are working with the International Atomic Energy Agency, South Korea, Japan and China to counter the North Korean nuclear threat."
8. "And from Japan to Mexico to the European Economic Community, the Administration has stressed the need to advance America's economic interests in parallel, though not in place of, maintaining our alliances."
9. "Our prompt action helped thwart the 'auto-coup' in Guatemala, as a reflection of our worldwide promotion of democracy."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Post Scant Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
All but burying fears of worrisome inflation, consumer prices inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in May as lower prices for gasoline and clothing offset increases for vegetables, used cars and the fees charged by physicians and lawyers, Labor Department figures showed today.
The report, combined with a similar one on Friday showing no inflation at the producer level, was widely seen as proving that prices remained in check and that jumps earlier this year were temporary and in some cases more statistical than real. 
 Short-term interest rates posted further declines as investors and traders seemed to rule out the possibility that the inflation-wary Federal Reserve would act to tighten monetary policy anytime soon.
President Clinton, who has tended to let aides do the commenting on economic figures, hailed today's report at a White House news briefing where he once again promoted his budget proposals.
"The continuation of this trend depends on our ability to pass a strong economic program through the Congress which reduces the deficits, increases investment in our future and is fair," the President said.
 
A Political Debate
 Mr. Clinton and his aides contend that the prospect of meaningful deficit reduction has held interest rates down, aiding a rebound in housing and other interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. Skeptics, on the other hand, wonder whether rates are being held down by fears that the President's proposed tax increases would scuttle the economic expansion, now officially in its 27th month.
In related figures today, the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings soared 1.6 percent last month, the biggest advance since early 1982. Analysts cautioned, however, that this did not imply a sustained pickup in the fortunes of American workers since most of the gain merely reflected longer hours.
Over the last 12 months, the report also showed, weekly earnings climbed 3.6 percent but after adjusting for an inflation rate of 3.1 percent the real gain was a skimpy five-tenths of 1 percent.
Another sign of a strengthening economy came from auto makers, who said the sales recovery that began in April appeared to be continuing, as sales of domestically built vehicles rose 15.5 percent in early June. [Page D5.]
The report on the Consumer Price Index was seen as clinching the argument that the April jump of four-tenths of 1 percent was not sustainable in an economy where companies seem to be doing everything possible to hold down wages and other costs and have been unwilling to risk losing customers by sharply raising prices.
"Slower inflation this month represents a return to the trend path implied by economic fundamentals," said Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
The "core" inflation rate, which excludes the wide-swinging food and energy components, subsided last month to a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent, half the April advance and much less than the rise of five-tenths of 1 percent that caused such consternation in January..
 
Some Increase Is Seen

 
 "It certainly puts the nail in the coffin of saying there's substantial acceleration," said Patrick C. Jackman, a Labor Department official. Still, he added, inflation would probably trend up modestly, with the 1993 rate perhaps half a percentage point above the 1992 pace of 2.9 percent.
Food prices at grocery stores climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month, their biggest increase since August, with the largest factor being a 5.7 percent spurt for fresh vegetables. Tomatoes soared 48.2 percent.
The broader food and beverage category rose less than grocery prices, with a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, matching its April increase.
In transportation, which accounts for 17 percent of the Consumer Price Index, the same as food, prices declined one-tenth of 1 percent, because gasoline fell 2.5 percent while automobile finance charges eased 1 percent. This more than offset a 2.4 percent rise in airline fares and an eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in the price of used cars, which brought the category's 12-month rise to 9.1 percent.
 
A Seasonal Quirk

 
 Gasoline prices actually rose 1.4 percent last month, but since that was less than usual for May, the price fell when seasonally adjusted.
For the housing component, representing 41 percent of the index, the rise was one-tenth of 1 percent, compared with an average four-tenths during March and April. Renters' costs climbed three-tenths of 1 percent and natural gas and electricity also rose, but prices fell for fuel oil and maintenance and repairs.
For clothing, prices eased five-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting larger than usual reductions on spring and summer merchandise, especially women's and girls' apparel.
The cost of medical care, however, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in May, the most since February 1992. Physicians raised their fees 1.1 percent, much more than in March and April. But prescription drugs, long one of the main contributors to medical inflation, have now moderated to an inflation rate over the first five months of this year of just 1.4 percent. With the Clinton Administration creating a plan for health care overhaul, some pharmaceutical companies have announced plans to limit price increases.
Tobacco prices continued to advance as the May survey was too early to capture previously announced discounting in cigarettes, Mr. Jackman said.
The cost of legal services jumped 3.2 percent for no obvious reason.
Prices in New York and in Philadelphia, two of the metropolitan areas for which prices were reported today, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in May. The New York decline, reflecting apparel prices, was the city's second straight.
Before rounding, the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers rose 0.138696 last month, or 1.7 percent if this pace were maintained and compounded for a full year. The overall index stood at 144.2, meaning a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-1984 base period now costs $14.42.
The Consumer Price Index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers also moved up one-tenth of 1 percent last month and by two-tenths of 1 percent with food and energy excluded, the report showed.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference at the White House

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
 
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to make a couple of opening remarks. 
 First, let me say that this morning I had a good talk with Judge Ginsburg, complimenting her on her very moving statement yesterday, and I assured her that we were moving ahead with this confirmation process. I spoke with Senators Biden and Thurmond and Hatch and asked them to work with me to insure the speediest possible confirmation consistent with the Senate doing its duty. At any rate, I am confident that she will be ready to assume her position on the Supreme Court when the fall term begins in October.
With regard to the economy, we've had since last Friday very good reports on low inflation in terms of both producer prices and consumer prices. And in a larger sense over the last few months, we've seen a continuing reduction in long-term interest rates, which have given us a 20-year low in mortgage rates, a seven-year high in housing sales, and have mightily contributed to the introduction into this economy of 755,000 new jobs, well over 90 percent of them in the private sector.
I am confident that the continuation of this trend depends on our ability to pass a strong economic program through the Congress which reduces the deficits, increases investment in our future, and is fair in terms of requiring a fair apportionment of the burden. The plan that the House passed, that the Senate Finance Committee is now dealing with -- for every $10 that the deficit is reduced, $5 comes from spending cuts, $3.75 from upper-income people, $1.25 from the middle class, and families with incomes under $30,000 are held harmless.
I hope that the principles I have outlined will be honored as this program moves through the Congress. The Senate Finance Committee has some tough decisions to make. I don't expect to agree with all of them, but I think they will produce a bill. I think the Senate will produce a bill. And then we can go on to conference and see what the final shape of the economic plan that the whole Congress will vote on will be. I'm encouraged, quite upbeat, by the reports I've received from Senator Moynihan, Senator Mitchell and others about the progress being made there, and I just want to encourage the Senate to move forward.
Finally, let me say that the Senate is dealing with another very difficult and very important issue now, and that's campaign-finance reform. I have believed for a long time that we can't get thorough-going economic reform in our country until we have political reform. That requires the lobby-reform legislation that is moving its way through Congress -- but very importantly campaign-finance reform to lower the cost of campaigns, reduce the influence of special interests and PAC's, and open the airwaves to more honest debate. The troubling thing, obviously, is that the Republican senators have announced that they may yet again filibuster a bill. And the thing that particularly troubles me about this one is that several Republicans voted for a bill not unlike this last year which contained public financing. If, in fact, this filibuster occurs, it will be the second time that Republican senators who voted for a piece of progressive legislation when there was a Republican in the White House have now voted against it and have filibustered it. The first was on the motor-voter bill, where eventually we were able to work out the problems and get a bill passed.
But I think this is very, very important, and I very much hope that the senators will reconsider and let this bill go forward. We need to pass a strong campaign-finance reform bill this year. Political reform and economic reform, in my judgment, over the long run must go hand in hand, and the time is long since past when we should have campaign-finance reform.
Now, having said that, I think I ought to give Brit his follow-up.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. I hope you don't mind if I follow up on another subject, sir. In the House ----
PRESIDENT CLINTON. You know what I'm really upset about? You got a honeymoon and I didn't.
Q. Yes, sir, but you got to end it.
A. Well, I -- let's extend it, then. Go ahead.
Q. The House, liberals in particular, Black Caucus, in particular, seem in a somewhat mutinous mood as they watch the deliberations in the Senate on your economic program, and I'm wondering, sir, what you say to them to assure them that the tough vote they felt they cast for your program was not in vain and that you haven't really cut the rug out from under them.
A. Well, I've not cut the rug out from under them at all. I have not agreed to any provision that the Senate Finance Committee is deliberating. There has been no agreement on any issue. I have set out principles: $500 billion in deficit reduction, a deficit reduction trust fund for all the tax increases and spending cuts, at least $250 billion in spending cuts, although I would like some more cuts and some less taxes. Seventy-five percent of the burden has to fall on upper-income people, and we ought to keep the incentives for growth and for empowerment of the working poor and the incentives to move people from welfare to work. Those are the things that I want to see in the final bill.
And what I have assured the Black Caucus -- and let me say I have talked to, oh, probably 15 of the members in the last week or so just in that Caucus, and many other members of the House -- is that the principles that I outlined are still there and that we'll do our best to articulate those as the Senate deals with this bill, but the real test will be what happens in the conference and what the final bill looks like that the House and the Senate will vote on. And again, I'm quite encouraged that we'll get a bill out that they'll feel good about.
They made it clear to me what they felt most strongly about, and the two things above all were the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, which is an important part of our welfare reform incentive, and the empowerment zones for the depressed urban and rural areas. And there are all kinds of parliamentary issues that, as you know, the Senate has to consider in all this, but I'm confident that in the end, the bill that they vote on in the House to send to me for signature will have those things in it.
Q. Mr. President, do you perceive a loss of public confidence in your Presidency because of wavering domestically and in foreign policy? And what do you plan to do about it ----
A. No. . . . There is no wavering. I mean, you know, if somebody had told you at Christmas time, Helen, that by June 1 we'd have unemployment under 7 percent for the first time in a year and a half, 755,000 new jobs, a 20-year low in interest rates, a seven-year high in housing sales, that the United States would have led a global effort to support Boris Yeltsin, signed the Global Warming Treaty -- that actually happened on, I mean, the Biodiversity Treaty, that actually happened on June the 4th -- passed family leave and passed the motor-voter legislation, repealed the gag rule and the ban on fetal-tissue research to allow more science and less politics in medical research, I'd say most people would think that was a pretty decisive record -- that we would have moved this budget through the House of Representatives, sent it to the Senate -- much tougher decisions than were required in the Reagan budget in 1981, on a faster track, on a faster track. I think people would have said at Christmas time, that's a pretty good and decisive record. We haven't solved the problem in Bosnia that has plagued everybody. I concede that. The Europeans wouldn't go along with my proposed resolution. I still think they may be compelled to do that or something very near like it if they want to get anything done over there.
And I think we're going forward. I like the Supreme Court judge that I picked. I don't think it shows any wavering at all on that.
Q. You don't think there is a public feeling that you're indecisive ----
A. Well, all I'm telling you is ----
Q. I mean, on the highly touted issues of budget, Bosnia ----
A. Let me tell you something about Bosnia. On Bosnia, I made a decision. The United Nations controls what happens in Bosnia. I cannot unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I didn't change my mind. Our allies decided that they weren't prepared to go that far at this time. They asked me to wait and they said they would not support it. I didn't change my mind.
And as far as the budget, I don't -- how can you say that? No President's budget has been taken seriously in this town for a dozen years. Three-quarters of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against President Bush's last budget. I sent a budget up there that passed -- the budget resolution passed on time for the first time in 17 years, and we're out here fighting for these tough decisions. How could anybody say -- this is the most decisive Presidency you've had in a very long time on all the big issues that matter. And I might say all the heat we're getting from people is because of the decisions that have been made, not because of those that haven't.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, getting back to Judge Ginsburg for a moment, I know you -- you're familiar with her Madison lecture and her rather provocative statements about the judicial reach of Roe v. Wade. Can you tell me how comfortable you are with her challenge to the whole theoretical concept to that landmark ruling and whether you feel confident that she will, once on the court, meet what you had said during the campaign were your concerns about continuing ----
A. The -- I think if you read the lecture -- she is clearly pro-choice in the sense that she believes the Government should not make that decision for the women of America. She disagrees with the rationale of the decision. I'm not sure I agree with her, as a matter of fact, on that issue, but I thought it was a very provocative and impressive argument. And she -- as a matter of fact, you know, I have always thought that Roe v. Wade was the most difficult case decided in the last 25 years because it was such a difficult issue and that the court would have -- did the best it could under the circumstances. She made a very interesting alternative suggestion, but there is no suggestion in any of her writings that she's not pro-choice, and was to me the important thing.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. In regard to Judge Ginsburg, do you have any regrets about the process that led to her nomination?
A. Yeah, I have one big regret ----
Q. Mr. Babbitt and Mr. Breyer's names as the front runners?
A. Well, first of all, I strongly dispute that I hung them out. I regret the leaks, but it's not fair to say I hung them out. Any senator I talk to will tell you: when I called to discuss Judge Breyer, I also said I've got someone else I'm looking at. Anybody will tell you that. I told Bruce Babbitt the first day I called him: "I want to know if you agree to be considered -- I don't -- if the country can afford to lose you as Interior Secretary."

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Sir, we have not had the opportunity to ask you your reaction to the derogatory remarks about you that were reportedly made by the Air Force general in Europe. How did you feel when you heard about that, and why have you tolerated it the way you have?
A. First of all, I have not tolerated it, I have simply permitted the Air Force to handle this in the ordinary course of business, as I thought was appropriate. The Air Force is dealing with this issue. I have been fully briefed on it.
I had two feelings about it, frankly. For me, personally, I didn't care. People say whatever they want to say about me personally. It had no impact on me. And I thought, well, here's a guy who's served his country and, you know, so what if he doesn't like me and he doesn't know me from Adam's -- (inaudible). So, you know, he's just repeating something he's heard. But for a general officer to say that about the Commander in Chief, if that happened, is a very bad thing.

HEADLINE: Women Seize Focus at Rights Forum

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 15

 BODY:
On the crowded first floor of the United Nations complex here, every imaginable oppressed cause seems to be represented, each displaying its own set of atrocity photographs in a macabre competition for attention during the World Conference on Human Rights this month.
For hundreds of organizations, it is a rare chance to throw the spotlight on some distant corner of suffering. There are stands or posters dealing with crises in Peru and Tibet, graphic accounts of human rights abuses in Kurdistan and Kashmir, and photographic displays of the horrors of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 "It's hard to be noticed," Omar Mansour said as he distributed pamphlets about the Polisario movement in Western Sahara.
Out of the confusion, one pattern has become apparent. Women, particularly those here to promote women's human rights, have emerged as easily the strongest and most effective lobby. And the proof is that they have been noticed by the diplomats from 160 nations meeting one floor above.
 
950 Women's Organizations
 It is no accident. What has become known as the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights has been preparing for this meeting for the last three years and, in the process, some 950 different women's organizations around the world have joined a coalition backing the campaign.
"We want a final document from the conference that says something about women's human rights because that will legitimize our next step," said Charlotte Bunch, a professor at Rutgers University who is a leader of the campaign. "But I think we've already demonstrated that a global movement exists."
What distinguishes this campaign from, say, the battle for women's rights in the United States, is that it is focused less on the struggle to end discrimination and more on the need to put an end to a series of acute human rights abuses suffered by women because they are women.
In some areas, like domestic violence, there is a coincidence of concerns, although awareness that women have a "human right" not to be beaten is less entrenched in many developing countries than in the West. But other problems, like trafficking in women and genital mutilation, are often identified with specific regions of the world.
 
Global Tribunal
 As the centerpiece of its activities here, the women's campaign today organized what it called a Global Tribunal on Violations of Women's Human Rights. And, before a packed audience, women from around the world gave personal testimonies on a vast range of abuses, some personal, others political, a few cultural.
Even half a century later, for example, Bok Dong Kim of South Korea could not help breaking down in tears as she recounted how she spent eight years as a "sexual slave" of Japan's wartime army. Accompanying her, Chin Sung Chung, a young academic, said Japan's refusal to assume responsibility for this crime "is all the more reason for Japanese troops not to be sent abroad today."
In the section dealing with war crimes against women, Emma Hilario, a middle-aged woman from Peru who emerged as a local leader of protests against high prices and unemployment, told how the far-left Shining Path accused her of being an obstacle to the revolution and tried to kill her. Her right arm, which she said protected her head from bullets, was still bandaged.
Perhaps more surprising was the testimony of a Palestinian women's leader, Rana Nashashibi. She complained about the perils of life under Israeli occupation, but her principal message was that Palestinian women and children were above all victims of violence in the home. "We have become aware that Palestinian statehood will not necessarily bring freedom for women from a patriarchal society," she said.
 
'Where Are the Men?"
 Edward Broadbent, a former Canadian political leader, was one of two men and two women presiding over the tribunal. "When diplomats discuss human rights in United Nations bodies, there are always men and women," he said, looking out across the audience. "But I can't help asking, when we talk about the rights of women, where are the men today?"
While few men were indeed in the crowd today, the influence of the women's movement was apparent in that the section dealing with "the equal status and human rights of women" in the conference's final document was one of the few on which agreement had already been reached. Addressing the conference, many government leaders said they now go out of their way to recognize women's rights.
In his speech here on Monday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher won applause when he announced that Washington would press for appointment of a United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women. He also said the Clinton Administration would seek Senate approval of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
The women's movement has an advantage over a host of human rights groups present here because the final document will not deal with abuses in any specific country, but will only spell out generic rights. Even so, the draft appears to have some Islamic and African customs in mind when it demands protection of women's rights against "certain traditional or customary practices, cultural prejudices and religious extremism."
But for some women active here, the conference's main achievement may be that it has demonstrated that women from sharply different backgrounds can unite around a common set of objectives.
"For the first time, women's groups can now make demands on the United Nations," said Reed Brody of the International Human Rights Law Group, "and for the first time the United Nations will have to deal with them."

HEADLINE: Where Necessity Ends for Hospital Care

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLD SPRING, N.Y.

 BODY:
The Julia L. Butterfield Hospital, which sits on the outskirts of this tiny town, is not much to look at. Its melon and gray facade is hardly beautiful. There are cracks in the tiles on the upstairs halls. Although the emergency room was renovated last year, the X-ray machine dates back four decades and the ventilation system is almost as old.
For years the 2,200 residents of Cold Spring have seen the hospital as evidence that they have a basic right to immediate and total health care. Reluctantly, others came to a different conclusion: that the price of keeping the hospital open -- $2 million to save 35 beds -- is too high. 
 The difference in views illustrates a central question of the current health-care debate: where is the line between medical necessity and economic luxury? Across the United States, 642 hospitals have closed since 1980, forcing patients to drive extra miles to deliver their babies, recover from their illnesses, have their surgeries. The next-closest hospital to Cold Spring is about 20 miles away. How far is too far? How much is too much? Does the right to health care include the right to a community hospital?
"The current economics of health care don't allow a community hospital in every town," said Donna Gaidamak, a spokeswoman for the association.
Butterfield Hospital was founded in 1925 in a bequest left in the will of its namesake, a wealthy local woman whose son had died in childhood after a fall from a horse. If only there had been a hospital nearby, Mrs. Butterfield believed, her little boy might have been saved.
The institution has been on financially shaky ground from its first year of operation, when it had a deficit of $1,500. Since then, there have been economically good years mixed with the bad ones, but national trends were not in Butterfield's favor.
The cost of providing health care coupled with a push by insurance companies to reduce the length of each hospital stay have strained small hospitals to the breaking point. Since 1980, 404 hospitals have entered merger agreements with neighboring institutions. More than half of those mergers took place in the last five years.
"A small place like this can't keep up with technology," said Marcel Martino, chief executive officer of Butterfield. "Our radiology equipment is 30, 40 years old, we can't get parts. We can't expand our physician base, because doctors want to work with larger hospitals. People feel secure knowing we're here, but they don't really want to come here, either. They want to go where the doctors are and the technology is. Most people in the community have never been inside."
 
Unable to Meet Payroll
 Ten years ago, Butterfield nearly merged with Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie, 20 miles north of Cold Spring, which is 55 miles north of New York City, but the agreement fell through in its final stages. Five years ago the hospital was scheduled to be closed, but another small hospital in Beacon closed first, and the New York State Department of Health urged that Butterfield remain open so that the area did not lose two hospitals at once.
The latest threat to Butterfield began in March of this year when the board of trustees found itself unable to meet the hospital payroll. The board turned to the Hudson Valley Hospital Center, which had formerly been the Peekskill Community Hospital. Hudson Valley took control of Butterfield in exchange for an infusion of $500,000 to meet immediate expenses and allow the hospital credit with which to buy medical supplies.
Shortly after Hudson Valley took charge, it announced that it would close Butterfield's 35 beds on July 1, when the building would be turned into a nursing home. The Butterfield emergency room would remain open for as long as possible, Hudson Valley said, but if the economics proved impossible, it too would be closed. All patients from Cold Spring would have to travel 18 miles to Hudson Valley's 114-bed hospital for care.
In response to that announcement, the governing boards of Cold Spring and neighboring Nelsonville formed the Joint Commission for Butterfield Hospital to find alternatives to Hudson Valley's plans. The group found another hospital -- St. Luke's Community Medical Center, across the Hudson River in Newburgh, N.Y. -- which was willing to consider running the hospital and keeping the beds open.
 
Another Option Pursued
 Hudson Valley, in turn, said it would relinquish control of Butterfield, if it could recoup the $500,000 already spent to acquire the hospital, and if there is evidence that the community has raised an additional $1.5 million toward an operating endowment.
The Joint Commission set out to meet that challenge.
"We should do what people do in Mudpuddle, Utah," said Jacqueline Lofaro, a commission member whose elderly parents are regular users of Butterfield. "Make quilts, bake cakes -- it seems like an awfully cheap price for a hospital."
To their surprise, members of the commission found that others in the community did not share their optimism. Business is slow in the antique shops and cafes that are the primary livelihood here, since the flood of weekend tourists ebbed with the recession. Raising the equivalent of $1,000 per person, some residents said, was simply not possible.
"This community cannot raise this kind of money," said Katherine O'Donnell, owner of the Main Street Cafe, where the conversation over eggs and muffins is often about health care. "You have to sell a lot of cupcakes to raise $1.5 million. These are working people."
The commission said the money could be found -- in time. But time was the one thing it did not have.
"We'd gone as far as we could go," said Ms. Lofaro. "But we just couldn't meet the July 1 deadline."
And so the cost of health care in Cold Spring will change soon.
"That's a price of living away from everything," said Shawn Luther, who grew up in Nelsonville and is working at the Hudson Land Company real estate office before he leaves for college in the fall. "You have to drive 15 minutes for shopping. You have to drive 15 minutes for everything. Now you have to drive that far to the hospital. At least it isn't further."

HEADLINE: Cuba Willing to Discuss U.S. Reparations

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 15

 BODY:
Cuban officials made a gesture of peace toward the United States today, expressing willingness to negotiate reparations for American properties confiscated in the 1960's.
Cuba also announced today that it had cut the size of its armed forces because of its desperate economic problems. 
 The two announcements, carried by the official Prensa Latina press agency and monitored in Mexico City, indicate the depths of Cuba's economic crisis as well as its hopes of forging a less hostile relationship with the Clinton Administration.
The account did not say how far the military had been or would be cut. Cuba, with 10.8 million people, has about 380,000 regular troops and 1.5 million paramilitary forces, as well as about 65,000 Interior Ministry forces.
Cuba's economy nose-dived after the breakup of the former Soviet Union, its main trading partner and provider of aid.
The president of Cuba's State Committee on Economic Cooperation, Ernesto Melendez, expressed willingness to discuss American claims for payment on properties nationalized by Cuba in the 1960's as part of broader talks on normalizing relations.
President Clinton has not yet shown an interest in such talks.
The State Department said that 5,911 Americans had lost $1.8 billion in the nationalizations, a figure that has grown with inflation and interest to $5 billion to $6 billion.

HEADLINE: James Madison High School's Tradition of Success;
From Cousin Brucie to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Students and Graduates Earn Top Honors

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
There's plenty of talk at James Madison High School about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 1950 graduate who was nominated on Monday to the Supreme Court. But in the halls of the red brick school in southeast Brooklyn these days, there is even more talk about State Regents exams, scholarships, colleges and all the other academic hurdles that are to frame the students' futures.
Just as in Judge Ginsburg's day, James Madison today seems to be a rarity in American education -- an ethnic melting pot of scholastic overachievers, of whom Judge Ginsburg is only one of hundreds who have made names for themselves in the professions and the arts. 
 In the main hall next to the office of the principal, Constance M. Ranieri, for example, is the latest meaningful honor roll. In this case the names of the five James Madison students who won first-place prizes in New York City's 1993 Science Fair: Berenice Belizaire, Anthony Perez, William Kwok, M'Tchaka Warren, and Lisa Wong.
 
Reinforcing Success
 "Sure we feel glad for Judge Ginsburg," said Miss Belizaire, a Haitian immigrant who first spoke English on a daily basis only six years ago. "The kids here realize it's an honor. But it's the sort of distinction that only reinforces our desire to do well in class, and forces us to study when we get home at night."
Indeed Miss Belizaire -- who has won a score of honors at James Madison since arriving from Haiti in 1987, who is the school's current valedictorian and who is now headed for M.I.T. on a scholarship -- would seem to be the updated personification of the 1940's Ruth Bader.
As a student at James Madison, Judge Ginsburg was a star pupil, a cheerleader, the treasurer of the Go-Getters Club, a student pep group, an editor of the student newspaper, and the winner of a number of awards.
James Madison has traditionally labored in the shadow of more famous schools like Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School. But administrators and students say community involvement, innovative programs and a history of past success have combined to make James Madison something special. Its dropout rate is less than 6 percent -- a third of the citywide average -- and Miss Ranieri, the principal, said that more than 90 percent of the graduates go on to college.
The school is on Bedford Avenue near the Midwood and Kings Highway sections in a middle-class neighborhood that is so neat it seems to squeak. It is a neighborhood of hard-working families who have high aspirations for their children, and that attitude seems to be reflected in the school's success.
About half the students are black, Hispanic or Asian, with large numbers of recent immigrants from China, Russia and the Caribbean.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat and a James Madison alumnus, said the school "did more for my education than Harvard, which was my next stop."
 
'Steet Smarts'
 "James Madison not only gave me a wonderful education, but going to a big urban high school gives a kid street smarts that put him ahead of the competition in a place like an Ivy League school."
Miss Belizaire, the valedictorian, said, "Yes, Judge Ginsburg might be considered a role model, but a lot of the students here are the sort who want to achieve in life anyway."
In any case, Miss Belizaire has taken life very seriously in her 17 years, resulting in an acceptance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she will study computer sciences.
Miss Belizaire grew up in Port-au-Prince speaking Creole and French. She arrived here with her now 19-year old sister, Beatrice Belizaire, who is studying economics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook on a scholarship, and her mother, Rosette Versailles, a nurse at the Green Park Health Center in Brooklyn. The family lives in Hollis, Queens.
It is no accident that James Madison has ties to the fields of law, in which Judge Ginsburg has risen to prominence, and science, in which Miss Belizaire would seem to be heading toward a bright future. Miss Ranieri noted that for many years James Madison has had special ties to Manhattan law firms, like Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, and regional science centers, like Mount Sinai Medical Center.
Joseph Markowitz, 16, a James Madison junior and already the winner of half a dozen science awards, said there seemed to be a community spirit about the school that involves many people in the neighborhood beyond the students and faculty.
Mr. Markowitz knows whereof he speaks, living across the street from the school with his father, Dr. Marvin Markowitz, a retired cardiologist, and his mother, Julie Markowitz, a travel agent.
His sister Jennie is about to graduate and head to the University of Pennsylvania as a prelaw student.
Dr. Markowitz, himself a member of the James Madison Class of 1943, said he was delighted that his children attend the school, adding, "And God willing, my grandchildren will be going to James Madison -- it's a wonderful school."

Nordstrom Plans Men's Boutique

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Nordstrom Inc. removed the wraps yesterday from its plans to open a men's boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York, which may be the first step on a new growth path at the specialty store company.
The boutique, which will open Oct. 1 at Fifth Avenue and 54th Street in the location formerly occupied by Gucci, will be called Faconnable (pronounced fas-o-NA-bleh) and will feature a line of tailored men's clothing, sportswear and furnishings by the same name. It will be Nordstrom's first presence in New York City, although it has three full-line Nordstrom stores in New Jersey. 
 Nordstorm has carried the Faconnable line in 50 of its Nordstrom stores since 1989 under an exclusive licensing agreement with Faconnable, a French apparel manufacturer and retailer. The option to open a Faconnable store as a joint venture with the French company was part of the original licensing agreement.
"Right now, it's the only one planned, but we'll see how it works," said Jack Irving, the executive vice president in charge of Nordstrom's men's division. "Ideally it's just the first one of many."
 
Obstacles to Growth
 Sales at the $3.4 billion retailer have been relatively stagnant, in large part because almost 60 percent of its selling space is on the West Coast, where the economy has gone from bad to worse. But its growth has also been impeded by efforts of competitors to block its entrance into new markets and by the growing pains associated with the company's expansion from its Seattle base.
Nordstrom has been experimenting for more than two years with offshoots of its full-line stores. It has a chain of close-out stores called Nordstrom Rack and it plans to open its first Nordstrom Factory Direct, an outlet store that would carry designer labels and Nordstrom's private-label brands, outside Philadelphia in August.
Mr. Irving said Nordstrom had decided to open the New York store based on the success of the brand in its full-line stores at a time when the men's clothing business, particularly at the high end of the price range, has been anything but brisk. Faconnable shirts sell for between $65 and $75, ties for $55 to $65 and suits for about $1,000.

Bad Weather Has Been Very Good for Elcor, But Can It Last?

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
TAKE some folks on a drive through Dallas and at some point, someone may say, "My, don't these homes have nice-looking roofs?"
They certainly do, because a large portion of the housing stock in Dallas was damaged during the last year by huge hailstorms that stripped off hundreds of thousands of roofing tiles, all of which had to be replaced. 
 And of course, when disaster appeared, Wall Street saw opportunity.
Shares of the Elcor Corporation, a Dallas-based maker of roofing tiles, have been, well, going through the roof since last August. The shares, which never topped $16 throughout the booming 1980's, have traded as high as $36.50 this year, more than four times the $8.125-a-share price fetched in July. They closed yesterday at $29.75, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
And small wonder. The hailstorm damage in Dallas, along with damage caused by Hurricane Andrew and fires in Oakland, Calif., helped raise demand for Elcor's products significantly, allowing the company to put through price increases during the slow fall and winter quarters that traditionally see heavy discounting.
Low interest rates chipped in their part as well, as increasing numbers of homeowners took out loans to replace their roofs. Elcor also benefited from an increasing shift toward laminated fiberglass roofing tiles, which it makes, away from the more traditional asphalt or wood tiles.
Those factors showed on the bottom line. In the 1992 fiscal year, which ended June 30, Elcor's revenues jumped almost 16 percent, with some $6.5 million in operating earnings, compared with a loss in 1991. And, as reroofing picked up, operating profits jumped even more, to $16.2 million for the nine months ended June 30.
But does that strong performance signal a major market shift? Or, as some investors and industry executives argue, is Elcor benefiting from the aberrations of heavy storms and low interest rates, which may soon disappear?
Elcor argues for the shift. The company plans a secondary stock offering to build a new roofing-tile plant in California that would increase its manufacturing capacity by 65 percent.
In its registration statement, Elcor predicted significant growth. "The laminated fiberglass asphalt shingle segment is the fastest-growing segment of this marketplace," the company said, adding that the sector grew some 55 percent in 1992 over 1991.
But when the effects of the bad weather are set aside, the industry demand does not seem quite as impressive. "Half of the growth rate, comparing 1991 versus 1992, was because of unusual weather phenomena," said John Sergey, president of the GAF Building Materials Corporation, an Elcor competitor.
Some investors are also not as convinced as Elcor that it will be able to take significant advantage of the growing popularity of laminated tiles in the face of growing competition. "For Elcor to claim that demand is going to keep up, they have to ignore how much capacity is coming on and how easy it is to add capacity," said Charles Biderman, editor of Market Trim Tabs, a Santa Rosa, Calif., newsletter that specializes in short-selling recommendations.
Indeed, executives in the roofing tile industry say that the growing demand for laminated tiles has not only been noticed by Elcor. Numerous companies, including GAF, Owens-Corning Fiberglass and Celotex, are rapidly moving to expand their capacity.
"The industry in total has probably added 60 percent more laminate capacity than existed three years ago, and now that's going to grow even more," said one senior industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. "That is a stunning amount of additional capacity for this business, and demand is already slowing substantially. The hailstorm needs have been pretty much satisfied."

HEADLINE: Ex-Kremlin Figure Returns to Power in Azerbaijan

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan, June 15

 BODY:
In a remarkable political comeback, a former K.G.B. general, former Communist Party boss and former Politburo member in the Kremlin has maneuvered his way back into power here, saying he is a democrat and promising to turn his native Azerbaijan back from the brink of civil war.
"Let there be no doubt about my purpose," Heydar Aliyev, 70, said in his acceptance speech upon being voted into the office of Chairman of Parliament today. "I will devote the time God has left me to protect the independence of Azerbaijan and promote the rule of law, democratic pluralism and the development of a market economy." 
 Mr. Aliyev also called on a rebel commander whose forces are within 60 miles of the capital to end his revolt, promising that those responsible for bringing the country to the brink of collapse would be punished.
Mr. Aliyev repeatedly referred to the beleaguered President of Azerbaijan, Abulfez Elchibey, as his "host," but the selection of Mr. Aliyev by Parliament is widely regarded as signaling that he has won a struggle for supremacy in the oil-producing former Soviet republic. In the week since he arrived in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, he has waged a campaign against the dwindling authority of the Government, meeting with foreign diplomats, summoning international oil executives and promoting an image of himself as the savior of the country.
But Mr. Aliyev appears to have bowed to United States and other Western official statements of support for the "Government of the democratically elected President." A flight of foreigners involved in the oil industry seems also to have played a role in his decision not to oust Mr. Elchibey.
Whatever the sincerity of his recent embrace of political pluralism and market economics, Mr. Aliyev was almost a perfect child of the Soviet system, even down to the Russification of his first name, which for years was spelled Geidar. After joining the local K.G.B., he made his way up the ranks of the Soviet security forces, achieving the rank of general. In 1969, he was promoted to First Secretary of the Azerbaijani Communist Party and was one of the most faithful members of Leonid I. Brezhnev's inner circle.
 
Dropped by Gorbachev
 In 1981, Mr. Aliyev was brought into the Soviet Politburo by Mr. Brezhnev's successor as Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov. He served as Deputy Prime Minister until he was dropped from the inner circle in 1986 by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and branded a corrupt, anti-glasnost hard-liner.
Mr. Aliyev resurfaced in January 1990, when he appeared at a Moscow rally to denounce Mr. Gorbachev for ordering Soviet troops to move into Baku to put down anti-Armenian riots that had actually ended several days before the troops arrived. Resigning from the Communist Party, Mr. Aliyev made a heroic return to Baku as an anti-Soviet Azerbaijani nationalist.
Regarded as suspect by the Communist Party apparatus he once controlled in Baku, Mr. Aliyev set up camp in his native Nakhichevan, an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan that is separated from the rest of the country by Armenia. Becoming chairman of the Nakhichevan legislature, he presided over the introduction of the Latin alphabet to replace the Russian-imposed Cyrillic script and the abolition of Soviet holidays even before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Lawmakers Balk at Anti-Crisis Plan

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 15

 BODY:
The Ukrainian Parliament balked today at President Leonid M. Kravchuk's latest attempt to solve the country's growing economic and political crisis, and gave the Government two days to come up with an emergency economic recovery plan.
As labor unrest continued to spread through eastern Ukraine, Mr. Kravchuk called for parliamentary elections this winter, along with a referendum on his leadership. But that proposal was voted down by Parliament on a vote of 331 to 138, according to the news agency Interfax. 
 Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who has repeatedly pressed Parliament for extra powers to stop runaway inflation and push ahead with economic reform, warned today that unless his request was granted, the country could slide into dictatorship within a month.
Mr. Kuchma urged striking miners and industrial workers in the Donbas, a region where a majority of the population is ethnically Russian, to go back to work or else face the prospect of starvation in a few days.
The strikes in the Donbas began after Ukraine was hit with another round of price rises, set off after Russia, its main supplier of gas and oil, increased energy prices. In the first quarter of this year, inflation in Ukraine was 314 percent, more than three times the rate in neighboring Russia.
In Parliament today, Mr. Kuchma accused the miners of staging a "political" strike, and blamed Russia for bringing the Ukrainian economy to a crisis point.
"Russia's position toward Ukraine could hardly be called friendly and normal today," Mr. Kuchma said, according to Interfax. "We are being robbed because of our weakness."
As the weeklong strikes picked up support, some of its leaders have been pressing for greater autonomy for the Donbas, as well as a referendum on the the future of the Kiev Government and its economic policies. This demand was rejected in Parliament today by Ukrainian nationalists, who view an autonomous Donbas as "a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine."
Ukraine's quickening political and economic crisis comes at a time when Parliament is scheduled to consider ratification of the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the former Soviet Union, which the Ukrainian leadership committed itself to a year ago. Parliament's continued delay in voting on the 1991 treaty, as well as in a related vote to join the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons as a non-nuclear power, has caused anxieties in the West, raising the specter of two nuclear powers -- Russia and Ukraine -- rising from the ruins of the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Kuchma, still fighting to get the emergency powers he says he needs to put economic reforms on track, said Mr. Kravchuk's proposed national referendum should focus on Ukraine's economic as well as political future.
"There should be a referendum with just one question -- what kind of society are we building," Mr. Kuchma said in a fiery speech. He said the powers he was seeking last month -- which would have given him control of the Ukrainian Central Bank, among other things -- were "ordinary, intended for a relatively soft way out of the crisis."
Now, he said, he needs real emergency powers to amend laws and dismiss recalcitrant officials. "If such powers are denied today, dictatorship will be unavoidable in a month," he said.

HEADLINE: Man Kills Boy and Injures 2 With Machete

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROOSEVELT, L.I., June 15

 BODY:
A man whose parents took him in last year after he had spent months living on the streets took a machete this morning and hacked to death his 17-month-old grand-nephew and injured his 3-year-old grand-niece and his father, the Nassau County Police said.
The man, Mark Mitchell, 36, was arrested about 9:20 A.M. as he sat calmly on the steps of his parents' home, across from his bleeding father, Thomas, 67, said Lieut. Frank Guidice. 
 His grand-nephew, Brandon Guzman, was pronounced dead on arrival at Nassau County Medical Center, and his grand-niece, Amber Lee, was in surgery all day as doctors tried to save a leg that had been cut to the bone, Jean Bladykas, a hospital spokeswoman said.
In this suburban neighborhood of modest homes, neighbors said they were not surprised by the crime. They said Mr. Mitchell had a history of bizarre behavior and was an accident waiting to happen.
 
'A Time Bomb'
 They described a troubled young man who often practiced karate in the front yard in his underwear, was in and out of jails and psychiatric institutions and one night built a foxhole in his front yard and shot at imaginary foes with a broomstick.
"He was just a time bomb waiting to go off," a neighbor, Harold McKnight, said.
Lieutenant Guidice said that Mr. Mitchell had been in jail repeatedly since 1986 on misdemeanor and felony charges ranging from harassment and sale of narcotics to assault and burglary. One former neighbor had an order of protection placed against Mr. Mitchell, he added.
Mr. Mitchell apparently attacked the two children and his father after he became irritated with his grand-niece for something she said to him, then struck the girl with his hand, the police said. His mother, Ruth, began to yell at him, and when he argued back, his father joined in and the two began to tussle. He then left and returned with the machete, Lieutenant Guidice said.
Mr. Mitchell was unemployed, and neighbors said he had been unsuccessful for years in his efforts to find work. He had left his parents' home last year, and Lieutenant Guidice said that for a while he had "fallen on hard times" and was "living on the street and moving from residence to residence."
His parents agreed to let him move back in October, and for at least a month he had been sharing the four-bedroom home with his parents, his niece and the two children, the police said.
Neighbors said that over the years Mr. Mitchell's family had been scarred by violence, and they recalled incidents in which they saw Mr. Mitchell hit a sibling or a parent. The police said that two of his brothers had been slain, and Mike DeLouise, a spokesman for Hofstra University in nearby Hempstead, said that a woman who is believed to be Mr. Mitchell's sister killed herself by jumping out of a dormitory window more than 10 years ago, though she was not a student there.
Mr. DeLouise also reported that a Mark Mitchell, who lived at the address where the killing today took place, 318 Park Avenue in Roosevelt, was a student at Hofstra briefly in 1978 and was banned from the campus because of his behavior. The student listed a different birthday than the one Mr. Mitchell today gave the police.
Mr. Mitchell was charged this evening with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He is to be arraigned on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Senator Commands Stage Far Bigger Than Oklahoma by Defying Clinton

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
At home in Oklahoma, Senator David L. Boren was once portrayed by newspaper cartoonists as the Pillsbury Doughboy. In the cloakrooms of the Senate, he was dismissed as a glad-hander who craved approval more than power.
That was before Mr. Boren went on a diet and reassessed his career after the death of his father, an irreverent Democratic Congressman who rebelled against Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Then the Senator took on President Clinton's economic package. 
 More than any other member of Congress, it was Mr. Boren who forced Mr. Clinton to abandon his broad tax on the energy content of fuels. First he threatened to withhold his swing vote on the Senate Finance Committee, and then, breaking an unspoken rule of Congressional conduct, he forcefully lobbied House Democrats to break with their leadership and President.
Further embarrassing the President and infuriating his Democratic colleagues, he is now threatening to withhold his vote unless they cut an additional $50 billion in spending in politically sensitive programs like Medicaid and Medicare.
 
Like Paul Revere?
 His critics -- and there seem to be more every day -- say he is a shill for big oil who is on an ego trip. Mr. Boren compares himself to Paul Revere, saying he is a man with a mission to save President Clinton from the Democratic Party's liberal wing.
The 52-year-old Senator said in an interview on Monday that he expected to reach a compromise with the White House this week. But he added: "If we don't, it wouldn't be the end of the world because we would have to start over again, this time on a bipartisan basis. That could be better for the President and the country, though it would certainly mean an uncomfortable time for me."
It is the exceptional Senator who does not possess a robust sense of his own importance and a willingness to step on toes to promote the interests of his state. But Mr. Boren never before appeared to have the strength of personality to withstand so much criticism and pressure. He has made contradictory public statements the last few weeks, sometimes appearing like his old wavering self, but he keeps coming back to defy the President and his party.
Mr. Boren has made waves before, though they were small, few, and far between. As chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, he once sharply criticized President George Bush, accusing him of neglecting to take advantage of a 1989 failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama. And he broke with his party by voting in favor of the Supreme Court nominations of Robert H. Bork and Clarence Thomas. (He has since said his vote for Judge Thomas was a mistake.)
 
A Larger Stage
 But he is now performing on a far larger stage, and much more is at stake.
Actually, he is trying to perform two contrasting roles at the same time. Even as he locks horns with the President on economic policy, he is Senate floor manager of Mr. Clinton's campaign finance-reform legislation. As a Democrat who works well with Republicans, he can help Mr. Clinton unlock a filibuster on one issue even as he stalls the legislative progress on another.
"I'm sort of a split personality right now," he chuckled at a breakfast with businessmen Wednesday. "When I call the White House, the operator is trained to say, 'Is this the good Boren or the bad Boren?' "
He owes his new "bad Boren" image mostly to the nine Republicans on the Finance Committee who have refused to back the President's economic program. Hence, Mr. Boren is one of 11 Democrats on the committee Mr. Clinton must unanimously carry unless the Democratic leadership takes the highly unusual -- and risky -- tack of bypassing the panel and moving the bill directly to the Senate floor.
"I love the direction he's going," said Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. "But I don't think the poor devil can get his party there."
 
Colleagues Are Upset
 By contrast, fellow Democrats accuse Mr. Boren of breaking his word to the President that he would stand by him. They note that he first enthusiastically backed Mr. Clinton's budget, and even argued against farm-program spending cuts that would hurt his state. "People just wonder if a lot of the things he does is not for parochial interests," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn.
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said: "There are many of us who are very upset with him. It's obvious he would be more comfortable on the Republican side."
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is so angry with Mr. Boren that he has discussed with several subcommittee chairmen ways of withholding money for military, farming and Indian-affairs programs in Oklahoma.
Mr. Boren concedes that he favors the interests of Oklahoma, and that he was too quick to speak in favor of Mr. Clinton's economic proposals before he read the fine print. But he says the criticism comes mostly from liberals who are overly committed to spending programs that must be cut if the country is to regain its financial footing and competitiveness.
"People say, 'My God, he's left the back of the bus,' " Mr. Boren said. "I was prepared to ruffle feathers. I didn't go into this with my eyes closed."
 
Invitation to Perot
 The anger is particularly palpable among liberal House Democrats, who resent Mr. Boren for not only intervening in their chamber but also for his efforts at restructuring Congressional procedures and campaign-finance laws. Many were outraged when Mr. Boren earlier this year invited Ross Perot to testify before a joint committee, of which Mr. Boren is co-chairman, to study ways to reform Congressional perquisites and functions, an occasion that the Texas billionaire used to lash out at Congress on network television.
Although Mr. Boren has become increasingly identified with Mr. Perot, he has far more in common with President Clinton. Like the President, Mr. Boren played saxophone in high school and college, attended Yale and was a Rhodes Scholar. A lawyer, he was elected Governor at the age of 34, campaigning against an incumbent Democrat by walking across the state with a broom over his shoulder.
Mr. Boren said he inherited his rebel streak from his father, Lyle Boren, who served in Congress from 1937 to 1947. Though the elder Mr. Boren regularly played poker with Harry S. Truman and Sam Rayburn, he frequently broke with his party, against much of the New Deal and most notably when Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court. He was finally driven from office by a campaign staffed and financed by national labor unions.
 
A Father Remembered
 Mr. Boren's Senate office is virtually a gallery of photographs of his late father, posing at the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, whistle-stopping with Roosevelt and relaxing with Rayburn.
Still, for most of his Senate career, Mr. Boren has been known more for hedging his bets than striking out boldly. Bush Administration lobbyists recall how maddening it was tracking Mr. Boren on the issue of capital gains tax breaks in 1989. From week to week, on the Finance Committee and later on the Senate floor, the Senator went from the Administration position in favor to the Democratic Party in opposition.
Associates close to Mr. Boren say he has become more introspective and self-confident after two epiphanies in the last two years, first when he turned 50 and then when he lost his father last July. For one thing, he has kept on a steady regime of exercise to trim down, and for another, he has taken more time for contemplation while gardening.
Mr. Boren considered the observation, then agreed that he does not care quite as much what people think of him as he used to. "You get more at peace with yourself as you get older," he said. "The one thing my father could say at the end of his life was, 'I don't think I ever ducked taking a stand.' Even though he's not here, I often think about what he would say if he were sitting across the desk."
"Whenever you stick your neck out in a very forceful way, on something that is highly controversial where there are influential members of Congress on the other side, you always run the risk of hurting yourself," Mr. Boren added. "I rarely put myself in a confrontational role. I'm a bridge-builder."
But Mr. Boren started burning bridges last month, on the day President Clinton tried to quell an uprising by House Democrats by dramatically traveling down Pennsylvania Avenue to plead with the Democratic caucus to stand by his program. Just as it appeared that Mr. Clinton had nipped the revolt in the bud, Mr. Boren threw a new obstacle in his way by announcing that a group of moderate Democrats and Republicans had designed an alternative budget plan with more budget cuts and fewer taxes.
The next day, Mr. Boren walked over to the House side of the Capitol to buck up moderate and conservative Democrats who were wavering under the intense White House lobbying. His tactics stood in stark contrast with those of Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, the other oil-state Finance Committee swing vote, who lobbied House members in favor of Mr. Clinton's package, promising that changes would come later in the legislative process.
"A tough-guy image is not what I'm looking for," Mr. Boren said. "I'd like to be quietly strong."

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill to Ban Replacement of Strikers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
The House voted today to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for union members who strike, but Senate Republicans immediately said they would stage a filibuster to kill the measure, organized labor's biggest legislative priority.
The same legislation passed the House last year but was killed by filibuster in the Senate. Its prospects appear somewhat better this year, largely because President Clinton favors the bill and could sway some crucial Democratic Senators. 
 The highly partisan six-hour debate in the House centered on the philosophical questions of what role organized labor should play in American society and what role Government should play in balancing the interests of labor and management during strikes.
While liberals said strong unions were necessary to protect the wages, pensions and health benefits of workers, several conservatives compared big unions to dinosaurs whose extinction would strengthen small business and create more jobs.
 
Trying to Halt Decline
 The House voted 239 to 190 to pass the bill, with 221 Democrats, 17 Republicans and one independent in favor and 33 Democrats and 157 Republicans opposed. The total supporting the bill fell 8 short of the 247 members who favored it last year.
Organized labor says passage of the bill, called the Cesar Chavez Workplace Fairness Act, is needed to reverse the sharp decline in membership and influence that unions experienced in the 1980's. Labor advocates note that the hiring of permanent replacement workers has become more frequent in recent years, like in the highly publicized strikes at International Paper and Greyhound. Businesses hired permanent replacement workers in nearly one of five strikes reported to the Federal Government from 1985 to 1989.
Business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers are lobbying against the measure, arguing that it would unwisely tilt the balance of power in contract negotiations to the unions' favor.
The measure would apply only to companies where a labor group is recognized by the employer or the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive representative of the workers in negotiations.
"What good is the right to strike if when you do the boss fires you?" asked Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana. "Those members who oppose this bill are for bosses firing workers for striking."
 
Republicans See Dilemma
 House Republicans criticized the legislation as a "strike-maker bill" that would provoke more labor unrest, lower productivity and trade competitiveness, as well as increase prices for consumers.
"If employers who are faced with unreasonable demands from a union cannot consider hiring permanent replacements, even as a last resort" said Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, "many businesses will be faced with a Hobson's choice of either closing down altogether or agreeing to potentially outrageous demands."
Representative Cass Ballenger, Republican of North Carolina, said the bill "would grant big union bosses powers to paralyze small business and the American economy unseen since Jimmy Hoffa began pushing up daisies under the 50-yard line."
But the real battle will be fought next month in the Senate, where Republicans have far more power than in the House because of their ability to filibuster. Last year, supporters of the bill fell three votes short of the 60 needed to shut off debate.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said "there will be a real filibuster" to kill the legislation. He predicted that the vote on stopping the filibuster would be very close.
Unions are pressing Mr. Clinton to make a concerted effort to win Senate passage. Two of the five Democratic Senators who voted against ending the filibuster last year were Senators Dale Bumpers and David Pryor of Arkansas, who normally try to support Mr. Clinton when he asks. Their aides said Mr. Pryor was undecided while Mr. Bumpers remained steadfast in his opposition to the legislation.

She approvingly quoted Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a bete noire to Democrats for most of that time, as saying that a good judge is bound to apply the facts and the law to come up with a decision, even if it is "not what the home crowd wants." 
 It was a telling choice of a quotation that underscored Judge Ginsburg's own seemingly anomalous role as both an authentic heroine in the legal battle for women's rights and a prominent critic of what many see as the crowning accomplishment of that battle, the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade that established a constitutional right to abortion.
Her criticism of the 1973 decision, expressed over the years but most notably in a lecture at New York University Law School three months ago, has somewhat discomfited her home crowd of feminist lawyers and other leaders of the women's movement. Sound bites suggesting that her commitment to abortion rights is something less than unwavering have been the inevitable result.
 
Divided on Approach
 The difference is not over the ultimate goal of a right to abortion fully anchored in the Constitution and secure against political undermining. Rather, Judge Ginsburg's lecture reflects a long-running debate about whether that goal could have been better achieved by another route, as a matter both of constitutional doctrine and judicial strategy, and over what lessons to draw from the tortuous history of abortion rights in the 20 years since Roe v. Wade was decided.
Judge Ginsburg's critique of Roe v. Wade is twofold. First, she said in the New York University lecture, as she has written for years, the right to abortion might have been more secure had it been grounded in the concept of women's right to equality rather than in the right to privacy. "The Roe decision might have been less of a storm center," she said, had it "homed in more precisely on the women's-equality dimension of the issue."
Given the fact that the right to privacy has become little more than a code word for abortion in current political discourse, it might appear startling to divorce abortion from privacy and seek a home for abortion rights elsewhere in the Constitution.
 
The Notion of Equality
 But the equality argument for abortion rights -- essentially the notion that women cannot participate in society equally with men without the ability to control their reproductive lives -- was in fact part of the abortion-rights movement from its earliest years. An equality argument was among the arguments presented to the Court in Roe v. Wade.
While Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion took a different path, a theoretical debate continued in academic legal circles throughout the next decade. Judge Ginsburg, who as a litigator arguing cases before the Supreme Court had helped create the modern constitutional law of women's equality, continued to press for equality.
The argument at times became bitter because of a new element: the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. Some leaders of the long and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the amendment were concerned that too close a link between equality and abortion would pose a political threat to the E.R.A. by driving away potential supporters of the amendment who did not share the abortion-rights agenda.
In any event, long after the equal rights amendment died and the argument faded into history, it was the Supreme Court itself that revived the equality basis for abortion rights in its ruling last year in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Pennsylvania case in which the Court reaffirmed the right to abortion.
 
Sticking to the 'Core'
 Among the reasons that Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter gave in their opinion for adhering to the "core" of Roe v. Wade was a sentence that could have been written by Judge Ginsburg: "The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives."
The second part of Judge Ginsburg's critique concerns the scope of Roe v. Wade, and it is this part that has made some abortion-rights leaders, including Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League, somewhat wary. Judge Ginsburg has argued that by issuing a broad ruling that swept most state abortion laws off the books, the Court created an inherently vulnerable precedent that led to a backlash and short-circuited a liberal trend then under way in the states.
While her New York University lecture discussed Roe v. Wade specifically, her critique reflected a more general approach to judging and to the development of the law. "Measured motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common-law adjudication," she said. "Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable." She praised the Court's opinion last year in Planned Parenthood v. Casey for opening a "renewed dialogue" between the states and the Court.
Marcy Wilder, senior staff lawyer for the abortion-rights league, said in an interview today, "When she says that Roe went too far and that Casey is progress, we have to know whether she's saying that a lesser standard of protection for abortion is a better standard." Ms. Wilder said it was far from clear historically that most states would have liberalized their abortion laws significantly on their own.
 
'Vision of the Future'?
 Helen Neuborne, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Educational Fund, also took issue with the notion that a more gradual approach by the Court might have avoided political fallout from the anti-abortion side. There are many possible explanations for the events of the last 20 years, Ms. Neuborne said, including a failure by abortion-rights groups to protect their court victories by early grass-roots organizing.
"These are very complicated issues," Ms. Neuborne said. "She believes that incremental in the long run wins the race. Some of us want everything all the time, all the way. It's a legitimate discussion. Her vision may be the vision of the future. Her gift may be to be able to build and hold the middle of the Court, to accomplish our goals in her style."
This somewhat abstract debate over style and approach will become concrete soon enough if Judge Ginsburg is confirmed. On abortion, for example, the Court has a substantial amount of unfinished business before it in defining the standard the Casey opinion adopted for judging state restrictions on abortion.
The Court said last year that state regulations must not place an "undue burden" on women's access to abortion. By the Court's next term or soon after that, the Justices will be confronted with abortion regulations that have had full trials under the new standard and that pose the question of what burdens are actually "undue."
Judge Ginsburg's written work leaves unclear how she will approach this second-generation abortion debate, and which abortion restrictions she would be most likely to strike down. Justice Byron R. White, to whose seat Judge Ginsburg has been named, never voted to strike down any.

HEADLINE: N.E. Auerbach Dies; Oversaw the Growth Of Accounting Firm

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Norman E. Auerbach, who as a World War II veteran in need of a job became an accountant at Coopers & Lybrand at the age of 27 and retired 35 years later as chairman, died Sunday at Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. A Tucson resident and former New Yorker, he was 73.
The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Dr. Gary A. Auerbach of Tucson. 
 When he reached mandatory retirement age in 1982, Coopers & Lybrand laid claim to being the world's largest accounting and consulting concern. By then the firm, which has headquarters in Manhattan, had 450 offices worldwide, 27,000 employees to staff them and revenues of nearly $1 billion a year. Now its worldwide revenues are $5 billion.
Mr. Auerbach, a native of Minneapolis, arrived at the University of Michigan in the midst of the Depression with $25 in his pocket. He earned his degree in economics and served in World War II, commanding a supply ship in the Pacific.
He then finished his master's in business at Michigan and shelved his plan to practice law. Instead, he found work at what in 1947 still was Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery, took his law degree several years later at St. John's University and was admitted to the New York bar. By then his accounting career had taken off. Before his election as chairman and chief executive at Coopers & Lybrand in 1976, he was the firm's associate managing partner.
After his retirement in 1982 he turned to his first ambition, the law, and joined his sons Roger and Richard in their Tucson practice.
Besides his three sons, Mr. Auerbach is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Judy Genden; a brother, Milton, also of Tucson; three sisters, Evelyn Mandelcorn of Los Angeles, Esther Sahr of Schenectady, N.Y., and Sally Steinberg of East Schodack, N.Y., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Company Is Coaxed Away

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Claiming another prize in the regional battle for jobs, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut announced yesterday that the Witco Corporation, a Manhattan-based manufacturer, was moving its headquarters -- and 800 jobs -- to a vacant office building in Greenwich. The state is providing Witco with $8 million in grants.
Mr. Weicker took the occasion to defend the state's aggressive economic development campaign and to respond to remarks this week by Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, who said the states should stop using grants to compete with one another and instead spend the money on schools, roads and bridges. 
 "I would suggest, considering the state of affairs in the Clinton Administration, that Reich should keep his comments to Washington," Mr. Weicker said.
Praising the State Legislature and his commissioners for working to improve the state's economy, he added, "We would appreciate it, sooner rather than later, if the biggest player got on the field and started helping the rest of us tackle this recession."
 
Increase in Region's Jobs
 He made his comments at a news conference in Hartford with William R. Toller, the chairman of Witco, who said the company will move to Greenwich next year. The company, based in Manhattan for more than 40 years, will occupy a huge office building built in the 1970's by the American Can Company on 155 forested acres.
While the move involves government inducements that have become increasingly common in the interstate competition between New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, officials said it was unusual because it will result in an overall gain in employment for the region.
Witco, a manufacturer of chemicals and petroleum products, said the Greenwich headquarters would consolidate operations now based in several states. It said its New York City staff of 200 will make the move, as will 400 workers based in Woodcliff, N.J., and 200 others from Kansas, Illinois, Ohio and other states.
The announcement yesterday followed three decades in which the headquarters of major New York City companies have migrated to northern New Jersey, Westchester County and Connecticut, and in which the financial inducements offered by the city and its suburban competitors have grown richer.
At City Hall, officials said yesterday that they had approached Witco earlier this year about keeping its headquarters in Manhattan, but that the company had already decided to leave and that no financial incentives from the city were discussed.
The inducements provided by Connecticut "demonstrate more clearly than ever how competitive the market has become," said Catie Marshal, a spokeswoman for New York City's Economic Development Corporation.
"Its shows what lengths a state like Connecticut, which has been very badly hurt by the economy, will go to take our jobs," she added.
 
Deciding Factor
 Mr. Toller said the money offered by Connecticut was a deciding factor for Witco, whose best-known consumer product is Kendall motor oil. With 8,400 employees around the world and annual sales of over $2 billion, the company was ranked as the nation's 242d-largest industrial concern by Fortune magazine last year.
Economic development officials said half of the $8 million would be used to refurbish the Greenwich building. The other half can be used by Witco however it chooses, but there is a catch -- unless the company retains at least 800 employees in Greenwich for 10 years, it must pay back part of the money to the state.
The provision is intended to avoid subsidizing a company that might reduce its payroll or shed operations soon. It is similar to requirements incorporated by New York City in recent "retention packages" that have been extended to big companies.
 
Provision Not Unusual
 In the most recent case, the Dinkins administration announced this month that it had persuaded Mastercard International, which had threatened to move its headquarters and 450 workers from Manhattan to White Plains, to stay in Manhattan, but only in exchange for tax credits.
The city said Mastercard would receive $2 million in tax credits, but would be required to keep at least 450 workers in Manhattan for 10 years. And, as an inducement to invest more in the city, it said Mastercard would receive as much as $8 million in grants if it doubled its Manhattan employment over the next decade.
A larger package of city incentives was accepted last year by Morgan Stanley & Company, which had threatened to move to Stamford. In that case, the city is providing tax breaks worth $39.6 million, but only if the company retains its current work force of 4,100 in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn for 10 years.
 
Long-Vacant Building
 The building Witco plans to move into has been vacant for years, and described by some in Greenwich as a corporate white elephant.
It was built in the 1960's by American Can, then a packing goods manufacturer, which overcame widespread apprehension among Greenwich residents to put its headquarters on pristine land along the town's border with Westchester County.
But less than five years after American Can moved in, it began disposing of manufacturing operations, shedding workers, and turning itself into a financial services company with roots far deeper on Wall Street than in Greenwich.
In the early 1980's, American Can renamed itself the Primerica Corporation, and left Greenwich.

HEADLINE: Sales of Domestic Vehicles Continue Gains

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 15

 BODY:
The auto industry's recovery that began in early April appears to be continuing, according to the nation's auto makers, which reported today that sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose 15.5 percent in early June.
Sales of cars built in North America rose 8.8 percent between June 1 and June 10 from the similar period last year, to 203,304. Sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles, rose 25.4 percent, to 157,156. Over all, vehicle sales totaled 360,460. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of domestic car sales was 6.8 million, up from 6.5 million a year earlier, but down from 7 million in late May. Light trucks sold at an annualized rate of 5.2 million, compared with 4.5 million in the comparable period last year.
 
Gains in Annualized Rate
 The broader annual rate of total vehicle sales was about 14.7 million, according to an estimate by David Healy, automotive analyst of S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. His estimate compares with total sales of about 13.1 million vehicles in 1992, considered a poor year.
"These are strong numbers, especially for the first 10 days of the month," Mr. Healy said. "We've got a real recovery." He added that the strong auto sales conflicted with surveys that had suggested consumers did not have enough confidence in the economy to purchase new vehicles.
Many dealers continued to offer incentives like low-rate financing and leasing.
"We have a philosophy that car sales are happening all over the country regardless of the economy," said Pete Franklin, general sales manager of Chris Auffenberg Chevrolet in St. Louis. "There are always people who want to buy. If you're aggressive enough, you can attract the buyer."
Earlier this week, Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said that early June sales could signal whether auto makers will be able to maintain robust production through September.
Domestically produced vehicles are those produced in North America regardless of whether the maker is foreign or domestic.
Sales by the Big Three auto makers were up 15.8 percent in early June, compared with a 12.5 percent gain for Japanese companies that build cars and trucks in North America.
 
Strong Chevrolet Model
 The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, sold 92,652 cars in early June, a 1.3 percent increase from last year. G.M.'s light-truck sales were 59,597, an increase of 25.6 percent. The Chevrolet Cavalier, whose price was reduced, was a hot seller, up 44.6 percent with sales of 10,576.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales rose 9.1 percent, to 56,123, while Ford's light-truck sales rose 21.8 percent, to 50,650.
The Chrysler Corporation does not report 10-day sales, but Ward's estimated that Chrysler's car sales were 25,100, up 50.5 percent, and light-truck sales were 39,800, up 28.2 percent.
The Honda Motor Company posted domestic car sales of 8,538, down 22.7 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation's domestic car sales rose 37.5 percent, to 10,473, while Toyota's light-truck sales more than doubled to 2,004. The Nissan Motor Company's car sales more than doubled to 5,389, while its light-truck sales rose 30.5 percent, to 3,214.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed in Ho-Hum Reaction to Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The release yesterday of consumer price figures for May confirmed for the stock market what it already knew: higher inflation is not currently a threat.
Trading was mixed, with blue-chip issues down and the broader market showing a little more strength than the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Traders said the release of data showing that consumer prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in May confirmed last week's report on producer prices showing little in the way of inflationary pressure. As a result, they said, the market shifted gears yesterday to look ahead to the triple-witching hour on Friday, when options on individual stocks, index options and futures all expire.
 
 
'The Standard Sell'
 "There was the standard sell on the news reaction to the C.P.I., as the market, in anticipation of a good report, had run up stocks a few days beforehand, buying on rumor," said Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst at MMS International, a Wall Street economic analysis and research firm. "So when the number was released yesterday, investors quickly sold. Then there was, of course, some selling related to the approaching triple witch on Friday."
The Dow fell 22.69 points, to 3,492, with 234.1 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up from 216.2 million on Monday. Gainers outnumbered losers by a very small margin.
The report on consumer prices lifted bond prices in the morning and helped support equities. But when the bond market rally faded, so did stocks.
The Nasdaq composite gained 0.93 point, to 697.34, and the American Stock Exchange index added 0.27 point, to 435.47. But the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 1.44 points to finish at 446.27 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.50 point, to 245.92.
Noting how the broader market had recently outperformed the Dow, Mr. Walberg predicted that the Dow would remain in a range of between 3,480 and 3,530 in the next few weeks.
 
 
Airlines Weak
 Airlines remained weak yesterday amid worries over the impact of proposed fuel tax. Airline stocks have been among the most skittish sectors of late, traders noted. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 1 1/8, to 130 3/4; Delta Air Lines dropped 5/8, to 51 3/8, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, lost 1/2, to 68.
Among big losers of the day that dragged down the Dow were I.B.M., which lost 2 1/8, to 49 7/8; Eastman Kodak, down 1 3/8, to 52 3/8, after announcing the spinoff of its chemical group, and Du Pont,which lost 1 3/4, to 49 3/4.
Shares of the International Business Machines Corporation fell on a Salomon Brothers report that more restructuring charges and a further dividend cut were likely. John B. Jones Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that I.B.M. could announce $4 billion to $5 billion in restructuring charges on July 27, the day its board meets to review the quarter dividend. Also, there is a good chance for a further cut in the dividend, Mr. Jones noted in his report. I.B.M. declined to comment.
Du Pont shares fell after a Goldman, Sachs analyst lowered the chemical company's rating. The analyst also lowered his estimates for 1993 and 1994 earnings.
National Semiconductor gained 1/2, to 15 3/4, after reporting stronger fourth-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share, compared with 22 cents for the quarter a year earlier.
Advanced Micro Devices, which is developing a new family of chips that do not use the contested Intel Corporation copyright, was up 3/8, to 21 3/4, in active trading. Intel, which won a recent battle in California state appeals court and is now pressing a copyright case seeking millions of dollars in damages from Advanced Mirco, rose 5/8, to 57 3/4.
Shares of Pepsico fell 5/8, to 35 5/8. The soft-drink maker said it had so far confirmed only four cases of syringes in Pepsi-Cola cans. The company said it was willing to order a recall but that it had been advised not to do so by the Food and Drug Administration because it might hamper the investigation.

HEADLINE: Despite Farm Pact, France Still Talks Tough on Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Despite recent indications that France was seeking to be more accommodating in international trade talks, its Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, said today that he could not accept an international trade agreement that would hurt the French economy.
Last week, France agreed to an agricultural agreement between Europe and the United States that reduced production of the European Community's oilseed crops. But Mr. Balladur said today that this did not mean that France would automatically acquiesce to calls for Europe to shrink the amount of subsidized grain it exports. 
 The reduction in Europe's production of oilseed crops, like soybeans, was negotiated in Washington last November during two days of talks between American and European Community representatives. France had threatened to veto the portion of the accord dealing with oilseed crops. But at a meeting of European foreign ministers in Luxembourg, France said it would go along with the deal.
 "I think it is important that our country should make a gesture concerning the agreement on oilseeds," Mr. Balladur told a few reporters in his hotel suite before his first meeting with President Clinton. "I did this deliberately because I consider that this was an agreement that did not harm the interest of the French economy."
But Mr. Balladur added: "I did this to indicate that my attitude is a very open one. But open does not mean that France should be capable of accepting an agreement that she would consider harmful to her interests."
Mr. Balladur's tough talk indicates that the Clinton Administration still faces a formidable task in gaining French agreement to a farm accord that would be part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As part of the negotiations on GATT, France is seeking a number of other concessions from the United States, including greater access to the American financial services market.
 Indeed, in what seemed to be part of Mr. Balladur's attempt to play hardball, he hinted today that while he preferred to see a GATT agreement concluded, the failure to reach an accord might not be so harmful to world economic growth.
"I'll tell really what I have in the back of my mind," he said through an interpreter. "When I read somewhere that one has to have an agreement because that would produce $200 billion a year of growth, no one really knows this; no one can prove that. I note the fact that in recent years -- five or six years ago -- we had a very good level of growth, whereas GATT was still under discussion."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Speculation About Cut in German Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar jumped nearly two pfennigs yesterday in a broad rally touched off by speculation that Germany's central bank would cut interest rates this week.
As waves of dollar-buying swept the New York market, the dollar bounced off record lows against the Japanese yen reached earlier during Asian trading, where global currency activity begins. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6460 marks, from 1.6285 marks late Monday. The dollar also rebounded to 105.75 yen, up from late Monday's 105.10 yen. In Tokyo trading earlier yesterday, the dollar had fallen as low as 104.85 yen.
 
 
Signal From the Bundesbank
 Many currency traders expect the Bundesbank to lower one of its shortest-term rates during its regular weekly money-market operations today in an effort to revive Germany's economy. A decrease would be taken as a signal that the central bank planned to lower another benchmark short-term rate during its biweekly policy-making meeting tomorrow.
That, in turn, would help the dollar, since lower German interest rates would make mark-denominated investments less attractive.
The speculation of a German rate cut overshadowed anxiety over a report that American inflation remained under control last month. The Labor Department report showed consumer prices edged up only one-tenth of 1 percent in May.
Ordinarily, a report of low American inflation would deflate expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher domestic rates would increase the dollar's value.
The dollar's rise also seemed tied to reports that the American merchandise-trade figures for April, due out tomorrow, would show a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with Japan.
That seemed to relieve some pressure for a stronger yen. In theory, a higher yen would help trim the American trade deficit by making Japanese products more expensive abroad while decreasing the cost of imports to Japan.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Show a Decline; Gold and Silver Up Sharply

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Concern over ample supplies of crude oil and oil products weighed on futures contracts yesterday, sending prices lower.
Gold and silver prices surged in what analysts described as a technical rebound from recent weakness. 
 Crude oil for July delivery dropped 31 cents, to $18.58 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. July unleaded gasoline fell 0.61 cent, to 53.93 cents a gallon, and July heating oil declined 0.45 cent, to 52 cents a gallon.
 Traders had expected that the weekly report of the American Petroleum Institute on domestic supplies, released after the close of trading, would prove negative to the market. But the report said gasoline was down by 1.04 million barrels, confounding expectations that inventories would rise, with refinery utilization remaining high.
Oil prices have been sliding since last week, when a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended with a nervous agreement that was rejected by Kuwait.
 
'Lack of Anything Bullish'
 "To blame all of this on OPEC isn't all of it," said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil, an energy trading company. "What's important now is that refinery runs are so high. With the lack of anything bullish out there, the market has no recourse but to go lower."
Trading at the five commodity exchanges in the World Trade Center in New York was halted twice in the morning for a total of about two hours because of technical problems.
 At the Commodity Exchange, the actively traded contract for August gold rose $4.20, to $370.80 an ounce, while July silver advanced 7 cents, to $4.288 an ounce.
"It appears to be all short-covering," said one analyst of the market's defiance of a strong dollar and fresh signs that inflation was in check. The Consumer Price Index for May rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: How Honda Slipped From Its Perch

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 15

 BODY:
Honda. For years the name struck fear and awe into the American auto industry.
But with a strong yen forcing up prices and with many Detroit models flourishing on the strength of improved quality and creative design, the Honda Motor Company is stumbling -- still profitable, but not the powerhouse it once was. 
 From 1989 through last December, for example, Honda's Accord was the best-selling car in the United States, and the company's smaller Civic and sporty Prelude also sold well. Honda was in the forefront of companies that were shifting production to the United States, reducing costs through efficient production techniques and exporting cars back to Japan. And Honda, with the Acura, was the first Japanese auto maker to bring luxury cars to America.
But now sales of most Honda models are tepid. Only months after the Accord was barely edged out by Ford's Taurus for honors as the best-selling car of 1992, sales of Accords have plunged almost 35 percent, and this year the car is not even in the top five.
Even worse for Honda, the company, once so canny, was caught flat-footed in the fast-growing markets for mini-vans and four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles, which many Americans now buy as a substitute for cars. Honda, alone among the large auto makers, offers no competition for Chrysler's successful mini-vans or Jeeps and their many competitors.
Few auto industry people believe Honda's wounds are mortal, and Honda itself says a wave of new designs will soon rekindle its growth and popularity. Indeed, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, has been exhorting staff members to set their sights high and surpass the much larger Nissan Motor Company as the No. 2 Japanese auto maker, after Toyota, by the end of the decade. That would require higher sales in the United States, Honda's largest market.
Indeed, Honda's decline has been so swift and unexpected that automotive rivals, particularly Detroit's Big Three, cannot quite figure why the tables have turned. Indeed, a stunned American auto industry is not quite willing to believe the sky has opened to drop a house on the wicked witch.
Honda "didn't get dumb overnight," said Arthur C. Liebler, vice president for public relations at the Chrysler Corporation, adding, "They will be back."
Like Honda, Nissan and the Toyota Motor Corporation have been hurt by the strong yen and the worldwide economic slump. The yen's value against the dollar has increased 15 percent in 1993 alone, forcing the Japanese to raise prices more sharply than overseas competitors to maintain profit margins. Last week, six of Japan's nine big auto makers reported their earnings for the last fiscal year, and collectively they were down 76 percent.
But the strong yen does not fully explain the problems at Honda, which was the only major Japanese auto maker with declining sales in the United States in 1992. That forced Honda to cut back production at its plants in Marysville, Ohio, and in Japan. And this year has been no better. In May, for instance, Honda's sales were flat, while Toyota sold 12 percent more cars and 15 percent more light trucks than in May 1992. Nissan sold 24 percent more cars and 48 percent more trucks.
Theories abound about why Honda is stumbling, but no one questions the quality of its cars. Rather, many people in the automotive industry say, Honda has had more difficulty than most auto makers in keeping up with changing tastes and demographics.
"The other models are just getting better, and the service at other dealerships is getting better, too," said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Inc., an automotive marketing company in Santa Ana, Calif.
 
 
Early Emphasis on Value
 In Honda's early days in the American market -- the mid-1970's -- the marketing message focused on value, emphasizing practicality and a low price, said Leon Mandel, editor of Auto Week magazine. Many of Honda's first buyers were young, and they bucked the conventional wisdom that Detroit's cars were best.
Initially, Honda's pricing reflected the low cost of efficient manufacturing and the yen's weakness. The dollar was worth 242 yen before the Plaza Accord was reached in 1985, under which the United States and its allies reduced the dollar's value, hoping to increase American exports and ease the nation's trade deficit. Now the dollar has sunk to about 106 yen, so a dollar has less than half the buying power it used to have for Japanese goods.
By moving some manufacturing to the United States, Honda avoided some currency-related cost increases. Still the base price of its four-door Civic, $8,175 in 1985, had risen to $11,280 in 1993.
In 1990, an Accord sold for less than $16,000, less than the American cars with which it competed; today it sells for nearly $19,000, more than its Big Three rivals. While Honda has never resorted to steep discounting, it is now offering a $239-a-month lease on the Accord, a subsidized rate roughly equivalent to a $1,100 rebate.
Honda has nearly 16,000 employees in the United States, and dealers in every state. Unlike other auto makers, Honda also sells motorcycles -- more than any other company in the United States -- lawn mowers and generators. But more than 80 percent of Honda's business remains in car sales.
Indeed, the popularity of Hondas in their heyday may have set the stage for questionable practices, now the subject of a criminal investigation. In the last year, some Honda dealers have accused some of Honda's American sales and marketing executives of accepting bribes and kickbacks as payment for diverting extra cars to them. Several executives have resigned.
As Honda grew in the United States, its perspective changed from niche marketer to mass marketer, said John Wolkonowicz, an analyst for Arthur D. Little Inc., the consulting company in Boston.
"Honda started looking at who its customers were and saw my 65-year-old uncle and an 18-year-old college girl and everyone in between," he said.
But this larger audience seems to have brought more conservative judgments. New models were designed to satisfy several demographic groups, insuring that they would excite none of them, Mr. Wolkonowicz said. "The best example of this is the Accord," he said. "It is one bland machine. It does everything well, but it doesn't excite."
 
 
Civic Sales Are Up
 One bright light for Honda has been the Civic, which was redesigned for 1992; its sales have increased 30 percent this year. Accord sales, meanwhile, are down about the same amount. On the other hand, sales of the redesigned Prelude, Honda's two-door sports coupe, have fallen by more than 30 percent this year.
As a relatively small auto maker, Honda has far less capital than some rivals and has always expanded its line very deliberately. As a result, in an extraordinary gaffe, it missed out on the booming market for mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, which now account for more than 37 percent of all sales of cars and trucks. Many satisfied owners of Accords or Civics undoubtedly traded for Chrysler mini-vans as their families grew and they needed a vehicle that could haul half of a Little League team.
"We still have a problem with too little plant capacity," said Jeff Leestma, a spokesman for the American Honda Motor Company, the United States sales subsidiary. "People see us as this huge company, but we don't have the physical ability to be a full-line manufacturer."
 
 
At Last, a Utility Vehicle
 Next year, Honda will finally bring out a sport-utility vehicle, a version of the Isuzu Rodeo that Isuzu will build. A mini-van, which Honda will build itself, is rumored to be in the works as well. Honda executives declined to discuss their plans.
Even when Honda broadened its line, adding the Accord station wagon in late 1990, the company stumbled. Honda's stab at a multipurpose vehicle has not impressed car buyers, and at nearly $20,000 it was pricey and remains so compared with its competition.
"The wagon was worth our while," Mr. Leestma insisted. "It has become popular in export markets." In two years on the American market, Honda has sold about 40,000 Accord station wagons.
In luxury cars, Honda actually led the Japanese into the American market. The Acura division, opened in 1986, won high marks, and the Legend and the smaller Integra put a big dent in a segment that BMW and Mercedes-Benz had starred in. But sales have been sliding since 1991, damaged principally by Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti.
 
 
Rapid Price Increases
 The Integra, to be replaced by a new version in a few months, was built for customers in the 20-something age group, the so-called baby-busters. But now, "busters don't have the money for the Integra," which costs about $19,000 typically equipped, said Bob Hall, a product planner for the Mazda Motor Corporation in Irvine, Calif. The Integra's price has gone up faster than the baby-busters' incomes.
Acura's larger Legend was aimed squarely at somewhat older, affluent baby-boomers. But many customers came to prefer an even bigger, more powerful luxury car. The introduction of the Infiniti Q45 and the Lexus LS 400 gave them a choice, said William Jeanes, senior vice president in charge of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines Inc.'s automotive group. "You could say Acura should have built a bigger car," he said. "But Honda is quite a small company and can't do everything."
For the fall, Honda plans a new Acura Integra, then a substantially redesigned Accord, its first since the 1990 model year. It is unclear whether Honda will take a conservative approach, with only incremental improvements over the current model, or whether it will make a bold departure. Toyota, for instance, redesigned its Camry with a more expressive look, and it offers a choice of engines. Will the Accord follow suit or will it stay with a four-cylinder engine while rivals offer six? Will Honda's styling remain muted rather than bold?
"Maybe success breeds conservatism," Mr. Jeanes said. "That's the way it was with Americans."
Perhaps. Detroit's auto executives, whose companies lost billions during downturns, are not betting against Honda, noting that even in its slump, the company remained profitable. Though worldwide revenue declined 6 percent, to $35.5 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, and Honda's profit declined 41 percent, the result was still a profit of $329 million.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
No-Smoke Ways to 'Burn' Wastes

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Everybody agrees that toxic wastes are nasty. But getting rid of them has become increasingly difficult as environmentalists and regulators have recognized the danger of stashing pesticide residues, chemical industry leftovers and paint sludges in landfills, where the toxins can seep into public water supplies.
Unfortunately, one of the few alternatives to dumping, the incinerator, also has a flaw: the smokestack. As waste is burned, hot gases spew into the atmosphere, carrying with them any toxic materials not consumed by the flames. The Clinton Administration recently imposed a ban on new hazardous-waste incinerators. 
 And so developers see commercial opportunities for two distinctly different technologies that are now emerging from the laboratory and moving to pilot plants.
Both approaches eliminate toxic wastes by exposing them to intense heat in closed vessels, breaking the materials down into simple, safe compounds with virtually no emissions. One method effectively "burns" them in water; the other uses a bath of molten metal to reduce complex chemicals to their elemental constituents.
The first technique depends on the phenomenon of "supercritical" water. When water is heated to more than 705 degrees Fahrenheit and compressed to 3,200 pounds a square inch, it ceases to act like a liquid or a gas, and its physical properties change in other striking ways.
Oily substances, which do not mix with water at ordinary temperatures and pressures, are easily soluble in supercritical water. And salts, which do dissolve in ordinary water, are separated out in supercritical water.
These characteristics of supercritical water have led researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and at some private companies to develop disposal systems in which water, waste and a source of excess oxygen are placed in a big pressure cooker. Once the water reaches the supercritical phase, the waste molecules break down to their constituent atoms. These atoms then combine with the excess oxygen, which may come from injecting gaseous oxygen or liquid hydrogen peroxide. This is the equivalent of burning, but without the flame or smoke.
 
Test Projects Under Way
 Companies at work on such systems include the General Atomics Corporation of San Diego; Eco Waste Technologies of Austin, and the Modell Development Corporation of Framingham, Mass. Supercritical water oxidation is undergoing commercial testing in three or four locations, and the Departments of Defense, Commerce and Energy are sponsoring nearly a dozen projects.
The economics of supercritical water oxidation are such that it works best with wastes that are watery to start with, like sludge from municipal sewage plants, wastes from pulp and paper mills, and the remnants of pharmaceutical and food processing. The technique produces clear water, carbon dioxide and an ash that can be disposed of in a landfill.
Since this "burning" of carbon-based compounds releases heat, the process can be self-sustaining after the initial heating, as new toxic "fuel" is gradually added while the waste products are drawn off or filtered out. And because the combustion takes place in a fluid, there are no air pollutants like oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur or particulate emissions, all three of which are byproducts of incinerators.
 
Variety of Uses
 Supercritical water can be used to treat a broad variety of nonorganic wastes as well, including chlorinated hydrocarbons like PCB's, which come from old electrical transformers and are difficult to dispose of, as well as old solid rocket propellants and nerve gas that has been stashed in Government warehouses since the chilliest days of the cold war.
These more complicated wastes present more problems, because elements like chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus form highly corrosive acids that attack virtually any alloy used in the walls of reactor vessels. The acids can be neutralized by adding a base, like sodium hydroxide, but this does not completely solve the problem, because the resulting salts are sticky and tend to gum up the system.
Nevertheless, agencies of the Defense Department are intent on perfecting supercritical water oxidation to clean up cold war remnants like the five million rounds of chemical warfare ammunition that is slowly corroding in military warehouses.
While some corporate scientists experiment with the watery demise of toxic waste, others are busily adapting an approach, first developed at United States Steel in the early 1980's, that destroys wastes by injecting them into a bath of molten metal, usually iron. The technology was inspired by the steelmaker's desire to lower energy costs by using waste items, like scrap tires, as fuel.
Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass., has come up with a system for injecting toxic materials into a pool of molten iron at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Such treatment causes almost all compounds to break down into their constituent elements because of the intense heat and the catalytic effect of the metal. Hydrocarbons are rendered into hydrogen, which bubbles off the top of the bath, and carbon, which similarly boils off as carbon dioxide gas if oxygen is provided.
As in supercritical water oxidation, the process occurs in a closed system, with minimal releases to the atmosphere.
The company touts the process as recycling, and indeed some materials, like the gases, can be separated and recovered. Vastly more important is the regulatory reality that once substances are labeled as waste, a company is liable for them forever. If the materials can be broken down and the constituents re-used, however, nothing remains that could become a liability in the future.
If the metal bath is installed in a plant as part of a manufacturer's production system, the material going into it, no matter how toxic, stands a good chance of being considered a "process intermediate" that will be rendered harmless before it leaves the factory. Thus no waste needs to be reported to regulators and a company's environmental liability is reduced.
The process has some limitations. Because of the prohibitive energy costs of keeping the metal molten, the process cannot handle wastes with a high concentration of water, which would act as a coolant. That would seem to leave that part of the market to supercritical water.
And at this point, the company cannot separate out metals while the process is in operation, so it has to market the result as an alloy or treat the alloy in a separate process to recover valuable materials. If a company with a lot of printed circuit boards wanted to run them through the bath to recover the small quantities of gold and silver in each board, for example, the process would require two steps.
 
Mining an Alloy
 "If you operate the technology properly, you could get all the gold to accumulate until you had a gold-rich alloy," said Ian C. Yates, Molten Metal's vice president for market development. Then the furnace could be taken out of operation and the gold leached out of the alloy using mining techniques.
Mr. Yates said a top research goal was to find ways of separating metals out while the bath was still in operation by adding chemicals that would combine with them and have them precipitate out of solution.
Molten Metal has built a small commercial-scale plant in Fall River, Mass., which is capable of processing up to two tons of waste an hour, and it anticipates testing waste for such potential customers as the Du Pont Company later this year.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 15

 BODY:
Champagne may be the drink of celebration, but the people who make it have little to celebrate these days. Battered by rising costs, a depressed market and growing competition from cheaper sparkling wines, Champagne sales have been slipping steadily for several years. Three events in France last week served to underscore the extent of the problem:
* In case they were unaware of its gravity, shareholders of the parent company of the biggest Champagne producer, Moet & Chandon, were told on Thursday that Champagne was in the midst of an "unprecedented crisis" that was not about to disappear soon. The grim news came from Bernard Arnault, the president of Moet's parent company, the luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton. "We're not deluding ourselves," Mr. Arnault said at the LVMH annual meeting. "This is going to last several years." 
 * The previous day, 21 major Champagne producers, including Moet & Chandon, announced that they would join with some 700 restaurants throughout France to cut Champagne prices in those restaurants by as much as 25 percent. Restaurant sales of Champagne have been particularly hard hit because of high prices. Here in Paris, few restaurants offer Champagne for less than 300 francs, or about $55. In a wine shop, prices for a good name-brand Champagne begin at about $25.
* Earlier in the week, the industry said it was being assaulted from another quarter and that it was about to embark on what could be a costly venture, yet another defense of one of its most valuable assets, the name of its product. Roland Chaillon, the director of the Champagne producers organization, said his group was taking Yves Saint Laurent to court for misappropriating the name Champagne for a new perfume.
At the Moet meeting, Mr. Arnault told the stockholders "we believe in the future of Champagne," but noted that shipments of Moet & Chandon fell from 24.6 million bottles in 1990 to 19.4 million in 1992. He noted that the drop in consumption came at a time when the industry had raised prices because of the high cost of grapes in 1989 and 1990. In 1992, Moet & Chandon held 19 percent of the world Champagne market, down from 21 percent two years earlier.
Blaming the recession, Moet & Chandon said it would dismiss 245 employees over the next 18 months at its cellars in Epernay. Pommery, another Champagne house in the LVMH group, will dismiss 89 in Rheims. Yesterday, about 500 LVMH Champagne workers demonstrated against the layoffs outside LVMH's headquarters in Paris. There are seven Champagne concerns in the LVMH group.
Shipments of Champagne to the United States continued a six-year decline in 1992. Last year, the total was 10 million cases, down from 10.2 million in 1991 and from 15.8 million cases in 1987.
The restaurant price cuts here in France are scheduled to begin on Saturday and last until Dec. 31. "We are adapting to the situation," said Jean-Claude Rouzaud, the managing director of Louis Roederer Champagne. "We want to show consumers that our product is not only for celebrating but can also help avoid gloominess."
Under the agreement, the Champagne houses will offer their wines to some 700 restaurants at price reductions of up to 25 percent, so long as the restaurateurs agree to pass the savings on to their customers. The promotion is the result of a survey taken by the Champagne industry that indicated the French are drinking less Champagne in restaurants.
If the promotion is a success, it will be extended to all French restaurants, which account for about a quarter of all Champagne sales, Mr. Rouzaud said. The Champagne houses participating in the promotion include the seven in the LVMH group, Charles Heidsieck, Bollinger, Laurent-Perrier, Mumm and Taittinger.
Champagne, the perfume, is scheduled to be introduced in Europe in September by Yves Saint Laurent in a bottle shaped like a Champagne cork. But not if Champagne, the drink, has anything to say about it. "We are going to take them to court," said Philippe le Tixerant, a spokesman for the Champagne Bureau. Yves Saint Laurent said it bought the rights to the name from a perfume maker, Caron, which introduced a perfume called Bain de Champagne (Champagne Bath) in 1942.
The French cigarette monopoly, Seita, marketed a cigarette called Champagne in 1984, but a French court ordered it to stop and to pay damages to the Champagne growers.
The Champagne industry spends more than $3.5 million a year defending the exclusivity of its name, Mr. Chaillon said, with middling success. The Champagne growers insist that under French law only sparkling white wines from the Champagne region can be called Champagne. They have fought successful actions in Australia, Germany, Spain and Italy to ban local appropriation of the name Champagne for their sparkling wines. Under European Community regulations, even the term "methode champenoise," denoting that the wine was made by the process used in the Champagne region, will be banned.
One place the restrictions have not worked is in the United States, where any sparkling wine can choose to call itself champagne, although fewer and fewer producers actually do.
Since May, Yves Saint Laurent has been a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the petroleum and energy conglomerate, France's biggest company.
Mr. Chaillon said Yves Saint Laurent had offered to pay royalties on sales of the new perfume but that the growers had refused. The Champagne Bureau has asked the Minister of Industry, Gerard Longuet, to intervene on the industry's behalf, Mr. Chaillon said. The Ministry declined to comment on the matter.
 
TASTINGS
Chateau d'Armailhac 1989 (Pauillac). About $20.
 
Vinexpo, a wine trade fair held every two years, will begin on Sunday in Bordeaux, and a highlight of this weeklong event will be a dinner at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild on Monday night. You can be there in spirit if not in person by opening a bottle, not of Mouton, but from one of the other two chateaus that make up the Mouton complex in Pauillac. Mouton-Rothschild is the star; then come Chateau d'Armailhac and Clerc-Milon-Rothschild. D'Armailhac started out as d'Armailhacq. When Baron Philippe de Rothschild bought it in 1933, it became Mouton-Baron-Philippe. After the Baron's death in 1988, his daughter, Baroness Philippine de Rothschild, brought back the original name, minus the q. The 1989 vintage has none of the power of Mouton, but it is much less expensive ($20 compared to about $100). It is a rich, dense, intensely flavored wine that speaks well of its illustrious ancestry.

HEADLINE: In City Budget Package, a Modest Arts Increase

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The city's cultural institutions, their finances hurt by the recession, have received a modest but significant lift from the budget package worked out last weekend between the Mayor and the City Council.
Under the agreement between Mayor David N. Dinkins and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, the funds budgeted for cultural programs and other noncapital expenses were increased by $9 million, bringing the total to $89 million for the fiscal year starting next month. 
 Although the culture budget is just a fraction of the total city budget of $31.2 billion, its importance is always disproportionately greater than its actual amount. Not only are the heads of the city's arts institutions outspoken and articulate in expressing gratitude and grievances, but the institutions themselves are widely recognized to be magnets for tourist dollars. Accordingly, the Mayor and the Speaker were eager to make up for the 24 percent reduction that cultural institutions sustained during fiscal year 1992.
Mr. Vallone said yesterday: "The final budget shows the Council believes cultural institutions are an essential, if not the essential, element to life in New York. And so naturally we supported them."
 
The Big Winners
 Among the big winners is the New-York Historical Society, which will receive the $6.3 million commitment it sought from the city to match a similar state contribution. With these funds available, the historical society, which had a close brush with bankruptcy last winter, can proceed with its financial bail-out plan.
Other major institutions that fared well are Lincoln Center, which received $800,000 over its basic grant for the maintenance of its public plazas, and the Brooklyn Museum, which was given $67,000 over its basic financing of $350,000 for the operation of its new wing.
Though there was often tense and bitter bargaining between the Mayor's office and the Council, in the end the cultural money was distributed according to the same formula used in recent years. Under that formula, some 85 percent of the city's arts funds go to members of the Cultural Institutions Group: 31 major arts institutions that occupy city-owned real estate and include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the New York Shakespeare Festival. About 15 percent went to the 419 other recipient arts groups in the city.
Among the recipients in the Cultural Institutions Group are the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which will receive a total of $200,000; the Studio Museum in Harlem, which will receive $150,000, and the American Museum of the Moving Image, which will receive $100,000.
The final budget amounted to a rejection of many proposals by Luis R. Cancel, Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs. Mr. Cancel had submitted to the Mayor a plan that departed from the traditional formula. Under Mr. Cancel's plan, only 13 of the 31 members of the Cultural Institutions Group, most of them smaller institutions like the Bronx Museum and El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan, received increases. Those that did not included City Center and the American Museum of Natural History.
When he first submitted his budget proposals several weeks ago, Mr. Cancel explained that he had been forced to scrap the old formula because there was so little money to go around. If the funds available were spread across the board, he argued, it would be impossible to meet critical needs of certain institutions, like aid to the Brooklyn Museum for the operation of its new wing.
 
Politics Charged and Denied
 But cultural administrators and members of the City Council criticized Mr. Cancel's list of special benefactors. Some viewed his proposals as a means of winning good will for Mayor Dinkins and himself by handing out bonuses to politically useful institutions at the expense of others.
Yesterday, Mr. Cancel said that political considerations had "never at all entered the decisions." Mayor Dinkins agreed, and expressed his support for Mr. Cancel.
Under the final agreement, the City Council also cut $150,000 from a half-million-dollar project in which Mr. Cancel had invested much personal prestige: a voucher program under which seventh-grade school children would be given "passports" to attend cultural events of their choice. Council members said they objected to adding a new program, with uncertain administrative costs, at a time when many proven programs were in jeopardy.
Mr. Cancel's voucher program survived as well as it did, staff members of the City Council said, because the commissioner was willing to sacrifice his department's $100,000 emergency fund. This fund was the source drawn upon earlier this year to help keep the New-York Historical Society open until other financing could be arranged.

HEADLINE: Budgeting for Re-election

 BODY:
New York City officials finally came to terms on a budget for the new fiscal year in the wee hours of Sunday morning -- as if pressed by a deadline. The deadline was still more than two weeks away, but perhaps they hoped the dark of night might conceal what they were up to.
State law requires that the city balance its budget each year. So Mayor David Dinkins and the City Council declared it balanced. But no one should be surprised if they have to cut more spending to reach that balance as the year unfolds -- say, sometime after Nov. 2, when both the mayoral and Council elections are safely past. 
 The Mayor and Council know perfectly well that cutting later probably means cutting deeper. If, say, $12 million must be saved in the course of a year, it is less painful to spread the cuts over the 12 months, beginning July 1, rather than waiting until Jan. 1 and cutting the full amount in six months. But the political pain of cuts before Election Day is something else, and so the budget negotiators chose to pray for fiscal miracles. For instance, they financed day care and transportation for AIDS patients for six months; what happens then?
The holes in this budget are so obvious that the new State Comptroller, Carl McCall, said the plan "will obviously not get us through next year, and makes the gaps for future years grow wider and even more difficult." Those unminced words came from a Democrat and Dinkins ally.
Budget specialists fault the city for counting on one-shot revenues and revenues that are unlikely to arrive at all, and for relying too heavily on one-year spending cuts while failing to tackle basic reform of the city's misaligned tax structure.
On the revenue side, one big item is both uncertain and reckless. The city wants to "sell" $200 million of delinquent property tax collections to a bank. In effect, that is borrowing on future revenues to cover current expenses. That's the reckless part. The "sale" can't happen unless Albany approves; that's the uncertain part. If Albany cares for the city's fiscal soundness, it won't happen.
True, the Mayor has no control over some of the factors that have worsened New York's problems -- the inadequacy of state aid for city schools, the state's failure to absorb Medicaid costs and the economy's continued weakness. But political administrators have to make do. As of now, they're not.

HEADLINE: Trade Sanity With Japan

 BODY:
In trade talks last week with Japan, the Clinton Administration turned from bullying to constructive negotiating. Instead of repeating threats to punish Japan for behavior the U.S. unilaterally decides is wrong -- a tactic designed to curry favor with protectionists in the Democratic Party -- the Administration set out reasonable ways to help U.S. exporters without risking a trade war.
Yet the old threats haven't been disowned, which makes U.S. policy appear contradictory. The Administration's overheated rhetoric risks creating unrealistic expectations that could make the modest gains of reasonable policy look like a retreat. 
 The prominence the Administration has given to trade talks with Japan reflects two beliefs: that trade deficits with that nation harm the U.S. economy and that negotiations can solve the problem. Neither belief carries much weight.
Longstanding trade deficits reflect insufficient saving. Americans buy more goods than they produce, importing the balance. The Japanese do the opposite: produce more than they buy, exporting what's left over. The U.S. trade deficit won't fall -- regardless of what Mickey Kantor negotiates with the Japanese -- until Americans save more.
That's why the strategy of "managed trade" proposed by some in the Administration won't work. Under managed trade, Washington would set numerical targets for Japanese imports of designated U.S. goods like supercomputers, telecommunications equipment and automobile parts -- and retaliate if they aren't met.
But if the Japanese are forced to import more designated goods, they will -- given their unchanged savings rate -- compensate by exporting more or importing fewer non-designated goods (some of which would otherwise have come from the U.S.). Besides, the Japanese Government can't control how much its citizens import unless it replaces markets with Government-run cartels -- a peculiar demand for the U.S. to make.
What's at stake when the U.S. negotiates higher import levels of U.S. supercomputers and telecommunications equipment is the well-being of Motorola and the Cray Computer Corporation -- not the overall trade balance of the U.S.
For now, President Clinton has backed away from threats of automatic retaliation. Numerical targets would simply serve as indicators to identify markets in which Japan unfairly blocks imports and where U.S. pressure ought to be applied. There are encouraging precedents for this strategy: After Japan, at U.S. insistence, changed its laws restricting large-scale retailers, the way was cleared for Toys "R" Us to open up six stores within a year.
The Administration also plans to pressure the Japanese Government to cut down the temporary bulge in the trade deficit by stimulating Japan's sluggish economy. And the Administration is claiming it won't shut out Japanese imports. These are sensible policies, adopted previously by President Bush.
Trade hawks in the Democratic Party will try to hold President Clinton to his promise to make cutting the trade deficit with Japan one of his highest priorities. So far, at least, Mr. Clinton is proceeding to fulfill his misguided promise in a responsible manner.

HEADLINE: John Connally of Texas, a Power In 2 Political Parties, Dies at 76

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
John B. Connally, the former Governor of Texas who served in two Presidential Administrations and who was wounded when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, died yesterday at Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 76.
The cause was complications of pulmonary fibrosis, said a hospital spokeswoman, Blythe Schaffer. Mr. Connally had been admitted to the hospital May 17 with breathing problems. 
 Early in his political career, Mr. Connally was a protege of Lyndon B. Johnson and served as Secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy Administration as well as Secretary of the Treasury under President Richard M. Nixon. After switching from the Democratic to the Republican Party in the 1970's, he was regarded for a time as a serious contender for the Presidency.
 
Tumultuous Public Life
 Mr. Connally's public life was nothing short of tumultuous. On Nov. 22, 1963, while serving his first term as Governor, Mr. Connally was riding in Kennedy's open-topped limousine through the streets of Dallas and was wounded when Kennedy was shot and killed. A bullet passed through his body, leaving Mr. Connally with scars on his back, chest, wrist and thigh. Later, he would recall drifting in and out of consciousness for four days. He said the first sustained consciousness he had was of watching television coverage of Kennedy's body being carried to Arlington National Cemetery.
Mr. Connally also said he thought that the shot that killed the President had been meant for him. He said this was because the accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, had written a letter asking Mr. Connally, as Navy Secretary, to upgrade his undesirable discharge from the Marines, and that no action had been taken on the request.
Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic national chairman, who was one of Mr. Connally's oldest friends, described him last night as "one of the ablest men I ever knew, a man who had an uncanny ability to forget the transitory stuff and retain all the vital information in his head, year after year."
"He was a pioneer," Mr. Strauss said. "He was a different kind of governor than Texas had ever had. He spent a lot of money on mental health and education and other things that were verboten at the time. One time he even put a liberal rabbi on the Board of Regents at the University of Texas, with all those businessmen.
"But after the assassination, he moved right and kind of lost his way."
In his 1989 book "Nixon: The Triumph of a Politician," Stephen E. Ambrose wrote that Mr. Nixon's "admiration for Connally grew to the point of adulation after Mr. Connally advised him to go ahead with the bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong." By 1972, Mr. Nixon says in his memoirs, he believed that Mr. Connally "was the only man in either party who clearly had the potential to be a great President."
Mr. Nixon discussed with several of his aides the possibility of putting Mr. Connally on the Republican ticket that year instead of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. But they demurred, arguing that dumping Mr. Agnew would anger Republican conservatives, and Mr. Nixon gave in.
Part of Mr. Connally's success as a politician derived from his impressive appearance. In 1970, after he was named Treasury Secretary, he was described in an article in The New York Times: "Mr. Connally is tall, gray-haired, handsome, personable and articulate, and his manners and bearing recall those of President Johnson. Yet he is suave and has a touch of the Eastern establishment."
 
 
Born Into Poverty
 John Bowden Connally Jr. was born in Floresville, Tex., on Feb. 27, 1917, one of seven children born to John Bowden Connally and the former Lela Wright. His father had been a cowboy, a barber and a grocer before turning to dairy farming and finally tenant farming. The family's circumstances were always quite modest; there often were debts and struggles to pay them.
The younger John Connally attended public schools in Harlandale, where his family lived, and in nearby San Antonio. He then went to the University of Texas, where he received a bachelor's degree and then a law degree.
In college he was interested in campus politics, oratory and acting, and was elected president of the Students Association. He also developed a desire to amass land and money, and never return to the poverty he knew as a boy.
Mr. Connally met Lyndon Johnson when he was a young Congressman from Texas in the late 1930's, and was a campaign worker for him..

 In World War II Mr. Connally served as a Navy officer, first as a legal assistant to James V. Forrestal, who was then Secretary of the Navy, and later in North Africa on the staff of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was planning the Allied invasion of Italy. Still later, reassigned to the Pacific, Mr. Connally won the Bronze Star for valor.
After the war he worked again in Johnson's Congressional campaigns, and managed his successful campaign for the United States Senate in 1948. During this period Mr. Connally also practiced law, first in Austin, Tex., and later in Fort Worth.
In 1952 he bolted the Democratic Party to help Eisenhower win the Presidency at the behest of Mr. Connally's client, Sid W. Richardson, a wealthy oil executive.
His defection did not bother Johnson, who valued Mr. Connally's aggressiveness and skills and continued to rely on them as he steadily gained power in the Senate.
They were effectively used again in 1956, when Mr. Connally helped his mentor wrest control of the Democratic Party in Texas from Gov. Allen Shivers. Johnson was grateful, but later reportedly told his Under Secretary of State, George W. Ball, that Mr. Connally could "leave more dead bodies in the field with less remorse than any politician I ever knew."
 
A Lucrative Association
 In the early 1950's Mr. Connally had become a lawyer for Mr. Richardson, who ultimately put him in charge of running his business ventures in Texas and Jamaica. The association proved most lucrative to Mr. Connally, who eventually became one of the executors of Mr. Richardson's estate.
In 1960 Mr. Connally managed Johnson's unsuccessful campaign to wrest the Democratic Presidential nomination from Kennedy and worked for the Democratic ticket after Kennedy chose Johnson as his running mate.
Mr. Connally was instrumental in the ticket's carrying Texas, the key to the Democratic victory, and Johnson gave him much of the credit for the narrow defeat of Mr. Nixon and his running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. In a letter to Mr. Connally, the Vice President-elect said, "Except for you, I know the outcome would have been different."
As a condition of accepting the Vice-Presidential nomination, Johnson was given control of appointments to the Kennedy Administration from Texas, and Mr. Connally was thus assured of an important post.
He became Kennedy's Secretary of the Navy in January 1961, but resigned the post in less than a year to make a successful run for governor of Texas, a job he held from 1963 to 1969. At the time of the assassination, Kennedy was visiting Texas in the hopes of mending some political fences, and Mr. Connally, as Governor, was accompanying him. Governor Connally had a reputation as a big spender, focusing on the improvement of higher education and establishing the state as a magnet for development during his three two-year terms.
 
Conservative Connections
 Mr. Connally was in the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, and in 1969 Mr. Nixon, who liked Mr. Connally's politics, asked him to serve on an advisory commission to reorganize the executive branch.
Mr. Nixon was so impressed with Mr. Connally that he named him Secretary of the Treasury in 1971. As Secretary until 1972, Mr. Connally was largely responsible for the Federal guarantee of some $250 million in loans to the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, then the nation's largest major military contractor but near collapse because of major cutbacks in military spending and other setbacks in its civilian projects.
It was during his tenure, in August 1971, that the United States went off the gold standard, which had the effect of inaugurating the era of floating currencies and devaluing the dollar. The Adminstration also imposed wage and price controls in an effort to control inflation.
"We are at the end of an era in our economic policy," Mr. Connally declared in an interview that month, defending the moves. "American business and labor may have to get used to the idea of living within certain parameters."
Mr. Connally gave the President some advice on matters not related to money. According to "The Lone Star," a biography of Mr. Connally written by James Reston Jr. and published by Edward Burlingame Book/Harper & Row in 1990, Mr. Connally urged Mr. Nixon to consider the use of nuclear weapons to win the Vietnam War.
In May 1973, three months after Johnson's death, Mr. Connally officially became a Republican. He said that party was his "true philosophical home" because it "it best expressed the broad view of most Americans, whatever their party affiliation."
 
Special Adviser to Nixon
 In 1973, as Mr. Nixon became more deeply embroiled in the Watergate scandal, he turned to Mr. Connally for help and named him a special adviser, a job that he held for 69 days before quitting. Mr. Reston says in "The Lone Star" that Mr. Connally resigned because Mr. Nixon picked the House minority leader, Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, as Vice President to replace Mr. Agnew, who resigned on Oct. 10, 1973, after pleading no contest to a charge of tax evasion stemming from kickback payments he had received as Governor of Maryland.
Months later, with Mr. Connally out of public office, Mr. Ford was sworn in as President after Mr. Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment over the Watergate scandal.
In 1974 Mr. Connally was indicted by a Federal grand jury on charges of perjury and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Prosecutors said he had taken $10,000 from the American Milk Producers Inc. after persuading Mr. Nixon to back a controversial increase in price supports for milk in 1971. Mr. Connally was exonerated by a Federal jury in Washington in 1975.
But Mr. Connally continued to be active in politics even after this incident. In the late 1970's he unsuccessfully opposed Ronald Reagan's drive to control the Republican Party, and in 1980 he made a costly but losing campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.
After that, he abandoned whatever aspirations he had for public office and concentrated on making money, which led to a partnership with former Lieut. Gov. Ben Barnes of Texas.
But in 1988 Mr. Connally declared bankruptcy, placing the blame for his $93 million personal debt mostly on bad real estate, oil and gas investments he made in Texas as the state's economy began to worsen. He was forced to sell most of his 2,674-acre ranch near Floresville, along with his horses, Chippendale and Louis XIV furniture, fine china, rifle collection and ceremonial saddles inlaid with his initials in gold.
Left with his ranch house and a mere 200 acres, Mr. Connally said, "I know what it is to be poor." To the surprise of nobody who knew him, he emerged from bankruptcy within a year.
His survivors include his wife of 52 years, the former Idanell Brill; two sons, John 3d of Houston and Mark M. of Austin; a daughter, Sharon C. Ammann of Austin; four brothers, two sisters, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 17, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of John B. Connally incorrectly described a picture of him and President John F. Kennedy. The car in which the two men were sitting was not the limousine in which Kennedy was assassinated, but a smaller car they used earlier that day. The caption also misstated Mr. Connally's location in the later motorcade. He sat in a jump seat between the front and rear seats of the limousine, not in its front seat.

Mr. Connally, who later in the motorcade moved to the front seat of the car, was also shot in the attack; Mr. Connally said he thought the attack on the President was meant for him. His belief was based on a letter written to him when he was Secretary of the Navy by Lee Harvey Oswald, who requested that his undesirable discharge from the Marines be upgraded. The request was not acted upon. (Associated Press) (pg. D25)

HEADLINE: A 25 1/2-Hour German Epic of Discovery and Art

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The statistics are daunting. The German director Edgar Reitz's 25 1/2-hour epic film, "Heimat II: Chronicle of a Generation," has 2,143 pages of script and consumed more than a million feet of exposed film. It took six years to write, 557 days to shoot and 117 days to edit. The cast includes 71 leading roles, 310 smaller ones and 2,300 extras.
 The product of this prodigious teamwork is an alternately gripping and lyrical 13-episode serial about German life in the 1960's that is being shown in roughly four-hour installments at the Joseph Papp Public Theater through July 29. Handsomely photographed and superbly acted, with English subtitles and a remarkably evocative soundtrack, it might be the ultimate highbrow soap opera for couch potatoes except that there are no plans to show "Heimat II" on television in the United States. 
 The director has emphasized that the 1992 film is not a sequel to his 15-hour film "Heimat," which told the history of a fictitious German village over 63 years. That film made it to television (on the Bravo cable service and then on Channel 13) and ran at the Public Theater in 1986. 
 "Heimat II," which is set mostly in Munich, follows 10 years in the lives of a circle of musicians and film makers who come of age at the height of Germany's "economic miracle." Although it begins in 1960, just 15 years after World War II, the war might as well as have been over for 50 years for all the attention it is paid, at least at the start of the series. All that matters is the future. The musicians are intoxicated with modernism, the film makers inspired by the take-to-the-streets esthetic of the French New Wave. 
 If these young Turks of the arts are openly derisive of those whom they believe to have been Nazis, their contempt is expressed more as social snobbery than as a deep moral revulsion. Most have left their families to make their way in a largely reconstructed city in a fresh new decade. They shrug off such uncomfortable reminders of the past as the occasional unexploded bomb that is discovered and quickly defused. 
 Although the 13 episodes of "Heimat II" move from character to character, the most prominent recurrent figure is Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold), a fiercely ambitious young composer, pianist and guitarist who leaves his provincial village to study at the Munich Conservatory. A hot-headed romantic who suggests a Germanic hybrid of Tom Cruise and Mandy Patinkin, he leaves home in a fury, determined never to return to the town that drove away his socially unacceptable childhood sweetheart. 
 Hermann emerges as the representative young German of a generation that today is in its early 50's. Arrogant, self-centered and passionate, he is much more intellectual than any corresponding figure from an American film set in the same period. One of the most intriguing qualities of "Heimat II" is the intellectual tenor of the conversation. Even in casual discourse, names like Leibniz and Schopenhauer are thrown around without a second thought. 
 Unlike most films about artists, "Heimat II" shows its characters struggling to create. It follows Hermann through an oral exam for the Munich Conservatory and features several of his compositions. These fiery atonal pieces, which perfectly reflect his personality, were composed by Nikos Mamangakis, who wrote the series' voluminous and gorgeous music in a rainbow of styles. The film devotes similar attention to the musical life of Hermann's sometime girlfriend, Clarissa (Salome Kammer), a gifted cellist, and to the studio labors of Reinhard (Laszlo I. Kish), a documentary film maker, as well as to Reinhard's lover, Esther (Susanne Lothar), a tempestuous Venetian photographer. 
 An elegiac thread of the story concerns Foxholes, a lushly appointed estate run by Elisabeth Cerphal (Hannelore Hoger), the niece of a German publishing magnate. Elisabeth, infatuated with youth, allows her home to become a free-floating bohemian salon in the early 1960's. Ultimately Foxholes is demolished. And the house and memories of its carefree romantic nights loom as a nostalgic touchstone for a more innocent and golden time. 
 The house also becomes a darker symbol of an unspoken agreement by almost everybody to regard the Nazi era as an embarrassing historical aberration that is best left behind. But as Elisabeth's family secrets come to light, willful ignorance of the past proves impossible. One of the most shattering scenes is a confrontation at the Dachau concentration camp. 
 At least two dozen memorable characters wind in and out of the series' 13 episodes. If Hermann is the most vivid, the most touching is Juan (Daniel Smith), a Peruvian expatriate musician and man of multiple talents who is refused entrance to the Munich Conservatory because his music is too folkloric. Juan, who eventually attempts suicide, hovers on the periphery of the action like a moth drawn to the flame of a society in which he can never feel as though he belongs. In Mr. Smith's portrayal he is an infinitely sad clown and truth-teller, a Robin Williams waif with the soul of Goethe's Werther. 
 Running through "Heimat II" is a strain of romantic fervor that echoes the lofty swirl of Wagner's operas. Most of the characters take love very seriously. In this still quite Puritanical atmosphere, kisses are not exchanged lightly, and passions run deep and long. Many of the young characters' stories take sharp melodramatic turns, and some individuals die unexpectedly. 
 These sudden reversals, along with the film's moody tone and expressionistic touches (black-and-white sequences are strikingly alternated with scenes in color) make it not quite realistic. Rather like the culturally literate never-never land of Woody Allen's New York, Mr. Reitz's 1960's Munich is the exotic city of a young man's dream. 
 "Heimat II" opened at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, in the East Village, on June 4. Episodes 2 and 3 are being shown through Sunday afternoon with two new episodes being shown each week thereafter, except for an early July recapitulation. The recap will show episode 1 on July 1, episodes 2 and 3 on July 3, episodes 4 and 5 on July 6, and episodes 6 and 7 on July 7. The series resumes on July 9 with episodes 8 and 9.

HEADLINE: EMPIRE SAYS DATA ON INSURANCE LOSS WERE ERRONEOUS

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield acknowledged yesterday that the company had repeatedly sent erroneous reports about its finances to New York State insurance regulators. The action came as state officials accused Empire's executives of obstructing state insurance examiners for years.
Kevin Foley, New York's deputy insurance superintendent, said Empire's executives made "misstatements" to the Insurance Department, told "falsehoods" and were slow to provide information requested by insurance examiners. Sometimes they claimed information did not exist, when it did, he said. 
 Empire's chief financial officer, who prepares the reports submitted to the state, was ordered by the company to leave the building yesterday and his office was sealed. His status with the company is unclear. Harold E. Vogt, Empire's chairman, said the company had not determined whether the financial officer, Jerry Weissman, would be allowed to return.
 
Losses Exaggerated
 The erroneous documents, filed as part of Empire's annual reports to the state in 1989, 1990 and 1991, exaggerate Empire's losses on insurance policies that cover the poorest and sickest New Yorkers. The documents also understated the losses on its insurance policies with some of the country's wealthiest companies.
The discrepancies are significant. In recent years, Empire has sought approval from the state for steep rate increases on the policies it offers to individuals and small groups, frequently the oldest and sickest New Yorkers who could not find insurance elsewhere. Empire has said that losses from these accounts are the primary reason for the company's precarious financial state.
Empire's admission about the figures came after The New York Times obtained internal company documents that showed figures different from those that Empire had filed with the New York State Insurance Department. Mr. Vogt said he began an internal inquiry two weeks ago, after The Times asked him to explain the discrepancy.
Internal auditors reported back to Mr. Vogt yesterday, he said, and he immediately informed the Insurance Department. "It appears that there was some discrepancy and it appears that we needed to address it," Mr. Vogt said.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Weissman acknowledged the existence of two sets of figures for the accounts, but said that the erroneous figures had no effect on rate increases. The discrepancy was the result of different accounting methods, Mr. Weissman said, adding that more accurate figures are sent to the state each time Empire requests a rate increase.
Reached at his home last night, Mr. Weissman said he had no comment on yesterday's developments.
The questions surrounding Empire's truthfulness with state regulators come during the worst management and financial crises in the company's 60-year history.
Mr. Weissman became third in command at Empire last month after its chief executive, Albert A. Cardone, was forced out by the board of directors. Yesterday's developments raised new questions about Mr. Cardone's tenure at the head of a company that provides health insurance to more than eight million New Yorkers. They are also likely to raise questions about the vigilance of the state Insurance Department in monitoring Empire.
 
Executives Freer to Talk
 Mr. Cardone, who was Empire's chairman and chief executive for six years, resigned last month after a newly invigorated board learned that he had kept crucial information about the company from them and that many top executives of the company were highly critical of his management and his confrontational personal style.
In the weeks since Mr. Cardone's departure, Empire executives have felt freer to tell regulators and the board about the company's inner workings.
Reports from these employees led the Insurance Department to conclude that it had been misled. "Our concern is that some senior executives of the company may have frustrated our examinations," Mr. Foley said. He declined to name the executives, but said the department would make public a fuller report on the matter in the coming weeks.
Mr. Vogt, who was named chairman of Empire last month, said he was informed yesterday by the State Insurance Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, that state regulators wanted to question Mr. Weissman about "missing data." Mr. Vogt said the superintendent did not elaborate.
 
Books Sent Anonymously
 The erroneous financial reports acknowledged by Empire yesterday had no effect on the company's "bottom line," Mr. Vogt said. But he added, "I'm not minimizing this as an issue. We're concerned that there be no discrepancies."
The internal books, which were sent to The Times anonymously, showed that Empire lost $150.6 million on its policies with individuals and small groups in 1991. But on its state filing for the same year, Empire reported a loss of $181.5 million on those policies.
And the internal books showed a loss of $66 million on policies sold to large companies. The figures filed with New York State showed a loss of $35.1 million.
Empire is a not-for-profit company that receives tax breaks from the state in exchange for offering health insurance to anyone who can afford to pay, no matter how sick. Its self-described mission is to insure as many people as possible at the lowest possible cost.
 
Intended to Subsidize Poor
 In theory, Empire uses profits from its accounts with wealthy companies to subsidize the policies offered to the elderly, the unemployed, small groups and others who are considered bad insurance risks and typically are charged far higher rates. But the big corporate accounts have lost money in recent years. Empire must get New York State's approval to raise rates on small groups and individuals, but can set any price for its larger accounts.
Over all, Empire has lost $250 million in the last two years and its reserves have fallen to a level considered dangerously low by state regulators and the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
Mr. Vogt said yesterday that he has hired the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher to conduct a thorough investigation of the financial discrepancies.
In a written statement, the company said it would "not speculate on the extent of involvement of any current or former employee."
Mr. Vogt said Empire also reported the discrepancies to a United States Senate subcommittee that has been conducting a broad inquiry into the management of Empire. The subcommittee, which has subpoenaed thousands of pages of documents from both Empire and the Insurance Department, has scheduled a hearing for next week.

HEADLINE: U.N. Approves Ban On Shipments of Oil To Haitian Military

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 16

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted today to impose a worldwide ban on oil shipments to Haiti but backed away from authorizing the United States or other countries to enforce the ban with a naval blockade.
The sanctions, which were approved unanimously, are aimed at forcing Haitian military leaders to accept the return of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They were weakened in response to objections by Brazil to a clause that called for the inspection of ships trying to enter Haitian ports. 
 Diplomats said that Brazil was able to win support for its objections from other Latin American countries because of a longstanding concern in the region about international actions that might undercut local sovereignty.
 
Arms Shipments Banned
 The sanctions also included a ban on arms shipments to Haiti and the freezing of Haitian assets abroad. Under the sanctions, Haiti's military leaders have one week to provide what one diplomat called "something really positive," before the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, imposes the embargo.
Shortly after the military coup in September 1991 against Father Aristide, the Organization of American States imposed a hemispheric embargo on commerce with Haiti, but those sanctions, never enforced, had little impact on international efforts to restore democratic rule.
Violators of the new embargo, which is mandatory and enforceable under the authority of the United Nations, would themselves be subject to United Nations sanctions or other punitive measures from the Security Council.
Since January, in an effort to prevent a large outflow of refugees from Haiti, the Clinton Administration has maintained a fleet of Coast Guard and Naval vessels off Haiti which, under the original sanctions language, would likely have been used to stop ships steaming toward Haiti. Diplomats say that other countries, including France, Canada and Argentina, had also offered to help police the embargo.
It was unclear today whether the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola, would adhere to the ban on oil shipments. Last week, the country's President, Joaquin Balaguer, criticized moves to impose stiffer sanctions on Haiti.
 
Bad Roads a Factor
 Whatever Haiti's neighbor decides, diplomats close to the crisis said roads linking the two countries are so few and in such bad condition that only a small portion of Haiti's needed oil could be trucked over land.
Addressing concerns that some nations or shipping companies might try to violate the embargo, diplomats said the Security Council could be called upon later to approve measures allowing ships entering Haitian waters to be stopped.
Father Aristide's delegate to the United Nations, Fritz E. Longchamp, said, however, that although the new measures represented an important step, the need to consult continually over enforcement "has given a lot of room for dilatory actions that the people of Haiti cannot afford."
Although the sanctions were weakened, they represent a dramatic increase in the involvement of the United Nations with Haiti.
Acknowledging the concerns of Latin American countries, the Security Council announced after the vote that the sanctions were meant to deal with the "unique situation in Haiti and should not be regarded as a precedent."
 
Question of Sovereignty
 Diplomats said the delicate question of national sovereignty was overcome in part by concerns that Haiti's chronic instability, by generating waves of refugees, affected regional stability. Further easing the way for the vote was a letter by Father Aristide requesting additional sanctions.
A senior diplomat at the United Nations expressed dismay today about the change in language that weakened the sanctions, but said the effect would be only temporary, because the United Nations was determined to bring about a negotiated solution to the crisis.
"Basically, the belief here is that these people need a shock," the diplomat said of the expected impact of the oil embargo on the Haitian military, which has frustrated every diplomatic initiative in Haiti so far.
Advisers to the deposed President said they expected that the measures would quickly exert severe pressure on the military to begin negotiating in good faith on Father Aristide's restoration because there are only four to six weeks of oil reserves now in Haiti.

HEADLINE: Advances in Detection Create Dilemma on Prostate Cancer

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., June 16

 BODY:
Prostate cancer is being diagnosed at a higher rate than ever before, according to new data from the National Cancer Institute. And as more cancers are diagnosed, record numbers of men are undergoing radiation or operations to remove the prostate.
But no evidence exists to show that this aggressive effort to diagnose and treat the cancer has had any effect in improving survival. And most of the increase in diagnosis can be attributed to new, more advanced diagnostic techniques, researchers say.
 
16% Increase Reported
 In fact, they say, more cancers are being caught at an earlier, more treatable stage. The real risk is in the treatment. Removal of the prostate not only has a higher death rate than comparable kinds of surgery, but it can also cause impotence and incontinence in large numbers of patients. 
 At a meeting held by the cancer institute on Tuesday and today to assess the prostate cancer problem, researchers reported that from 1989 to 1990, the most recent year for which national data are available, detection of prostate cancer grew by 16 percent, the largest increase ever reported for a cancer in a single year. Preliminary data indicate the 1991 rate may be up by an additional 30 percent.
The cancer institute estimates that in 1993 prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 165,000 American men and 35,000 men will die from it.
These increases in diagnosed cases and in operations stunned cancer specialists, because they reflected widespread use of a screening test that was all but unheard of four years ago.
"This is clearly a major public health issue," said Dr. Larry Kessler ofthe cancer institute. This year, he estimated, the testing will pick up 20,000 to 30,000 more men who have no symptoms and would otherwise have gone unnoticed. "Yet we don't know if treating them is advisable or whether a lot of the surgery is proper," he said.
A simple blood test, known as PSA, for prostate specific antigen, detects a protein that seeps out of the prostate gland when there is a tumor or when the gland is enlarged or inflamed. The American Cancer Society recommends that all men over 50 have a PSA test each year, but the cancer institute has not taken a position.
Unlike other tests for cancer, including mammography in women over 50 or Pap smears, whose use has been shown to save lives, there are no data showing the test for prostate cancer reduces mortality.
Researchers are discouraged by the finding that prostate-cancer death rates have stayed virtually the same for decades. If diagnosis and treatment make a difference, they should reduce the death rate -- the number of men per 100,000 men in the population who die of the disease.
The cancer institute is starting a study to see whether men who are tested live longer, but the study will start recruiting only in October and its results will not be in for a decade.
 
Sharp Rise in Operations
 Meanwhile, Medicare data show the number of operations to remove cancerous prostates in elderly men, defined as those 65 and over, increased by 500 to 600 percent from 1984 to 1990.
The PSA is becoming so routine that many doctors simply include it along with standard tests for cholesterol or blood sugar, for example, without even asking the men if they want it. The test is most often used in the West. Doctors in New England perform it at half the national rate and those in the Pacific states use it 75 percent more than the national average.
"This indicates that perhaps we don't know what we're doing," said Dr. John Wasson, a health-care analyst at Dartmouth University.
The death rate from the operation is 1 percent among men from 65 to 74 and 2 percent among those 75 and older, the Medicare data show. They also show that 63 percent of men who have their prostates removed are incontinent afterward and that 60 to 90 percent are impotent as a result of the operation.
Some surgeons, like Dr. Patrick Walsh of Johns Hopkins University, have much better outcomes, which Dr. Walsh attributes in part to the age of his patient population, generally men in their 50's. He does not operate on men over 70, he said, because he believes the benefits do not exceed the risks. He said he was uncertain whether operations on men between the ages of 60 and 70 were advisable.
Yet results like Dr. Walsh's are the ones most often cited to patients considering the operation, said Dr. John D. McConnell, a urologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "The results you read about and are often quoted to patients may not apply to the 70-year-old man who is being operated on in a community setting," Dr. McConnell said.
The issues are all the more pressing because prostate cancer is so common, especially among older men. According to the National Cancer Institute, autopsy data show that a third of men over 50 have microscopic tumors in their prostate glands and 90 percent of 90-year-old men have them.
The cancers arise in the prostate, the small gland at the base of the bladder that provides fluids to nourish sperm. Most tumors remain small and unnoticeable and never cause any problems. But some break free of the gland and take up residence in the bone, causing an untreatable metastatic bone cancer. Researchers say they have no idea which or how many of the tumors will prove deadly and which can be ignored. As a consequence, they are treating everyone.
Patients pay $15 to $40 for a PSA test. But doctors at the meeting spoke often of the slippery slope that ensues from a positive test result, which is found among 15 percent of men over 65 and 5 percent of men from 50 to 65. The next steps are additional tests and biopsies, then treatment and, sometimes, more surgery or treatment to alleviate the side effects of treatment.
Economists have calculated that annual tests of all men over 50, including subsequent tests to confirm the diagnosis, and operations for those with suspicious findings, could cost the nation $28 billion a year. But the real question is what is gained by testing.
Dr. Kenneth Pienta, a urologist at Wayne State University in Detroit, said that whether or not some men were treated unnecessarily, others were saved from death. "I'd rather screen and find the cancer," he said.
But Dr. Michael R. Conger, a urologist at the Group Health Cooperative in Redmond, Wash., had a different opinion. He explains to men that once the test is done, if the result is positive, they are in for "a cascade of intervention," that can be hard to refuse because the result itself is so terrifying. It may be better never to start down that road, he said.

HEADLINE: The Man Behind the High Court Nominee

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
In 1980, a handful of Republican senators appeared to be reluctant to confirm another Carter appointment to a Federal Court in an election year, so the prospective judge's husband mentioned the problem to a client.
The husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, told the client, Ross Perot, along with other influential friends in academic and political and corporate circles. 
The senators were called.
And in the end, only one Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, voted against Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination to join the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
 
Extraordinary Record
 Even though she had established an extraordinary record as a lawyer and teacher, Ms. Ginsburg has acknowledged that without the strong personal and political support of her husband, she may never have become President Clinton's choice for the Supreme Court.
For his part, Mr. Ginsburg said in an interview today: "I have been supportive of my wife since the beginning of time, and she has been supportive of me. It's not sacrifice; it's family."
It was also a sign of the changing times that Mr. Ginsburg would have to leave behind a successful career as a lawyer and tenured tax professor at Columbia Law School in New York and move to Washington so that his wife could become a Federal judge here 13 years ago. When Mr. Ginsburg graduated from law school 35 years ago, his new bride transferred from Harvard to Columbia Law School so he could take a job as an associate at a Manhattan law firm.
As women have begun to reach the highest ranks of political and judicial power, Mr. Ginsburg has come to represent a new kind of spouse: the husband as alter ego, adviser and political booster. It is a kind of role reversal that has been performed in recent months by Michael Kramer, the journalist who promoted the candidacy of his wife, Judge Kimba M. Wood, for Attorney General. Judge Wood was dropped by the White House after it was learned that the couple had employed an illegal immigrant to care for their son (although doing so was legal at the time).
Friends say Mr. Ginsburg worked behind the scenes to help persuade Mr. Clinton to nominate Judge Ginsburg for the Supreme Court, calling on leading scholars to write to Mr. Clinton and his counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum.
When rumors began circulating last month that Judge Ginsburg had opposed the right to abortion, Mr. Ginsburg enlisted academics to tell the White House and others that his wife had criticized the reasoning, but not the result, of the 1973 case establishing the constitutional right.
And in a capital that has grown hypersensitive to the tax histories of nominees for high office, it was Mr. Ginsburg, one of the nation's leading tax experts, who averted any controversy about the couple's finances. On a few hours' notice, Mr. Ginsburg compiled years of financial records over the weekend. He walked Government accountants through years of filings on Sunday, as Mr. Nussbaum was interviewing Judge Ginsburg in another room of the couple's Watergate apartment on a variety of legal and personal issues.
 
Deduction Defended
 When the Government accountants on Sunday challenged a $100 deduction, the tax professor who had structured some of the most complex corporate transactions was able to defend the accounting easily.
The financial records of the couple were significantly simplified by Mr. Ginsburg's decision in 1980 to sell all of his stock so that his wife would not have to remove herself from cases involving companies or industries in which the family had interests.
Mr. Ginsburg played down his role in the nomination, saying he spoke to only a few legal scholars he knew and only after a friend at the White House asked him, "What have you done about generating support from the academics?"
He said he was told: "Given that her background was as a scholar, if the world doesn't generate at least seven letters from academics then the White House will get very nervous."
The letters poured in -- from politicians like Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas and legal scholars like the presidents of Stanford and Columbia (both former law school deans). A number were not directly solicited by Mr. Ginsburg, who said what he did was merely repeat what he was told by the White House friend whom he declined to identify.
President Clinton said today that he was not influenced by the letters and that they showed "only that a lot of people felt a lot for her."
Mr. Ginsburg, 61 years old, was born in Brooklyn and raised in Rockville Centre, L.I. Through mutual friends, he met Ruth Bader at Cornell, and after his two-year service in the Army and the birth of their daughter, they enrolled a year apart at Harvard Law School. While she was developing a whole new area of law involving equal rights for women, he practiced tax law.
He decided to teach full time in 1977, when he did a stint at Stanford Law School. He sought that job to be with his wife, who had been invited to be a resident fellow for a term at Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences.
In 1971, Mr. Ginsburg met Ross Perot when his law firm represented Mr. Perot in a deal, and the friendship blossomed. He did not work on Mr. Perot's Presidential campaign, although he spoke with his economic adviser, John White, on some issues. Mr. Ginsburg said he had supported Mr. Clinton.
By all accounts, Mr. Perot grew particularly close to Mr. Ginsburg after the lawyer resolved a thicket of thorny tax problems that had threatened the acquisition of Mr. Perot's Electronic Data Systems Inc. by the General Motors Corporation in 1984.
Mr. Ginsburg hesitated before taking the assignment because his law firm represented several of Mr. Perot's competitors. While technically it was not a conflict of interest, Mr. Ginsburg said, "It looked unseemly."
But his long friendship with Mr. Perot, combined with his intellectual interest in completing one of the most challenging mergers, prompted him to do the job. To ease tensions with his law firm, he told Mr. Perot that he would work without pay.
Ultimately, he said, Mr. Perot said he wanted to repay Mr. Ginsburg some way, and after the deal was completed his client said he would endow a chair at any university Mr. Ginsburg liked.
 
Unwanted Monument
 "I said, 'It's a bad idea,' " Mr. Ginsburg recalled. "Endowed chairs are only for dead people."
But Mr. Perot said if Mr. Ginsburg did not pick a school, then the money would go to Oral Roberts University.
"Ross said when the founder of Oral Roberts heard it was to be the Martin D. Ginsburg chair, he took a deep breath and then said, 'Well, Ross, we're all God's children.' "
In the end, the money went to Georgetown University Law Center, where Mr. Ginsburg had been teaching since 1980. But Mr. Ginsburg has not filled the chair, because, he said, he is superstitious, and the interest on the endowment has been used to pay for books at the law school library.
On a shelf in the family's Watergate apartment sits a gift from some of Judge Ginsburg's clerks: a six-inch piece of furniture with a small plaque that identifies it as the Martin D. Ginsburg chair.

HEADLINE: Cash Woes Cast A Long Shadow Over California

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., June 16

 BODY:
In years past during budget-making season, Tom Orloff, the chief assistant district attorney here, would amble across the street to the Alameda County administration building and plead, wheedle and threaten until he got enough money for his department to survive.
But this year, Mr. Orloff said, "even if we fight and scratch and claw on the county level, we'll still get killed" because of Gov. Pete Wilson's plan to balance the state's $52 billion budget by commandeering $2.6 billion in local property taxes. 
 Elected leaders in the state's 58 counties are howling in protest, with law-enforcement officials, who rely almost entirely on county financing, leading the charge with dire warnings that criminals will go unprosecuted.
Those warnings, and the actual suspension of misdemeanor prosecutions in one cash-starved county for a month, have gotten the attention of California's Governor, who dreads a repeat of last year's two-month budget stalemate, which forced the state to issue i.o.u.'s and sent Mr. Wilson's approval ratings plummeting.
 
Deadline Missed Again
 Mr. Wilson, a Republican, has already suggested extending a half-cent sales tax, due to expire on June 30, for six months, with the revenue earmarked for local law-enforcement. He also has called for a special election next fall so that counties can raise their own sales taxes. And he has asked the legislature to give local governments more flexibility in state-mandated entitlement programs.
But those changes have yet to satisfy the lawmakers in Sacramento, who on Tuesday missed the constitutional deadline for passing a spending plan for the seventh year in a row.
And at least a dozen counties, including the population meccas of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, have laid the groundwork for legal action against the state's "property tax grab" by passing ordinances that instructing local financial officials to distribute tax revenue as in the past.
With the sales-tax extension subject to legislative approval and next fall's election a crap shoot in this recession-scarred state, Mr. Orloff is assuming the worst: a loss of $10.1 million, or more than 40 percent of the current financing.
That would force the layoff of half the 140 lawyers, Mr. Orloff said, thus ending the prosecution of all misdemeanors, 47,000 cases last year.
That would mean that shoplifters, vandals, prostitutes, drunken drivers, wife-beaters and those carrying concealed weapons would go unpunished in the rough streets of Oakland and its surrounding communities. Even some felonies might not be prosecuted.
When asked which serious crimes would be ignored, he removed his eye-glasses and squeezed the bridge of his nose in a gesture of weary pessimism .
"No matter what happened, we would continue to do homicide, rape, robbery with injury and major narcotics cases," Mr. Orloff said, citing categories in which the county is either No. 1, 2 or 3 in the state.
Other counties face the same situation, or worse. In Los Angeles, for instance, no misdemeanors or non-violent felonies would be prosecuted under the proposed budget, local officials have said. And a computerized gang-tracking system that is used by police departments nationwide would be disbanded. Jails in Los Angeles County, and elsewhere, have begun early release of some inmates.
In San Joaquin County, where lush farmland has given way to dangerous cities, an early budget decision by the Board of Supervisors led the district attorney to suspend misdemeanor prosecution in May, except for drunken driving, domestic violence and resisting arrest.
Some 1,300 crimes (including the vehicular manslaughter of an 88-year-old woman) went unprosecuted before the board last week restored some financing, a move that followed Governor Wilson's change of heart about parts of his fiscal package and could be reversed in 90 days.
The situation in San Joaquin, featured on ABC News's "Nightline," was a powerful lobbying tool in a state where crying wolf has become an art form in the 15 years since Proposition 13 limited property-tax collection and thus put local governments at risk.
 
Bureaucratic Footwork
 Year after year, interest groups have flocked to Sacramento to claim imminent disaster, only to find themselves in a better position than anticipated. Some money turns up that nobody knew was there. A few vacant positions remain unfilled so the police officers can keep their jobs. A bit of bureaucratic fancy footwork allows a threatened hospital to stay open.
But this year seems different, the fiscal problems in the nation's most populous state beyond the reach of bookkeeping tricks and painless service cuts. Experts point to the cumulative effect of a long recession and the staggering health and welfare costs tied to legal and illegal immigration.
Experts also note that the effects of Proposition 13, which in 1978 sparked a nationwide tax revolt, were muted for all these years because the prosperous state was able to bail out counties by paying most of the costs of education.
But those days ended in 1992, when Governor Wilson wrestled $1.3 billion from the counties, cities and special districts to close a $10.7 billion budget gap. Now the gap is $9 billion, and the Governor wants twice as much money from the localities, although he will likely settle for less.
 
A Landscape Altered
 Despite the dispute between the state and the counties, politicians are predicting a speedier resolution than last year's, because nobody has the stomach for a summerlong stalemate.
On the local level, too, hardship has altered the political landscape. Take last week's meeting of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, which was set to vote on an ordinance permitting a cut in monthly welfare payments for single adults to $308 from $327.
Mr. Orloff attended the meeting, aware that every dollar spent on welfare is a dollar not available for law enforcement. The supervisors, some of them weeping, voted with little hesitation to cut the grant rather than face such grim alternatives as closing the county juvenile detention center.
"Our problems have gone from epidemic to pandemic," said Supervisor Don Perata, who had never voted for a welfare cut. "This year is the terrible future we've all been talking about."

HEADLINE: CLINTON SEES CUT IN SPACE STATION

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided not to kill the eight-year-old space station project but to proceed instead with a slightly slimmed version of the original design, costing about $10.5 billion over five years, a senior Administration official said today.
That price tag would be at least $1.5 billion more than the President said he wanted to spend, but still falls well below the $17.6 billion it would have cost to complete the latest version of the original design. 
 Mr. Clinton is expected to announce his decision on Thursday evening, when the White House has tentatively planned his first prime-time news conference. While it should please the coalition of lawmakers whose districts benefit from the space station, and who opposed killing or radically redesigning it, even this moderately slimmed version is not assured of passing the budget-conscious House.
Space agency engineers last week gave the President three basic design options for a cheaper, smaller version of the space station, which they hoped would spare the project from budget-cutters trying to remove it from the President's economic program entirely.
 
What Kind of Choices
 Two options -- labeled A and B -- involved scaled-back versions of the original space station, named Freedom, drawn up under President Ronald Reagan. Option A was smaller and more streamlined than option B, which closely resembled the original. Both versions would consist of pressurized modules and solar-power panels attached to a girderlike truss that would be assembled in orbit, after pieces were ferried into space by shuttles.
A third design, labeled option C, was the cheapest alternative and involved a radical reduction of the project -- stripping it to a simple, pressurized cylinder with solar panels attached, and launching it into space with a single shot. It was dubbed "the big can."
A senior White House official said the President had picked a combination of options A and B -- meaning a smaller version of the original design, with simplified electrical and data systems.
The official said that, based on the White House's estimates, the project would probably run around $2.1 billion a year to build, over five years.
 
Coalition With a Cause
 Under such a plan, the first flight of the space shuttle to carry parts of the station into orbit would come in 1997. A laboratory module would be added in 1998, and the station would be ready for occupancy by four astronauts in 2000 or 2001.
Aides said the President opted for this version both because it could keep the station alive at a reasonable cost and because it was the only option that would apparently win enough backing from the coalition of lawmakers and foreign backers pushing the project.
Most of the station is being built in Texas, California, Florida and several other Southern states and has strong political support from lawmakers in those districts. Congressmen from these states strongly opposed the radical option C design and said they would not have agreed to finance it. The same was true of the foreign backers of the project. All of them favored option B, which was the closest to the original.
Canceling or radically streamlining the space station would have had international ramifications for Mr. Clinton, since Canada, Japan and member countries of the European Space Agency have invested hundreds of millions of their own taxpayers' dollars.
 
Preserving Contributions
 Many of the international partners had already developed a good deal of hardware and software for their portions of the space station. They were very concerned that option C would have included none of their contributions, and option A only a portion.
What Mr. Clinton chose, aides say, is basically option A, but with enhancements from option B that would preserve many of the contributions of the international partners.
Mr. Clinton met Monday night with White House advisers and Daniel Goldin, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to review the options for shrinking the space station. Asked about the project at a press conference on Tuesday, the President said he was carefully studying the options, but he also cited an argument often used by its supporters: "It's important to recognize that the space station offers the potential of working with other nations and continue our lead in a very important area and having significant impact."
Some $8 billion has been spent on the project, which has been plagued by mismanagement and cost overruns.
 
Billions and Billions
 The White House spurred the three-month redesign effort by NASA, ordering it last February to come up with some options that could salvage the program by cutting in half the $17.6 billion estimate for finishing it over five years. The team was asked to come up with three redesigns, for $5 billion, $7 billion and $9 billion. NASA could not meet those targets. The option that the President has selected, his aides say, will probably cost just under $11 billion.
Even with the President's backing, the survival of the station is by no means assured. Those lawmakers who do not have any "station pork" -- the term used by some lawmakers in whose districts parts of the station are being assembled -- do not have a strong political incentive to vote in favor.

HEADLINE: CHINA WINS FIGHT ON RIGHTS GROUPS

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 16

 BODY:
In what was seen as a victory for China's campaign to limit international monitoring of human rights, nongovernmental organizations attending the World Conference on Human Rights were ejected today from the committee drafting the meeting's final document.
The nongovernmental organizations, which include powerful groups like Amnesty International, protested angrily that the United Nations had allowed itself to be browbeaten by China, which had threatened to boycott the drafting committee if independent human rights representatives were present. 
 "A number of delegates told us that China said it would have trouble participating if nongovernmental organizations were present," said Reed Brody, a representative of the International Human Rights Law Group, who had been assigned to the drafting committee. "The Chinese said, 'We don't need baby sitters.' "
China is perhaps the most outspoken of a group of Asian countries that accuses the West of trying to impose its values on regions with different religious and cultural traditions and that objects to moves to strengthen United Nations authority to denounce human rights abuses.
Last week China infuriated the nongovernmental organizations when it persuaded the United Nations to ban the Dalai Lama from addressing rights groups here. After strong Western pressure, the Dalai Lama was allowed to speak to a crowd on the grounds of the United Nations complex, on Tuesday.
 
'No Right to Interfere'
 "At a time when the U.N. should be exercising leadership in advancing human rights, it shows itself to be preoccupied with the sensibilities of its most abusive governments," said Kenneth Roth, acting executive director of the Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York. "By succumbing to this blackmail the U.N. sinks to the level of its most repressive member states."
In presenting Beijing's formal position to the conference on Tuesday evening, however, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu made no effort to apologize for his Government's stance, noting that on human rights "other countries have no right to interfere."
He also reiterated his Government's view that economic development was the most important human right of any developing country. "The argument that human rights is the precondition for development is unfounded," he said, adding that individual rights could never prevail over those of the state and society.
The hard-line speech was no surprise to Western delegates, but its move to clear independent groups from the drafting committee signaled that China also hoped to achieve many of its objectives in the closed-door negotiations on the final document.
 
Exclusions From Meetings
 That document is theoretically to be adopted by consensus, but Western governments led by the United States have warned that they will not accept "the lowest common denominator" simply to preserve the image of worldwide agreement. Last week those governments also appeared to think that they had won approval for nongovernmental participation in the drafting.
But Mr. Brody said he already recognized signs of trouble on Tuesday, when the chairman of the drafting committee, Gilberto Vergne Saboia of Brazil, informed him that human rights groups would be excluded from informal meetings and that most of the negotiation in the coming days would occur informally.
"It's, of course, a fiction, because the committee meets in the same place with the same interpreters, with the same formality, but it just says it's meeting informally," Mr. Brody, an American lawyer, said shortly after the rights groups had been forced to leave the drafting committee. He added that he expected to be kept informed of developments by Western delegates.
Although the conference will continue until June 25 the 1,000 or so nongovernmental organizations represented here have been deeply frustrated by United Nations rules, not least the decision that in formal discussions specific cases of violations not be mentioned.
In practice that rule was violated on Tuesday by the Bosnian Foreign Minister, Haris Siladzic, who began a strong attack on Serbia for its onslaught on Bosnia and Herzegovina. The conference responded sympathetically, urging the United Nations Security Council to take measures to end "the genocide" in Bosnia.
Today it was the turn of Pakistan's representative, Begun Nusrat Bhutto, to accuse India of carrying out repression in Kashmir. India's chief delegate, J. N. Dixit, responded by accusing Pakistan of carrying out its own violations in the disputed territory.
Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, also addressed the conference, demanding that resolute measures be taken to end Israeli military actions in the occupied territories, actions that he said were "tantamount to genocide." In that case Israel chose not to respond.
The final document will not name specific violators. Instead, the battle of words will be between Western nations that are demanding reaffirmation of the "universality" of human rights and mainly Asian countries that favor redefining human rights.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Carol Rasco;
She's the Advocate She Once Needed

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
AT first glance, it seems a simple portrait of privileged Southern living --
a sparkling backyard pool, a family gathered in a comfortable den, a four-foot-wide television that flickers with camcorder images of a relative's sprawling new home.
Only one thing suggests that Carol Rasco has seen more than suburban comfort. That is the figure strapped in a wheelchair. That is her son, Hamp. 
 He is probably the only mentally retarded 19-year-old to have taught a Presidential confidante. Ms. Rasco, the White House domestic policy adviser, says nothing has taught her more about the need for responsive Government than the challenge of raising a son born retarded and with cerebral palsy.
"My children so much form the core of what my view of domestic policy is about," said Ms. Rasco, who also has a healthy 12-year-old daughter, Mary-Margaret.
Ms. Rasco can tell excruciating stories of getting the runaround from Government agencies, and she often does. Her long and lonely road as a mother has shaped one of her policy goals, which she says is to "help all parents be the best they can be."
Some women in power might view their domestic lives as an inappropriate topics for inquiry; profiles of the President's men, after all, do not usually focus on their roles as fathers. But Ms. Rasco invites such inquiries, turning questions about her policy views into a conversation about motherhood.
She did that recently before a group of company chief executives. She scrapped her prepared remarks on global competitiveness to extemporize on reasons why their future labor force, today's children, needed strong advocates.
She remembers thinking, "Oh dear, do I risk this?" But knowing that other speakers would cover abstract statistics, she told the executives how her experiences had led her to see the need for child advocacy. "Without a strong advocate, my own son would not have gotten what he needed," she says.
As a former elementary-school teacher in a White House thick with Rhodes Scholars, Ms. Rasco occupies an odd Presidential niche. She has nothing of the national reputations enjoyed by her two counterparts, Robert E. Rubin, the economic policy adviser, or W. Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
She is happy to describe herself as an implementer of policies rather than their grand architect, and she seems to have taken a back seat on major issues like the budget and health-care reform. Her colleagues often grasp at straws when trying to describe her ideology, or even, sometimes, her policy positions.
But virtually all agree that she has at least one coveted credential: a deep reserve of Presidential trust, earned during a decade spent as a senior aide to Mr. Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. "He loves her," said John Podesta, the White House staff secretary.
Ms. Rasco began as a human-services aide to Mr. Clinton in 1983 and rose to the point where she ran much of the state's daily business for the year that Mr. Clinton was out campaigning for the Presidency. She now provides him with daily briefings on staff and policy developments across the domestic agencies, and she has shown a talent for brokering disputes between warring bureaucracies.
Still, no one is quite sure what Ms. Rasco intends to do with her access, which seems to have remained undiminished by the recent White House upheavals and the arrival of David Gergen as Presidential counselor.
If her colleagues call her views mysterious, Ms. Rasco says that's fine with her. "I don't expect that in four, or hopefully eight, years, people will say, 'Carol Rasco is the godmother of X policy,' " she said. "The Clintons know that I'm in tune and that I can help coordinate their goals."
Asked for a definition of an underclass, for example, she answers, "I'm not going to give you big streams of words." Asked whether she identifies with so-called new Democrats or the old ones, she contends that neither camp has given "a very specific definition of what all that encompasses."
Ms. Rasco, who is 45, has a form of Southern charm that sometimes seems more evocative of the Junior League than the Oval Office. She has a sixth sense for putting guests at ease. She uses words like bumfuzzled, as a synonym for confused.
But she can also be unusually direct. The conversation turns to her son, and the air suddenly fills with vivid images: misshapen hip sockets and a broken femur, body casts and their effects on body smells. Ms. Rasco shows no hesitation stepping before a toilet and fumbling with imaginary straps to illustrate the complexities of her son's daily living.
Her father, Frank Barnes Hampton, said he admired what he called his daughter's purposefulness. "She's learned that a million tears don't change anything," he said.
Ms. Rasco grew up in De Witt, Ark., 65 miles southeast of Little Rock, the daughter of a pharmacist and a homemaker. At the University of Arkansas she worked for a fellow student who was campaigning for student-body president. That student, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, is now Mr. Clinton's chief of staff.
In 1969, at 21, she married Terry Rasco, who is an architect in Little Rock. Four years later, an uneventful pregnancy culminated in a traumatic 24-hour labor. It was a Saturday, her doctor was out of town, and today's health-care reformer found herself in the hands of what she calls an inattentive hospital staff.
"I've always wondered if there wasn't more interest in the Razorback game that afternoon," Ms. Rasco said, referring to the state's passion for the University of Arkansas football team. She still believes that the doctors should have performed a Caesarean section, though she cannot say for sure that it would have prevented the brain damage.
Hamp (his full name is Hampton) turned 5 before he talked, and he was 6 before he was out of diapers. With her husband at work, Ms. Rasco's life shrank to a thousand daily tasks -- bolting her son's sandals onto his tricycle, sticking Velcro on his forks and spoons. "There were nights I was so tired, I would think: 'Why am I doing this? Is it ever going to show fruition?' " she said.
She said her son's subsequent development represented their mutual triumph over doubters and unhelpful bureaucrats. She ignored doctors who suggested she institutionalize him as an infant. She fought the elementary school that had wanted to separate him from nondisabled children. She chased the school-bus bureaucracy until it provided him with a seat belt.
Her fights, she said, gave her empathy with those who were reliant on government, from the elderly to young mothers on welfare.
Ms. Rasco's efforts reached a milestone on June 2, when her son joined the graduation at Hall High School and received a certificate of attendance and a standing ovation.
Hamp speaks slowly, with a hint of a slur, and he has been announcing, with a hint of mischief, the onset of a new disease: "senioritis."
"That's when seniors want to get out," he said.
He left home last summer for an Easter Seals group house, where the staff helps him in and out of bed. He said he is looking for a job that will allow him to use his "social skills."
A training program has taught him to fold napkins and stack sugar baskets, and at restaurants he is quick to fault imperfect ratios of sugar and artificial sweeteners. "It's a hoot," his mother said. His favorite activity is to listen to his portable police radio (his sister, her eyes rolling, notes that he carries it even to the mall).
He attended the news conference at which his mother's appointment was announced, but he carried Kleenex with him, knowing it meant her departure from Little Rock. His old friend Bill Clinton, alarmed at his emotion, waded into the audience to soothe him afterward. Hamp will not reveal what they said. "I call that personal," he said.
Ms. Rasco describes their separation as the kind of difficult-but-healthy experience that all parents and children go through. They stay in touch through visits, phone calls and the fax machine in Hamp's room.
Ms. Rasco's daughter plans to move to Washington in the fall, but her husband's architecture practice will keep him, along with Hamp, in Little Rock.
Ms. Rasco first met Mr. Clinton in 1976, when he was a candidate for state attorney general and spoke to a neighborhood coffee gathering. She later befriended Hillary Rodham Clinton as a fellow member of the First Methodist Church.
During his first term as Governor, Mr. Clinton appointed Ms. Rasco to a state board that ran homes for the disabled. She pushed for programs that placed more disabled people in mainstream settings, like those her son has enjoyed. When Mr. Clinton returned to the Governor's office, in 1983, he brought Ms. Rasco as his liaison to the departments of human services and health.
She brought her mediating talents to bear on the nation's governors, helping forge the consensus for the 1988 Family Support Act, which required some welfare recipients to seek education or training.
But she was also overseeing human services policy when the state's child-welfare system fell apart, as state workers failed to investigate complaints of child abuse and placed children in unsafe foster-care settings. It took a Federal lawsuit to force Mr. Clinton, then an embarrassed Presidential candidate, to raise money to hire and train more workers.
Ms. Rasco said a tightfisted Legislature prevented the changes from coming sooner. "Any time there are children dying, you always should be doing more," she said. "Could we have done it faster? I question that."
The low profile, but high access, that Ms. Rasco brings to her current work can be seen through her role in immunization policy. Earlier this year, Department of Health and Human Services wanted to distribute free vaccines to all children, regardless of family income; the Office of Management and Budget wanted a cheaper plan that gave free vaccines only to the needy.
The decisive moment came in March, when Ms. Rasco went to the President and came back with his decision in favor of the more expensive option, which was subsequently rejected by Congress. She said Mr. Clinton understood the risks and made his own choice. But even now, Ms. Rasco's own views have to be discerned by reading between the lines. She says she wasn't "passionately and vociferously" for the plan, but she "would have been happy to have it go through."
A memorable moment in Ms. Rasco's call for a more helpful Government occurred last winter at a Camp David retreat, when she told her colleagues about a woman she had known in Arkansas. The woman, calling a state agency, had been hung up on by a worker eager to get to lunch. She had gone to Federal buildings that were marked "handicapped accessible," only to find they were not. She had seen her child rejected by state programs for the disabled because he was not indigent and the family was not allowed to pay.
Ms. Rasco caught her colleagues by surprise when she explained why those images would never leave her. "Because," she said, "those experiences were my own."

HEADLINE: A Window on Immigrant Crime;
In Jackson Heights, Drugs, Dirty Money and Prostitution

SERIES: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- Fifth of six articles.

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
No one knows how much criminal money flows through Jackson Heights, but no one doubts the current is steady and strong. On its busy and peaceful surface, the Queens neighborhood is like so many others where immigrants settle into new lives. People work hard, buy houses and shops and send money to the places they once called home.
Most of the enterprise is legal. But Jackson Heights is also the home to Little Colombia -- where high-level drug dealers operate and where much of their cash is laundered through travel agencies and wire transfer services that line Roosevelt Avenue in conspicuous numbers. By coincidence, the community is also the city's new capital for houses of prostitution. 
 Because of the proliferation of these three elements -- drug dealing, money laundering and prostitution -- Jackson Heights provides a striking glimpse into the other side of immigrant success: immigrant crime.
Estimates vary but experts believe that a quarter of the underground economy in New York City -- about $15 billion -- is generated by criminal activity, like drugs or prostitution, as opposed to activity that is simply illicit, like driving a gypsy cab or vending. Law-enforcement officials say most vendors do not traffic in stolen goods, but simply buy wholesale.
Immigrants by no means hold the market on crime. But there could be no more dramatic demonstration of their involvement in criminal activities than the ship that recently went aground off Rockaway Peninsula carrying nearly 300 illegal immigrants, smuggled like contraband halfway across the globe. Slightly less overt, but with much broader effects, are the tons of cocaine the authorities say are smuggled here -- by land, sea and air -- from South America, and which immigrants in Jackson Heights play a major role in selling.
Officials believe that the amount of illegal cash that washes through Jackson Heights could reach into the billions each year.
"The basic goal is to sell the drugs here and send the money back to the big guys in Colombia," said Cheryl L. Pollack, head of narcotics prosecutions for the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn.
Unlike some organized-crime groups -- many Italian, some Irish and some Jewish -- whose members brought over families and became citizens even as they exploited their neighborhoods, the cartels are highly mobile, experts say. The cartel members usually come alone from Colombia, stay only a few years and ship profits home. As a consequence, economists see little economic benefit locally.
 
Low-Grade Activity
 Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University who has studied the underground economy, said that at best the drug trade adds a low-grade buzz to Jackson Heights's already vital legitimate economic base: drug dealers rent beepers, cellular phones and apartments to stash drugs and cash.
And through money laundering, the dealers also help prop up many of the 200 or so travel agencies and wire transfer places there. But they do not seem to be buying property or investing heavily in legitimate businesses, experts say.
"The capital we are talking about is a capital that does not circulate in the local economy," Professor Sassen said.
The economic impact of the 60 brothels on Jackson Avenue is even less clear, because the quantity of money is so much smaller. The brothels, which open at night in apartments along Roosevelt Avenue, seem more a neighborhood nuisance and a testament to their workers' desperation to survive however they can.
 
Patterns of Crime
Specialties Divided By Nationality
Community advocates and law-enforcement officials take pains to distinguish the cartel representatives from the 30,000 legitimate Colombians in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, its sister community to the south.
"Immigrant connotes to me that they come here to live and immigrate to the United States to make a better life," said Thomas F. Sheehan, a Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent who has both lived and worked in Jackson Heights. "I don't think that is the case for a great majority of the drug dealers."
Law-enforcement officials say that criminality among the city's more recent immigrants tends to fall into patterns. Poor women from South America like Diana often work as prostitutes, as do some Korean women. Dominicans move cocaine to the streets. Chinese, and to a lesser extent Sicilians, rule the heroin trade. Nigerians are known as expert smugglers. Some Korean grocers are loan sharks. The Russian mob runs bureaucracy schemes, from Medicare fraud to evading taxes on oil distribution.
Chinese also run gambling houses, and as the city witnessed in the grounding of the Golden Venture, smuggle other Chinese here for a price. The practice provides a telling example of how crime expands within groups: the refugees come illegally, at prices ranging up to $35,000 or more, in trips arranged by Chinese crime groups. Some refugees join heroin-smuggling operations to work off their debt, an Immigration and Nationalization Service official said.
There are also cases in which Chinese gangs -- already deep into extortion, robbery and drugs -- kidnap indebted refugees to ransom them for transportation costs. The official said there have even been cases in which gangs have shown up at Kennedy International Airport to pick up refugees, beating out the organized-crime group that actually arranged for the passage.
 
Devastation at the Fringes
 Even if crime has given a marginal economic boost to Jackson Heights, its impact on other neighborhoods is undeniably devastating. Ansley Hamid, an associate professor at John Jay College, said that cocaine, more than any other drug, sucks the poorest neighborhoods dry. Users impoverish places like the South Bronx and East New York by spending what little cash they have on drugs and stealing anything else of value: cars, televisions, jewelry.
"With cocaine the money flows upward and out of the community," Professor Hamid said. The average street seller, he said, "gets arrested quickly. He becomes a user. His rivals shoot him down."
 
Booming Sex Trade
Desperate Women, Lucrative Choices
While the Cali cartel dealers are shipping fortunes home and living at least a comfortable middle-class existence in this most middle class of immigrant neighborhoods, the prostitutes of Jackson Heights offer a far more painful picture of immigrant crime.
Diana, 33, considers herself more victim than criminal. She earns $25 for every 15 minutes with a man, plus tips. But the brothel keeps 40 percent of her earnings. She came to Queens illegally a year ago, washing floors for $150 a week, not enough to support herself and her three children in Cali. Now she measures business by how many Newport menthols she smokes each night.
"Every customer is one cigarette," she said in Spanish. "Sometimes it's 20 to 30 customers a night and that's 20 to 30 cigarettes." She chain-smoked as she spoke, but by her own rules, should have lit up only three times that night.
Over the last few years, Roosevelt Avenue -- a commercial strip thriving with Hispanic restaurants, pushcarts and newsstands that sell old copies of Colombian papers -- has blossomed with brothels filled with immigrant women like Diana.
Local authorities, including in the Queens District Attorney's office and the police, have closed 30 brothels over the last year. But the brothels -- converted apartments where landlords charge high rents -- keep appearing, run mostly by South American immigrants along with a few Koreans.
The brothel where Diana works, she stood in one of eight cubicles slapped together with wallboard and plaster, and described how she has been a prostitute for only three months and earns $300 or more a night, enough to pay tuition for her children in Colombia and to hire a live-in maid to care for them. Like most of the other eight women in the house -- from Colombia, Venezuela and Peru -- she wants to go home. She will work only for one year and return.
"It's a very difficult country for an immigrant," she said, behind a heavy mask of makeup. "It's not the mecca that everyone says to make money easily."
The house's madam, a savvy 23-year-old from Uruguay named Topacio, would agree about the hardship. But she sees in America almost unbelievable opportunities to make money, legally or not. The owner of three brothels, she has transformed the degradation of prostitution into a small personal fortune.
She recalled her decision to become a prostitute. "I said, 'I can't do this,' " she remembers saying to another prostitute. "But she said, 'You have nothing to lose. You will cry the first day. You won't like it. The second day you will cry more. The third day you will adapt to the first clients. Then the fourth day you will see all the money you made and forget completely your problems.'
On her fourth day, Topacio saw the money. "It was decided," she said.
 
Freeing the Cash
Laundering By Computer
The storefronts looked innocent enough until someone counted them. Then law-enforcement officials realized that the travel agencies, wire transfer centers and change houses were actually the most visible sign of the drug trade. Officials say the stores launder hundreds of millions of dollars each year, mostly sending cash electronically to South America, in addition to making many legal transfers for immigrants who are sending hard-earned money back home.
There are so many of these businesses, and their trade is so obvious, that a casual cynicism about the business has settled into the neighborhood, both on the street and within the businesses themselves, which are decorated with neon signs and huge posters advertising cheap fares to South America.
"Some offices, they do it, but the F.B.I. is on top of things," Juan Vasquez, the manager of one such business, Fax Beepers Communications, offered almost off-handedly. "They come to visit." He said his business handled only legal transactions.
The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 90 percent of its money-laundering investigations in the New York area trace back to Jackson Heights. And over the last few years, several of the companies have been tied directly to investigations into the cartels, including one huge company, Delgado Travel, that paid a $1 million fine in 1991 but is still boomingly in business.
"Non-bank financial institutions are the new frontier in the money-laundering struggle," said Charles A. Intriago, a Miami lawyer who edits a national newsletter on money laundering. "We are talking billions."
 
Too Heavy to Handle
 During the 1980's, as the cocaine trade rose and banks came under increasing Federal scrutiny, these businesses suddenly began to proliferate. According to law-enforcement officials, the industry works like this:
Drug dealing is a bulky enterprise because it generates vast amounts of cash ($1 million in $20 bills, for example, weighs 114 pounds; for $5 bills, the price of a mid-sized vial of crack, multiply that by four). So high-level dealers take money to, say, a travel agency to wire money abroad for an 8 percent fee.
Federal law requires that all transactions over $10,000 be reported. But in Jackson Heights, people get around the rules: there is, for example, a practice called "smurfing," breaking large amounts into transactions of less than $10,000. (The name was coined a decade ago by a Justice Department lawyer who imagined the blue cartoon figures magically breaking down piles of cash.) And often transactions of all sizes are not reported, officials say, because the laws lack teeth and regulators are not capable of overseeing every company that wires money overseas.
But is much of the money coming from drug dealers?
"The suspicion is there," said Edward D. Saslow, an Assistant Attorney General who heads the state's Crime Proceeds Task Force. "But it's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt at this moment in our legal history."

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Man Held in Killing of Youth, 16

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
A Brooklyn man has been arrested in the killing of a 16-year-old student near a school for the emotionally disturbed, a shooting that the police said was carried out despite the victim's pleas for mercy.
The suspect, Gregory Gooding, 21 years old, is also wanted for questioning in another shooting in a housing project near where he lived, which is about half a mile from the school where the student was shot. 
 The police believe that Mr. Gooding, who was unemployed and had served a year and half in prison for a street mugging, shot Andre Sarvis after an argument that began with a disparaging remark about a leather jacket, said Lieut. Charles F. Dowd, head of the 79th Precinct Detective Squad.
 
Stalked to a Parking Area
 Mr. Sarvis, a student at the Ellory School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a school for teen-agers with severe emotional handicaps, was stalked by Mr. Gooding until he reached a small parking area in back of the school, where he was shot twice in the chest at point-blank range, Lieutenant Dowd said.
Before firing, the assailant ignored Mr. Sarvis's screams of "Don't kill me! Don't kill me!"
Witnesses initially told investigators that Mr. Sarvis had been chased by two assailants and that one man had kept watch during the shooting. Lieutenant Dowd said yesterday, however, that there was "no indication at this time that anyone else was involved or that anyone had any knowledge of what Mr. Gooding's intentions were or that anyone else was armed."
"Mr. Gooding is charged as the shooter," Lieutenant Dowd said. "It seems he showed no mercy."
 
Arrested in North Carolina
 The police said that he was arrested early Tuesday morning at his father's house in Williamston, N.C.
Lieutenant Dowd said that housing authority detectives had also been seeking to question Mr. Gooding about a shooting in a nearby housing project, though not in the Tompkins Houses at 200 Throop Avenue, where he lived.
A woman who identified herself only as Mr. Gooding's mother and who refused to give her name said: "He's just my son and I know he ran into trouble."
David Ernst, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole, said that Mr. Gooding had been released from prison last November after serving 17 1/2 months for a 1990 mugging.
Lieutenant Dowd said that Mr. Gooding was with a group of people leaving a sneaker store near the school as Mr. Sarvis entered with several friends. Mr. Gooding, he said, made a comment about a jacket worn by one of Mr. Sarvis's friends, leading to an argument between Mr. Gooding and Mr. Sarvis.
Several minutes later, Lieutenant Dowd said, Mr. Gooding was seen chasing Mr. Sarvis to the spot between two parked cars where the shooting took place.

Lumber Prices Fall Sharply On Home Building Report

While the May housing starts rose 2.4 percent to the highest level in five months, it was less than half the 5.1 percent increase the market had been expecting.
 
July Lumber at $273.30
 The July lumber delivery dropped the daily limit of $10 per 1,000 board feet and settled at $273.30. 
 "The key thing to remember is the confidence level," said a lumber analyst, Steve Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. "That's probably limiting how aggressively people are in purchasing new homes.
"People are not ready to commit themselves to the long term," he said. "Jobs and job security are certainly still rather questionable for a lot of people."
The incentive of lower interest rates has not done the job it was expected to do, he said.
Bud Merrill of Shearson Lehman Brothers in Eugene, Ore., was more optimistic and said the housing starts, which are based on building permits issued, have been historically shy of the true construction level.
"My best sense is to look at where interest rates are," he said. "I look at that as the main key. First-time buyers can get in the market now."
Mr. Platt, Mr. Merrill and Steve Moore of Moore Research Center, also in Eugene, agreed that the sharp decline yesterday could also be attributed to traders who were selling futures because contract prices were too high in relation to the cost of lumber in the cash market.
But Mr. Moore played down the impact of the housing starts data. "That might have a little to do with it," he said, "but the market was already on its way down."
Elsewhere, energy futures prices turned higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, responding to industry data showing a decline in crude oil stocks that was greater than expected.
Light sweet crude oil for July advanced 26 cents and settled at $18.84 a barrel; July heating oil was 0.45 cent higher at 52.45 cents a gallon; July gasoline was 0.86 cent higher at 54.79 cents a gallon, and July natural gas was 4.1 cents higher at $2.193 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Rockefeller Center With Clay Feet

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
There is something fascinating about seeing the rich get poorer, and the spectacle is even more engrossing when it involves a storied location -- Rockefeller Center -- and storied owners as well.
It was just a few years ago -- 1989 to be exact -- when the Rockefeller family created an uproar by selling 80 percent of the center's owner, the privately held Rockefeller Group, to the giant Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. (The other 20 percent of this symbol of American capitalism remained in the family's hands.) 
 At the time, the purchase seemed a coup for the Japanese. Now it appears to be one of the worst buys on record. Income from rents at the center does not cover payments on the mortgage, and the Mitsubishi-Rockefeller owners are suffering big losses. They lost $49.6 million in 1992 and are likely to lose even more this year.
 
Lease Renewals
 A still bigger hit seems certain in 1994 when, because of a historical quirk, leases covering almost half of the center's 6.2 million square feet come due. Renewals for those leases are being negotiated now, amid the worst real estate market many in the industry can remember. And while the center is doing pretty well at renewing leases in a tough market, the rents are less than half of what was projected in 1985 when a public real estate investment trust holding a mortgage on the property was formed.
"The fact that the cash flow from the building would not meet mortgage payments was expected," said Catherine C. Creswell, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. "What is out of line is the new rents they sign on leases that turn over, which will be dramatically below expectations."
While such losses would be intolerable to many companies, Mitsubishi is a giant organization that is thought to take a long view of its investments. Thus, it is not widely considered likely to walk away from the property. But as the monthly deficits continue, as is likely, Ms. Creswell said, "the question becomes, how long will they be willing to support this?"
The question is a critical one not just for Mitsubishi and the Rockefellers but also for the 60,000 public shareholders in Rockefeller Center Properties.
In 1985, the Rockefeller family invited the public to participate in the Rockefeller Center magic by creating Rockefeller Center Properties -- a real estate investment trust, or REIT -- to hold a $1.3 billion mortgage on 12 of the center's buildings. The trust's main asset is still the mortgage on the buildings.
As the center has suffered, so has the REIT, which offers the best -- or really the only -- window into the economics of the center, because the Rockefeller Group is privately held. Although the center's owners continue to make their mortgage payments to the REIT, the uncertainty hanging over the center has hurt the investment trust. Despite the recent boom in REIT's, the Rockefeller trust's share price and dividend have plummeted.
 
'Bottom of the Well'
 The trust's plunge, reflects the fact that the New York office market "is at the bottom of the well," said Edward P. Fontaine, president and chief executive of the REIT.
The REIT's share price fell to $7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, about half of what it was a year ago. In December, it sliced its dividend almost in half, from $1.92 a year to $1. Then, in January, one of the REIT's bankers, on 24 hours' notice, called due a $20 million loan that Mr. Fontaine said the company had expected would be rolled over.
In late April, the company said it expected to make another dividend cut, of 20 cents to 30 cents a year. That cut will be the result of a restructuring agreement on a $200 million credit line that requires the company to sell securities to reduce the letter of credit.
Still, Mr. Fontaine said he was heartened by the center's progress in filling its office space. Although the rents at the center are down, big tenants are staying, and vacancy rates of 6 percent are very low compared with the rest of the midtown Manhattan market.
Out of 14 tenants that have 50,000 or more square feet, five have renewed, including Simon & Schuster with 195,000 square feet, the law firm Chadbourne & Parke with 265,000 square feet and The Associated Press with 167,000 square feet. The center's strategy has been to concentrate first on the big tenants and then focus on the remaining 200 or so smaller leases that expire in 1994.
 
A Falling Appraisal
 As the leases are renegotiated, the value of the properties continues to fall. This year, for example, the REIT's appraisal of the buildings dropped to $1.2 billion, a cut of $400 million -- or 25 percent -- below last year's appraisal. And many industry insiders say even that appraisal may be too high in this market.
"The concern," Ms. Creswell said, "is that if you have a property that is worth less than the mortgage, might they not want to renegotiate? And No. 2, what's to prevent them from walking away?"
But Mr. Fontaine discounts the owners' turning over the properties. "We get a question a week on whether it's possible that the borrower would walk away," he said. "Sure, it's possible, but it'd be expensive."
Refinancing is a different thing, though. Real estate industry insiders have suggested lately that Mitsubishi is considering how to refinance.
"Is there a chance that they would look at alternate forms of financing?" Mr. Fontaine asked. "Absolutely. Are they doing it? I know they're not. And they haven't approached us."
When the center was built between 1932 and 1940 on the blocks from 48th to 51st Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues (now Avenue of the Americas), it was a modern marvel dressed in austere limestone with Art Deco twists. It included the golden statue of Prometheus as well as a mural by the Mexican artist Diego Rivera, which was eventually destroyed, reportedly because the Rockefeller family was horrified that it depicted Lenin. The original buildings were joined by added constructions and purchases through 1973.
The center was built by the Rockefellers on land owned by Columbia University. For years, the Rockefellers paid rent on the land, and then, in 1984, they bought it. Because Columbia and the Rockefeller Group had agreed on the previous land lease in the last real estate depression in 1973, with a 21-year renegotiation clause, many leases were written to expire in 1994 -- when market conditions would presumably have changed.
 
Expected a Bonanza
 The latest chapter in the center's 65-year history began in the white-hot real estate market seven years ago, when the financial wizards were predicting that the buildings' office rents on new and renewed leases would soar to an average $74 a square foot by 1993. Instead, because of the real-estate crash that followed the overbuilding of the 1980's, rents are about $31 a square foot.
To make the deal more attractive when the public real estate investment trust was created in 1985, the REIT was given an option, effective in 2000, to convert the $1.3 billion mortgage to a 71 percent equity share of the ownership of the Rockefeller Group or to switch the loan to floating-rate notes due in 2007 and leave 100 percent ownership with the Rockefeller Group. While majority ownership of the properties sounded enticing at the time, it may not be so if the market remains weak.
Four years after the REIT was created, the Rockefeller family was able to take more money out of the properties when Mitsubishi paid $846 million for a 51 percent interest in the Rockefeller Group, followed by a $527 million investment for another 29 percent. That deal occurred just as the market was poised for its crash.
Officials at Mitsubishi Estate, which is intensely private, did not return several telephone calls seeking comment on Rockefeller Center finances or their plans. At the Rockefeller Group, which manages the properties through a subsidiary, the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation, there was no comment on substantive issues.
Mr. Fontaine dismissed the likelihood that Mitsubishi would walk away from its investment. By doing so, he said, the Mitsubishi-Rockefeller owners would forfeit a $200 million letter of credit, an estimated $175 million for a special tax on forgiveness of debt and all rights to any piece of the center.
As the REIT moves through these difficult times, it is also going through a fundamental change in its relationship with the Rockefeller Group. On June 1, Mr. Fontaine, who also served as vice president and treasurer of the Rockefeller Group, left that position, becoming an employee solely of the REIT.
All other REIT officers also resigned their Rockefeller Group positions, in a move Mr. Fontaine said was intended to emphasize the arm's-length relationship between the public and private companies. In April, David Rockefeller also resigned as a director of the REIT.
In the same vein, the REIT, which has shared offices with the Rockefeller Group in the Simon & Schuster Building at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, is moving out -- to a 3,000-square-foot new office in 1270 Avenue of the Americas, two blocks north, where Mr. Fontaine says he got "a market deal" on the rent. Thus, the REIT joined the train of other tenants looking at lease renewals in 1994 because of a twist of history.
And despite the upheavals, the analysts' view of the REIT is by no means unanimous. While Alex. Brown has rated the REIT as a sell or a hold since 1985, the Boston-based Penobscot Group discounts the possibility of a default and is less pessimistic. Penobscot issued a report in May saying, "We continue to rate shares a buy at or below a price of $7 a share."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies on Prospects Of German Rate Reductions

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rallied to a three-month high against the German mark yesterday on continued expectations of a reduction in German interest rates.
The gains spilled into other currencies, giving the dollar a broad-based lift. But some traders cautioned that the move up seemed driven mainly by speculators and technical factors and the market could face a correction in the near term. 
 Gold, meanwhile, edged higher in New York after soaring overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery rose 70 cents a troy ounce, settling at $371.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for spot gold of $370, up $1.
The rally of the dollar came even though the German central bank failed to cut one of its short-term interest rates during its regular weekly repurchase operations yesterday. Many in the market thought a cut would signal the intention of the Bundesbank to ease its widely watched discount rate at its biweekly policy-making meeting today.
But a widespread belief persisted that the central bank would ease the rates at its next meeting on July 1, said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
 
Pressure Intensifies
 By easing rates in two weeks, the bank could help stimulate the ailing German economy without appearing to bow to political and market pressures for an imminent rate cut, Mr. Malpede said.
The pressure intensified yesterday amid reports that the German economy was expected to shrink in the second quarter of 1992. The reports, which were attributed to an unnamed German Government official, helped push the dollar through the important 1.6500-mark level in early New York trading.
The dollar ended trading in New York at 1.6570 marks, up more than a pfennig from 1.6460 marks late Tuesday. The last time the dollar closed that high in New York was on March 17, when it finished at 1.6620 marks.
The dollar was also quoted at 106.45 Japanese yen in New York, up from 105.75 yen late Tuesday. And the British pound fell to $1.5050, from $1.5155 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose Only 2.4% During May

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Builders broke ground for new homes at only a modestly faster pace in May, despite a reported early-spring sales boom and a rise in construction jobs, the Commerce Department reported today.
The somewhat disappointing 2.4 percent rise in housing starts meant this crucial sector is likely to contribute almost nothing to gross domestic product for the April-June quarter despite the lowest mortgage rates in about 20 years and a reversal of lumber prices that soared over the winter. 
 Moreover, analysts noted that permits for future home construction edged up a scant 1.2 percent last month.
 
 
Expecting Better
 "We've been expecting a better sort of snapback" following a poor, storm-ravaged first quarter, David F. Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said.
In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve said industrial production climbed two-tenths of 1 percent last month, a lackluster rise but about what had been expected based on job and workweek statistics reported in early June.
Two of the depressants on housing, which is considered a predictive indicator of the economy at large, are thought to be some lingering effects of the doubling of lumber prices between October and March and the expiration of tax incentives to build apartments for the poor. Yet these seem considerably outweighed by general uncertainty among potential buyers.
The rise in starts for May, to an annual pace of 1,244,000, was almost entirely accounted for by single-family homes. A small gain in buildings with two to four dwelling units was offset by a decline for apartment houses containing five or more units.
"What we're looking at is steady if unspectacular increases on the single-family side and continued weakness on the multifamily side," Mark Obrinsky, senior economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, said. "I would expect to see more of this" in coming months.
The Commerce Department today revised upward, to 8.1 percent from 6.7 percent, its estimate of the starts gain for April while reporting that the March decline, 4.7 percent, was even steeper than had been thought.
Regionally, starts in May were mixed, with the Midwest and South posting gains of 10.2 and 2.8 percent, respectively, while the West had a 3.3 percent decline. The Northeast showed a negligible decline.
New England and California, Mr. Seiders predicted, would continue to be among the weakest markets.
Permits, which some specialists regard as a more reliable statistical indicator of current -- but not future -- activity, were also mixed last month. The 1.2 percent rise, following a 6.5 percent April spurt, occurred mainly in the Midwest and to a lesser extent in the Northeast. The South and West, on the other hand, recorded small declines.
 
 
Earlier Reports
 May's limited gain in starts seemed to belie earlier reports that sales of new homes soared 22.7 percent for the month, leaving inventories at the lowest point since the early 1970's, and that construction jobs rose 103,000 in April and May.
Although industrial production was up only a lackluster two-tenths of 1 percent, output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities has now risen for eight straight months -- the longest such string in a decade.
The operating rate at industrial companies remained unchanged in May, at 81.6 percent.
Manufacturing production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May. Production of durable goods -- big ticket items ranging from computers to cars -- edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, while nondurable goods output advanced three-tenths of 1 percent. Mining output jumped half of 1 percent. A 1 percent rise in oil and gas drilling helped offset a 2 percent drop in coal mining. Output at utilities fell three-tenths of 1 percent.

Good Demand Seen for Trump Notes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
He is still Donald J. Trump. He still has financial problems and a history of stinging his bondholders. But it appears that his re-entry into the bond market with two issues backed by the Trump Plaza casino may be greeted with a lot of demand.
And if this is the case, Mr. Trump's bankers are probably going to be very happy. Because instead of accepting securities with no immediate interest payments they will walk away with cash. 
 People connected with the offering said the demand for the most controversial part of the new offering -- $60 million in payment-in-kind notes that could have a yield around 15 percent -- might be strong enough that the $25 million that Mr. Trump's bank creditors had been expected to hold could now be sold to the public.
"That real possibility does exist," said one official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. But he said Mr. Trump was the one who had to decide if the notes the banks were to take could be sold to the public.
That decision is expected to be made today, when the entire $385 million deal is expected to be priced.
Last night, the Casino Control Commission approved Mr. Trump's plan.
Some analysts said they expected the demand for these notes to come from high-yield mutual funds, which are becoming more popular with small investors looking for better returns at a time when interest rates are low.
Under the deal, there are $325 million in eight-year mortgage notes due in 2001, $10 million more than had been planned earlier this week. While there are portfolio managers who will not touch them because of Mr. Trump's bankruptcies, there has been a pretty good reception nonetheless. One reason is the apparent bottoming of the recession in the casino industry. Another is that the notes are a first mortgage on the casino and it appears, using current numbers, that the assets are there to cover the mortgage.
"Would I lend Donald Trump money on an unsecured basis? No," said one protfolio manager considering the offer, which is handled by the lead underwriter, Merrill Lynch. "But if he has a good property to secure it, I have to look."
The talk in the market yesterday was that the mortgage bonds would yield around 11.25 percent.
But it is the second part of the deal that has raised eyebrows, because of the risks that some analysts argue that it carries for investors given its design and Mr. Trump's history. That is $60 million in 10-year payment-in-kind notes.
A payment-in-kind note allows the issuer to pay the interest by issuing new notes with the face value of the interest owed. In the Trump deal, payment-in-kind can be made for the first eight years on the 10-year note. To make the notes more attractive they come with a warrent that allows the holder to get an additional $1,000 for each original $5,000 payment-in-kind note at no additional cost.
The payment-in-kind notes are expected to be priced to yield 150 basis points more than the yield on the mortgage notes, which means about 12.75 percent. The added value from the warrants increases the effective yield to around 15 percent, analysts said.
If the demand some underwriters were hearing about yesterday holds it may be possible to sell $60 million of these notes to the public instead of the $35 million anticipated in the most recent prospectus for the issue.
The manager who is considering buying the mortgage bonds said he would not go near the payment-in-kind notes. "These PIK's tend to be Pacmen; they tend to eat companies," he said. The official who indicated that the demand for the PIK's was growing acknowledged that there were negative views about the notes.
"That is what makes a market," he added.
 
Corporate Bonds

Time Warner Inc., in another move to pare its debt burden, yesterday sold $2.1 billion of liquid yield option notes, known as Lyons. The notes are zero-coupon bonds that are convertible into Time-Warner stock.
The deal, done through Merrill Lynch, raises about $782 million for the company. The 20-year discounted notes were priced at $372.43 per $1,000 of face value. They pay no interest but the holder gets the $1,000 of the face value at maturity. They are also convertible into Time-Warner stock at $48 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $36.75, down 50 cents.
 
Treasury Market

There was little action in the Treasury market yesterday. The price of the 30-year bond was up 4/32 as the yield dropped to 6.81 percent, from 6.82 percent Tuesday. The prices of Treasury notes were also little changed.
Investors seemed to be taking a break after digesting the good news on inflation in May that came with the report that the Producer Price Index was unchanged last month and the Consumer Price Index was up only one-tenth of 1 percent.
Lawrence Lindsay, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, may have unsettled a little of the good feeling on inflation with his remarks to the National Association of Business Economists in Washington. He told them "the deceleration of inflation has stopped."

HEADLINE: A Troubled Life Ends

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In a sense, Johnny Ray Cromartie never really left his old neighborhood. In 1971, his mother moved the family out of its apartment at 147th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem, but Johnny kept going back.
It was in that neighborhood, dotted with trash-strewn vacant lots and buildings long missing their window panes, that he had most of his numerous run-ins with the law in the 1970's. People in the area recall that in recent years, a time when he stayed out of trouble, the heavy-set, soft-spoken man still came around regularly. 
 And it was there, a block away from the apartment where he grew up, that on May 22, Johnny Cromartie, 40 years old, was arrested for the last time. Two and a half days later, he died in police custody at New York Downtown Hospital, under sharply disputed circumstances. The Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, has ruled the death a homicide, the result of a severe beating by the police and his inability to breathe properly in the face-down position in which officers had put him.
His death has once again focused attention on the Police Department's handling of suspects in custody, and led to questions about whether officers used excessive force in subduing a man who, a lawyer for the family says, may have been having an epileptic seizure. But just as the facts of Mr. Cromartie's death remain a mystery, so do the details of his life.
His face was familiar to the men who congregate outside Shop Mart Deli Grocery at the intersection where he was arrested. But the men, who would not give their names, knew little about him and nothing of his home life. "He kept to himself," one said. "He didn't say much."
Though Mr. Cromartie lived with his mother, Laura C. Pruitt, a nurse's aide, in a small, neat apartment in the Abraham Lincoln Houses in East Harlem, she confessed to having little knowledge of how her son passed his days. "He never hung around here," she said.
Seated in her living room, surrounded by plants, family photos and prints of Bible scenes, Mrs. Pruitt, 61, described the second of her three sons as a friendly but quiet man -- an account supported by her neighbors. He sometimes did cleaning work, she said, but was unemployed when he died. Five years younger than his brother Curtis and 10 years older than his brother Gregory, Johnny Cromartie was not particularly close to either one, she said.
 
Bouts With Epilepsy
 While not a stellar student, he liked to read and did fairly well at Benjamin Franklin High school, graduating in 1971, she recalled.
Mr. Cromartie developed epilepsy as a young man but controlled it with daily medication, although he had a few serious seizures that landed him in the hospital for a few days, his mother said.
He liked to draw and did it well -- an aspect of his life that the regulars of his old neighborhood knew nothing about. Hanging on a wall in his bedroom, whose windows look out over the East River, is one of his works, a portrait of the music duo Ashford and Simpson.
Mr. Cromartie was married in 1980, but members of his family insist that he never lived with Teresa Cromartie and had not seen her in years. Attempts to reach Mrs. Cromartie, who has filed a notice of claim with the city for an $11 million lawsuit over her husband's death, were unsuccessful.
Mrs. Pruitt refused to discuss either her son's criminal record or suggestions that he was an alcoholic. Despite her insistence that he "never bothered anybody," as a young man he was frequently in trouble with the law.
By 1977, at age 24, Mr. Cromartie had been arrested eight times and convicted once of a felony weapons charge and three times of misdemeanors. In 1980, he pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery, his second felony conviction, and served more than three years of a prison sentence of three to six years. But between a 1984 arrest, on a narcotics charge that was later dismissed, and his final arrest his record was clean.
"As you can see, he was no Boy Scout," said Suzanne Trazoff, the Police Department's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information.
But the prevailing interpretation of his record in his old neighborhood was markedly different. "Around here, if you're a black man, you get arrested," one man said. "The most amazing thing is he didn't get in trouble for nine years."
At 12:09 P.M. on Saturday, May 22, Mr. Cromartie was picked up by the police at the corner of Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 146th Street. An officer called Mrs. Pruitt that day and told her that her son was in jail. "That was the last I heard from them until they told me he was dead," she said.
The next day, at the Central Booking Unit in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Cromartie suffered a seizure, and at 5:35 P.M. was taken to the New York Downtown Hospital emergency room. From there the story become murky.
Ms. Trazoff said she knows only that Mr. Cromartie was admitted to the hospital the following evening. A law-enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after treatment at the emergency room, the prisoner was returned to jail on Sunday night, then taken to the hospital again on Monday evening, after a second seizure.
A report filed by an officer says that at 13 minutes after midnight on Tuesday, May 25, in hospital room 409, Mr. Cromartie became violent with officers Mose Walton and Richard DiCostanzo and tried to escape. It happened, Ms. Trazoff said, when the officer who had been on guard duty removed his handcuffs from Mr. Cromartie's wrists to turn him over to another officer.
Dr. Hirsch's report said that the prisoner was restrained for "agitated behavior consistent with delirium tremens," a condition symptomatic of alcohol withdrawal.
But C. Vernon Mason, Mrs. Pruitt's lawyer, suggested that what officers called combative behavior may have been yet another seizure. He and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who claims to have spoken with a witness whom he would not name, said there was no escape attempt. But they acknowledged, and law-enforcement officials confirmed, that the witness did not see the start of the beating.
The two officers called for assistance, and as many as five officers, whose names have not been released, responded, said a law-enforcement official who insisted on anonymity. Three minutes later, the report said, Mr. Cromartie was subdued. The official said he did not know what role Officers Walton and DiCostanzo played.
Citing the witness's account, Rev. Sharpton said that only two officers, both white, struck Mr. Cromartie, and that they shouted racial epithets at him.
Later that day, Mrs. Pruitt came home from work to find a note on her door asking her to call a police detective. "Regarding your son," it said. "Important." She called.
"They said he kept fighting the police and they had to restrain him and he went into cardiac arrest and he died," she said. "I told him, 'You all killed him. You killed my son.' "

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Risks For Clinton in His New Trade Policy Toward Japan.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FOR months, the Clinton Administration has been scolded for failing to spell out a trade policy toward Japan that went beyond rhetorical cheap shots. Now the White House has obliged, staking out a "results oriented" middle ground apparently calculated to disarm Japan-bashers without touching off a trade war.
From this limited perspective, the policy will probably succeed. Hard-core protectionists in Congress will be isolated, at least for the moment. And while the Japanese Government is unhappy with President Clinton's casual dismissal of what it views as major concessions negotiated with the Bush and Reagan Administrations, Japan has a facility for making lemonade out of lemons. "There is absolutely no question the talks will be successful," assured Hiromoto Seki, the consul general of Japan in New York. 
 But that is modest comfort to embattled defenders of free trade, who see the demands for specific targets for import penetration of the Japanese market as a step toward the cartelization of global markets. And it may yet backfire on President Clinton, who could lose control of trade policy to Congress and shore up the waning influence of "Japan Inc." Most ominous perhaps, it could stem the torrent of Japanese capital financing economic development from Malaysia to Maui.
Putting the best face on it, Mr. Clinton is only following the path of Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush. All were free traders. But all balanced the political necessity of appeasing domestic industries against the broader national interest in open trade and close ties with the other industrial democracies.
The best face, though, is not the only face. Unlike his recent predecessors, President Clinton has signed on to the trendy view that governments can do better than flawed free markets -- that subtle Japanese barriers to imports leave Washington with little choice but to negotiate about results rather than process. And while the Administration rejects the description "managed trade," Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist from Columbia University and a senior adviser to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, argues that Mr. Clinton's team is "weaseling over terminology."
Whatever you call it, does it constitute a step backward? Nothing Mr. Clinton wants could prove as costly as the restraints on auto and steel imports extorted from our trade partners over the last two decades in the name of realpolitik. Indeed, Administration sources proudly note that this White House will not front for inefficient industries looking for a free ride.
One catch, argues Gary Saxonhouse, a University of Michigan specialist in the Japanese economy, is that import targets meant only as benchmarks have a way of becoming quotas. The semiconductor accord with Japan negotiated by the Reagan Administration, he points out, merely stated that 20 percent penetration by foreign producers was "obtainable." But "every time a number is thrown around," Mr. Saxonhouse concludes, "it's treated as an agreement." And if the new targets are not met, the President will face enormous pressure from Congress to retaliate.
What is more, the only way Japan can enforce these "nonagreements" is to place "nonquotas" on purchases of American products by industries and commercial distributors. That might seem as natural as mom's sweet bean cake to the interlocking directorate of government bureaucrats and business barons who supposedly run Japan.
But Japan Inc. is not the monolith so dear to the imaginations of Michigan Congressmen and Michael Crichton. Coordination of business has never been as great as in, say, South Korea and probably is not much greater today than in France. Ironically, the emphasis on numerical targets would undermine the trend toward decentralization of the Japanese economy. "We would feed a system we do not like," Mr. Saxonhouse argues.
The other risk of the Clinton policy is that America may soon regret its successes in transforming Japan into a nation of world-class consumers. At least some members of the Administration understand that Japan's ballooning surplus earnings abroad, roughly 3 percent of national income, have little to do with import barriers and virtually everything to do with the Japanese recession. Aggressive spending and tax cuts -- the policy recommended by Washington and halfheartedly carried out by Tokyo -- would thus serve everyone's interest by increasing total output.
But once the Japanese economy again reaches full capacity, Tokyo will only be able to reduce its remaining foreign surplus by diverting savings going abroad into domestic consumption or investment. And if Japan does not generate a good chunk of the trillions of dollars needed to transform the third world and the former socialist economies into prosperous democracies, it is not clear who will.
From 1870 to 1914, Britain invested 5 percent of its national income overseas, helping to power a period of spectacular world growth. America and the European Community, natural heirs to the British role a century later, are actually net importers of capital. It would be sad if Japan, the only great economy that saves more than it invests at home, is bludgeoned into conformity at the expense of billions of poor people around the globe.

USAIR NOW SAYS IT EXPECTS LOSSES FOR QUARTER AND YEAR

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
USAir expects to report a loss for the second quarter and for the year, the company said yesterday. The airline company, based in Arlington, Va., cited "sluggish economic conditions" for its reversal of an earlier projection that it would be profitable for the current quarter, which ends on June 30. 
 "Although the company expects that results for 1993 and the second quarter will be considerably better than 1992 results, revenue increases at USAir in the month of May have not been as strong as expected due to sluggish economic conditions," said Seth E. Schofield, USAir's chief executive. On the New York Stock Exchange, USAir Group fell $1.75 a share, to $17.125.

Wanted: Summer Jobs for Teens

 BODY:
The latest national figures show an increase in job growth and a slight easing of the unemployment rate, from 7 to 6.9 percent. But the picture is not so rosy for teen-agers, particularly urban youths.
Nationwide, about 20 percent of teen-agers are unemployed. However, New York City officials report that 40 percent of city teens were jobless during the first three months of this year. That's about twice the rate of just two years ago -- and the highest recorded level in 25 years. 
 Entry-level job opportunities for teens have dropped sharply with the recession and demands for higher job skills. That's why the Summer Youth Employment Program, run by the city's Department of Employment, and Summer Jobs, run mainly by private groups, are important stepping stones toward employment. They give young people age 16 to 21 practical work experience and show them new possibilities for their lives.
But even as the need rises, the number of young people served by these programs may plummet below last year's level. New York City is likely to have 15,000 fewer public sector jobs this year because of Federal budget cuts.
That puts more pressure on private companies to help make up the difference. The Summer Jobs program is having difficulty matching last year's 42,500 private-sector jobs.
Even more jobs are needed this year to accommodate the 100,000 youths who have signed up to work. Giving them a boost in the job market could improve prospects for their future -- and the city's. Companies that need help -- and want to help -- are urged to call (212) 888-JOBS.

HEADLINE: Don't Treat Air Quality in Planes as a Luxury

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One step forward, two steps back. I was astonished to read "Frequent Fliers Saying Fresh Air Is Awfully Thin at 30,000 Feet" (front page, June 6), on the reduction of circulation of fresh air on newer airplanes. Just as we were permitted to breathe more freely when smoking was eliminated on short flights, we learn that the quality of the air in the cabins has been decreased. 
 Now, in addition to the normal stress of travel, those prone to headaches and the nausea of motion sickness will have to worry about not getting enough fresh air.
Migraine and its associated symptoms of visual disturbance and nausea are a very common human ailment. It is well known by physicians that migraine syndrome or vascular headaches can be triggered by several different stimuli such as reduced levels of oxygen, pollutants, toxic fumes and certain foods.
In addition, you cite studies stating that decreased circulation of fresh air may increase the rate of transmission of contagious respiratory infections among passengers.
Air quality on and off the ground should be a primary concern to all of us. With all of the discussion regarding health care in our country, our best method of cost containment is preventive medicine. Whether or not airline officials have received a "significant increase in passenger complaints" should not be an argument for ignoring air quality on airplanes.
I would hope the scientists and business people of the airline industry would put passenger health above economic considerations. In any case, air quality should be a top-priority item regulated by the Government, not subject to entrepreneurial dynamics.

HEADLINE: Minimum Tax Closes Corporate Loopholes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Liberals Fight Clinton Plan to Ease Tax on Companies" (Business Day, June 10) states: 
 "For many large companies, the best news about President Clinton's economic package is a little-known frighteningly complex provision that would ease requirements for companies to pay a minimum tax when their profits fall to zero."
On the contrary, the point of the minimum tax is to tax profitable companies that report little or no taxable income because of loopholes in the regular corporate tax system.
For instance, last year, Texas Utilities reported more than $1 billion in profits to shareholders. Without the minimum tax, it would have paid no Federal income tax at all. Because of the minimum tax, the company paid $19.6 million -- better than nothing.
If the minimum tax is gutted, profitable corporate giants will again avoid paying any significant Federal income tax. The proposed change is a bad idea.

HEADLINE: Science Education Must Discover Real World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a graduate of the California Institute of Technology, I share the pain of the capable young men and women who find their futures clouded by the uncertainty in science and engineering careers (front page, June 6). Caltech and its sister institutions are in trouble. The roots of this problem are deep. 
 The first part of the problem is historical. Directly or indirectly, the Department of Defense, the national laboratories and the defense and space industry consumed more than half the scientists and engineers the universities produced. These national needs also affected research and teaching. Now that market for graduates has weakened, and they are the first to feel the pain.
The second part of the problem is the specialization within the universities. Caltech has virtually the same divisional structure as at its beginnings, seven decades ago. The highly specialized training this provides is good up to a point. However, it has to be complemented by interdisciplinary programs that address the broad problems of society. Caltech has generally shied away from these messier, real-world problems.
Caltech, other universities and related institutions must re-examine their roles. Scientific and engineering skills are still needed for a myriad of problems, including preserving the environment, providing a sustainable economy and assuring human health and well-being. It is up to each institution to reorganize or redirect itself to meet these needs, before its graduates are no longer marketable.
At the same time, Federal policy in science and applied technology has to share the risk taking with the universities. The Government needs to reorganize and redirect the way it provides Federal supporting funds. Without Federal flexibility and vision, initiative from the universities will not succeed.

HEADLINE: Let's Stop Using 'Liberal' as a Dirty Word

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 6 front-page report of a New York Times/CBS News poll finding that most Americans view President Clinton as "liberal" was incomplete and carried a hidden bias. While the poll indicates a growing perception of the President as liberal, another message seeps through: "liberal" as negative. 
 You are encouraging an ill-informed and reactionary "liberal equals marginal" stance that does not reflect the diversity and strength of liberal belief. I do not think you would so blithely present contrasting ideological viewpoints in this light. One cannot imagine your giving such a spin to "conservative."
I was pleased that you analyzed the poll extensively, including the figures that show negative opinions on Congress and Ross Perot. However, this was buried deep in the article, and a casual reader would simply absorb the bias of the first few paragraphs.
A large segment of the American political body is progressive and unapologetically liberal. To many of us, President Clinton's cautious and constantly revised budget does not go nearly far enough. With the President's tendency to placate the right, buttressed by the incessant howling of commentators about the deficit, this view gets little acknowledgment.
We do not all see the deficit as the monster in a cage, isolated and hungry, that needs to be starved into submission. The deficit is the symptom of a complicated accumulation of deficits that we have been subsisting on as a society, most ravenously for the last 12 years. These are deficits in our national body: the drains left open on our educational system, our cultural systems, our health system, our environment itself.
We cannot just "attack" the deficit, a phrase deliberately disarming in its simplicity. We have to rebuild, reprioritize, reorder and deepen our understanding of the integration of all citizens in the economic and cultural system. President Clinton's original stimulus plan was a hesitant step in the right direction; a cautious testing of the public waters we are swimming in. It was quickly drowned.
I hope to see more trenchant and ideologically honest analysis from you.

Starring in Tocqueville's Crystal Ball

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Commager on Toqueville
By Henry Steele Commager
130 pages. University of Missouri Press. $24.95.
Henry Steele Commager's brilliant new interpretation of Alexis de Tocqueville's "Democracy in America" offers this astute comment: "He had an instinct for the jugular vein in history." 
 The same can be said for Dr. Commager, the author of major works on the American mind and dream and now professor emeritus of history at Amherst College. For in "Commager on Tocqueville," our premier historian allows the reader to see America today through the critical vision of Commager on Commager.
Pulling no punches, Dr. Commager achieves three things in his invaluable little book. He makes us want to read or reread Tocqueville's 1835 classic, he tells us what's lasting and what's flawed about "Democracy in America" and, more than many of the historians in academe, he speaks out about some imperfections of the United States.
As a historical icon, Tocqueville is generally more cited than read. He could be quaint as well as prescient, better on the political system than on the people. Prepare to be chided if you quote this Tocqueville sentence -- from his chapter titled "The Young Woman as a Wife" -- to a feminist: "In America a woman loses her independence forever in the bonds of matrimony." He can hardly be blamed for failing to anticipate the current society-page phrase "the bride will retain her name."
But selective quotations are always unfair, including Tocqueville's famous but isolated paragraph predicting that the future belonged to America and Russia because "each of them seems to be marked out by the will of heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe." To which Dr. Commager adds that Tocqueville accurately predicted "the Americanization of the Old World," but he foresaw it as impending only within his own lifetime.
"Commager on Tocqueville" explores five areas Tocqueville raised but did not always answer: democracy and the tyranny of the majority, the price of a just society, centralization and democracy, the military in a democracy and the contradictions between political equality and economic inequality. While showing great respect for Tocqueville's profound interpretations of America, Dr. Commager uses these areas as taking-off points for his own humane and liberal views.
It's been a long turning from the Age of Andrew Jackson in the 1830's to the Age of President Clinton in the 1990's, but Dr. Commager finds that Tocqueville's ideas, if not his high standards, remain as instructive today as they were a century and a half ago. Admittedly, Tocqueville's sources of information were inadequate and often misleading: "He made it a point to meet the best people, and the best people, then as now, were inclined to deprecate democracy." Yet Dr. Commager emphasizes that Tocqueville, the aristocrat, admired America's egalitarian government and society.
Balancing equality and justice in modern America, here is Commager on Commager in some of his most challenging words: "We were vindictive toward those who refused to fight in a war in Vietnam that they thought unjust and immoral, but we do not always prosecute those agents of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose business it is to enforce the law, for the countless crimes they committed -- committed with official approval, to be sure -- nor did we prosecute those who improperly gave their approval. Is there one justice for the citizen and another for those who regard themselves as rulers above the law, not servants of the people and of the law?"
Tocqueville was certain that war and the military would endanger liberty and democracy in the New World. Here, too, Dr. Commager finds Tocqueville capable of looking into the future. "And though Tocqueville could not possibly have foreseen the form that militarism would take in the era of the military-industrial complex," Dr. Commager says, "he did somehow apprehend that war would increasingly involve business and manufacturers and that inevitably the state and the interests that provided the materials for war would become mixed-up and interdependent."
But Dr. Commager doesn't simply place the blame on the American military for the military-industrial complex during the cold war. He follows up Tocqueville's fear that militarism would harm a democratic Government by pointing to civilian-led administrations in Washington that assumed "something of the military character" and were responsible for creating what he calls the national security state.
Again, Commager boldly on Commager: "It was President Truman who formulated the doctrine that led the United States to replace Britain in the Near and Middle East, and Truman, too, who made the decision to enter the Korean War. It was Eisenhower who sent warships and marines to Lebanon, Kennedy who launched the Bay of Pigs. Kennedy, too, was in part responsible for the initial ventures into Vietnam, which under the guiding and misguiding hands of Presidents Johnson and Nixon escalated into a major war."
Dr. Commager builds on Tocqueville's vision of a democratic society by calling for the next egalitarian goal: a just society in the United States and for the rest of the world. He proposes that international agencies and regulatory commissions, not "some abstract thing called 'world government,' " should handle such basic concerns as the environment, health, nourishment, agriculture and "a hundred other problems that no one nation can possibly solve and which unsolved will affect every nation."
In an eloquent conclusion to a book whose only flaw is that it lacks an index, Dr. Commager writes that the United States should recover the "moral and practical leadership," which inspired Tocqueville in the last century and which existed during times of crisis up to the middle of the 20th century.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Suspends Results of Vote That Was to Restore Democracy

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, June 16

 BODY:
Nigeria's planned return to civilian rule was suspended today when a commission appointed by the military leaders set aside the results of Saturday's presidential elections.
There had been growing indications that the candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Moshood Abiola, was well on his way to a resounding triumph over his rival, Bashir Tofa, of the National Republican Convention. Both had campaigned against military rule. 
 The vote had been heralded by many Nigerians as a historic end to nearly a decade of military rule in Africa's most populous nation.
 
Hope Tainted by Skepticism
 The election was to be only the third time since independence from Britain in 1960 that a president would rise to office through the ballot box and not through military action.
But even before today's announcement, there had been considerable skepticism over whether the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, was committed to democratic rule.
[This skepticism was reflected in Washington. Though the State Department had no official comment on the election, some Administration officials said they were not surprised that problems had arisen.
[While they said they had no reason to believe that General Baba ngida was directly involved in the delay of the return to democracy, "there is a lot of cynicism about the process that has grown up," one official said, "sort of a dark apprehension that it would never happen."]
 
'A Hidden Agenda'
 Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, said today that he had long suspected General Babangida was stalling the shift to civilian rule. "He's always had a hidden agenda," to remain in power, Dr. Ransome-Kuti said.
General Babangida has postponed a return to civilian rule three times since 1990, and the military authorities have annulled a number of gubernatorial and parliamentary elections, saying they had been compromised by financial improprieties and vote-buying.
Since independence, there have been seven successful coups and three of the nation's eight leaders have been assassinated. Two brief periods of civilian rule collapsed after allegations by the military of incompetence and wholesale corruption.
 
A General's Promise
 Still, General Babangida has said repeatedly in recent speeches and interviews that come what may, the military will return to its barracks on Aug. 27, the eighth anniversary of the coup that brought him to power.
Nigeria, with about 90 million people and more than 250 tribal groups, has always been difficult to govern. From 1967 to 1970, the nation was mired in a war to quell secessionists among the mostly Ibo peoples in the Eastern Region known as Biafra.
Despite its great natural resources -- Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer -- the country remains basically poor; per-capita income in 1991 was $250.
The suspension of the election results came in response to a suit filed by the Association for a Better Nigeria, a lobbying group of wealthy business executives, politicians and military officers who have led a highly visible campaign urging General Babangida to remain in office at least four more years.
The association asserted that the transition to civilian rule had been compromised by widespread vote-tampering and corruption, and on Tuesday the group won a court order instructing the national electoral commission not to release election results.
Justice Mohamveg Saleh, the chief judge of the high court in Abuja, the capital, ordered the commission not to publish the results until legal arguments over vote-rigging were heard by the court.
This process could take months, effectively nullifying the election and keeping the military in power.
This morning Humphrey Nwosu, the chairman of the commission, reportedly met with his staff and officials from the President's office to decide how to respond. Late this afternoon Mr. Nwosu issued a statement saying, in effect, that the Government had no choice but to suspend the elections or face being held in contempt of court.
Mr. Nwosu added that he would appeal the court's jurisdiction over the electoral process.
 
Details of Charges
 The association's suit charged, among other things, that officials of the Social Democratic Party had bribed delegates to the party's nominating convention to vote for Mr. Abiola. It also said that the campaigns of both presidential candidates had increased tension among Nigeria's many ethnic and religious groups, and that if an election were to occur now, it would was likely to "lead to chaos and a breach of public peace."
It was difficult to assess the accusations.
Many neutral Nigerian analysts said they were not persuaded that these assertions constituted proof of systematic fraud or posed a threat to security. Foreign observers have generally described the elections as free and fair.
Even though the decision to set aside the election results stunned many, the reaction among people milling in Lagos's crowded streets and in bars and restaurants tonight was subdued.
Salle Lamido, of the Social Democratic Party, said on state television tonight, "The court order is very, very contradictory and that shows the futility of the entire thing. The court has not been fair. I believe at the end of the day justice will prevail."

HEADLINE: Report Describes Jordan's Aid to Iraq During War

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
As King Hussein of Jordan prepares to meet for the first time with President Clinton on Friday, a Congressional report has confirmed that during the Persian Gulf war, Jordan was simultaneously receiving American military aid and helping Iraq by giving it American technolgy and intelligence information.
While many of the allegations about Jordan's cooperation with neighboring Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait and during the gulf war in 1991 have been known, the recently declassified report provides new concrete evidence about the depth of the relationship between the two countries, despite United Nations sanctions against Iraq. 
 The report also confirms allegations that the Bush Administration misled Congress when it sent $550 million in military equipment to Jordan's official shipping company despite the State Department's assurances to Congress that such aid had stopped. The report also questions public assertions by Bush Administration officials that except for some oil imports from Iraq, Jordan was in compliance with United Nations sanctions against Baghdad.
The report, citing American intelligence officials, says Jordan shared intelligence from the American-led coalition and Israel with Iraq, gave Iraq access to American technology and conducted joint military training exercises with Iraq. It also says Iraq bought military spare parts from Jordan.
"U.S. intelligence services verified four types of Jordanian and Iraqi military cooperation during the gulf crisis," the report said. "These activities included joint training exercises with Iraq, two cases of providing access to U.S. technology, one case of purchasing spare parts and one case dealing with the sharing of coalition and Israeli intelligence information."
The report did not say what technology was sent to Iraq or describe the nature of the shared intelligence.
The report was prepared last fall by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, for the House Foreign Operations appropriations subcommittee, but its classified annex was declassified only this month. The subcommittee released the G.A.O. report today.
Both the State Department and the Jordanian Government have taken issue with the G.A.O. report.
Marwan Muasher, spokesman for the Jordanian Embassy, said: "These allegations are untrue, and the State Department itself disputes the accuracy of the report. We have made it very clear that categorically no military equipment has gone to Iraq after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. We don't put much importance on it."
Richard Boucher, a spokesman for the State Department, said tonight, "The G.A.O. report is not new. We have cooperated closely with members of Congress and answered their questions on the G.A.O. report. Not a single report of Jordanian trans-shipment of defense articles to Iraq has ever been verified. Our exhaustive efforts to follow up on the reports of Jordanian military assistance to Iraq have produced no conclusive evidence to support the original reports."
The report is potentially embarrassing for King Hussein, who is eager to mend the relationship with Washington that was damaged during the war.
At stake is military aid that was suspended by Congress after King Hussein made statements supporting Iraq when it invaded Kuwait. Jordan has already been given economic aid.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Jordanian aid to Iraq in the Persian Gulf war referred incompletely to the aid the United States has withheld from Jordan. Because of Jordan's support for Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, the United States is withholding $50 million in economic and military aid from fiscal 1992 and $26 million from fiscal 1993. Also because of an editing error, the article misstated the year of the Persian Gulf war in some editions. It was 1991, not 1992.

Banker Seeks Uses for Military Technology

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 16

 BODY:
Jon B. Kutler, an investment banker who has been raising money for military industry buyouts, hopes to use that expertise in his own company by hunting for aerospace technology that could be converted to civilian products.
In January, Mr. Kutler founded Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc. after leaving the Los Angeles office of the investment banking company Wasserstein, Perella & Company, which he had headed since 1988. 
 Quarterdeck will specialize in providing private capital for restructuring weak weapons makers and financing start-up businesses or military industry spinoffs. But there are two caveats: The target companies must use the military technology for commercial products and the manufacturing must be in Southern California.
"Our mission is a for-profit, public interest company," said Michael C. Lambert, the vice president of Quarterdeck and a former marketing vice president of Lear Siegler Inc., an aerospace company.
 
'A Private Market Solution'
 Quarterdeck has grown from a proposal Mr. Kutler made to a public-private Los Angeles committee convened to compensate for the loss of some 150,000 aerospace and weapons jobs in the region in the last five years.
"All their ideas focused on government spending," said Mr. Kutler, 36, a former Navy officer and a graduate of the Harvard Business School. "I tried to come up with a private market solution."
Clearly, the potential influence of Quarterdeck on steering the declining weapons industry toward commercial work would be small. "It's not going to cure California's unemployment problem, except very marginally," said Larry Korb, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a research organization in Washington.
Still, Quarterdeck could provide important assistance to military subcontractors, suppliers and engineering talent "that has been dumped on the street," said Jack Kyser, the chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles. They have often needed help identifying potential markets for technology, he said.
 
First Deal Announced
 Last week, Quarterdeck, which Mr. Kutler said was backed by a handful of private investors, announced its first deal, which he valued at less than $10 million.
The company acquired A+H International Inc., which makes Beeperkid, an electronic alarm device that activates when a child wanders 15 feet from a monitor, which is worn by an adult.
Though the product won an industrial design award last year, it had some technical flaws. Andrew Ha, the owner of A+H, had found a proprietary military technology that would have greatly improved Beeperkid, but he could not afford to license it. Quarterdeck could. Based on old orders and renewed interest by retailers, the company said it expected $7 million in sales of Beeperkid, which would be priced at less than $100, in 1994.
Mr. Kutler said military contractors rarely thought of the broader applications for their technology. "Most defense contractors don't know what they have," he said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND CONGRESS: Intelligence;
BUDGET CUT LIKELY FOR INTELLIGENCE

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Defying stern warnings from the Clinton Administration, Democrats in Congress are preparing to cut more than $1 billion from a White House intelligence budget request.
The cuts would leave the nation's intelligence agencies with only about as much money for next year as they were given by Congress this year. President Clinton had asked for an increase that would have outpaced inflation, contending that the national security requirements in the post-cold war era justified the steeper rise. 
 The Democratic lawmakers have generally agreed that intelligence programs provide cost-effective insurance against surprises in an unpredictable new world. But in turning aside Mr. Clinton's request, they have argued that the intelligence agencies must share some of the budget-cutting burden being borne by the military.
 
2 Budgets for Intelligence
 While the size of the nation's vast intelligence budget remains an official secret, Administration and Congressional officials say the White House request for an increase next year would bring it to well over $28 billion.
The cuts being endorsed by influential Democratic lawmakers would slash at least $500 million from each of the two proposed budgets that make up the overall intelligence program, reducing the overall White House proposal by about 4 percent.
A clear indicator of that Congressional sentiment came late this afternoon, Government officials said, when the House Intelligence Committee voted to cut about $1.2 billion from the White House request on the two budgets -- the National Foreign Intelligence Budget, which provides for the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency and other spy agencies, and the budget for Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities, which are run primarily by the military.
 
'Devastating Consequences'
 The final budgets voted on by Congress remain to be shaped by four more Congressional committees, which are not due to vote on the issue until next month at the earliest. But the Senate Intelligence Committee is also on track to cut the Administration request, and the House and Senate appropriations committees are likely to recommend even deeper cuts.
The Democratic-led defiance comes despite strong warnings from R. James Woolsey, who as Director of Central Intelligence has served as chief lobbyist for the Administration's request. Congressional officials have said that Mr. Woolsey has contended that cuts below the Administration's request could have "devastating consequences" on the ability of United States intelligence agencies to monitor developments around the world and to assess their significance.
In at least one private meeting, Mr. Woolsey warned members of Congress that the budget cuts could force him to eliminate a crucial intelligence operation, said Congressional officials who refused to describe the secret program. But they said Democrats who control the committees with power over the intelligence budgets had reacted with some skepticism to those contentions.
"I personally think it's part of the 'we'll close the Washington Monument' syndrome," said a prominent Congressional official, who said he and others had concluded that Mr. Woolsey's arguments "just don't fly."
 
Resigned to Cuts
 Administration officials who insisted on anonymity said today that Mr. Woolsey was now unlikely to repeat such complaints. They suggested that the White House had grown resigned to the prospect that its request would be cut.
The White House request for a budget increase had surprised some lawmakers because Mr. Clinton promised to cut intelligence spending by $7 billion over four years. The request is in classified sections of the Defense Department budget, in which it represents an exception to a plan outlining significant cuts in military spending.
But the Administration has contended that a short-term increase in intelligence spending is needed before the reductions can safely be made in the budgets of the C.I.A. and other spy agencies. Nearly all of the proposed spending for strategic programs would be devoted to launching spy satellites that can replace several older ones, Administration aides have said.
Because Congress cut the overall intelligence budget in fiscal year 1993 by $1.6 billion, from its 1992 level, its aversion to Mr. Clinton's request for an increase is not surprising. Some Administration officials have said they would regard themselves as lucky this year if Congress agreed simply not to cut the intelligence budget below its current level of about $27.5 billion.
The fact that the budget numbers are classified leaves Government officials reluctant to discuss them, and the figures they cite are sometimes contradictory. But estimates provided by officials from both the Administration and Capitol Hill make clear that Congress is poised to reject White House requests for increases in both budgets.
Mr. Clinton had asked Congress for authority to spend about $17.8 billion on the national programs next year, an increase from this year's final appropriation of about $17 billion. But the House Intelligence Committee today cut that request to about $17.3 billion, and its Senate counterpart is likely to recommend a slightly lower figure.
Until now, Mr. Clinton had been reported not to have sought substantially more money for the military's intelligence programs. But Congressional officials said he had in fact asked for an increase of $900 million over the current $10.1 billion, a request that the House committee cut today by about $600 million.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT SOFTENS OPPOSITION BY U.S. TO DIVIDED BOSNIA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
President Clinton signaled tonight that the United States might accept a partition of Bosnia that would allow the Serbs to keep land they seized by force, provided that Bosnian Muslims and Croats agreed to such a plan.
Mr. Clinton, speaking in the East Room of the White House at his first evening news conference, said he still preferred a "multi-ethnic state" in Bosnia. But he said for the first time that "if the parties themselves agree, genuinely and honestly agree, the United States would have to look very seriously" at the three-way partition plan proposed by the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia. [Excerpts from the news conference, page A19.]
 
Only Practical Solution
 Until tonight, the Clinton Administration said it would never endorse such an alteration of internationally recognized borders by force. But American officials now acknowledge that such partition is probably the only practical solution, given that neither Washington nor its European allies are ready to use force to hold Bosnia together and that the Bosnian Muslims do not have the power to do so alone. 
 Mr. Clinton's remarks come on the heels of declarations by America's European allies also supporting partition. An alternative peace plan for Bosnia that had won international support was declared dead today by its co-author, Lord Owen. [Page A8.]
 
Pressure on Muslims
 Together, those statements will generate heavy pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to accept some form of partition, even though it means ceding parts of their territory that the Serbs seized by a brutal campaign of "ethnic cleansing."
Mr. Clinton began his news conference, which was broadcast by only two of the four major television networks, with a 10-minute political speech promoting his economic programs. Returning to his campaign theme of soaking the rich, Mr. Clinton used four-color chart to make a case that he was determined to drive down the Federal budget deficit with spending cuts and taxes on the wealthy.
But he spent a large chunk of his television time discussing foreign affairs, trying to reassure Americans that his diplomacy in Bosnia and Somalia would not draw the United States into foreign quagmires. Using language drawn up during the afternoon in consultation with Gen. Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. Clinton declared that the United Nations military operation in Somalia had achieved its aims. He said General Powell had reported to him earlier Thursday that "this operation was over and that it was a success" even though the Somali warlord against whom it was directed was not captured by the United Nations forces.
Perhaps mindful of the trouble his predecessor, President Bush, had in his showdown with Iraq, Mr. Clinton went out of his way to try to avoid turning the Somali operation into a personal conflict between himself and the Somali warlord, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid.
"The United Nations, acting with the United States and other nations, crippled the forces in Mogadishu of warlord Aidid and remains on guard against further provocations," he said. "His forces were responsible for the worst attack on U.N. peacekeepers in three decades. We could not let it go unpunished."
Mr. Clinton, who went out of his way to avoid formal news conferences for most of the first months of his Presidency, has suddenly held three this week as he has finally received a small flood of good news and legislative successes.
This sudden interest in give and take with White House reporters reflected the strategy of his new communications adviser, David R. Gergen, who once used such prime time events to showcase his previous boss, President Reagan.
Mr. Clinton said that while his early months have been messy at times, his legislative agenda was moving forward. He cited the fact that various Congressional committees this week have made progress on his proposals for campaign finance reform, with voluntary spending limits for Congressional campaigns and a ban on contributions from political action committees, plus progress on the issues of national service, and $500 billion in deficit-reduction. These favorable developments followed closely on Mr. Clinton's nomination Monday of a Federal appeals judge. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to the Supreme Court, a choice hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike.
In his opening statement, Mr. Clinton listed a string of what he called successes for his Administration, emphasizing the recent military action in Somalia and the progress of his budget proposal.
With the first question, however, he had to shift from a focus on areas of progress to the thornier topic of the war in Bosnia.
 
Not 'the Way I Hoped'
 Asked about the Croatian-Serbian plan to carve Bosnia into three ethnic states, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the plan would grant to Serbia territory captured by force. The crisis in the region, he said, "has not been resolved in the way I would have hoped."
But he said the reward to Serbia reflected the inadequacy of a Bush Administration arms embargo that gave Serbian forces an advantage in the war. He called the ethnic fighting in the region "perhaps our most difficult foreign policy problem."
Turning to Somalia, Mr. Clinton said troops under United Nations command had "crippled the forces" under General Aidid and would remain on guard against further provocation in the Somali capital.
 
'Heroism Knew No Flag'
 "In this battle, heroism knew no flag," Mr. Clinton said of the United Nations response, which has involved air strikes by United States AC-130H gunships and a ground operation by United Nations forces today.
The President was asked whether General Aidid had been captured. Mr. Clinton said that he had not been, but that military forces were seeking his arrest. If when he is captured, Mr. Clinton said, "the United Nations will have to determine what action to take."
"The purpose of the operation was to undermine the capacity of Aidid to wreck havoc in Mogadishu," said Mr. Clinton, adding that the general was responsible for the recent attack that killed 23 Pakistani soldiers.
While General Aidid remains at large in Mogadishu, Mr. Clinton rejected a suggestion that his declaration of victory was somehow incomplete. He said there was "a big difference" between the situation in Somalia and the one the United States faced in the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Hussein remained in power in Iraq.
 
Could Tolerate Aidid
 Mr. Clinton stressed that General Aidid does not control the Government of Somalia and insisted that his elimination had never been an objective of the United States or the United Nations. He suggested that the United Nations would tolerate General Aidid if he proves willing to live in peace and said his fate would depend on "what he does in the future."
Regarding Haiti, the President said he still believed there would never be peace and democracy there without a multi-national force, which both the Haitian Government and the opposition have rejected.
"I have always assumed, to facilitate democracy in Haiti, there would have to be a multi-national force there," he said.
But Mr. Clinton added that economic sanctions approved by the United Nations "will make a difference."
 
Balkan Update
 One of the chief mediators for the BALKANS, Lord Owen, conceded yesterday in GENEVA that his plan for 10 semiautonomous provinces in BOSNIA has failed, and he urged Muslims to negotiate with the Serbs and Croats over their alternative plan to divide the country into three parts.
In VIENNA, Foreign Minister Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia sought a United Nations emergency session to "prevent the dismemberment" of Bosnia.
United Nations officials, preparing for a countrywide cease-fire for noon Friday, said it was unrealistic to expect the guns to go silent right away.
United Nations monitors were finally allowed to enter GORAZDE after waiting three weeks. They reported heavy damage. New clashes were reported near the Bosnian towns of TESANJ, MAGLAJ, TUZLA, GRADACAC, and BRCKO. Bosnia Serb forces continued their bombardment of in SARAJEVO.
In BONN, Radio Free Europe said it had gotten the go-ahead to turn its transmitters toward the former YUGOSLAVIA.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND CONGRESS: The Budget;
Democrats Pushing Plan Toward a Vote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Shrugging off Republican accusations that they were raising taxes and cutting services for millions of Americans, the 11 Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee today started muscling the first big chunk of President Clinton's budget toward a Senate vote and enactment into law.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton focused on shielding his budget from further attacks within his own party. At a televised news conference, he said he was "drawing the line" on more concessions to conservatives in Congress who, he said, would lower the deficit by cutting deeply into Federal benefit programs rather than taking the money from the well-off. 
 While Republicans have proposed deeper cuts in Federal programs, it was conservative Democrats on the Finance Committee who built additional cuts into the Senate version of his plan. Some of them had threatened to block the budget entirely unless their demands were granted.
 
Call for Fairness
 Mr. Clinton labored to put some space between himself and those lawmakers, saying sharply that he "did not negotiate" the version of the budget now before the Finance Committee, and that "you know where I have been on the issues."
"We can't simply balance the budget on the backs of the old, the sick, the veterans, and those who work hard but are just barely making ends meet," Mr. Clinton said. "It's not right."
The President nevertheless praised the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, for what he called a remarkable job of moving the budget package toward a Senate vote.
Mr. Moynihan's committee spent a full day today explaining and debating the five-year package, which is dominated by a near-record tax increase of $249 billion and a $67 billion paring back of the explosive growth of Medicare spending. They were expected to approve the measure and send it to the full Senate for a final vote on Friday.
Today, the panel's nine Republicans harangued the Democrats mercilessly on those issues, and others. The Senate's Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, dropped by to complain that the Democrats were raising taxes on Social Security benefits "to be used for social investments." A Missouri Republican, Senator John C. Danforth, accused them of playing a shell game with the expiration dates of tax breaks in a "gimmick" to make spending seem smaller than it is.
 
Attack Over Medicare
 Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who ran the Finance Committee when the last major tax bill passed in 1986, assailed them for "taking one more whack" at Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals instead of raising Medicare premiums for the well-off.
Most of all, the Republicans groused about being left out of the real negotiations over the budget, which the committee's Democrats thrashed out among themselves and behind closed doors during two wrenching weeks that ended on Wednesday evening.
The Democrats politely ignored them, and rejected an initial effort to amend the bill before recessing for the night. Their unanimity insures that the budget bill will make it through the Finance Committee and to the Senate floor, where the Democrats hold a more comfortable 56-to-44 majority. A vote there, almost surely to pass the bill, is expected next week.
Mr. Clinton praised Congress's action this week on his deficit reduction plan, his national service program and campaign finance overhaul as "an impressive and important series of victories" for the nation. But he saved his most forceful words for his economic plan.
Pointing to a series of charts reminiscent of Ross Perot's television lectures, the President tried to cast the debate over his program in terms of stark terms of fairness toward the poor and middle class.
Declaring that Congress had made "remarkable progress" on his economic plan, he said: "Make no mistake about it. This means we are putting our economic house in order."
Painful though it may be, he added, "It's necessary, it's fair and it will work."
The Senate version of the bill differs significantly from the House-passed version on several basic tax and spending issues. It discards a proposed tax on the heat content of fuels, which would have raised $71.5 billion through 1998, and substitutes a meager 4.3 cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, diesel and kerosene that would raise $24 billion.
The Senate bill also rejects a proposed tax on barge fuel that the White House had first pegged at $1 a gallon and that had been whittled down to 50 cents a gallon in the House. But it leaves unclear the status of two fuels, ethanol and methanol, that had been exempted from taxation in the House.
The Senate bill cuts $17 billion more from Medicare spending than did the House bill, but it gives retirees somewhat more generous tax treatment than did the House, raising the income threshold for proposed additional taxation of Social Security benefits by $10,000 over the House version.
 
Ban on Filibusters
 Ordinarily, Republicans could stall or alter the bill on the Senate floor. But the budget package, known as a reconciliation bill, moves under special rules that ban filibustering and allow the Democrats to sharply limit unfriendly amendments.
The Senate will then try to meld its version of the budget with a House version, passed earlier, that differs on the critical issues of Medicare spending and a tax on energy. Congress has pledged to have a compromise bill on the President's desk by the time lawmakers take their annual vacation in early August.
Mr. Moynihan contends that the bill is the most progressive economic legislation since World War II, and figures made public today by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation support that.
 
Smaller Burden for Some
 Focusing only on tax changes and not on spending cuts, the committee concluded that the Senate bill would cut taxes for any household earning less than $20,000 a year in "expanded income" -- that is, household income plus any employer's contributions to Federal taxes, health insurance and a grab-bag of other benefits. Their share of the total Federal tax burden would drop by $1.6 billion, to about $46.4 billion a year in 1993 dollars.
By comparison, households with expanded incomes of more than $200,000 would suffer a sharp rise in their tax burden, to nearly $199 billion from the current $168 billion a year. Those in between would experience comparatively modest increases.
The portion of the package that appeared to win universal praise today was a stiff increase in the earned income tax credit, a tax break aimed solely at working families with incomes beneath the poverty level.
The House had passed an even more generous version of the tax credit benefiting families with and without children. The Senate finance panel excluded childless wage earners, but it sharply raised the amount of the credit -- to $2,098 from the current maximum of $1,434 for families with one child, and to $3,500 from $1,511 for families with two or more children.
The credit would be phased out as a household's income approaches a threshold of $23,470 for one-child families and $27,000 for two-child families. At its maximum, Mr. Moynihan noted, "we now have the equivalent of a family allowance of $75 a week for low-income families."
Other provisions were not greeted with such open arms.
 
Increases in Tax Rates
 Republicans generally argued that the bill's major tax provisions -- lifting the corporate tax rate one point to 35 percent, and the personal income-tax rate to a maximum of 39.6 percent from 31 percent -- were a bill of false goods, advertised as deficit-reducers but destined to finance Mr. Clinton's social agenda.
"The American people don't want us to raise taxes unless we're also going to cut spending," Mr. Dole said early in the session. Nor did he stop there: Mr. Clinton's plan to tax 85 percent of the Social Security benefits of wealthier people, rather than the current 50 percent, was "a rifle shot aimed at senior citizens," Mr. Dole said.
That provision would raise $26.3 billion through 1998. "If he didn't spend all that money for so-called investment programs nobody really cares about, he wouldn't have to do this," Mr. Dole said of the President.
But when a Republican proposal to delete the tax increase -- the only amendment considered today -- came to a vote, three of the finance panel's most moderate Republicans bolted to join the Democrats. They were John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Mr. Danforth of Missouri and Dave Durenberger of Minnesota.
Later, they and other Republicans sounded ferocious objections to the Democrats' Medicare proposals, which add $17 billion in new cuts to the $50 billion that Mr. Clinton had already proposed. The Democratic cuts reduce or freeze payments to providers of ambulances, outpatient surgery, home health care, community health centers and other services.
Republicans argued that the Democrats should have raised insurance premiums for wealthier older citizens to finance some cuts.
"I've never seen a community health center wallowing in money," Mr. Chafee said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S NEWS CONFERENCE;
Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference at the White House

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference tonight at the White House, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Ladies and gentlemen, first I want to speak with you about a situation that all of us have followed very closely in the last week. And that is the United Nations action in Somalia. General Powell reported to me this afternoon that this operation is over and that it was a success. The United Nations, acting with the United States and other nations, has crippled the forces in Mogadishu of warlord Aidid and remains on guard against further provocation. Aidid's forces were responsible for the worst attack on U.N. peacekeepers in three decades. We could not let it go unpunished. Our objectives were clear. The U.N. sought to preserve the credibility of peacekeeping in Somalia and around the world to get the food moving again and to restore security. 
 I want to congratulate the American and the United Nations forces who took part in this operation. In this battle heroism knew no flag. And in this era our nation must and will continue to exert global leadership as we have done this week in Somalia.
Here at home America is on the move. These past few days have been an impressive and important series of victories for the American people. Congress is taking major steps to limit the influence of special interests and their money in our lawmaking and in our campaigns. Congressional committees have also approved my plan for more college loans for the American people and to enable tens of thousands of them to pay their loans off by community service to their states and nation.
But the most important thing I want to discuss is the progress that is being made, the remarkable progress on the economic plan. Last month the House of Representatives passed a plan to reduce the deficit, the first step toward creating jobs and increasing incomes.
Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee cleared the way for action by the full Senate. Make no mistake about it. This means that we are putting our economic house in order. Getting the economy back on track depends upon Congress passing this economic plan. It's necessary, it's fair and it will work.
I propose, indeed, I have insisted upon, $500 billion in deficit reduction to be locked away in a deficit-reduction trust fund. We will be making historic cuts in the deficit by making historic cuts first in Government spending. Then by making high-income Americans pay their fair share so middle-class Americans will be treated fairly in the tax burden, for a change. Seventy-five percent of the new taxes proposed fall on the top 6 percent of the American people, those with incomes above $100,000.
Now some of the critics of this plan in Congress prefer instead to cut Social Security or health care or tax benefits for elderly people just above the poverty line or working people just above the poverty line, so that the wealthy won't pay so much. I'm here tonight to say to you and to the American people that I have -- that I will draw the line. We have to reduce the deficit by reducing the unfairness of tax patterns of the 1980's, and once again, asking all Americans to do what is right and fair.
We can't simply balance the budget on the backs of the old, the sick, the veterans and those who work hard but are just barely making ends meet. It's not right.
Let's look at what's at stake here.
First of all, this chart shows that if we do nothing, the inherited deficit -- what we found when I came into office -- will go up by 1998 to about $400 billion a year. If this deficit reduction plan is passed, we will cut $500 billion out of the deficit. That's the difference in this line and that.
As all of you know, and as you've pointed out in various ways in the last few weeks, I just got here. And I may have a lot to learn, but I didn't create the red line. What I'm trying to do is to change the red line and bring the yellow line in. And let me say, to get the yellow line down here, we have to bring about an affordable health-care plan for every American. And that's the next big step. But look what this deficit reduction plan alone will do. I want to emphasize once again, because there's been so much about -- talk about taxes, that this is the most progressive tax plan this country has seen in decades. Two-thirds of the money will be paid by people with incomes above $200,000.
Seventy percent of the economic gains of the last decade went to the top 1 percent of the American people. They are in a position now to pay more to help make this economy move again and they will. This is the payment -- monthly payment -- if my full economic plan is passed, by people with incomes above $200,000. And you can see what happens here to the plan, with an actual modest break for people at the bottom end of the income scale. This is a very progressive and fair plan.
Now finally let me say there's been a lot of talk about spending cuts here. If you look at this plan for every $10 in deficit reduction $5, half of it, comes in spending cuts, $3.75 of the $10 comes in tax increases on the highest income Americans, the upper 6 percent and $1.25 comes in taxes from the middle class, people with incomes below $100,000 but roughly above $30,000. Families with incomes below $30,000 are held harmless in this program. Now that's the way this program works: $5 in spending cuts, $3.75 in taxes from the wealthiest Americans, $1.25 in taxes from the middle class. It's fair and it's balanced and I hope that the Congress will adopt it.
Let me say that, as I open the floor to questions, the real issue here is whether we will reverse the pattern of the last 12 years where Presidents send budgets to Congress that are never seriously considered and everybody is afraid to talk about taxes because they're afraid no matter what happens, that will dominate the agenda. Nobody will know about spending cuts. Nobody will know about deficit reduction. Nobody will know about fairness.
I've tried to tell the truth to the American people and if this plan passes, you will see a continuation of what's happened already in the last five months: low interest rates, increased housing sales, more jobs coming into the economy. In the first four months of this economy alone, we had a bigger growth in construction employment -- 130,000 people -- than we have had in nine years. Why? Because we're serious about bringing the deficit down. That's what this last week means. It means continued victory for the American people if we can stay on this road.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. If Vance-Owen is dead, will the United States approve of a partition of Bosnia, if the three factions meeting in Geneva actually approve it? And also isn't NATO really obsolescence now? I mean, hasn't it outlived -- it can't stop the slaughter in Europe. It won't be the policeman in Europe.
PRESIDENT CLINTON That's two separate questions. First of all, as you know, my preference was for a multi-ethnic state in Bosnia. But if the parties themselves, including the Bosnian Government, agree -- genuinely and honestly agree to a different solution, then the United States would have to look at it very seriously. Secondly, I do not agree that NATO is dead. NATO was limited in what it could do in this instance because there was no agreement among the NATO partners first of all, and because any organization of states was limited by the rules that the United Nations imposed in the former Yugoslavia on the arms embargo, for example.
The clearest example I know to give you that NATO is not dead was provided by the leaders of the all the Eastern European countries that used to be Communist that aren't any more. When they came here a few weeks ago for the Holocaust dedication, everyone of those present said that their number one priority was to get into NATO. They know it will provide a security umbrella for the people who are members, and I think we need to continue to be involved in it.
Q. Who's the enemy?
A. Well, there will be different enemies. The enemy will be anybody that threatens the security and the peace of the member nations and the values that -- that we hold important. There are all kinds of possible problems in the years ahead from terrorism, from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, from yet unforeseen developments in countries around NATO. So I don't think it's time to dismantle NATO, I think it's very, very important.
Terry.
Q. Mr. President, doesn't this plan for carving up Bosnia send a dangerous message to separatists around the world, particularly in the former Soviet Union that military aggression pays?
A. I think that this plan shows that a civil war which has roots going back centuries, literally centuries, based on ethnic and religious differences has not been resolved in the way that I certainly would have hoped. I think Serbian aggression has been rewarded to the extent that the United Nations resolution permitted the Serbs to send arms to the Bosnian Serbs and permitted the Croats, that were next door to Croatia, to have access to more weapons than the Bosnian Government, predominantly Muslim, had. And I think that was a mistake. But I don't think that anybody should overlearn that lesson. Everyone who looks at this can see that this is perhaps our most difficult foreign policy problem.
Andrea?
Q. Mr. President, getting back to your pie chart. You said that a dollar and a quarter from that tax increase will hurt the middle class. During the campaign --
A. I don't think it will hurt the middle class. I think that it will help the middle class because it'll be a way of bringing the deficit down.
Q. But a dollar and a quarter out of that tax bite will hit the middle class. In the PBS debate during the campaign, you said, "The only thing Paul Tsongas has recommended that I haven't is a 3- to 5-cent a year gas tax increase. And I'll be darned if I understand why we should do that without giving some offsetting tax relief. Then in "Putting People First," which was your campaign manifesto you said, you oppose a Federal excise gas tax. I quote, "Instead of a backbreaking Federal gas tax we should try conservation." Why are you now willing to go along with the Senate plan at least to keep it moving through the Senate for a gasoline tax. Do you think you can defeat in conference and if you do, will you try to restore the B.T.U. tax as your budget director suggested today? If so, won't you then lose Senators Boren and Breaux and all the other opponents when it gets back to the Senate? Isn't it a no-win situation?
A. First of all, I think it is a win-win situation if the Senate passes a budget that has $500 billion in deficit reduction, locks the spending cuts away in a trust fund and asks the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share. I think that's a win-win situation because I think we'll go to conference and we'll get a plan that will meet those criteria and will also be fairer to the middle class people and to the working poor. There's also a lot of important provisions in there that I care about that will help to encourage people to move from welfare to work.
The Senate bill is very different. It does have a 4.3 percent fuel tax in it. That is very different from 3 cents a year, which is 12 cents or 15 cents over five years, or 5 cents a year which is 25 cents over five years, a 4.3 percent tax flat is not nearly as onerous as that.
I wish we didn't have to do that, but I would remind you that after the election and before I took office, the aggregate deficit over the next five years was written up by $165 billion. I'm doing the best I can to use very conservative hard-headed revenue estimates to get the deficit down and keep interest rates down, so that people in the middle class can save more money than they'll pay if they refinance a car loan or a home loan or take out a business loan with lower interest rates.
And tonight there will be millions of people who will either watch us or hear about this tomorrow who have refinanced their homes just since November with interest rates dropping they'll save more money in one year than they'll pay in five years under this program. So I still think, on balance, it is the right thing to do.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. You say this Somalia operation has been a success. Does that mean that the United States and U.N. forces have captured the Somali warlord Gen. Mohammed Feher Aidid and his associates including Col. Omar Jess and if you haven't captured them, what are you planning on doing with them if you do capture them? Are they going to be put on war crimes tribunal or anything like that?
A. The purpose -- no, they have not been arrested -- the purpose of the operation was to undermine the capacity of Aidid to wreak military havoc in Mogadishu. He murdered 23 U.N. peacekeepers and I would remind you that before the United States and the United Nations showed up he was responsible for the deaths of countless Somalis from starvation, from disease and from killing. The back -- the military back of Aidid has been broken. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. If he is in fact arrested then the United Nations will have to determine what appropriate action to take. That is the decision the United States is leaving to the United Nations and one I believe we should. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Economic Problems
 Q. Mr. President, I'm surprised that for the first four months you came into office you were saying how bad the economy was and how important it was for your program to be enacted to grow the economy. Now, we hear you in the last week or so talking up the economy, saying how well things are going and yet, your program hasn't passed. What are we to make of this? Why have you changed your mind about the economy.
A. First of all, I think the economy is still bad for most Americans. But the trends are good, and the trends are plainly tied to the determination of this Administration to bring the deficit down. We began to see a substantial drop in long-term interest rates after the election, when Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen announced that we were going to have a serious deficit reduction plan that would include entitlement cuts, other budget cuts, tax increases on the wealthy and an energy tax. We saw that. And every student of this, starting with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has testified before Congress to this effect, has said that if we continue and pass this we will get interest rates down.
So those things have been coming down. That's why the Home Builders Association of America -- not a Democratic group, presumably, largely a Republican group -- came from all over the country to Maryland a few days ago to endorse the economic program, because it is already beginning to bring interest rates down. So are most people affected by the economic recovery? No. But is it a good thing that you have 755,000 private sector jobs in the first five months, that you have 130,000 jobs in the construction industry -- the biggest gain over a four-month period in nine years? Yes, it is.
So the point I'm trying to make is we're taking the right direction but we've still got a lot of changes to make.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, as you pointed out, your economic plan would reduce the budget deficit by $500 billion over five years, which is a significant improvement over what we've seen in the past. But your critics would point out that the budget deficit would continue to mount by hundreds of billions of dollars a year and that your attack on the deficit is limited to lowering projected spending increases rather than taking the much harder tack of making real cutbacks in the budget. Can't you do more to deal with the problem of this deficit and runaway spending?
A. Let me have the chart again.
The answer to that question -- first of all, let me answer -- you asked two questions, not one. Let -- It is absolutely true that if this whole thing is adopted, or any other deficit reduction plan that has been presented today is adopted, by the fifth year the deficit starts to inch up again and you don't get down to zero. Now that is true. But why is that? That is because primarily of the projected exploding costs in medical care through Medicare and Medicaid. And because we have programs like Social Security and other retirement programs where people are given cost of living increases year in and year out, something that most Americans support. But the prime culprit here is Social Security -- I mean is medical costs, not Social Security. The prime culprit is medical costs. They've been going up way faster than inflation.
Now, I want to make two points: Why did we reduce the deficit only $500 billion over five years, even though that's a huge amount? Because it was the considered judgment of the economic team -- Secretary Bentsen, Mr. Panetta, Mr. Rubin -- that in a recession there was a limit to how fast you could contract the deficit. And that this would be a very rapid reduction of the deficit in a time when there is very slow economic growth around the globe. We think it will actually lead to some expansion of the economic activity. Why? Because there's so much debt built into our system at high interest rates that if people just go refinance all their homes and their business loans it will give them a lot of cash in their pocket and that will stimulate the economy to grow.
Secondly, it is our considered judgment that we cannot get the deficit down to zero, which is where it ought to be, until we do something about health-care costs which is why the next big piece of this Administration's work is to provide a comprehensive health-care plan that will bring health costs in line with inflation. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, many African-American writers have expressed their anger, or extreme disappointment, over the way you handled the Lani Guinair nomination, and with the way you handled the Haiti situation. In addition, the Congressional Black Caucus has said it's very angry with the fact that they voted for your budget package, and cast some very politically difficult votes only to have you negotiate a watered down package in the Senate. What would you assess your relationship right now with blacks, and what are you doing to mend fences with the Congressional Black Caucus so they will not vote against the conference report on the budget package?
A. I did not negotiate that bill that the Senate passed. That is just inaccurate. I did not do that. And I think you know what I liked about the House bill, and you know where I have been on the issue, and you know what the principles are; I have enunciated. I think Senator Moynihan did a remarkable job to get a bill out that does have $500 billion in deficit reduction, more spending cuts and tax increases, and taxes falling primarily on upper income people. I think to that extent we ought to give him credit. But there has been no negotiations. Secondly, and quite to the contrary, when members of the Black Caucus came to see me and asked me to pursue sanctions in the United Nations against Haiti that included oil, I examined it and I agreed to do it. They were the first people to ask me to do it and very shortly after the meeting I agreed to go forward. But the know, the ones who follow the Haitian developments, that even before that I offered to have the United States participate in a multi-national peacekeeping force to restore democracy and restore President Aristide and that he rejected that. They know that's the fact. Thirdly, I don't think my commitment to civil rights is very much open to question. And I think my actions as President, the appointments I've made and things I've stood for, document that, and I believe that over the long run the Black Caucus and the Clinton Administration will continue to be very close, and I've talked to any number of them personally, recently. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, will you support the Senate's 10 percent increase in the capital gains tax?
A. Well, they imposed a 10 percent surcharge because there's now a difference between the capital gains rate and the income rate. And as you know, the theory of the Tax Reform Act of '86 was to level them. Let's see what comes out of the conference report. What I want is a tax system where 75 percent of the burden falls on the top 6 percent of the American people -- at least that progressive. And if it is that progressive, then I'm open on the details. But i want to see what the final bill is. That's the key thing: will the wealthy pay their fare share, will it all be in a trust fund to reduce the deficit and will the ratio be at least as good as the one I showed. Five dollars of every 10 in spending cuts, 375 in tax increases on upper income people, $1.25 on the middle class.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans to Ask Congress to Approve Smaller, Cheaper Space Station

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Saying that in even tight budgetary times the nation "cannot retreat from our obligations to invest in our future," President Clinton said today that he would ask Congress to support a smaller, less-expensive version of the space station.
Mr. Clinton said a space station was crucial to the country's long-term technical leadership and a focal point for international cooperation in the post-cold war era. "At a time when our long-term economic strength depends on our technological leadership and our ability to reduce the deficit, we must invest in technology but invest wisely, making the best possible use of every dollar," he said.
Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore strongly supported the concept of a space station in last year's Presidential campaign. But that support was called into question last spring when the President, under pressure to reduce the Federal deficit and Government spending, ordered the space agency to redesign the orbiting laboratory to cut its costs significantly.
 
$16.5 Billion by 2001
 The Administration said it would propose spending $10.5 billion on the space station over the next five years, asking for $2.1 billion a year starting in the fiscal year 1994. In order to construct a permanently staffed orbital laboratory, spending could reach $16.5 billion by the year 2001, it said.
Compared with spending estimates for the original Space Station Freedom, which would have taken $14.4 billion in the next five years and $25.6 billion to complete, the new proposal could save up to $9 billion in construction costs and $18 billion in operating costs over the projected 10-year life of the station, the White House estimated.
Senior Administration officials said Mr. Clinton was pleased with the proposals for cutting costs, and would make the space station a "high priority" in future budgets. "You can and should assume that the President will support this, and that he will get involved personally," said a White House official who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
In addition to redesigning the station and streamlining the program's management, Mr. Clinton called for reducing bureaucracy and personnel at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to improve efficiency.
Noting that Mr. Gore's National Performance Review team would work with the agency on proposed management changes, Mr. Clinton said, "We are going to redesign NASA as we redesign the space station."
 
Cutbacks in Personnel
 NASA has spent almost $9 billion on the space station project over the last decade and continues to spend about $150 million a month on the program. An independent panel that reviewed the latest NASA redesign effort said most of the savings of the new design would come from major changes in the management and organization of the project, including a 30 percent reduction in the 17,000 NASA and contractor personnel working on the program.
Mr. Clinton reviewed three options for a scaled-down station and chose a combination of the two that most resembled the existing design of the space station Freedom. That design calls for pressurized modules and solar power units attached to a girder-like truss or backbone. Mr. Clinton's plan incorporates most of the elements of what was called Option A, a simplified version of Freedom with scaled-down modules and less complex electrical and data systems, but includes elements of the more expensive Option B.
The President rejected the least expensive alternative, Option C, which called for orbiting the core of a station, a pressurized cylinder with solar panels attached, launched in a single space flight. Option C, criticized as less advanced technically than the other two, would not easily have accommodated modules being developed by international partners to the project.
The White House said the Administration would spend the next 90 days working with Congress, NASA and the project's international partners in Japan, Canada and Europe to work out the details of a new, simplified design of the station. A major goal of the effort, it said, would be to expand international participation in the project, which some observers took to mean a greater role for Russia.
"I will also seek to enhance and expand the opportunities for international participation in the space station project so that the space station can serve as a model of nations coming together in peaceful cooperation," Mr. Clinton said.
Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington, said the President's action could make the station a truly international project. "I read the President's statement as leaving the door wide open for enhanced Russian participation," he said.
Major supporters in Congress said the President's decision to stay with many aspects of the design now in development would help the project retain political support, particularly among Congress members with space station work in their districts.
 
Clinton Backs Supercollider
 On another technological matter, Mr. Clinton today reaffirmed his support for the Energy Department's Superconducting Supercollider in a letter to Congress, a week before the House is to debate how it would finance the project.
"These are tough economic times, yet our Administration supports this project as part of its broad investment package in science and technology," he wrote in a letter to the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, William H. Natcher, Democrat of Kentucky.
Mr. Clinton sent the letter to Congress to counter speculation that the Administration planned to trim the $8.25 billion particle-accelerator project under construction in Texas, a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Clinton's RevisionOf a Space Outpost"
 
An adaptation of this design is to be worked out, adding some features of a similar but heavier version that would have retained more elements of the original space station. About 300 feet long, it would take about 16 shuttle flights.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND CONGRESS: Base Closings;
Aspin Asks Base-Closing Panel Not to Add to List

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Les Aspin today told a Presidential commission studying base closings that shutting down more than he recommended could hurt military readiness and overwhelm Pentagon efforts to help communities find new uses for closed sites.
Mr. Aspin's cautionary tone was in striking contrast to his first appearance before the commission on March 15, when he acknowledged that his list was based on outdated assumptions of the military's future size, and all but invited the panel to close several more installations. 
 Since then, however, senior Pentagon policy makers have been grappling with ways to shrink the military and do not want the commission to pre-empt any of their options on the use of bases before their review is completed this summer. In addition, the Defense Department now realizes the deficiencies of existing Federal efforts to assist communities in developing new uses for closed installations.
"Closing the wrong bases could impair our future readiness and military capability," Mr. Aspin said. "Closing too many bases could overload the system and undermine our ability to pick the right bases."
Mr. Aspin's plea to commissioners to hold back from closing more bases than he recommended sounded less like a defense of those bases than a testimonial to Pentagon incompetence.
"Closing bases has been cumbersome and slow," Mr. Aspin said, adding that only 13 of the 42 large bases identified for closing in 1988 and 1991 have actually closed.
"Grants were too meager," he said. "The property disposal process was far too slow. Interaction with communities was fragmented. Folks didn't know who to talk to. And finally, Federal assistance itself was uncoordinated."
 
Decision Expected Soon
 Mr. Aspin said he had ordered a major effort to correct these problems.
The chairman of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, James A. Courter, a former Republican Representative from New Jersey, said the seven-member panel would probably start making its final recommendations Wednesday.
The commission is studying the 43 large bases and 122 smaller sites that Mr. Aspin recommended for closing or reduction, as well as 47 other large bases and 26 smaller installations the commission added because they were comparable to the sites on Mr. Aspin's list. Commissioners have said they may substitute one or two bases from Mr. Aspin's list, or close a few more, but are not likely to alter the Secretary's list significantly.
The panel, set up to insulate Congress from angry constituents, can add or subtract bases from the Pentagon's list. The panel must submit its final recommendations to President Clinton by July 1. Mr. Clinton, and then Congress, would have to approve or reject the entire package.
The hearing today was the last of 26 sessions the panel has held since March. The commissioners visited 80 installations and, reflecting the intense political interest in their work, heard testimony from 209 representatives and senators.
Mr. Aspin, flanked by Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four military service chiefs, stood by his original recommendations, including sparing the Monterey Presidio and McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, because of the potential harm to that part of Northern California, which has been hit hard by the recession. The commission has since added the two installations for consideration.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In April

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Confounding forecasters, the nation's trade deficit widened again in April, to $10.49 billion, as the imbalance with Japan climbed to its highest level in five and a half years and its third highest on record.
The Commerce Department report is likely to increase trade friction between the two countries as President Clinton prepares for the Tokyo economic summit meeting of top industrialized nations in less than three weeks. 
 The American deficit with Japan grew moderately to $5.5 billion, despite a slight reduction in imports of new cars. The drop in auto imports suggested that American car makers were at least holding their own, with the aid of a sharply rising yen.
Possibly adding to the trade tensions with Japan was a separate report that showed Tokyo had fallen slightly short of its commitment to import 20 percent of its semiconductors in the first quarter.
 
 
Most Analysts Surprised
 Although the widening of the overall merchandise deficit was not large -- only $35 million from a March level that was revised upward -- most analysts were surprised that the deficit did not narrow substantially following a huge jump that had carried it to a four-year high and was thought to have been temporary.
Exports and imports each declined about $500 million for the month, imports from a record $49.3 billion that Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, had called "a one-month deviation."
Today, Mr. Brown called the trade results "disappointing," a reflection, he said, of the fact that economic recovery is taking shape in the United States while the economies of its main trading partners remain for the most part in the doldrums.
This disparity means that the United States can afford to buy large amounts of imported goods while other countries lack the money to buy as many of ours.
But surprised as they were, most analysts appeared to take today's report in stride, noting among other things that exports continued to be quite vigorous and that the weak dollar, which should eventually help shrink the deficit with Japan, had initially magnified it.
"The export pace is up 5.5 percent" over the first four months of this year, said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
Some analysts also pointed to customs data for May indicating that the next report on merchandise trade, due July 16, will show a markedly smaller deficit. Michael Englund of MMS International, an analytical firm, calculated that customs receipts for imported goods fell 18 percent last month.
And Paula Stern, a consultant and one-time head of the International Trade Commission, found no new worrisome elements in the trade data even though the deficit with Japan was the largest since one of $5.54 billion in October 1987.
"What we've got," she said, "is a chronic problem that's been in the making for several years," one mainly the result of the bursting of Japan's economic bubble and not of faltering competitiveness here.
"We've been growing," Ms. Stern added, noting that American automobile companies, for example, have been using the rising yen to take back market share from the Japanese instead of using it as cover to raise their own prices.
The falling dollar, however, does cause uneasiness among economists in that it makes foreign goods more expensive and thereby aggravates inflation, which so far remains under control in the area of 3 percent, heading for perhaps 3.5 percent.
One of the main factors keeping the deficit high in April was the bill for imported crude oil, which climbed to $3.7 billion, from $3.4 billion in March. The United States bought 14 million more barrels in May at a price averaging $16.71, up 24 cents.
The biggest change in exports was a $400 million decline in capital goods while the biggest nonpetroleum change in imports was a decline in consumer goods, the report also showed.
 The American surplus with the European Community withered in April to $47 million from $860 million as deterioration with Britain and France far exceeded a narrowing of the deficit with Italy.
But a small deficit with South and Central America became a $240 million surplus and the deficit also narrowed with South Korea and Singapore while holding steady with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The surplus with Mexico, with which the United States is trying to conclude a free-trade agreement, eased to $264 million; over the first four months of the year, it ran at only 54 percent of the comparable 1992 pace.
The deficit with Canada, the largest trading partner of the United States, widened in April to $934 million from $661 million as imports of new cars exceeded exports by $1 billion.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Tokyo Misses Goal
 WASHINGTON, June 16 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- Japan imported 19.6 percent of its semiconductors in the first quarter, just shy of its commitment of at least 20 percent, the United States and Japanese Governments said today.
In the last three months of 1992, foreign semiconductor makers held 20.2 percent of the Japanese market.
In March, Japan warded off what might have been the beginning of a trade war with the United States by announcing that it crossed the 20 percent level agreed to in a 1991 accord.
"Any decline in foreign market share is cause for concern," Andrew A. Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said. "However, having just returned from productive meetings with electronics company executives in Japan, we are encouraged by their commitment to continue working with the U.S. industry to achieve the goals of the semiconductor trade pact."
Hidehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of the Toshiba Corporation, said the decline should not be used to justify demands that Japan commit to at least a 20 percent foreign share of its chip market in 1993.

HEADLINE: Technology Fund Is a First for China

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
China took another step down the capitalist road yesterday with the creation of its first international venture capital fund, the Shanghai Pacific Technology Venture Fund.
The $20 million fund plans to invest in 30 to 40 technology companies in Shanghai, a city of 12 million people. The start-up companies -- some already formed, others still to be created -- will be in selected high-technology fields like computer software, telecommunications, cable television and pharmaceuticals. The fund will make its first investments later this year. 
 Half of the financial backing for the fund will come from nine state-owned Chinese banks and companies, while the other half will be invested by an American partner, Pacific Technology Venture Fund Inc. of Boston.
For the Chinese, the Shanghai fund is an effort to spur development of an entrepreneurial high-technology sector, tapping American money and business expertise. "The Shanghai government wants to reform the structure of its industry," said Liu Zhenyuan, the chairman of the fund, who stepped down earlier this year after a decade as the vice mayor in charge of economic development in Shanghai.
"We need the know-how much more than we need the money," Mr. Liu said yesterday in a telephone interview from Boston.
 
Big Money for China
 There has been a flood of foreign investment in China recently -- in the booming Shanghai Stock Exchange, in factories and in joint ventures. Another Chinese venture firm, the Guandong Science and Technology Venture Capital Company, was set up earlier this year, backed by several Government agencies. But the Shanghai fund is believed to be the first venture capital fund with a foreign partner to be authorized by China.
The American partner, Pacific Technology, is also discussing similar joint investments with the Chinese authorities in Guandong, the province near Hong Kong, and in Beijing. Pacific Technology was founded more than a decade ago by Patrick J. McGovern, the chairman of the International Data Group, a leading publisher of computer magazines like PC World and Computerworld.
 
New Public Companies

The Shanghai fund plans to work with the companies it backs in much the same way as an American venture capitalist works with start-ups in Silicon Valley. There will be plenty of hands-on coaching at the beginning, said Hugo Hsiung, managing director of the Shanghai fund.
"After a few years, we want to take them public," said Mr. Hsiung, a former Chinese official who was educated in the United States. The flourishing Shanghai Stock Exchange, he added, should prove an eager market for the initial stock offerings of the new companies.
For his part, Mr. Liu, 59, reflected briefly on how much times have changed in China. The new venture capitalist received his doctorate in electrical engineering from the Academy of Sciences of the former Soviet Union in 1960, when China favored Marx over markets.
In the next couple of weeks, Mr. Liu will visit American high-tech centers like Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley. "We want to bring small American businesses with technology and marketing expertise to China to work with our entrepreneurs," he said.

HEADLINE: Productivity for Quarter Off, First Drop in 2 Years

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After two years of impressive gains, the productivity of American workers plunged in the first quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The new numbers suggest that perhaps the workplace is not becoming as efficient as many experts have suggested.
Productivity -- essentially, the amount produced by workers in a given period -- fell at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the quarter, the Labor Department said. While some economists insisted that the setback was only a temporary interruption for a work force becoming steadily more efficient, others predicted that productivity might be falling back to the weak rate of growth that hampered the nation in the 70's and 80's. 
 Whatever the view, nearly everyone agreed yesterday that one quarter's poor figures, after months of improvement, did not provide a conclusive answer. "There is no way to say the trend line is definitely up until one has seen a few years of data," said Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist.
 
More Overtime and Temporaries
 The latest report concluded that while the nation's nonfarm output -- the total production of goods and services -- rose only eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, the number of hours worked by Americans increased 2.5 percent. Employees, rather than cutting the time needed to type a letter or manufacture a shirt, as they had in the eight previous quarters, took longer to carry out such tasks.
Recoveries from previous recessions have followed a similar pattern. There were many months in which companies found ways to squeeze greater production from the work force, only to give up the effort and once again hire, add overtime or bring in temporary workers. All three tendencies showed up in the first quarter.
 
A Qualitative Difference?
 Some economists, like Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley & Company, argue that the current upturn is different. They say that American companies, beset by competition and weak demand, have achieved permanent efficiencies that allow them to produce more without raising labor costs. Automation and computers have helped to achieve this.
"What happened in the first quarter is only a brief interruption in this long-term trend," Mr. Roach said. "Over the last two years, it looks as if the cumulative gain in productivity is just over 2 percent" annually.
But Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, hailed yesterday's numbers as the beginning of a return to the lower productivity gains characteristic of the 1970's and 1980's, when efficiency improved at an average annual rate of only 1.3 percent. "My bottom line is that all the improvements in 1992 were simply correcting the inefficiencies of the late 1980's," Professor Gordon said.
The first-quarter numbers -- revising an earlier estimate of a decline of only five-tenths of 1 percent -- showed great variation. Manufacturing productivity, for example, rose by a healthy 4.8 percent. But while makers of durable goods like cars and machinery shot ahead 8.6 percent, efficiency among manufacturers of nondurable items like clothing and toys fell by four-tenths of a percent.
The Labor Department does not provide separate breakdowns for service companies, public employees, construction and the like.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND CONGRESS: Medicare;
Cutting Health Dollars to Heal Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
The two houses of Congress are preparing for a fight over how deeply to cut the growth of Medicare, a fight that has major implications for the nation's elderly, for doctors and hospitals, and for the success of President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health-care system.
Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee said today that they were seeking much deeper cuts in the growth of Medicare, the Federal health-insurance program for the elderly and disabled, than President Clinton proposed or the House of Representatives endorsed. The extra savings would reduce the need for the Senate to vote to raise taxes as much as the House did. 
 Mr. Clinton sought Medicare savings that would total $42.9 billion over five years. The budget bill passed by the House would generate savings of $50.4 billion. Senate Democrats would shave $67.3 billion from Medicare. Most of the additional cutbacks envisioned by Democratic senators would come from hospitals and, to a lesser degree, from doctors.
Medicare is expected to cost slightly more than $1 trillion over the next five years. Mr. Clinton would trim total outlays about 4 percent, while the House would save nearly 5 percent and the Senate 6.4 percent.
 
Different Approaches
 The Senate bill would make selective cuts in Medicare over five years, whereas the House bill would simply freeze most payment rates, eliminating inflation allowances for the next two years.
The changes would be the starting point for future efforts to revamp the nation's health-care system. The Medicare cutbacks will complicate Mr. Clinton's task of financing the health-care overhaul. Many people had hoped that Medicare savings would be available to help finance health care for the uninsured, but now that money will be used to help reduce the Federal budget deficit.
While many economists agree that the deficit should be reduced, the specific measures proposed by the Senate Democrats have drawn a chorus of criticism from spokesmen for elderly people, doctors and hospitals.
Dr. Daniel Thursz, chairman of the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, a coalition of groups that lobby for the elderly, called the Senate's proposals for further Medicare savings "a pointed attack against older Americans."
"Most of the Medicare cuts will initially be placed on doctors and other service providers, but their impact will eventually be felt by consumers," Dr. Thursz said.
 
Impact on Hospitals
 In speech after speech, President Clinton has pointed out that Medicare cutbacks do little or nothing to control overall health costs because hospitals and doctors simply raise their charges to privately insured patients, a process known as cost shifting.
Thomas A. Scully, a top budget official in the Bush Administration, observed that most of the cutbacks now sought by Senate Democrats had been proposed unsuccessfully by Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, asserted that the new cutbacks would have "a devastating effect" on the city's hospitals, which depend heavily on Medicare. In particular, he lamented cutbacks in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals; he noted that 15 percent of all doctors were trained in New York City.
"If the program is chopped up like this, it will have a terrible impact on our ability to deliver care," Mr. Raske said. "It will force New York hospitals to make cuts in work force and services."
The Senate bill would take several novel steps to favor "primary care" doctors -- those who practice family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics and preventive care -- at the expense of surgeons and other specialists. Surgeons are predictably angry.
 
Favoring Some Doctors
 Dr. W. Gerald Austen, chief of surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital and president of the American College of Surgeons, said: "We are outraged by recent actions of the Senate Finance Committee that disproportionately and unfairly penalize surgeons. The committee's decision to achieve budget savings by placing additional, unwarranted burdens on surgeons shows total disregard for the physician-payment system that Congress designed just a few years ago."
Under that system, Congress established a fee schedule for doctors serving Medicare patients. To make sure that doctors do not perform unnecessary services, the Government set annual goals for Medicare payments to doctors. Payments for surgical services decreased last year by 3.3 percent, partly because of surgeons' efforts to control the volume of such services, while payments for other doctors' services rose 7 percent.
Charles G. Huntington, director of the Washington office of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said: "The Finance Committee saw fit to protect and promote the delivery of primary-care services. That's consistent with most proposals for health-care reform, which seek to make such services more available by providing incentives for doctors to go into primary care."
Medicare pays teaching hospitals for some costs of medical education, including a portion of salaries for residents in training. Under the Finance Committee's bill, the payment would be increased 10 percent for each resident in a primary-care program. Payments would be reduced 30 percent for other residents.
Despite the cutbacks, the total outlays for Medicare would continue to increase at a robust pace, to more than $220 billion in 1998 from the $129 billion in 1992. But, at the current rate, the costs in 1998 would grow to $258 billion.
Howard B. Shapiro, director of public policy at the American College of Physicians, said that many doctors were now reluctant to take new Medicare patients because Medicare payments were inadequate to cover their costs.
Administration officials are preoccupied with the budget bill and have little time to work on Mr. Clinton's ambitious plan to guarantee health care for all Americans, a delay that has caused consternation for some groups that have pushed for such changes.
Ellen L. Goldstein, director of health policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500 companies, said: "Health-care reform is an existential exercise right now. Will there be reform? Will it be bold and comprehensive, as President Clinton promised? This was the moment for such reform, but people worry that maybe it will slip away again."

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND CONGRESS: Campaign Finance;
Senate Passes Measure to Curb Aid From PAC's

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
The Senate today passed campaign finance legislation that would create voluntary spending limits and reduce the amounts that political action committees can give candidates.
The Senate bill actually proposes to ban PAC contributions absolutely, but it adds that if that is found to be unconstitutional, as many senators believe, the contributions must be reduced to $1,000. 
 The vote was 60 to 38, with 7 Republicans joining 53 Democrats in support, and 3 Democrats voting with 35 Republicans in opposition.
The Republican votes in favor came only after Democrats agreed to drop most public financing from the bill, retaining only a provision under which a candidate who abides by spending limits can get Federal money if his opponent exceeds them.
But this and other compromises did not dim the enthusiasm of Senate sponsors or of President Clinton. Mr. Clinton issued a statement saying, "Today's vote is a victory for the American people and a setback for the special interests," and adding, "The Senate has answered the call for change."
 
Republican Unity Fades
 This bill, whatever happens to it in the House or in a House-Senate conference, is also an important token of the warning that leaders of both parties issued earlier in the session, when Republicans united to kill Mr. Clinton's economic-stimulus program. On many issues, they said, Republicans will not be able to muster that sort of unity.
Mr. Clinton, while winning no help from Republicans on any issue involving taxes or the deficit, can attract their support on domestic issues like student loans or national service, and even on the more partisan question of campaign-finance legislation.
And his technique of claiming victory and emphasizing the successes his Administration achieves in compromises is one that Capitol Hill welcomes. Lawmakers compare his reactions favorably to those of President Jimmy Carter, who they thought spent more energy complaining about what he did not get than boasting of what he achieved.
Today's passage was an anticlimax after Wednesday's 62-to-37 vote to end a Republican filibuster, which had gone on for nearly three weeks.
But when the bill was passed, at least one major question was left unsettled by the Senate, and that was how to make the Federal Election Commission more decisive. The six-member commission that enforces the campaign laws is one of the slowest-acting agencies in Washington and frequently does nothing at all because of tie votes.
A provision in Mr. Clinton's version of the bill, giving the commission's general counsel, in effect, a tie-breaking vote, was attacked at the last moment by Republicans, who thought it would make the agency partisan, and probably pro-Democratic.
To insure that the filibuster would be broken, the bill's managers agreed to drop that section Wednesday, and today they agreed to try to resolve the matter in a House-Senate conference.
But before a conference can be held, some form of the bill has to be passed in the House.
The bill passed today fundamentally deals with only Senate elections, leaving the House to write rules for its own elections. The only provisions that apply to the House as well as the Senate are the one that would reduce the maximum contributions by political action committees to $1,000 from $5,000, and another prohibiting franked mass mailings in an election year.
House leaders today professed optimism that they could pass a bill, although one that would differ sharply from the Senate bill. "We will retain part of the campaign finance role of political action committees," said Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington.
 
Public Financing Imperiled
 And while some spokesman for outside interest groups, like the League of Women Voters, said today they would press for the House to restore the public financing that the Senate dropped, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, indicated that was unlikely.
In the bill passed today, the incentives for Senate candidates to adhere to the spending limits, which vary by state according to population, are that if they do, television stations would have to sell them advertising time at half price, they could get low-cost mailings and they would not be subject to a newly imposed 35 percent tax on the money their campaign committees receive.

HEADLINE: Assembly Tax-Cut Plan Fans Political Flames in Trenton

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 17

 BODY:
It will be at least weeks before the tax-cut proposal that the Assembly Speaker introduced today comes to a vote, but the political impact of his move was immediate.
It set off a heated exchange between Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, while sending both Gov. Jim Florio and his Republican rival, Christine Todd Whitman, scrambling for safe political ground. 
 On Monday, the Republican legislators released a version of the budget that called for an anticipated $150 million surplus to go into a "taxpayer relief fund" to soften an anticipated increase in the Federal gasoline tax by the Clinton Administration.
 
A Blustery Meeting
 But Mr. Haytaian said 54 Assemblymen, including three Democrats, had signed on as co-sponsors of his bill, enough to assure its passage. That would force Senate Republicans to go along, or accept the consequences of voting down a tax cut in an election year.
Legislative aides said a meeting today between Republican leadership from both chambers to discuss the tax cut ended quickly with the blustery Mr. Haytaian and the normally reserved Mr. DiFrancesco yelling at each other.
"I categorize it as some disagreements, which I expected," Mr. Haytaian said later at a news conference. "My job is to get bills through the Assembly. We'll worry about the passage through the Senate when we get it through the Assembly."
He said he expected an Assembly vote in July or August.
Mr. DiFrancesco issued a statement that said the Senate would consider Mr. Haytaian's plan.
"It may be premature, however, for the Legislature to finalize a taxpayer relief program before it has a clearer view of the direction of Federal fiscal policies and the health of our state's economy," Mr. DiFrancesco said.
 
A Rift Between Chambers
 Last year the Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature with a two-thirds majority, overrode Mr. Florio's veto to roll back the sales tax by one percentage point. But since then, Mr. DiFrancesco and the other Senate Republicans have become more cautious and Mr. Haytaian more aggressive.
"We are carrying on the mandate of the people, people that voted us in and agreed with us when we said we would repeal the sales tax, cut the size of government and, as monies come in, we would look at the other taxes that Jim Florio enacted," Mr. Haytaian said. "I have been consistent in what I have been saying and this is just consistency extended."
A senior Republican aide in the Senate said that Mr. DiFrancesco felt he had been "ambushed" by Mr. Haytaian. Many Senate Republicans and some Assemblymen believe any surplus should be used to reduce the state debt, not taxes.
Governor Florio, in a letter to Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco, said that he favored "a responsible, fiscally prudent tax cut." "But I believe we should not wait until the fall for whatever tax relief we believe we can responsibly and prudently provide," the Governor said. "People have a right to expect certainty in the process, and they are rightly skeptical about promises made in June about a tax cut that might come in September or October."
 
Middle-Income Benefit
 Mr. Haytaian said later that Mr. Florio had no say in the process.
"Governor Florio is not moving this train," the Assembly Speaker said. "Chuck Haytaian and the Senate President are moving this train by virtue of a veto-proof majority."
Meanwhile, Carl Golden, chief spokesman for the Whitman campaign, said his candidate's position had been consistent.
"If the money is available to support this kind of tax cut, then we should move ahead and do it," he said. "If the money isn't there, we shouldn't do it."
The tax cut, intended to benefit New Jerseyans with middle incomes, would average $250 a year. The Haytaian plan would cut half a percentage point from the tax burden on income between $20,000 and $70,000 for married couples and between $20,000 and $35,000 for single taxpayers. The tax rate on income below $20,000 would stay the same.
If approved, the tax cut would take effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and would cost between $108 million and $117 million in the first six months, Mr. Haytaian said, and between $240 million and $260 million in the following years.

HEADLINE: Newcomers Find Success Despite the Barriers

SERIES: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- Last of six articles.

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRICK, N.J.

 BODY:
After following their dreams to the United States, Yolanda Vasquez and her husband found themselves in a dark, three-room tenement in North Bergen with a mattress on the floor, wondering what had possessed them to leave Panama.
They had no working papers, no job connections and few prospects -- at a time when immigration laws were about to become stricter and halfway decent jobs hard to come by, even for Americans. 
 But now, like many thousands of other immigrants who make their way against great odds, they are on the verge of success. After nearly nine years in the United States, they already own a three-bedroom ranch on a cul-de-sac, spend most weekends chauffeuring their three children to soccer matches and hold two individual retirement accounts. Any day now, they will also be legal residents.
The journey this couple made -- starting out in the region's underground economy -- does not always end in success. The underground economy -- a world that is off the books and unregulated -- has virtually enslaved thousands of vulnerable immigrants, exploiting their desperation by forcing them into the worst jobs for the worst pay.
But it has also served to sustain and nurture many thousands more who eventually surface to pay taxes, gain legal status and achieve their goals.
Experts say that those most likely to succeed are much like Ms. Vasquez and her husband, who were both well educated when they got here and had the advantage of a relative already living legally in this country.
But theirs was not a journey without hardship. For this couple, it has involved one route for the husband and one for the wife. He worked 12-hour days, seven days a week, for years. She had to work as a live-in maid, hostage to a job she hated, because she knew that maids, sponsored by their employers, are almost guaranteed they will be granted legal status. The children, two boys, 14 and 12, and a daughter, 13, suffered too. Often lonely in a strange land, they spent long hours with babysitters, and many hours by themselves, as their parents worked to establish themselves.
Sitting on a rose chintz sofa in their living room on a Sunday afternoon, the couple talked of how far they had come even without a green card. They love the security and convenience of their Brick Township neighborhood, a sleepy block of identical houses on quarter-acre lots bordering several large roadside malls and plazas. Both have become fluent in English; Ms. Vasquez barely has an accent. Together, they make $55,000 a year, with $45,000 coming from wages and overtime earned by Ms. Vasquez's husband.
"Now, getting all the papers means we have arrived," said Ms. Vasquez, who is 41 years old. "But, whew!" She pretended to wipe sweat from her brow. "It has been very hard."
 
Entry
A Simple Plan Derailed by Reality
Ms. Vasquez's husband, who is 39 and came to New York on a tourist visa in 1984, one year before the rest of the family, expects his green card, or permanent visa, within the next few weeks. Because he is not a legal resident yet, he spoke only on the condition that he not be identified in order to protect his job as a manager in a parking garage in northern New Jersey. Ms. Vasquez, who usually uses her husband's last name, would only allow her given surname to be used. She and the children received permanent visas last year, after applying when Ms. Vasquez began working as a maid eight years ago.
When Ms. Vasquez's husband came to New York, the plan was so simple: Get a high-paying job, save money, and send for the family. He believed that a job -- any job -- was the ticket to becoming a permanent resident of the United States.
He had decided to come after constant prodding from his brother-in-law, a native Colombian who is a naturalized American citizen, and his sister.
 
Limited English in New Land
 The couple lived in David, the capitol of Chiriqui, on Panama's west coast, where they both had good jobs. He headed the human resources department of a major company. She was a social worker. But they came to believe that their children, who were still preschoolers, would never have the same educational opportunities as their American counterparts.
"Panama doesn't have the technology," Ms. Vasquez's husband explained.
When he arrived in New York, in 1984, Ms. Vasquez's husband stayed with his sister and brother-in-law in Astoria while he began looking for work by scouring the want ads in the Sunday papers. But he knew little English beyond "How are you?" "I am fine, thank you?" No job fit the bill for a manager/accountant who couldn't speak the language.
 
Rough Times at Work
 Meanwhile, his sister and brother-in-law told him to apply for a New York State driver's license. All it took, he said, was a written test at the Department of Motor Vehicles and proof from the Panamanian consulate that he had been a licensed driver in Panama.
By his second month here, his brother-in-law also got him a Social Security number and card -- sold by its owner -- from an acquaintance in Astoria with connections in the underground economy.
"I didn't know that it belonged to somebody," Ms. Vasquez's husband said of the card. "I didn't know what an illegal alien was. All I knew was that I was told I needed the card to work."
Actually, at first he didn't need the card. His first three jobs, brokered by an employment agency he found in the classifieds of Noticias Del Mundo, a Spanish-language newspaper, were in places employing illegal immigrants. He was dismissed from the first, a midtown croissant shop, after two hours for failing to understand a sandwich order. He quit the second, as a deliveryman for a Times Square diner, after getting paid $60 for a 60-hour week. (He had been promised $130.) At the third, a Greek diner in Queens, he dropped a tray in the dining room, sending plates and glasses crashing "with tremendous noise." The owner paid him $80 for four days of work and said he would get a call if the diner needed him.
 
Employment
Making a Living Despite Obstacles
It took close to six months to find a steady job, at a parking garage under a midtown hotel. When the employers asked him for a driver's license and Social Security card, he was able to show both.
By this time, his visa had expired. He and his brother-in-law went to an immigration lawyer in Queens for help and were told that to get a visa he needed the kind of job that would lead an employer to sponsor his application. Live-in domestic work qualified. Parking cars did not.
But the garage paid relatively well -- $4 an hour when the minimum wage was $3.35, and he decided to stay there. He set aside the issue of his residency and began taking English classes twice a week for $60 a week at a midtown language center.
He also opened a savings account at a Queens bank. And he received his first credit card, by applying for a $500 credit limit, the minimum the bank offered.
Two months after he started working at the garage, he was ready to bring the family over.
 
Moving to New Jersey
 Ms. Vasquez and the children arrived in New York on tourist visas to find their new home was a two-story clapboard building on North Bergen's busiest commercial strip. On the advice of a co-worker, Ms. Vasquez's husband had crossed the Hudson to find an affordable apartment. The rent: $500 a month.
"It was not a very nice apartment," he said.
But they could save money. A month later, they bought their first car, a 1978 Ford Fairlane, for $1,300.
They planned to have Ms. Vasquez's college transcripts transferred here so that she could get a job as a social worker and apply for a green card. Meanwhile, she enrolled in Hudson County Community College where she took six credits in English and social service. "We considered it an investment," Ms. Vasquez said.
"It was a happy time," her husband said. "We started to travel around. One of the first places we took them to was Washington, D.C. I learned how to use a map. We went to Vermont. We went to Great Adventure."
Ms. Vasquez began applying for county social-service jobs but was told she needed to learn more English.
"The plan wasn't really working out," she said.
 
Assimilation
Buying a Home And Settling Down
Not long after she and the children moved here, the 1986 immigration bill imposing sanctions on employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens was passed. It was then that she decided to become a maid. A friend in North Bergen told her that a family in Deal, a half hour from where they now live, needed help. "We went together to the couple," Ms. Vasquez said. "We said we wanted visas. That's the only reason I will do this." The couple, who had two sons in elementary school, agreed.
Ms. Vasquez and her husband saw few other options. They could have divorced each other, married citizens for $2,000 to $3,000 each, then divorced the citizens and married each other again. (He knew of people who were doing it.) Or they could have bought false documents stating they lived in the United States before 1982 so that they could apply for amnesty under the new law. (He knew of people doing that as well.)
"It wasn't the right way," he said. "I didn't want to go through that situation."
They concede they have resorted to a few illegal methods to move forward here. Ms. Vasquez's husband's Social Security card not only helped him get the garage job; he also used it to open bank accounts and apply for credit cards. And Ms. Vasquez bought a New York driver's license, paying a Panamanian official $50 and a Department of Motor Vehicles worker $40 to get it.
But they have made their money in honest jobs, they say. And they have sacrificed. For the first 18 months of her job, until the family moved from their apartment in Hudson County to Ocean County, Ms. Vasquez lived with her employers and saw the family only on weekends. She spent close to $80 of her $100-a-week cash salary on taxis. Her husband, who worked an overnight shift, had to hire a babysitter to care for the children. The eldest began having problems in school. The whole family was miserable.
"I cried every night," Ms. Vasquez said. "I lost 40 pounds. I wanted to go back to Panama."
The family then moved to a beach apartment in Deal, and having saved about $10,000, started looking for a house. And because Ms. Vasquez had a work permit and proof that she was in the process of obtaining a visa, they could apply for a mortgage.
When they bought their $110,000 house in Brick Township in November 1989, it took every penny they could save -- their combined income was about $40,000 -- and a small loan from the employers of Ms. Vasquez's husband.
It took nearly seven years for Ms. Vasquez and the children to receive their visas. The applications, like thousands of other visa applications that flood the Immigration and Naturalization Service each year, became mired in bureaucracy.
Her husband had not applied for a visa with the rest of the family because if his request had been denied, he would have had to leave the country, he said. Ms. Vasquez applied for her husband's visa after she received hers because the family's lawyer advised them that visa applications sponsored by a spouse are usually quickly approved. In April, immigration officials requested a copy of their marriage certificate -- a good sign, according to their lawyer. Eventually, they hope to become full United States citizens.
 
Progress on Job Front
 As much as she loathes it, Ms. Vasquez still works as a maid. For a while, she kept the job because she thought she had to if her husband was to get a visa. But a couple of months ago, she found out that that wasn't so.
"The lawyers said I just need to be employed," she said. She applied for a job as a social worker for a nonprofit organization; last week, she found out she got the job, which starts later this month.
Ms. Vasquez keeps a file of their children's school records on a kitchen counter, with all their report cards, teacher's notes and awards. Recently, when their report cards didn't meet her standards, Ms. Vasquez and her husband canceled their cable television.
"We tell the children keep your first language and then work hard to achieve," she said. "That's the two pieces of advice."
Her husband is researching schools offering business courses for the import-export business he wants to start. He firmly believes he will succeed.
"One of the things that has always prompted me," he said, "is the idea that if someone else could do it, what can't you?"

Trump Jumps the Gun a Bit On Success of His Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
True to his promoter's instincts, Donald J. Trump announced yesterday the "tremendous success" of the sale of his $385 million in junk bonds, even though they have not been officially sold.
"They were all saying they wanted to buy Trump bonds," he said in a midafternoon call he initiated about the sale of $325 million in eight-year mortgage notes and $60 million in 10-year payment-in-kind notes.
 
 
'A Good Year'
 The coupon rate on the mortgage bonds, he said with some obvious pride, was below 11 percent -- at 10.875 percent. And the deal "was oversubscribed." 
 So, he was asked, "Is Trump back?"
"I'm doing great," he replied. "It has been a good year."
What's good? He listed the rebound of his three Atlantic City casinos, one of which, the Trump Plaza, is backing the two junk-bond issues he was touting. There was the New York City Council's approval of his $3 billion residential development on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. And there was the approval to convert his 140-room, Palm Beach, Fla., home, Mar-a-Lago, into a beach club and spa.
Then, in the way that he can get personal, he confided, "I had to get back to work, in all fairness."
But a subsequent call to Merrill Lynch & Company, the lead underwriter on the deal, disclosed that the new bonds had not been officially sold yesterday and there could be no comment on the details of yields and prices or who bought what.
The reason the sale could not be completed was that some small changes had been made in the plan that required it to be refiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We cannot go effective on the transaction until tomorrow, when we anticipate on being cleared by the S.E.C.," an official at Merrill Lynch said yesterday.
Still, that was no obstacle to Mr. Trump. Calling later yesterday from near the 17th green at the Baltusrol Glof Club in Springfield, N.J., he said, "Believe it or not, I am at the U.S. Open." And, he added, "I guess it will be effective tomorrow morning," referring to the bond sale.
Regardless of the finality of the deal, the junk-bond sale did appear to be going very well, even though it was just three years ago that Mr. Trump's real estate and casino empire nearly toppled.
One of the signs of strong demand was that all of the $60 million of payment-in-kind notes were sold to the public. In the May 24 prospectus, $25 million of them were to be taken by Mr. Trump's bank creditors.
The rumor in the credit market was that high-yield mutual funds run by Fidelity and Putnam would buy many of the Trump junk-bond issues. This could not be confirmed. But if such high-yield funds do buy the Trump notes, it will be millions of small investors who are taking on the risks as portfolio managers try to keep their returns attractive.
"Some people may buy them but not want it to be up in lights because of the drubbing that people took on Trump," said one portfolio manager, who like others was reluctant to comment for the record on the Trump deal.
 
 
Risks Cited
 The payment-in-kind notes will allow interest to be paid with new notes rather than cash for eight years. A number of portfolio managers said they would not touch the Trump notes because of the risks. One manager said he figured that the equity value of Trump Plaza would have to increase at a rate that exceeded the yield on the bonds over the next eight years.
That yield, according to Mr. Trump, will be around 12.5 percent. He said the yield would be 137 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on the mortgage notes, which is 11.125 percent. The fact that the notes are being sold at a price below their face value raises the yield value of the 10.875 percent coupon to the investor.
Another sign of strong demand was the fact that the spread between the yield on the mortgage notes and the payment-in-kind bonds was lower than the 150 basis points that was being predicted as Merrill Lynch began shopping the bonds this week.
The actual return on the payment-in-kind bonds will be higher because they come with warrants that give a buyer $1,000 in additional notes for each original $5,000 note that was purchased. This brings the effective yield to around 15 percent, analysts said.
 
 
Better Buy
 The mortgage notes, according to portfolio managers, seemed to be a much better buy, in part because they are a mortgage on the Trump Plaza casino. Several analysts said the casino had the assets to back up the mortgage.
But still, there are those who wonder about buying from Mr. Trump again.
"It's like Brazil coming back to the market," said Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "From an outsiders point of view I am always amazed how quickly people forget. But when you are managing other people's money you do that."
Mr. Trump dismissed such thoughts. Asked about Brazil, he said, "I've never been like that."
"The reason they stuck with me," he added, referring to bondholders, "is that they know what kind of job we do."
 
 
Treasury Market
 Prices in the Treasury market were little changed yesterday, even as traders and investors were greeted with the news that Senate Democrats had reached a compromise on a new version of President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan.
The price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 was up 1/32 point, to 104, and the yield was unchanged at 6.81 percent. The prices of short-term Treasury notes were down slightly as the yields, which move in the opposite direction, inched up a few basis points.
The shape of the final deficit-reduction plan depends on what compromise the House and Senate can finally work out if the full Senate approves the version put together by the Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. So any real response in the bond market, if there is any, will have to wait until then.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Steady

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
New claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged last week, the Labor Department reported today. The department said that 344,000 people applied for first-time benefits, the same as in the week that ended on June 5 and in line with forecasts.
The four-week moving average of new claims, regarded as a more accurate measure of the jobless situation than the more volatile weekly figures, showed a slight increase to 343,250 last week, compared with 342,500 a week earlier. 
 "The four-week moving average has not dramatically changed for some time," said Michael Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. "What we're seeing is more of the same."
Initial claims for the June 5 week were revised down slightly, from 345,000. A total of 2,769,000 people were receiving state unemployment benefits in that week, the latest period for which the figure is available.

Nomination Expected for Labor Post

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to nominate Katherine G. Abraham, a labor economist at the University of Maryland, as the new commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, Administration officials and colleagues of Professor Abraham said yesterday.
If nominated and confirmed by Congress, Professor Abraham, 38, who has spent most of her career in academia, will head the agency that produces several of the most important statistics for measuring the economic health of the nation and for gauging the success of any Administration. These include the monthly unemployment rate and the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
 "She is really quite good; a major researcher who has done important work on the nature of the labor force today," said Richard Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University, where Professor Abraham received a doctorate in economics in 1982. "She would be on any short list of candidates for the job."
 
Fitting the Mold
 The bureau commissioner has traditionally been a professional economist with considerable experience in survey work and statistical analysis. Professor Abraham fits this mold, having done considerable research on unemployment data, and on temporary and contract workers, a growing work place issue. In a survey of 442 companies that used temporary workers, for example, she found that 23 percent brought in the workers with the goal of finding good candidates for permanent jobs.
Another study, of which she was a co-author, found that older workers with 30 years or more of service were 3.6 times as likely to be laid off or dismissed as employees with eight to 10 years' service -- perhaps because the companies found the younger workers were more productive for their salaries than the higher-paid older workers.
Reached by telephone, Professor Abraham declined to comment on the reports that she was President Clinton's choice for commissioner. She would replace Janet Norwood, who resigned on Dec. 31, 1991, after more than a decade in the job, and became a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington.
 
Bush Nominee Not Confirmed
 To replace Ms. Norwood, President George Bush had nominated Marvin Kosters, the director of Economic Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, but Congress did not act on the nomination last year.
Before Professor Abraham was chosen, the Clinton Administration had offered the position to Rebecca Blank, an associate professor and labor economist at Northwestern University, various economists reported, but Ms. Blank decided not to move to the Washington area.
Professor Abraham, a native of Ames, Iowa, who lives near Washington, holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Iowa State University. She taught at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in the mid-1980's was a research associate at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington. She joined the University of Maryland faculty in 1988. She and her husband, Graham N. Horkeley, who works in computer software, have two sons.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed; Gold Continues to Edge Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday as several reports of economic weakness gave traders an excuse to cash in their profits following the currency's recent run-up.
Gold continued to edge up. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery rose 70 cents an ounce, up $372.20. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for spot gold of $370.85 an ounce, up 85 cents. 
 Traders initially sold dollars in early New York trading after the Commerce Department reported that the April trade deficit jumped to $10.49 billion. Many analysts had expected the deficit to narrow substantially.
In theory, a larger trade deficit signals weakness in the economy and diminishes prospects for higher interest rates. Lower rates would make investments denominated in dollars less attractive to investors.
In addition, currency market participants believe that the Clinton Administration favors a strong Japanese yen as a way to help pare the American trade deficit.
Another sign of economic weakness came in a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which said its June indexes of business conditions and employment fell sharply in comparison with May.
But the dollar quickly recovered as sentiment crept back that Europe's economy was in worse shape than the United States'. "The market is still anticipating lower interest rates in Europe and eventual higher rates in the U.S.," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
In addition, political uncertainties in Japan continued to undermine the yen. Opposition parties filed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for failing to enact political reforms in the current session of Parliament, which is due to end tomorrow.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 107.00 yen, up 0.65 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at a lower rate of 106.60 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 107.30 yen, up from 106.45 yen late Wednesday.
The dollar posted only slight gains against the German mark following its three-pfennig rally early this week.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6545 German marks, from 1.6590 marks late Wednesday. But in New York, the dollar rose to 1.6585 German marks from 1.6570 marks.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5145, up from $1.5035 late Wednesday. By 4 P.M. in New York, the pound fetched $1.5165, more than late Wednesday's $1.5050.
Other late dollar quotes in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.4810 Swiss francs, down from 1.4850; 5.5760 French francs, up from 5.5710; 1,507.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.2766 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2787.

HEADLINE: Business Confidence Wanes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Business executives' confidence in the economy plunged in June, the United States Chamber of Commerce said today.
The business confidence index fell to 47.7 percent in June from 59.3 percent in April and 62.4 percent in both February and December 1992. It was the lowest level since 39.3 percent in December 1991, when the economy had only recently emerged from the recession. 
 This month's decrease in confidence was the steepest drop recorded in the two years that the business lobby group has been conducting a bimonthly survey of its members.
The decline reflected, the group said, "a growing disenchantment with the economic uncertainty caused by the prospects of higher taxes for deficit reduction and health- care reform."
An index reading of 50 or more indicates moderate economic growth. A reading of 70 or more indicates strong growth.

Shades of a Rebirth for Painting

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
After a year dominated by everything but painting -- sculpture, installation art, late-Conceptual political art and so on -- the 1992-93 art season is winding down with a flurry of group painting exhibitions, almost all of them in SoHo. It would be stretching things to say that the medium is making a comeback, although it's about time: like the Democrats, painting has been out of office for so long that, in theory, it ought to be able to do some good. But it does seem that painting has a higher priority among young entry-level artists than it has had in recent seasons. With several galleries mounting painting shows concentrating on younger painters, re-election could be just around the corner.
Although these shows hardly represent the full range of painting being done at the moment, even by the younger generation, they do provide some interesting signals about the medium's direction. Cartoons, usually mixed with abstract elements, are especially hot, as are high-key fluorescent colors, which give some of these shows an undeniable visual bounce. Variations on the all-over composition, whose roots go back to Jackson Pollock's abstract drip paintings, continue to proliferate, often made of tiny semi-legible images. 
 As always, artists are experimenting with different ways to make paintings, an activity that seems essential to its vitality. Sometimes this involves using unfamiliar materials (a glass-smooth resin surface is rather popular right now) or unusual tools, like a felt-tip marker. In addition, the urge to appropriate found imagery and to bring the camera into the painting-making process, basic to so much art since the early 1980's, is yielding new twists and turns.
These shows of current work are all the more interesting because they're bracketed by two group shows of paintings from opposing styles of the recent past. At the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, "Singular Dimensions in Painting" presents nearly 40 Minimalist works by such artists as Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Brice Marden, Robert Ryman and Robert Mangold dating mostly from the 1960's and 70's. The show pays tribute to a sensibility in which logic, rigor and reduction ruled; it is characterized by an austere, crystalline beauty and the certain faith that less is more.
In marked contrast, the Tony Shafrazi Gallery (which recently relocated to 119 Wooster Street, SoHo) has mounted a timely, if not always first-rate tribute to the painting of the early 1980's, when the less-is-more faith crumbled and precocious talents like Kenny Scharf, Keith Haring, Donald Baechler, Francesco Clemente and Jean-Michel Basquiat were on the loose. (The Clemente -- a double-decker interior titled "My House" -- has never been shown in New York City and is especially good.) The painting of this period has been so roundly bashed of late that it may almost be time to start revising its somewhat sagging reputation, a process that might benefit the medium's current condition.
 
Postmasters Gallery
 The group show that has the most visual bang is "What's Wrong With This Picture?," at Postmasters Gallery, although its title never quite makes sense. The presiding spirit here is Carroll Dunham, who has operated in the gap between abstraction and cartooning for more than a decade and is represented by a new abstraction, radiant of color, loquacious of form and bursting its pictorial seams with mounds of little balls dipped in paint. Mr. Dunham's influence is visible in new paintings by Matthew Weinstein and Bill Komoski.
Steve Di Bennedetto, known for cool-handed reprises of Op Art, has turned to more heavily worked and layered compositions, which have a new emotional heat, while Michael Scott's painting of black-and-white stripes continues to build quite effectively on the Op vocabulary. The show's newest name is Christian Schumann, whose taut collagelike mixture of words, cartoonish images and abstract shapes exudes so much precocious pictorial talent that he seems like an early 80's throwback.
 
Jay Gorney
 The optical punch of the Postmasters show has a slightly softer echo at Jay Gorney Modern Art, where a show of six painters includes works by Mr. Komoski and Mr. Di Bennedetto, who provide some of its better moments. Here the inclination toward the all-over compositions, preferably achieved through eccentric painting methods, is especially evident.
Scott Grodesky has made an unexceptional painting by covering a canvas with shattered glass and spraying it with black paint. Lari Pittman's small paintings reveal that this talented painter needs a big surface to build up pictorial steam. Peter Nagy's ornate yet somewhat sinister black-on-white patterns suggest origins in the vicinity of the Xerox machine.
Lisa Ruyter, a young artist who is making her debut in several galleries at the moment, covers her canvases with a fine-lined web of interconnecting images drawn with a felt-tip marker and intermittently filled in with one or two shades of Day-Glo color. Ms. Ruyter's images, which repeat motifs that seem to come from various popular sources, are engaging in the way they shift in and out of legibility, like linear Rorschach blots, but ultimately they are thin and a little gimmicky, and steer too close to some kind of crazed commercial illustration.
 
Jack Tilton Gallery
 Down the street at the Jack Tilton Gallery, the Cartoons "R" Us energy prevails in the group show "Pure Pop for Now People" (the title is lifted from an album by the English pop star Nick Lowe), but here the imagery tends more toward the figurative.
The best-known and most accomplished of these six artists, several of whom are showing their work in New York City for the first time, is Chuck Agro, a veteran of several recent group efforts, who has yet to have a solo show. With the help of clear resin applied to paint on plaster, Mr. Agro has come to specialize in endearingly wry, physically smooth images of rough characters, fat blobby guys with 5 o'clock shadows and bad haircuts, when they have any hair at all. The clear frescolike colors add to the air of innocence, as does the plaster, which curls around the edges of the paintings like cake icing, or shaving lotion.
Katie Merz and Dan McCarthy also specialize in cartoon images and share Mr. Agro's sense of ease and economy, while the complex, more conventionally rendered images of Jane Fine and Jory Felice show promise, but also try too hard.
 
Salvatore Ala
 "Paintings," the group show at Salvatore Ala, seems intent upon avoiding a unifying theme or style. Cary Smith's blocky thick-surfaced paintings and Stephen Westfall's inimitably airy ones make the case for hard-edged geometry. (Although the best Westfall on view in SoHo right now is a relatively small painting in an otherwise mediocre group show at the Stephen Rosenberg Gallery.)
Making the case for gesture are Craig Fisher's big, confident abstractions, in which large spots of paint in different colors and densities drift across bare canvas. They provide more evidence that the legacy of Color Field painting, crossed with a little Cy Twombly, lives on.
The Dutch artist Jan Frank, whose work used to be more geometric, contributes three swirling black-and-white abstractions, big spongy thickets of line, whose main attraction is that they are painted on big squares of raw plywood boxed out to a thickness of six inches, so that they resemble packing crates.
The cartoon sensibility finds especially delicate expression in the paintings of Amy Sillman, which contrast thin stains of rich color with lacelike patterns of line that effortlessly flow between the decorative and the imagistic, often intimating feminist tales as they go.
 
Collins & Millazzo
 In Chelsea, on West 23d Street, the independent curators Collins & Millazzo have organized an exhibition of American and European artists that is rather ambiguously titled "Elvis Has Left the Building (A Painting Show)." Although large and uneven and often relentlessly derivative, it offers several works of interest.
Among these are a small, adept, if rather Polke-like abstraction by Lino Fiorito, an Italian painter who helped organize the show; a painting of a giant blue-on-white plant form by Alessandro Twombly (son of Cy Twombly), and two small, rather Surrealist interiors, beautiful in their color and detail, by Robin Tewes, whose work has not been so visible in recent years. Also of interest are works by Joo Chung, Marc Maz, Gian Carlo Pagliasso and Charles Clough.
 
Solo Shows
 In addition to these group shows, several painters are having one-person exhibitions that are worth a visit. Mr. Clough, for example, has mounted a show of his roiling gestural abstractions, which contrast passionate brushwork with glaring Pop colors, at the Grand Salon, a gallery Collins & Millazzo recently opened in SoHo.
At Wooster Gardens, additional works by Lisa Ruyter are on view, along with the paintings of Margaret Curtis, which seek a new fusion of pure paint, narrative and feminism with the help of cake-decorating tools. The results are quite impressive.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Racing Report Is In, And Jockeying Begins

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Sweeping changes in operating, taxing and betting on horse racing in New York State were proposed to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo yesterday when his special commission released its report on how to revive an industry that it said was "in decline in New York State and throughout the nation."
The report sprang no surprises after nine months of hearings and two months of briefings. But it did concede that "the reform process will be long, difficult and at times frustrating," especially since its main provisions would have to be approved by the Legislature. And the Governor took the occasion to renew his attack on the New York Racing Association for "having blown the whole racing industry." 
 The heart of the report calls for a merger of the two principal organizations in racing in the state: the New York Racing Association, which operates the Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga race tracks, and the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation, one of the six regional offtrack betting companies, which handles 60 percent of the money wagered in the state.
 
100 Pages in the Report
 The two organizations, which operate as competitors for the betting dollar and almost as natural enemies, would join under a new state agency that would regulate the entire business. However, their precise relationship to each other would have to be decided through joint negotiations, which seemed likely to trigger a political fight for survival.
The tone of the 100-page report, titled "Racing Into the 21st Century," was diplomatic but firm and at times doomsaying. But it was received by the Governor with renewed anger directed at the executives of N.Y.R.A., which was enfranchised in 1955 to run the race tracks and to turn over any profits to the state. The franchise expires in the year 2000, but as the profit has dwindled, the Governor's anger has grown.
At an impromptu news conference at the state Capitol in Albany, he said with heat:
"What did the people at N.Y.R.A. get paid for having blown the whole racing industry? For not being able to pay the taxes? Well, they got Jaguars. They got Porsches. And they gave themselves bonuses this year."
"You're begging for jobs in western New York," he went on. "Your unemployment rate is out of sight. You can't find work for the people on welfare. You can't increase the unemployment insurance because you can't afford it. You're cutting Medicaid benefits. People in education are all crying. You had to increase the tuition of hard-working middle-class people.
"But they're giving themselves raises at N.Y.R.A."
He was asked if the Legislature could act during its current session, which ends on June 25, and he replied: "I don't know." And he said that he would talk with his advisers "to see what the next steps are."
 
Less Winter Racing
 The commission, headed by the state's director of economic development, Vincent Tese, made these key proposals:
*The city's Offtrack Betting Corporation and N.Y.R.A. should enter into a "joint venture" to eliminate duplicate costs, "increase the total amount bet, return more revenues to the industry and to government and maintain an option for privatization." They would somehow be merged under a new state superagency within the Public Service Commission.
*The state tax on parimutuel bets would be reduced by approximately 2 percentage points to return money to "the betting churn" to stimulate wagering. Under current law, 17 percent is subtracted from every winning bet (and up to 25 percent on exotic, or multiple, bets). The money is split this way: 8.5 percent to N.Y.R.A., 4.5 percent to the state, 3.5 percent to purses and one-half of 1 percent to breeders. The commission recommended that the takeout be lowered by 2 percentage points for two years to see if it actually put more money back into the betting system.
*In a one-year experiment, winter racing in New York would be replaced by a combination of live racing and simulcast racing from other tracks. New York's tracks are now limited to importing 50 races on television each year. But some live racing would be held to accommodate horsemen who spend the winter in New York, despite the fact that seven racing days were canceled by severe weather last winter.
*The 12 percent state withholding tax on payoffs of $1,000 or more would be deferred. The bettor would still be expected to pay taxes on winnings at the end of the year. But, the commission said, the withholding practice "has been a severe burden to horseplayers, who are being taxed not on their profits, but on their gross receipts."
 
Cautious Reactions
 The industry reactions to the report were guarded. Allan Dragone, the chairman of N.Y.R.A. who was in California on business, said in a statement: "N.Y.R.A. is anxious to effectuate change after careful deliberation of the impact of the commission's proposal."
Hazel Dukes, president of the city OTB, said: "We have many questions as to the nature of a joint venture. But we are looking forward to a realistic dialogue that leaves the past behind."
And Vincent Tese said for the commission: "Unless there's change, this industry is in for a long, deep slide."

Books That Make a Case for Shades of Gray

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
HUMAN beings have always had a fondness for black and white distinctions, for easy ways of categorizing experience, values and taste, as though life were just one great big athletic showdown. People are foxes (who know many things) or hedgehogs (who know one big thing); Apollonians (advocates of order and classical discipline) or Dionysians (revelers in the romantic and the extreme). Writers are palefaces (genteel surveyors of sensibility, like Henry James) or redskins (raucous explorers of the outer limits, like Melville). One is "in" or "out"; in Nancy Mitford's words, "U" or "Non-U." Or, as Ken Kesey once put it, you're either on the bus or off the bus.
Recently, however, such amusing distinctions have given way to more serious efforts to pigeonhole the world, efforts that underscore our tendency to see everything in terms of either-or, all-or-nothing, left-or-right. Teen-agers used to ask each other, "Are you a fan of the Stones or the Beatles?" John or Paul? Those innocuous questions, used to categorize one as a human being, have been replaced by similarly reductive -- but considerably more loaded -- litmus tests: Are you "pro life" or "pro choice"? Are you for unemployed loggers or endangered spotted owls? Do you believe Anita Hill or Clarence Thomas? Is Bosnia another Holocaust or another Vietnam? 
 Television, newspaper and magazine polls almost daily tell us whether President Clinton is up or down, whether people give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the world, the country, their own lives. Newsweek's Conventional Wisdom Watch evaluates everything from politics to sports to the fortunes of Socks the cat with an arrow up or an arrow down (or a horizontal arrow to indicate no change). Time magazine's new column Winners & Losers gives the reader an illustrated list of that week's personalities who have scored a success or suffered a defeat, while its Health Report categorizes developments in medicine as "good news" or "bad news."
Mr. Clinton's campaign talk of creating a new politics of consensus has devolved into factional fights between liberals and moderates within his own Administration, and attacks from the right and left without. The Administration's struggle to find an acceptable Supreme Court nominee, its waffling over the issue of homosexuals in the military, the appointment of David Gergen as a White House consultant, all have been marked by a heightened awareness of reactions from the left and the right.
Indeed, shrill denunciations, absolutist language and extremist assertions have become a commonplace in debates about politics, race, abortion and sexism. Dr. Leonard Jeffries preaches the superiority of blacks (or "sun people" as he calls them), while David Duke has declared "there's only one country anymore that's all white, and that's Iceland, and Iceland is not enough." Feminists blame men for sexism, while members of the men's movement blame women for making them victims. Traditionalists assail multiculturalists as "Visigoths in Tweed," while radical reformers complain about the hegemony of DWEM's (that is, dead white European males).
This rising tide of rhetoric, along with our current penchant for either-or constructions, is both a symptom of -- and a catalyst for -- the growing polarization of American society, a polarization, as authors of several recent books point out, that has begun to affect how we think about everything from politics to the arts. "Polarization is addictive," writes the critic Robert Hughes in his eloquent new book, "Culture of Complaint." "It is the crack of politics -- a short intense rush that the system craves again and again, until it begins to collapse."
Cornel West -- the director of Afro-American studies at Princeton University and the author of a new book called "Race Matters" -- argues that in the area of race, too, "the predictable pitting of liberals against conservatives, Great Society Democrats against self-help Republicans, reinforces intellectual parochialism and political paralysis."
As Mr. West sees it, "these two camps have nearly suffocated the crucial debate that should be taking place about the prospects for black America." By focusing on government aid and the economic dimension, he says, the liberal approach overlooks the crucial role of culture and values; by focusing on the moral behavior of poor city blacks, he adds, the conservative approach "tends to deny the lingering effect of black history -- a history inseparable from though not reducible to victimization."
Another scholar, James Davison Hunter of the University of Virginia, defines the polarization taking root in America in somewhat different terms. In his book "Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America," he suggests that orthodox elements from the Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant traditions are forming a coalition against progressive forces from those same traditions and secular interests. Given most political and social issues, he suggests, it's fairly easy to predict the stand of many major organizations: on the progressive side, one can usually find mainline Protestant denominations, as well as such groups as the National Council of Churches and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; on the orthodox side can usually be found such groups as the National Right to Life Committee, the American Council of Christian Churches, the American Association of Christian Schools and Agudath Israel of America.
 
Mirror, Mirror
 Just what accounts for this growing polarization? In part, the development is a reflection of realities in American society: the growing disparity between rich and poor, and the growing racial tensions that have been exacerbated by unemployment, shifting immigration patterns and a troubled economy.
Yet at the same time, the polarization is also the result of ideologues on either end of the political spectrum imposing their paint-by-the-numbers formulations on the national debate; and a function of a time-pressed, fashion-obsessed society in which people have opinions about books they've never read and movies they've never seen. After all, it's easier and more amusing to dispense a quick pro or con witticism about a subject -- be it Somalia, the budget or the latest Springsteen album -- than to embark upon a considered discussion. Cut to the chase, as they say: what people want to know is, is it good or bad? What's the bottom line?
No doubt the "us versus them" view of the world also has roots in the Manichaeism of the cold war decades, which pitted a virtuous, democratic America against the evil empire of the Soviet Union; and in the counter-culture struggles of the 60's, which encouraged opponents of the Vietnam War to see themselves in an adversarial relationship with the Establishment. Conservatives remember the 60's, when they saw liberals as obscenity-shouting radicals; liberals remember the 80's, when they saw conservatives as greedy capitalist pigs.
As the world order has fragmented, as economic and social problems have proliferated at home, these old habits of bipolarism die hard. Japan and Iraq have been floated as possible successors for the role once filled by America's old nemesis, the Soviet Union, while an assortment of domestic bogeymen have been proposed by ideologues on both the left and right.
Of course, the us-versus-them formula has long been used by politicians, eager to focus their agendas by playing up distinctions between themselves and their opponents. It's an inclination that has been galvanized by television: not only do the nightly news programs zero in on the most colorful sound bites, but talk shows (from "The McLaughlin Group" to "Crossfire" to "Meet the Press") like to pit conservatives against liberals, Republicans against Democrats.
In his compelling new book "Strange Bedfellows," the Los Angeles Times reporter Tom Rosenstiel argues that television has concentrated increasingly on the horse-race aspect of politics, and that politicians have learned to exploit this situation. Of the Clinton adviser Paul Begala, Mr. Rosenstiel writes that he "believed the teachings of Republican strategist Roger Ailes that the press was mostly interested only in conflict, scandal, polls, process and gaffes." Mr. Rosenstiel adds: "So to get coverage of a speech, he usually included attack lines, making his speeches more malicious than they would otherwise be."
 
Corralling Scapegoats
 In the escalating war of words, hyperbole flourishes, as both sides play to the public's fears, searching for easy scapegoats and convenient straw men. Extremes consequently begin to dominate the debate: while the left tries to equate conservatives with Senator Jesse Helms, the right tries to equate liberals with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. As Mr. Hughes observes in "Culture of Complaint," "one side needs the other, so that each can inflate its agenda into a chiliastic battle for the soul of America."
This process of polarization began decades ago, say Thomas Byrne Edsall and Mary D. Edsall in their book "Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights and Taxes on American Politics." As the Edsalls see it, the reform wing of the Democratic party, which gained control of the nominating process in 1972, alienated working-class and middle-class whites by pushing the party toward an identification with minority rights. During the 80's, the Edsalls say, the Republicans learned to exploit this development, portraying the Democrats as the party of special interests and welfare recipients; this Republican tactic -- which culminated in the use of Willie Horton in television ads during the 1988 campaign -- effectively used racial politics as a wedge to break up the old Democratic coalition.
Though the Democrats have regained the Presidency, the polarization nourished by years of divided government (since 1951, the White House and Senate have been controlled by different parties more than half the time) has remained in place. Voters have become accustomed to a familiar dialectic: the private sector versus the public sector, taxpayers versus welfare recipients, defenders of responsiblity versus advocates of rights.
 
Political Art
 In much the same way that the liberal-conservative dialectic has politicized the workings of government (from the selection of Supreme Court Justices to the passing of budget proposals), it has also infected the worlds of art and academia.
Some artists have willfully decided to use their work as a means of making political statements: rap music frequently purveys a hostile, divisive message, using ethnic slurs and violent antipolice demagoguery to try to shock audiences into an awareness of social problems. Much of the art on view at this year's Whitney Biennial is also overtly ideological, banging home messages about racism, sexism and ecology with the subtlety of a jackhammer.
At its best, such art has the ability to educate the public at large and provoke intelligent discussion; one thinks, say, of "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about AIDS and the spiritual malaise of America. More often, however, overtly political art, like that on display at the Biennial, tends to preach to the converted, thereby accelerating the Balkanization of the arts in this country and the loss of common ground.
"A dazzling array of different radio stations, music recordings, and films," says the history professor Paul Jerome Croce, in an essay in the magazine The Public Perspective, "are now available to individual customers, without their having to defer to the selective choices of media moguls. With polarized politics and technological variety, people can get their news and find entertainment -- things that used to be the province of mass culture -- all within the segregated clusters of their own subculture."
To complicate matters further, the politicized Zeitgeist that has encouraged overtly ideological works of art also ratifies the tendency to look at all art -- both past and present -- through an ideological lens. On one hand, reactionaries label everything from "Murphy Brown" to the photos of Robert Mapplethorpe as subversive work that threatens to undermine family values and corrupt the youth of the nation. On the other hand, advocates of political correctness denounce the likes of Conrad and Melville as outdated avatars of a sexist and racist power structure that needs to be overturned.
The loudest voices raised on both sides of this debate are shrill, admitting little room for rational discussion or common sense. Columbus is either the heroic explorer who opened the gates of the New World or the barbaric imperialist who initiated the rape of Eden. The literary canon taught at colleges is condemned either as a motley assortment of obscure third-world writers, or as an obsolete collection of DWEM's. To put it another way, you're either on the bus or off the bus.
The problem with this either-or approach is that it reduces art to its message, and erases the subtle grays of ambiguity and chance. Characters become stick figures in a morality drama, and just to make sure that the identity of the heroes and the villains is perfectly clear, the audience is given lots of little signposts. In "Indecent Proposal," we know Demi Moore is supposed to be sympathetic because she takes a job teaching citizenship; in "Jurassic Park," we know the Brachiosaurus is a good dinosaur because it's a vegetarian; the Velociraptor is a bad one because it's got an unhealthy appetite for meat.
As politically correct attitudes permeate esthetics, the story an artist wants to tell or the way it is told becomes less important than the issues it supposedly addresses. "It revives the illusion that works of art carry social meaning the way trucks carry coal," writes Mr. Hughes. "It divides the sprawling republic of literature neatly into goodies and baddies, and relieves the student of the burden of imaginative empathy, the difficulties of esthetic discrimination."
 
No Nuances, Please
 The consequences of society's overall polarization are similarly insidious. Hyperbolic rhetoric about any issue obscures the emotional and political nuances of the actual situation. Symbolism and metaphor -- comparing Bosnia, say, to Vietnam or the Holocaust -- begin to color reality; generalizations take the place of specifics; snap judgments replace thoughtful debate.
To give Mr. Clinton or any public figure a simple thumbs up or thumbs down flattens out the ambiguities of politics and history, turning the chiaroscuro of real life into a comic book's primary colors. "We tend to deal with our past Presidents," writes Meg Greenfield in a recent Newsweek column, "either by suppressing and ignoring their faults so we can count them saintly, or uncovering those faults and deciding they obliterate all the good the benighted fellow ever did. Which is to say that, just as it is with our contemporary Presidents, so we seem always to insist that their long-gone predecessors were either heroes or villains, successes or failures -- never, say, a little of each and a lot in between."
Equally problematic is the effect that an either-or, all-or-nothing mentality has on the collective dialogue. When opinions calcify into hard-line stands, when extremists on the right and left define the agenda, the middle ground is lost, and along with it, the possibility of consensus.
 
Beyond Dogma: Jazz
 Are there any solutions to this situation? In his book "Beyond the Culture Wars," Gerald Graff, a professor of English at the University of Chicago, proposes teaching the conflict between, say, multiculturalists and their traditionalist opponents as a way of forcing students to grapple directly with both sides of the debate.
Mr. West uses the metaphor of jazz to describe a mode of critical exchange that would move beyond dogmatic pronoucements and supremacist ideologies. "The interplay of individuality and unity is not one of uniformity and unanimity imposed from above," he writes, "but rather of conflict among diverse groupings that reach a dynamic consensus subject to questioning and criticism. As with a soloist in a jazz quartet, quintet or band, individuality is promoted in order to sustain and increase the creative tension with the group -- a tension that yields higher levels of performance to achieve the aim of the collective project."
Such an approach is predicated not upon mutually exclusive alternatives but upon the inclusive belief that individuals can understand, even sympathize with the disparate beliefs and values of others. Its result is not polarization but pluralism, the idea, as Isaiah Berlin wrote in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity," that "there are many different ends that men may seek and still be fully rational, fully men, capable of understanding each other and sympathizing and deriving light from each other, as we derive it from reading Plato or the novels of medieval Japan -- worlds, outlooks, very remote from our own."

HEADLINE: Brazil Prolongs Haiti's Agony

 BODY:
U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels ring its coasts. It has barely six weeks' oil supply on hand. The worldwide oil embargo voted by the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday should have marked the beginning of the end for Haiti's military regime.
But at the last minute Brazil got squeamish. The Council flinched from authorizing those vessels to enforce the embargo. The likely results: more unnecessary weeks of suffering for the Haitian people, and a weakening of Brazil's own claim to a permanent Security Council seat. 
 Even in its diluted form, the Security Council resolution, which takes effect next Wednesday, is important and welcome. Until now, the only economic pressure behind diplomatic efforts to restore Haitian democracy was a highly porous Western Hemisphere embargo.
That only made life harder for Haiti's destitute peasants and slum dwellers, but failed to stop luxury imports to the wealthy supporters of the military regime. And it had no effect at all on the tanker traffic between Europe and Haiti.
If it can stop the flow of oil, the Council resolution will immobilize the army's trucks, planes and tanks, along with the cars and boats of the elite. The resolution also usefully bans arms shipments and freezes Haitian assets abroad. But the removal of the naval enforcement provision invites evasions, even though countries violating it now face punishment themselves.
Brazil's action, supported by Venezuela, reflects a longstanding Latin American concern about outsiders, particularly the U.S., intervening in domestic political issues. But in this case the intervener is the United Nations and the domestic political issue is the destruction of democracy by military force.
What of Latin America's own commitment at Santiago, Chile, two years ago to defend the hemisphere's democratic regimes? And what of Brazil's claim to be a serious world power deserving a permanent seat on the Security Council? The Council is often asked to authorize the use of international force, sometimes over such internal political questions as starvation and banditry in Somalia or potential genocide in Iraq. Should Brazil be expected to water down all such resolutions?
Bad enough that Brazil embarrasses its own diplomacy. Far worse that it prolongs the agony of Haitians who have already suffered far too long.

HEADLINE: Budget Bill: Make It Better

 BODY:
President Clinton's budget plan got roughed up by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. But the bill that is emerging would still cut the deficit by about $500 billion over five years, primarily with lower defense spending and higher taxes on families with taxable income over $100,000. The committee bill, like the President's plan, would be a step toward fiscal prudence.
Nevertheless, the bill would come at a steep price to poor workers and makes health-care reform needlessly more difficult. Senate Democrats cut $45 billion from the energy tax passed by the House. More than $35 billion of the gaping hole was filled by whacking Medicare, food stamps and tax credits for low-paid workers -- cuts that House-Senate conferees should fully restore. 
 The loss of a single Democratic vote would have buried the President's budget plan in committee. Senate Democratic leaders were therefore forced to appease each committee member who opposed higher energy taxes. That required substituting a sales tax on transportation fuels, mostly gasoline, for the President's broad-based B.T.U. tax and scaling back the tax increase from $70 billion in the House bill to $25 billion.
The committee would pay for these changes, in part, by cutting back programs for the poor. Gone is Mr. Clinton's plan to increase food stamps for needy families. Also gone is his innovative plan to extend tax credits to workers without children who are currently ineligible for the credits and who, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have been hit hardest by Federal tax hikes over the past 15 years.
Indeed, because as higher gas taxes work their way into consumer prices and thereby hit all poor families, the Senate plan will tax some poor families into poverty. This threatens the centerpiece of the President's anti-poverty strategy: to lift every full-time worker out of poverty.
The committee would pile on $20 billion in Medicare cuts on top of the $50 billion already proposed by the House. Supposedly this cut would come at the expense of doctors and hospitals. But they will charge their private patients more.
And by taking a $20 billion cut out of Medicare now, the committee plan would leave that much less for the President's task force to take from Medicare when it issues its health care reform. That will force it either to scale back its program or pay for it by raising taxes by an additional $20 billion.
That said, the committee made changes worth preserving. At the urging of Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, it trimmed some $12 billion in unwarranted corporate loopholes and other tax giveaways proposed by the President. They include wasteful subsidies for investors in small business and the restoration of deductions for so-called passive losses by real estate investors. The last thing the economy needs is more investment in real estate.
The committee bill is expected to be passed by the full Senate next week. Exactly how the House and Senate will resolve their differences isn't clear. The important task for the conferees is to reinstate about $10 billion in tax credits for poor workers, $7.5 billion in food stamps and $20 billion for Medicare. One place to look for the extra money is a broader sales tax on energy -- one that extends beyond gasoline to electricity and other sources. For the sake of the environment, the poor and health reform, the country can afford more than $25 billion in new energy taxes.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Change Is Hard

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
Bill Clinton ran as the candidate of change. So, in his way, did Ross Perot. A large majority of Americans voted for them and for change. But since Jan. 20 we have been relearning -- we and President Clinton -- how hard change is in the American system.
In the campaign Mr. Clinton blamed "gridlock" in Washington, the tension between a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, for inaction on national problems. By now he knows that the difficulty is far more profound. 
 This week the President made some satisfying gains in Congress. His budget plan moved another step, the Senate Republican filibuster against campaign finance reform was broken after compromise, and committees approved his proposal for national service.
Those victories did a lot for Presidential morale after a string of bad weeks for Mr. Clinton. But the price of victory was giving up a good deal of substance, and who knows what the bills will contain by the time of final passage?
Political deadlock is more than a passing Washington phenomenon. The men who created our constitutional system 200 years ago deliberately made change difficult, dividing authority and building in conflict. They reasoned, wisely, that efficiency in government was less important than protecting the people from the dangers of concentrated power.
But something has happened to the constitutional theory in recent years. Dealing with urgent national necessities has become not just difficult but, we often feel, impossible.
The budget deficit is a compelling example. Just about everyone agrees that it has to come down, and President Clinton is making the first serious effort in years. But his proposal is being nibbled to death by ducks. Its fate illustrates what has gone wrong with the system.
The Clinton plan relied heavily on a new energy tax. Lobbyists for big energy users savaged that proposal, and senators from oil states killed it. Instead the Senate Finance Committee put in a derisorily small gasoline tax increase and, to save money, called for massive cuts in Medicare. Does anyone really think that those cuts will survive the certain onslaught by the elderly lobby?
In other words, it is hard to change because important interests want to keep the advantages they have. We live in a world of mutual vetoes. Most of the time, inertia wins.
Loss of the energy tax is particularly painful. American energy prices are the lowest in the industrial world. In real terms, taking account of inflation, they are 30 percent lower than they were 10 years ago. The result is to make us profligate users of energy, damning the environment and making us dangerously dependent on Middle East oil.
"The neutering of Bill Clinton's energy tax would be a huge opportunity missed," The Economist of London said last week. Since then it has effectively been neutered.
Why has the resistance to change that the Framers built into the Constitution become so much greater, and more serious?
First, the Federal Government is far more important than James Madison & Co. ever imagined, with huge powers over the national economy and individuals' share. It follows that interest groups will fight more tenaciously over its policy.
Second, modern communications have inflated the egos of members of Congress, and their independence. They are less likely to cooperate with their leadership or the President when they can go on television and take a stance as protectors of local interests.
Third, the President nowadays has no respite from the press. The age of deference is past. Reporters are all over him all the time.
In those circumstances we are dated romantics if we think a President can just use his bully pulpit to see that the nation's problems are solved. Bill Clinton has made mistakes. But the problems are deep, and any President who is serious about addressing them would find it desperately hard to make things change.
I erred in a recent column when I said that President Clinton had asked Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago to be Secretary of Transportation and then withdrawn the offer. The offer, made and withdrawn, was to the Mayor's brother, William M. Daley, a banker and lawyer.

HEADLINE: Simple Categories Just Don't Explain the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Coming Clash of Civilizations or, The West Against the Rest" (Op-Ed, June 6) by Samuel P. Huntington, director of Harvard's Olin Institute for Strategic Studies, is fraught with dangerous assertions. While the article illustrates the declining importance of the nation-state, it offers a hollow paradigm of a new world order rife with competing civilizations.
To categorize the world into Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and "possibly African" civilizations is arbitrary and ahistorical at best, racist at worst. Mr. Huntington's depiction of civilizations as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity" follows the logic that leads to the justification of "ethnic cleansing," for he implicitly asserts that authentic, pure civilizations exist. 
 Moreover, he explicitly downplays the importance of political and economic conflicts. In Mr. Huntington's formulation differences between civilizations will be the source of tensions. Thus the presence of "Latin Americans" in the United States, "Africans" in Britain and "Muslims" in Germany will inevitably lead to conflict, as seen in the Western context. Consequently, according to this logic, to avoid conflict these outsiders should become Western or leave.
Civilizations are not homogeneous entities; they are composed of and divided by overlapping groups based on gender, class, religious sect, region, language and ethnicity. Moreover, there are strong links between groups across civilizational categories. Although Mr. Huntington acknowledges that civilizations blend and overlap, he still maintains that the "clash of civilizations will dominate politics."
For Mr. Huntington, "differences among civilizations are basic, involving history, language, culture, tradition and, most importantly, religion." If one were to take Islamic civilization as an example (which along with Confucian civilization he labels as potentially hostile to Western civilization), one would see that the more than 1 billion adherents of Islam do not share a single history, language, culture or tradition.
Islam is a complex religion that has, over 1,400 years, taken on many political, philosophical, theological and mystical forms in a number of countries; and Muslims are a diverse grouping of people that differ in gender, class, ethnicity and experience. Simply to place all Muslims under the rubric Islamic civilization is to iron out diversity and support the ideologies of fundamentalist groups, which wish to eliminate differences within the Muslim world.
Moreover, it ignores ties between groups who are members of different civilizations. This is not to deny the importance of civilizational identities, but to argue that these divided and dynamic identities are only one of the multiple identities all individuals possess.
To divide the inhabitants of the world into seven or eight simple categories of civilization and conclude that in future major conflicts will occur along these lines is a simplistic political analysis that reflects the rhetoric of racist-fundamentalist-nationalist leaders, rather than the reality of the diverse groups of individuals that make up this world. Global conflicts will occur, but they will emerge from a combination of the political, economic and cultural tensions pervading the world, not simply from divisions between seven or eight categories dreamed up by Samuel Huntington.

To the Editor:
Samuel Huntington's June 6 Op-Ed article seems to me fictional and xenophobic. He uses religious labels to separate "civilizations," which are in a great state of flux and increasingly interdependent. Having just returned from nine months as a visiting scholar at the Central Institute of Fine Arts in Beijing, I question what he means by "Confucian civilization." Is he referring to China and Korea?
Having visited an entirely deserted Confucian temple in Suzhou (all the Government money flows to tourist sites like the gardens), I can hardly be convinced that Confucianism in its institutional, religious sense is predominant in China; making money in Western capitalist fashion is more of a current value. If any religion is making headway in China, it is Christianity, again contradicting Mr. Huntington's thesis of separately evolving religious "civilizations," sealed off and pitted against each other. 
 Mr. Huntington posits, in new cold war fashion, a "connection between Confucian and Islamic states." This is pure fiction, promulgated to resist arms reduction. Mr. Huntington is linking his fears of Islam and "Red" China into a mythical beast.
If, as he appears to fear, the East, and particularly China, is rising up as an economic force, isn't it in our best interest to understand the past and present of the region? Is it necessary to regard the Chinese or the Muslims as America's new enemy? Ought we not recognize that America itself is becoming a racially mixed nation, which must respect various races in daily interaction to prosper?
Mr. Huntington's argument is based on outmoded cliches and attachment to big guns, and would benefit from more direct cross-cultural experience.

HEADLINE: For Best Revenue, Tax Cigarettes $1.26

 BODY:
To the Editor:
According to Jeffrey E. Harris, a $2 increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes from 24 cents a pack to $2.24 a pack would increase tax revenue from $5 billion to $33 billion (Op-Ed, June 4). Professor Harris underestimates the reduction in smoking rates that would accompany the excise tax hike and thus substantially overestimates the additional tax revenue that would be generated. 
 My research with Gary S. Becker, winner of the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, Frank J. Chaloupka and Kevin M. Murphy demonstrates that cigarette consumption is responsive to price. Given the addictive nature of smoking, consumption of cigarettes is positively related to past consumption. This means that price response grows over time. For example, a price hike in 1993 would reduce consumption in 1993, which would cause consumption in 1994 and all future years to fall. Moreover, since teen-age smoking rates are particularly sensitive to price, the number of new smokers would fall dramatically.
My colleagues and I estimate that eventually each 10 percent increase in price causes per capita cigarette consumption to decline by about 8 percent. Based on our studies, I estimate that a tax rate of $1.26 a pack would maximize Federal revenue from the excise tax at $16 billion. Higher tax rates, such as the $2.24 suggested by Professor Harris, would yield less revenue than $16 billion.
Indeed, if the tax rate were sufficiently high, it might produce even less revenue than the $5 billion yielded by the tax of 24 cents.
The harm done to others by smokers (for example, that done to fetuses by pregnant women who smoke) may justify Federal excise tax rates of more than $1.26 a pack. But a rate of $2.24 would not yield nearly enough to pay for the health care of one-fourth of the 37 million uninsured Americans, for which Professor Harris argues.

HEADLINE: Gains Tax Turnabout

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
A capital gains tax increase?
Tax analysts are buzzing over a seemingly minor provision in the Senate Finance Committee's hastily cobbled budget proposal presented on Wednesday. For wedged in among the big-ticket items -- ranging from the 4.3 cent gasoline tax to the Medicare reimbursement cuts -- is an effective increase in the maximum tax rate on capital gains to 30.8 percent from 28 percent for those who pay most of the capital gains. 
 Ironically, the political fallout is likely to be large and the revenues small from this higher tax on gains for households with incomes over $250,000. "It's like waving a red flag at conservatives," remarked one senior Congressional staff member, who questioned the logic of rekindling the fiery debate over capital gains taxes at a moment when Democrats loyal to President Clinton need every vote they can muster.
But to the Finance Committee majority, an increase in the capital gains tax is a nod to good public policy and equity.
Under current law, the maximum capital gains tax for most Americans is 28 percent, although high-income taxpayers who claim large itemized deductions do pay a slightly higher effective rate. But that maximum rate represents only a modest break for upper-income families, who are now subject to a 31 percent rate on wages, interest and dividends in excess of $89,150.
And for years, economists who lean to the right have been arguing that a deeper cut in the capital gains rate would spur productivity with little or no sacrifice in revenue.
"Encouraging risk-taking is important," insists John Taylor, a researcher at Stanford University who was a member of President George Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
Indeed, this argument for helping small business has made more than a little headway among centrist Democrats: The House version of the budget bill would allow taxpayers to exclude from taxable income 50 percent of their long-term capital gains on sales of stock in small businesses.
But in a surprise move, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, managed to eliminate the break for small businesses from the Senate Finance Committee bill. More important, at least in symbolic terms, the committee voted to extend the House's 10 percent tax surcharge on ordinary income for wealthy taxpayers to include capital gains. Thus, the maximum effective rate on capital gains would rise from 28 percent to 1.10 times 28 percent, or 30.8 percent.
 
No Pressing Need Seen
 This reversal of fortunes clearly was not driven by the pressing need to recoup revenues lost in the rubble of the abandoned B.T.U. tax. For while the preponderance of evidence on capital gains suggests that somewhat higher rates would increase revenue over the very long term, the impact over the five-year horizon of the Congressional budget makers is probably too small to measure with any accuracy.
On the one hand, the stiffer tax rate would mean more taxes from those who chose to sell appreciated property. On the other, the higher rate would aggravate the "lock-in effect," reducing the incentive to realize capital gains. "It could raise or lose revenue," concluded Eric Toder, an economist at the Congressional Budget Office.
A more realistic concern to some is that the expanded tax rate differential in the House bill would serve as a catalyst for mischief. In the House's version, the difference between the tax rates on ordinary income and capital gains would widen to more than 11 percentage points, from only 3 percentage points now, making it more profitable for tax alchemists to transform dividends into gains from the sale of stock and other business property. "You are laying the foundation for new tax shelters," Senator Bradley said.
But perhaps the most pressing reason behind the push for a higher capital gains rate is the perception of fairness. The House bill hardly touched the incomes of middle-class families and actually increased the take-home pay of the working poor: As President Clinton correctly claims, the only big losers would be the wealthy who did very, very well indeed in the 1980's.
 
Keeping Rich on Hook
 The Senate Finance Committee bill, by contrast, limits the energy tax to gasoline and diesel fuel, stripping the burden from corporate stockholders. It delays the full impact of higher income tax rates on the wealthy until next year. And while the Medicare cuts are supposed to be borne by physicians and other well-off providers of health care, it is widely believed that the squeeze on Medicare will raise private medical insurance rates paid by the middle class.
Hence the Senate Finance Committee's concern that the wealthy not be let off the hook. And since 27 percent of the income from the sale of capital assets in 1991 was realized by taxpayers with more than $1 million in adjusted gross income, capital gains became an irresistible target.
It is far from clear whether the Senate Finance Committee's capital gains provisions will survive a floor vote, and then emerge intact from a reconciliation conference with the House. The higher gains rate will undoubtedly be cheered by House liberals, who have never been enthusiastic about President Clinton's focus on deficit reduction. But it will alienate the substantial numbers of Congressional Democrats who have no particular affection or loyalty for the President. And it is already becoming a rallying point for conservatives, who are bitter about the Democrats' turn toward populism.
"I think this whole thing is class warfare and very shortsighted," said Eugene Freedman, the chairman of Coopers & Lybrand.

HEADLINE: Japan's Government Falls; Party in Peril

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, June 19

 BODY:
In a revolt that could end nearly four decades of one-party rule in Japan, rebel legislators in the party of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa joined forces with the opposition Friday night to pass a vote of no confidence in Mr. Miyazawa's Government. The Prime Minister then dissolved Parliament and called for elections next month.
The organizers of the rebellion, which turned on the question of how to reform Japan's scandal-plagued Government, appeared to be preparing to split off from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Their moves raised the prospect of a fundamental reorganization of the political order that has ruled Japan since the Liberal Democratic Party was founded in 1955. 
 Mr. Miyazawa, who will serve as a caretaker through the elections, seemed almost certain to step down as Prime Minister even if his party wins. His precarious position casts the Government into embarrassing turmoil three weeks before President Clinton and the other leaders of the major industrialized countries arrive here for their annual summit meeting.
 
Meeting Going Forward
 Kyodo news service reported that the Cabinet decided this morning to hold the election on July 18, meaning that the street campaigning will begin on July 4, three days before the summit meeting begins.
Japanese leaders insisted that the Group of Seven summit meeting and the simultaneous visit of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia would go forward without a hitch, even in the midst of what promises to be one of the most critical and hard-fought parliamentary campaigns of postwar Japanese history.
But the battling seems certain to leave the Government virtually paralyzed, dashing any hope that Japan would use its role as chairman of the annual gathering to provide leadership on a host of critical issues, from stimulating the global economy to bringing global trade-liberalization talks to a quick conclusion.
Analysts and officials said the political upheaval in Japan could jeopardize the trade talks with the United States and the meeting in Tokyo. [Page 35.]
 
A Crushing Blow
 Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Yeltsin are also scheduled to meet in their first face-to-face discussion of the territorial dispute that has frozen relations between the two countries and now seems even less likely to be resolved soon.
For the courtly, 73-year-old Mr. Miyazawa -- a man who has been involved in Japanese politics for so long that he attended the signing of the treaty of San Francisco formally ending World War II -- Friday's events were a humiliating and crushing blow.
Though a brilliant analyst of international events, he never mastered the party's vicious factional infighting and never seemed at the center of the money politics that command influence.
In the end, he was outmaneuvered by far craftier forces. As members of Parliament walked up to the podium at 8 Friday evening to turn in their paper ballots, he looked stricken, his eyes downcast.
The vote was, in many ways, the culmination of five years of endless corruption scandals that carried different names -- Recruit, Kyowa, Sagawa Kyubin -- but the same message. They revealed a political system festering with corruption, in which companies regularly paid tens of millions of dollars to assure favorable treatment, win contracts or keep investigations at bay. Those investigations claimed the party's most powerful players, ultimately destroying the huge faction led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita that once ran the country. Its collapse led to a power vacuum.
Despite the turmoil, few in Japan expect major changes in policy. The battling that careened out of control Friday is part of a long-simmering feud among leaders of Japan's conservative establishment, none of whom seek fundamental changes in the policies pursued by Japan for decades.
Nonetheless, American officials said Friday night that they expected negotiations with the United States over the Administration's new framework for closing Japan's ballooning trade surplusses, and other talks requiring major political decisions, to probably grind to a halt for several months.
 
Lament on Trade Talks
 "The President might as well leave his trade files at home," a senior American official lamented, "because it is not even clear who he should be talking to." On television Friday night a leading member of the ruling party's executive council, Rokuro Kato, said that "there is no question this will affect the summit as well as trade talks with the United States."
Indeed, for a generation, Japan's allies and trading partners have geared their strategies to the assumption that the party that has held a grip on power for 38 years would be the only political force that mattered in Japan.
Now that assumption seems shattered, and diplomats scrambled Friday night to cable their capitals with speculation about how the prospect of a coalition government in Japan, even one with many of the same principal characters, could ripple through their own economies.
Opposition politicians celebrated the moment with cheers of "Banzai!" on the floor of the Parliament.
"It's like the Berlin Wall coming down for Japan," said Morihiro Hosokawa, who last year created a reform group called the Japan New Party that is widely expected to seize 30 or more seats in the coming election.
 
A Rare Event
 Before Friday night's vote, no-confidence resolutions had passed only three times since the end of World War II and only once in the 38 years that the Government has been controlled by the Liberal Democratic Party. That was in 1980, when Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira was forced to dissolve Parliament after a bitter dispute with two other former Prime Ministers. But Mr. Ohira died in the midst of the campaign, and a sympathy vote once again swept the party to power.
But sympathy for the Liberal Democrats is in far shorter supply now, and history seems of little use in predicting how the political landscape may be rearranged. The Liberal Democrats hold 274 seats in the lower house, or 53.5 percent of the 512 members. Its chances of retaining that majority seem slim.
The no-confidence vote capped years of perpetual scandals and days of wild maneuverings that ostensibly centered on the question of who would take responsibility for the Parliament's failure to agree on a long-promised package of political reforms. But it quickly became clear that the real battle was over who would control the party, a battle in which Mr. Miyazawa, never known for his skill at intraparty politics, was quickly outflanked.
The stage was set for the confrontation several days ago when Mr. Miyazawa abandoned any hope of getting a reform package through this session of Parliament, effectively reneging on a pledge.
A group of younger Liberal Democrats, seeing their chance and contending that they were tired of the party's image of corruption, insisted that the party strike a compromise with the opposition to get the reform package through, even in imperfect form.
The party's leadership would not budge, though, from its own more-sweeping plan, which argued that the way to reduce the amount of money sloshing through the political system is to change Japan's voting system to a series of single-seat constituencies, rather than constituencies that now contain three to five seats.
But the leadership's proposal also would have had the effect of practically guaranteeing the ruling party's virtual monopoly on power. To many, Mr. Miyazawa and the party leadership seemed to be advocating an extreme form of reform in order to kill it.
By 6:30 Friday evening, when the normally smiling Mr. Miyazawa took his seat in Parliament, a glance at his exhausted, dour face made it clear that hours of desperate negotiations to keep the party together had finally failed.
The end came quickly, with no pretense of Japanese politeness or indirection. Sadao Yamahana, the chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, presented the no-confidence resolution, declaring that "in the world after the cold war, Japan will be trusted and respected only when it has a healthy democracy."
"When we have a Prime Minister who is a liar," he said, "we simply will buy only sneers."
When the ballots were cast, 255 members of the lower house voted in favor of the no-confidence resolution, with 220 against it and 21 absent. A number of seats are vacant.
But most important, those who voted against Mr. Miyazawa included 39 members of his own party, most of them followers of two ambitious power brokers who once seemed in line for taking over the party leadership: Tsutomu Hata, a former Finance Minister, and Ichiro Ozawa, the protege of the man who ran Japanese politics with a cloaked hand for more than a decade, Shin Kanemaru.
Mr. Kanemaru has since been arrested for tax evasion, after investigators found tens of millions of dollars in his office -- a hoard that many speculate was being collected to propel Mr. Ozawa to the Prime Minister's office. But so far, Mr. Ozawa has not been implicated.
Many party elders, including the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, Seiroku Kajiyama, have now vowed to oust Mr. Hata, Mr. Ozawa and their 40 or so followers. That would cut them off from the support and patronage that have made the ruling party one of the world's best-oiled political machines.
 
Talk of Alliances
 The rebels, in turn, seem likely to jump before they are pushed: they have been hinting for months that they might form a new party.
There is considerable speculation that Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa will form an alliance with the Japan New Party and perhaps with the right wing of the Socialist Party and with a number of minor parties.
"What we are seeing is the emerging of two centrist parties, instead of Japan's usual competition between the conservatives and the leftists," said Takashi Inokuchi, a professor at the University of Tokyo. "The kind of vigorous leadership you once saw, when a few faction heads controlled the party, will become much more scarce. And for a long time, the government will seem weak and indecisive."
Eventually, he predicted, "they may all merge once again."
While it has often appeared monolithic from afar, the Liberal Democratic Party always has suffered from factional infighting, making the party seem like a coalition government at times. But in the end, the members have usually followed the command of their leaders. How much that could change if the political structure changes is one of the questions no one in Tokyo seems able to answer yet.
The bolting from the party seemed a particularly heavy blow to Mr. Miyazawa.
His faction is small, and Mr. Miyazawa has a reputation for being driven by events. He is widely described as ineffective, and his popularity rating in one televison poll Thursday night dropped below 10 percent.
In the end, many of his colleagues say, it was his passivity that finished his government. He watched the political reform debates more as a bystander than as a participant. "This matter is very difficult for many to solve because it is related to their own districts," Mr. Miyazwa said Friday night.

Chart: "The Politicians: Who's Who"
 Kiichi Miyazawa -- As Prime Minister since 1991, Mr. Miyazawa, 73, is known as an internationalist. But he is considered a poor intraparty politician, and the no-confidence vote he lost yesterday came after he was unable to fulfill his pledge to pass a political reform package.
 
 Ichiro Ozawa -- Once a lieutenant of two of Japan's disgraced politicians, Mr. Ozawa, 51, is known as a master fixer. Despite his past links, he has cast himself as a reformer and as the moving force behind the renegade politicians from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who brought down Parliament.
 
 Tsutomu Hata -- A former Finance Minister, Mr. Hata is the public face of the renegade faction that Mr. Ozawa largely controls. Mr. Hata, 57, refused in recent days to back down and ultimately led 39 governing party members to vote against their own party leaders.
 
 Seiroku Kajiyama -- The secretary general of the governing party, he has advocated a hard line against Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata, saying they should be expelled from the party. Mr. Kajiyama, 67, seems determined to wage an election campaign to crush the dissidents, and he apparently believes he can retain a party majority.
 
Sadao Yamahana -- Head of the Socialist Party, he has moved it back toward the mainstream of Japanese politics, avoiding the hard-line polemics of his predecessors. Mr. Yamahana, 57, offered the no-confidence motion, saying, "Miyazawa can no longer be trusted to run this country."
 
 Morihiro Hosokawa. Scion of one of Japan's oldest families of feudal lords, Mr. Hosokawa, 55, is the head of the Japan New Party, a reform group that has scored highly in the polls and is expected to win many seats that once seemed safe for the Liberal Democrats. (pg. 5)

HEADLINE: Airlines' Passengers Waging Guerrilla War to Trim Fares

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Call it the do-it-yourself fare war.
Trying to duplicate the low fares that were readily available last summer, growing ranks of passengers are using every means in the air fare book, and a few that are not, to take advantage of the airline industry's complex pricing system and drive down their ticket costs. The methods may not be new, but the consumers' fervor is, airline executives and travel agents say. 
 In response, some airlines are confiscating tickets and using their computer systems to track abuses as well as trying to convince customers that many of their moves are unethical.
Many passengers look for what are known as "hidden city fares." For example, Delta Air Lines, which charges $540 for a direct flight to New York from Dallas, charges $346.50 from Dallas to Montreal with a stop in New York. Thus, a passenger who books to Montreal and checks no baggage, might get off in New York, the hidden city, paying $193.50 less than the person who booked to New York. Such anomalies are created by the industry's hub-and-spoke route system and by the airlines' habit of matching competitors' prices.
Another popular tactic among passengers who fly frequently between two cities is back-to-back ticketing. A passenger, for example, can buy two round-trip tickets between Seattle and Kansas City, Mo., for $200 each, which require a Saturday-night stay. By using alternate halves of each set of tickets, a passenger can avoid a Saturday night layover and still pay less than the fare for a midweek round trip, which costs $1,000 on several airlines.
"It's like income tax," said Tom Parsons of Arlington, Tex., who publishes Best Fares, a monthly compilation of air fare discounts and ticketing tips. "If a loophole is there for the taking, then why not take it?"
His views are shared by frequent travelers like Herb Comrov, president of a Chicago company that makes security tags for retail merchandise. Mr. Comrov said he regularly bought hidden-city and back-to-back tickets. "The business passenger pays through the nose, and we have to do whatever we can to even the score," he said.
In a recent survey of 200 companies, Corporate Travel magazine found that almost 40 percent saw nothing wrong with using discount business fares for conferences for regular travel. And nearly half of those surveyed said they thought travel agents should do "whatever it takes" to get low fares.
Airline executives say that such gamesmanship is difficult to measure, but they contend it has added tens of millions of dollars to their recent annual losses. And travel agents agree that the flying public is hunting for deals with more determination than ever.
"Consumers always wanted to get the lowest possible fare," said Donald J. Carty, American Airlines' executive vice president for finance and planning. "But more and more people are looking for it."
The trend is partly fed by the legions of business travelers who are trying to squeeze more flights from their travel budgets, said Severin Borenstein, a professor of economics at the University of California at Davis who studies the airline industry.
In their search for fare bargains, Mr. Borenstein added, many travelers comb magazines and newsletters that serve frequent travelers and scroll through home-computer networks like Prodigy and Compuserve that allow consumers to check fares.
The big carriers say they are fighting back, trying to tighten up the loopholes in their fare structure. Their sophisticated computer systems enable them to improve their monitoring, they say, and employees at airports are checking tickets more carefully. Some airlines, like USAir, confiscate tickets if they catch a passenger using hidden-city or back-to-back fares. But others, including Delta and Continental Airlines, say they tolerate back-to-back ticketing because the practice technically breaks no rules.
 
Pressure on Travel Agents
 Many airlines exhort travel agents not to write hidden-city or back-to-back tickets. But travel agents say customers will simply take their business elsewhere if their request for such service is rebuffed.
"It puts us in a very difficult position," said Estelle Lessack, president of Travel Trends in Fort Lee, N.J. "The whole structure is ridiculous."
The airlines argue that consumers enter a type of contract with the airlines to be flown to a certain destination, and the fact that their flight stops briefly at a hub city is immaterial to their agreement. By beating the system, they add, passengers hurt those who play and pay by the rules. "It is clear to me that the customers are misrepresenting themselves," said Bill Brunger, vice president of revenue management at Continental Airlines.
But many passengers reject that argument. They see an airline ticket not as a contract but more like a ticket to a baseball game. If ticket holders want to leave the game in the seventh inning, they have every right to do so, and similarly, they say, passengers can leave a flight at an interim stop.
Thomas W. Dunfee, a professor of legal studies at the Wharton School who has researched ethics in the travel agency business, said that if there is a clear misrepresentation by the consumer, as he believes there is with hidden-city ticketing, "that bothers me." And while he believes an airline ticket is a type of contract, the airlines do not always make completely clear, in advance, such practices as overbooking. "It's a truly interesting area for an application of ethics," he said.
Some other methods used to beat the system include reserving a first-class seat with a fictional name, but buying a coach ticket. After the payment deadline, the first-class reservation will not be honored, but the airline may not be able to sell it at the last minute. So the passenger who made the initial reservation simply sits in the first-class seat as the cabin crew closes the door, and says hello when he is addressed by his fictional name. Frequent fliers say that flight crews rarely ask to see tickets, especially in first class.
 
Promotion Opportunities
 Very frequent travelers who hold so-called gold cards offered by many airlines are entitled to free upgrades to first class if there are any such seats available when the plane departs. So some people make several fictitious reservations in first class to better their chances.
Such duplicitous methods, however, represent a small part of a broader, low-profile fare war driven by the proliferation of discount travel coupons offered by the airlines.
Such promotions are seen by the industry as a slightly more effective marketing tool than all-out fare wars, which typically give an airline only a brief competitive advantage before its deal is matched.
Industry experts say the airlines, which have too many seats chasing too few passengers, are likely, if anything, to complicate matters further with more new marketing strategies.
They also point to American Airlines' failed attempt last year to overhaul the fare structure. Its so-called value pricing was intended to eliminate much of the discounting and complexities of the pricing system, but the rest of the industry balked.
Recently, however, USAir has taken a small step by introducing a new fare structure in the Northeast that is intended in part to reduce the need for manipulating fares.
For example, it created a tier of fares that require seven-day advance purchase but no Saturday night stay and are $50 lower than the highest last-minute coach fare.

HEADLINE: In Peace Plan for Northwest Timber Dispute, Options May Anger Both Sides

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
In a crucial test of a promise to square environmental goals with economic ones, the Clinton Administration has prepared an array of suggested solutions to end a fractious battle over timber and endangered species in the Pacific Northwest, including one that would slash the amount of cutting on Federal lands in the region by half or more, an Administration official said yesterday.
According to officials in the Administration and staff members in Congress, the options also include a proposal for legislation to bypass or waive some provisions of three important environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, to hasten the pace for putting the President's timber plan into effect. 
 These options are part of a package of proposals that officials in five Federal agencies and the White House are close to finishing and that may be sent to President Clinton early next week, according to Administration officials.
Marla Romash, the spokeswoman for Vice President Al Gore, said that no final decisions had been made and that the President would not make any for at least another week and perhaps longer.
"The President made clear at the forest conference, and believes strongly today, that the long-term economic and environmental health of the region must be what drives the Administration's policy," Ms. Romash said. "We are facing a difficult decision that has been created by years of bad management and policy making."
 
Longstanding Problem
 The package of proposals was ordered by Mr. Clinton in early April, when he, Mr. Gore, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and several other Cabinet officers traveled to Portland, Ore., to hold a public hearing on ways to resolve the conflict between logging interests, who are concerned about jobs, and environmentalists, who want to preserve the old-growth forests, the home of the northern spotted owl.
Mr. Clinton said during the campaign last year that he would study the issue and propose solutions. But almost anything Mr. Clinton calls for is bound to anger important political constituencies in the region, say leaders of the environmental movement and the timber industry.
In addition, some influential Democrats on Capitol Hill hail from the region, among them House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon. Both lawmakers represent timber districts and have made it known to the White House that they would like to see logging on public lands in the two states kept at levels sufficient to sustain logging jobs and mills. Congressional staff members say Mr. Clinton needsthe support of the Speaker and Mr. DeFazio if he hopes to enact his budget, a new health-care plan or any other important legislation.
In an interview, Mr. DeFazio said he wanted environmentalists and other critics to hold their fire until the President concludes his review and makes a decision. "It's a bit premature to be jumping all over the President when they really don't know what the President will do," Mr. DeFazio said. "This is not Ronald Reagan. This is not George Bush. This is not James Watt. This is a plan produced by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Bruce Babbitt."
 
Limit on Logging
 Aspects of the Administration's plan were reported yesterday in The Washington Post, including one option that would limit logging on public lands in the Pacific Northwest to an average of 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion board feet annually over the next decade. In the late 1980's, at the peak of production, loggers produced more than 5 billion board feet annually in the region, according to Federal figures.
That level of production has fallen to roughly 3 billion board feet annually, largely because of Federal court action in the early 1990's that has severely limited the amount of Federal timber that the Government can sell to logging companies. Unless the President acts, timber cutting on Federal lands in the Pacific Northwest would come almost to a halt by 1995 because all of the timber under contract would have been cut and no new sales have been conducted for several years.
Environmental groups attacked the proposal yesterday, not only because it would open forests now off-limits to logging because of court orders and other legal action but also because the plan under consideration would not establish forest reserves where no logging could occur.
The environmentalists, who were among the strongest supporters of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore during the campaign, also criticized the proposal as an effort to waive environmental law and perhaps limit public involvement in some aspects of the plan.
"After decades of illegal abuse and logging of nearly 50 million acres of public forest, this Administration endorses politics as usual," said Timothy Hermach, executive director of the Native Forest Council, an environmental group in Eugene, Ore. "Most Americans would demand an immediate halt to further sales."
Timber-industry employees and executives also attacked the recently disclosed option to limit logging to 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion board feet. They said such a low level of cutting would close more mills and put thousands more people out of work. "At that level, it's unacceptable -- it means a 75 percent or 80 percent loss for our industry," said Cary Jones, the executive director of Douglas Timber Operators, a group in Roseburg, Ore., that represents the timber industry.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Currencies and Diplomacy Get Jolt From Tokyo

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In a move that could not be better timed for American tourists, the dollar rallied sharply yesterday against the German mark and other European currencies and, suddenly, against the Japanese yen.
In a hectic day of global trading, the dollar ended 2.3 percent higher against the yen after a political revolt in Japan apparently doomed the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and threatened to end four decades of rule by his Liberal Democratic Party. 
 In New York, the dollar reversed its five-month plunge and surged to 109.75 yen, from 107.30 the day before.This was the dollar's highest close in a month and came just days after the dollar touched a record low close in New York of 105.08 yen.
 
Impact on Bonds
 The dollar also soared to its highest close against the mark since October 1991. It finished in New York at 1.6805 marks, up from 1.6598 marks and 3.2 percent higher for the week.
The dollar's rally could be felt immediately in the American bond market. Given low inflation and continued progress on deficit reduction in Washington, a currency rally may be the extra spark to push Treasury yields lower soon.
Several traders and economists said that they expected the rally against the mark and other European currencies to continue because the underlying economic fundamentals, including a continuing decline in interest rates in Europe, favor the dollar. This means the dollar could move toward 1.80 marks or higher.
But they were less certain about the dollar versus the yen, because the economic fundamentals, like the huge Japanese trade surplus, still favor the Japanese currency.
Given the new political uncertainity, it appears that the dollar may not fall now to new record lows against the yen. But it will not rally all that much either, especially if the Japanese leadership crisis is resolved faster than expected. This means that the dollar, which had fallen 16 percent against the yen since the end of last year, is likely to remain about 110 to 115 yen, which is still a hefty slump of 10 percent for the year.
"The dollar will hold better against the mark than the yen," said Robert A. White, a senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles. But, he said, if the Clinton Administration has stopped talking the dollar down against the yen, then the dollar has probably reached bottom.
It was such jawboning in February that began the dollar's precipitous slide against the yen. The Administration's apparent hope was that a weaker dollar would help shrink Japan's trade surplus by making Japanese goods sold here much more expensive. Intervention in the currency markets by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had not been able to stem the slide.
 
Forces Favoring Yen
 John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said the positive economic forces still favoring the yen were the trade surplus, the lack of a Japanese appetite now for foreign assets, the decline in oil and other commodity prices, which helps the Japanese economy, and the fact that the overall prospects for the Japanese economy are improving.
But he argued that even if the political uncertainty was cleared up quickly, the dollar would not fall to new lows. He expects the Bank of Japan to cut Japanese interest rates to prevent the American currency from falling to near 100 yen to the dollar. He also said there might be some signs that Japan's trade surplus was beginning to shrink.
The rise of the dollar against the German mark, in comparison, is not much of a surprise, except that the rally to this level has taken longer than many forecasters expected. That is because the American economy in the first quarter was much weaker than expected, meaning the flow of foreign money to invest here was lighter than expected.
In addition, the German central bank has moved more stubbornly than expected in cutting interest rates.
The dollar has been forecast to rise against the mark because the German economy is in a recession that many analysts argue is more severe than German officials are saying.
If this is the case, the Bundesbank will have to cut interest rates much further. In addition, the European slowdown will make the Continent a less attractive place for investors while the American economy appears, finally, to be on a steady, if moderate, path of growth.
And because currency traders and speculators like to be as far ahead of the next dollar move as possible, these expectations could push the rally forward quickly.

Gold in Slight Rise
 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- A stronger dollar helped limit a rise in gold yesterday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery climbed for the third consecutive session, gaining 30 cents to $372.50 an ounce. The August contract gained $5 this week amid perceptions that strong demand is overcoming signs of dormant inflation.

HEADLINE: President Chooses an Expert To Halt Smuggling of Aliens

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
President Clinton moved today to put his stamp on immigration policy, appointing an expert to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service and announcing new initiatives intended to end the smuggling of illegal aliens.
Mr. Clinton nominated Doris M. Meissner, who was a Deputy Associate Attorney General under President Jimmy Carter and an Acting Commissioner of Immigration under President Ronald Reagan, to head the agency. The 51-year-old Ms. Meissner has most recently been director of immigration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
 In announcing her selection, Mr. Clinton said a chief goal for Ms. Meissner would be to insure that the United States does not "lose control of our borders."
The Administration also announced a streamlined policy aimed at reducing the number of illegal aliens who are smuggled into the United States. The practice drew international attention last week when a tramp steamer carrying about 300 illegal Chinese immigrants ran aground off the coast of Queens, stranding many and resulting in the drowning death of six passengers who had attempted to swim to shore.
Such schemes are "a shameful practice of unspeakable degradation and unspeakable exploitation," Mr. Clinton said. He pledged to speed up the processing of illegal aliens who are caught while being smuggled into the country and to strengthen efforts to catch the organizers of smuggling rings.
Administration officials said legislation to meet these goals was expected to be introduced in two weeks, after Ms. Meissner has had an opportunity to review the recommendations, made by the White House, the I.N.S., the National Security Council and other agencies.
Immigration policy experts praised Ms. Meissner's knowledge of the subject and said her appointment represented a departure from the previous practice of treating the commissioner's job as a political appointment.
"She's solid," said Rick Swartz, an immigration-policy expert in Washington. "Doris is probably the most experienced choice that Clinton could have made."
Arthur Helton, an immigration expert for the Lawyers International Committee for Human Rights, said: "There were many inside the agency who were worried that a strong antagonist to their interests would be appointed. There were others outside who were concerned that it would be someone whose principal qualification was as a good fund-raiser in the course of an election. None of these worries panned out with the choice of Doris Meissner."
The Administration has only recently begun to integrate its foreign policy operation with immigration issues. Tim Wirth, the former Colorado Senator, was recently appointed to a new position as an undersecretary of state in charge of a grab bag of global issues, including drugs and immigration.
The Clinton Administration's new immigration policy, officials said, is expected to include proposals to toughen penalties for smuggling to as much as 20 years in prison, to allow racketeering laws to be applied to smuggling syndicates, to expand the ability of the Government to seize the assets of immigration smugglers and to expedite the admission or deportation of aliens seeking entry into the United States.
 
Streamlining the Process
 If such legislation is passed, officials said, the amount of time it takes for aliens to have their cases considered will shrink from as long as 18 months to as little as 30 days.
"With this plan, the United States signals its abhorrence of the trafficking in human beings for profit and its determination to combat this illegal activity," Mr. Clinton said. "At the same time, we reaffirm our commitment to protect bona fide refugees."
But Mr. Clinton would not specify the price tag for such a strategy, which would require, at a minimum, a significant increase in immigration workers.
Mr. Clinton stressed today that the Administration review had begun some time ago, when Government agencies had first become aware of a pattern of organized smuggling that brought illegal aliens from China, El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti.
But it was clearly the most recent episodes of alien smuggling -- especially the grounding of the Golden Venture steamer off Queens -- that prompted today's announcement.
"Events in recent weeks have brought into focus the tremendous economic, human and social impact immigration has on our country," said Attorney General Janet Reno, who oversees the immigration agency. "We have much work to do in this area to insure that those who truly deserve political asylum are granted it, but those who break the laws of this country are given the strictest possible penalties."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
House in Queens Is Raided
 Immigration agents found 22 illegal Chinese aliens being held in Bayside, Queens, in an early morning raid yesterday, and eight members of an Asian gang were charged with smuggling them into the United States, law-enforcement officials said.
The illegal aliens were part of a larger group that had traveled by ship from Asia and landed near San Francisco on June 2. They had flown to Kennedy International Airport from Los Angeles and were being held at 230-36 57th Road in Bayside when they were apprehended, the officials said.
William S. Slattery, the district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York, said the timing of the raid, on the same day as President Clinton's announcement of a crackdown on the smuggling of illegal aliens, was a coincidence.
The 22 illegal immigrants, 14 men and 8 women, were apparently being held by gang members until they could pay the $30,000 each had agreed to pay for passage. They will be held by the I.N.S. or released to family members until deportation proceedings begin.
The illegal aliens make up the third such group to be found in the New York area in a month. On May 24, 57 undocumented immigrants were found in a Jersey City warehouse; on June 8, 13 more were found in the basement of a house in Sunset Park in Brooklyn.
The eight people arrrested yesterday were charged with smuggling illegal aliens.

HEADLINE: Currencies and Diplomacy Get Jolt From Tokyo;
Turmoil Amid Crucial Economic Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 18

 BODY:
The stunning political upheaval in Japan could jeopardize important trade talks with the United States as well as next month's Group of Seven summit meeting in Tokyo, analysts and officials said today.
Political paralysis resulting from the turmoil could also delay additional measures to stimulate Japan's limp economy. According to new figures released today, the Japanese economy is showing the first signs, albeit feeble ones, of recovering from its worst slump in two decades. 
 Indeed, from an economic point of view, the no-confidence vote tonight against Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, which is likely to topple his Government, could not have come at a more delicate time.
 
 
Fear of Paralysis
 Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist for Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, said, "Political paralysis is the big risk we run at this critical juncture, where we need political leadership from Japan."
The political uncertainty seems to have halted, at least temporarily, the relentless rise of the Japanese yen, which has been occurring since February. The yen weakened sharply against the dollar today in New York trading, which took place after the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. After losing the vote, Mr. Miyazawa dissolved the lower chamber and set the stage for elections.
 The Tokyo stock market has also been jittery this week as the political crisis mounted, with the Nikkei average closing today at 19,804.54, down 120.97 for the day and off about 700 points for the week.
Analysts expect the yen and Japanese stocks to continue to fall next week, but perhaps not for long. "In the past, political uncertainty has had only a temporary effect" on the markets, said Tomoko Fujii, an economist with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
One longer-term economic question is what will happen if the current turmoil finally leads to a loss of power by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has controlled the Government continuously for four decades. There is a widespread feeling here that one-party rule has provided political stability and allowed the nation to concentrate on its rapid industrial development.
 
Much Is on the Plate
 But a more immediate concern is that with Mr. Miyazawa effectively a lame duck, it will be difficult for Japan to make decisions on crucial economic matters. And there is no shortage of important matters that will need attention in coming weeks.
Chief among them is the meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations, which will start on July 7 in Tokyo. The agenda will include issues like aid to Russia, revival of the world economy and liberalization of world trade.
A pre-summit meeting aimed at forging an agreement on market-opening measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will take place in Tokyo next week.
A political vacuum may also make it more difficult for Japan to make the hard decisions that may be needed to forge a new trade framework with the United States, which is also expected in time for the summit meeting. "No one's in a position to produce a deal," said Dr. Courtis of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bureaucrats Keep Humming
 Some Japanese officials played down talk that the summit meeting or the trade negotiations would be affected. They say the groundwork for both matters is being handled by Japan's powerful bureaucracies, which tend to go on running the country despite changes in administrations.
"We have spent a lot of time making preparations for the series of international meetings," Mamoru Ozaki, the Vice Minister of Finance, was quoted by the Kyodo News Service as saying today. He said the meetings would go on "without a hitch."
After losing the no-confidence vote, Mr. Miyazawa chose to dissolve the lower house of Parliament and hold new elections in late July. The other option would have been for him and his Cabinet to resign. That, officials said, would have truly disrupted the Group of Seven conference.
Still, having election campaigns begin in early July could divert attention from the summit meeting. "There is no doubt that this will affect the summit as well as trade talks with the United States," Rokuro Kato, a member of the ruling party's executive council, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
The political paralysis also makes it unlikely that there will be new efforts to stimulate the economy anytime soon. "The political development will mean no additional policy in the next two to three months," said Noboru Kawai, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo.
 Some business and political leaders have been pushing for an income tax cut to spur consumer spending. But the powerful Ministry of Finance has been opposed to this, because it does not want a national budget deficit.
The Liberal Democratic Party has been instrumental in overcoming Finance Ministry resistance to two other economic stimulus packages that were enacted in the last year. But now the party is in disarray, leaving the Finance Ministry with a freer hand to determine economic policy.
Still, Japan is not expected to consider new stimulus measures until fall, and by then the turmoil may be over.
There is still pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, but at 2.5 percent, the discount rate is already so low that little stimulus could be obtained by further reductions, some economists say.
Although the economy is still weak, some experts say it has hit the bottom. The Government reported today that in the first three months of 1993 the gross national product grew six-tenths of a percent over the previous quarter, or at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent. That followed three quarters in which economic output had either shrunk or remained flat.
 
A Disappointing Year
 But that slightly positive showing could not erase a bad year. For all of the 1992 fiscal year, which also ended on March 31, Japan's economy grew only eight-tenths of a percent, the worst showing since a decline of two-tenths of a percent in the 1974 fiscal year, after the first oil crisis.
The eight-tenths of a percent growth for the year was a fraction of the Government's initial target for the year of 3.5 percent growth. It was even well below the revised target of 1.6 percent, an indication of how badly the Government misread economic signals as the slump deepened.
Much of the growth in the March quarter came from Government spending as a stimulus package announced in August finally began to take effect.
There were some other positive signs in the data. Personal spending rose 1.2 percent in the quarter after declining six-tenths of a percent in the previous quarter. Even corporate investment, which has declined for six consecutive quarters, fell only two-tenths of a percent in the most recent period, compared with 3.6 percent in the December quarter.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Kantor Is Hopeful
 WASHINGTON, June 18 (Special to The New York Times) -- Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said today that he saw no indication that the political crisis in Tokyo was causing Japan to reduce its efforts on trade issues.
Mr. Kantor said he hoped that the momentum of negotiations "is not hampered in any way" by Mr. Miyazawa's action to dissolve Parliament after losing a no-confidence motion.
Japan is involved in talks to remove trade barriers under the Uruguay Round of GATT talks and is also engaged in separate talks between Tokyo and Washington in which the United States is pressing for greater access to the Japanese market.
"We have no indication at this point that the Japanese Government is backing away" from its effort to move forward, Mr. Kantor said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Kantor said he was scheduled to hold talks in Tokyo on Tuesday and Wednesday that aim to reduce Japan's trade surplus and increase American companies' sales to Japan.
 Trade experts said they saw several ways the changes could affect trade negotiations. Japanese bureaucrats already dominate the talks, the experts noted, and the weakening of the politicians in power could strengthen the bureaucrats' hands, allowing the talks to continue as before, or perhaps even more smoothly.

HEADLINE: Theme Schools Face Hurdles In Opening

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
As they race to open more than 30 small experimental public schools in the fall, New York City educators say they are grappling with an array of difficulties -- from hiring directors to finding buildings to signing up students.
Four of the 37 small new schools will not open in September as originally planned, school officials said yesterday. All four will instead open in the fall of 1994. 
 Despite the setbacks, however, several senior education officials, including the state Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, and the president of the New York City Board of Education, Carol A. Gresser, said yesterday that they believed the movement to create smaller, theme-based schools was still gaining momentum.
 
Smaller High Schools
 The comments were made at a news conference held at Central Park East Secondary School at Madison Avenue and 106th Street. The news conference was held to draw attention to efforts to open six small high schools at various locations in Manhattan this fall as part of a plan to phase out Julia Richman High School, where only about one student in three now graduates.
"These schools are part of a broader initiative by the New York City public schools to create smaller and personalized new high schools," Mrs. Gresser said. "They will provide safe and caring environments in which all students can be known well. They set a direction for effective school reform in New York City for years to come."
Ms. Gresser and another school board member, Ninfa Segarra, also announced their support for plans to replicate the Julia Richman experiment, by creating six small high schools in the Bronx in the fall of 1994 as part of an effort to replace one of the borough's failing high schools. The high school has not yet been designated.
For more than two decades, isolated pioneers have been experimenting with small schools as alternatives to the hundreds of colossal, factory-like elementary and high schools operated by New York City. Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez gave crucial support to their efforts, and earlier this year the Board of Education approved plans to open 37 of the new schools this fall.
 
Resembling a Corporate Office
 The 37 schools, like the High School for Economics and Finance with its site planned to resemble a corporate office, were all designed with curriculums centered on separate themes. Most were developed in partnerships between the board and unions, colleges, neighborhood groups and even some churches.
As a group, the new schools represent one of the largest expansions of the city's public school system in decades. Not surprisingly, some of them have run into problems.
"There's a lot that goes into starting a new school, from finding people and space and equipment to developing a curriculum, and it all has to be done in a relatively short period," said Beth Lief, executive director of the Fund for New York City Public Education, an education organization that is raising money and working to get 14 of the new schools started.
"This is the most exciting project I've ever been involved in, but it takes a tremendous amount of hard work." Organizers of the Health Opportunities Collaborative High School, which was to immerse students in a health-related curriculum with projects in hospitals and clinics, were forced to postpone the school's opening for a year because the proposed site, a converted gymnasium at Lehman College, was unavailable, and the director hired to run the school backed out.
The director originally picked to run the Museum School in Manhattan also backed out, forcing postponement of the opening of that school, which was to make use of the resources of the Museum of Natural History and several other museums.
Organizers of the Brooklyn School for Global Citizenship, who planned to turn Brooklyn into an urban laboratory this fall with a curriculum centered on the borough's immigrant communities, postponed their plans after protests from parents at a junior high school whose vacant classrooms they had hoped to use.
 
School Within a School
 The inauguration of the Andrew Jackson High School Magnet School, which was to open this fall as a new high school within a high school in Queens, has also been postponed a year. "That one never really got off the ground," said James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for the Board of Education.
Because the board only approved plans for the new schools in March, a catalog explaining to parents and students how to sign up was issued late, complicating enrollment, Mr. Vlasto said. But more than 4,400 students have now applied for the 3,300 seats that will be available in the new schools this fall, he said.
Though organizers of all the new schools have been racing against a tight schedule, most have hired project directors and teachers, found classroom space, and are well along in the development of their curriculums, Stanley S. Litow, the deputy chancellor for operations, said at the news conference.
Deborah Meier, a prize-winning principal who pioneered several of the city's first small alternative public schools in the 1970's, is a coordinator of the effort to phase out Julia Richman High School. She said it has not been easy to find buildings, hire teachers and make all the other arrangements for the six new schools. But she said she was sure all the toil would pay off this fall.
"I'm confident that these schools will provide a superb educational environment," Ms. Meier said.

HEADLINE: Planned Parenthood of New York Begins Abortion Training

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
Planned Parenthood of New York began training doctors yesterday to perform abortions, a role that teaching hospitals have abandoned in recent years in response to social, legal and economic pressures.
Over the last decade the number of medical residency programs that require abortion training in the United States has dropped by half, and that drop is one reason most of the nation's counties do not have a single doctor who will perform the procedure. 
 "Most teaching hospitals find it easier to leave abortion training to someone else," Alexander C. Sanger, president and chief executive of New York's Planned Parenthood chapter, said in announcing the program. "We have decided to become that someone else."
While some individual abortion clinics have occasionally trained doctors to work for them, the Planned Parenthood program is the first large-scale effort to increase the availability of doctors nationwide.
The graduates of the Planned Parenthood classes will not gain any additional legal standing: under current licensing rules, gynecologists and several other specialists are already certified to perform abortions even if they have never done one. But they will gain increased knowledge about the technicalities of the medical procedure as well as the counseling that usually accompanies it.
One doctor who signed up for the Planned Parenthood course said he did so because he felt his lack of training in abortions left him unprepared to be a good obstetrician. Dr. Jeffrey Meneges is a third-year resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, which he said does not perform abortions.
"I was surprised when I started my residency program to realize that abortion was something I would have to learn on my own," Dr. Meneges said. "It is an important part of an OB/GYN practice. It's something I should know how to do."
The program drew criticism from opponents of abortion, who have long seen the decline in the number of abortion practitioners as a sign that their message was gaining favor.
Jeanne Head, president of the Right to Life Committee of Manhattan, predicted that the Planned Parenthood program would fail. "I don't think that any amount of training can encourage doctors to destroy babies," she said.
Mr. Sanger, whose grandmother, Margaret Sanger, founded the American birth control movement, said the training program was a response to the growing nationwide shortage of doctors willing and able to perform abortions. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an independent, nonprofit research and policy institute on the subject of reproductive health, 83 percent of counties in the United States had no abortion providers in 1988, the last year for which it had statistics.
The shortage is worst in rural areas, but even in New York, Planned Parenthood is having a difficult time finding doctors, said Dr. E. Hakim Elahi, medical director of Planned Parenthood here. A catalyst for the program, in fact, was when a doctor in the group's Brooklyn office took an emergency three-week leave in 1992 and no replacement could be found.
Behind the shortage, experts say, is a confluence of trends and events. First, a generation of doctors who trained during the late 1960's and were struck by the often tragic complications of illegal abortions are retiring. Younger doctors were shaped by a different world, in which those who perform abortions are often harassed by protesters and threatened with violence, as evidenced by the murder of Dr. David Gunn earlier this year outside the Florida abortion clinic where he worked.
 
Fewer Training Programs
 While young doctors are having their doubts, the hospitals that train them are, too. Across the country, the number of hospital training programs that routinely include abortion training fell by 50 percent since 1985. Currently, 38 percent of all obstetrics/gynecology residencies do not offer any abortion training, according to a study by the National Abortion Federation. Only 12 percent of residencies require such training, and the other 50 percent make it optional.
Even at hospitals that teach the procedure, Dr. Elahi said, residents are limited by the number of abortions performed there. Because most abortions are done in clinics, he said, hospital residents receive insufficient exposure for proper training.
And when abortion training is optional, he said, young doctors often focus their energies elsewhere. Obstetrics and gynecology is increasingly subspecialized, he said, with doctors choosing to train in fields like infertility. "They put family planning at the bottom of the list," he said.
To counteract these trends, clinics have been recruiting their own doctors and offering to train them -- with varying degrees of success.
 
3,000 Letters, No Reply
 In Atlanta, the Feminist Women's Health Center sent 3,000 letters to imminent graduates of the nation's obstetrics/gynecology residencies without finding one person willing to train to work at that abortion clinic.
In Ohio one family planning clinic almost closed for lack of a doctor, and was saved only when an out-of-state physician offered to fly in periodically to train two recent graduates.
At the Vermont Women's Health Center in Burlington, physician's assistants train interested residents, who then work at the clinic.
The New York plan, however, is the most ambitious in scope. Mr. Sanger said his organization hoped to train 35 doctors a year over each of the next three years. He said $1.5 million had already been raised for that purpose.
 
'Regional Training Center'
 Eventually, he said, he expects New York to become a "regional training center," attracting doctors from along the East Coast.
The group that began classes yesterday consists of eight residents, three women and five men; three more women were trained during a test late last year. They are training to be specialists in the fields of obstetrics/gynecology, family practice and adolescent medicine.
Over the next three months they will spend 40 hours learning abortion procedures -- added to their hospital schedules of 80 hours a week. Some of that will be classroom time, covering subjects like the history of abortion, pregnancy diagnosis, preoperative preparations, surgical procedure, follow-up care and patient counseling.
Much of the time will be spent in hands-on surgical training in first-trimester abortions. Those procedures will be done in Planned Parenthood clinics under the supervision of a staff doctor. Doctors who complete the program will receive a certificate to that effect but will have no obligation to work at Planned Parenthood clinics.

HEADLINE: Inflation Warnings Weigh on Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Warnings by two Federal Reserve governors about inflationary trends weighed on what was otherwise a dull session in the bond market yesterday. Still, Treasury issues ended the day mixed.
The Fed governors, Lawrence B. Lindsey and Wayne D. Angell, issued separate warnings about inflation, several days after the Government issued reports showing consumer and producer prices remained in check in May. 
 The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond initially fell on the reports, but it later rebounded in technical trading. In the end, the 30-year bond gained 2/32 point, while its yield dipped to 6.80 percent, from 6.81 percent on Thursday.
Mr. Lindsey, in a television interview, said he planned to increase his inflation estimate to an annualized rate of 4 percent, from 2.7 percent. Mr. Angell, speaking at a luncheon in Switzerland, also said inflation was still too high for his tastes and added that he did not believe the Fed's inflation projection of 2.75 percent for 1993 would be met.
 
Hawks on Inflation
 Analysts said both men were considered inflation hawks, meaning their overriding goal in monetary policy was to achieve price stability. Inflation erodes the value of bonds and other fixed-income investments.
"These guys are the biggest hawks," said Susan Hering, an economist with Salomon Brothers. "They don't want people to give up on the issue."
Kevin Flanagan, a money-market economist at Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said the Fed governors' comments "put some pressure on the fixed-income arena."
The effect of their comments and a preliminary University of Michigan survey that showed rising consumer confidence in June were exaggerated in a lightly traded market, Mr. Flanagan said.
The two-year Treasury note fell 3/32 point, with its yield rising to 4.12 percent from 4.07 percent. And the five-year Treasury note fell 5/32 point, while the yield rose to 5.20 percent from 5.17 percent.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.86, to 1,296.73.
 
Three-Month Bills
 The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.04 percent from 3.02 percent, while the discount rate on six-month bills rose to 3.16 percent from 3.14 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 2 7/8 percent, down from 3 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10122/32, up 1/32 point. The average yield to maturity was 5.82 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
In a Glut of Information, Some Items to Ignore

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
THE United States Supreme Court has issued credentials for this session to 34 reporters, virtually all who asked. The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group, issued credentials for its convention this year to exactly 100 reporters, plus cameramen.
Let nobody complain that they lack information about investing. Newspapers, radio, television and magazines are all expanding their coverage. Readers and viewers might say they want even more, but some indigestion is evident. 
 "Ten years ago the question was 'How do you get reliable information?' " said Don Phillips, publisher of the Morningstar Mutual Funds newsletter. "Today the question is 'How do you avoid overload?' "
The overload is especially severe because the job of most networks and publications is to cover what's new and different, much more than repeating some standard, unvarying advice. Market coverage concentrates on the big winners or losers of the day or week, and a staple of mutual fund coverage is the quarterly performance ranking.
This info glut can reinforce investors' worst habits. . Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist who joined the Clinton Treasury Department, has written about "the tendency for people to do today what they wish they had done yesterday."
Each quarter, the best-performing mutual funds attract huge amounts of money. No matter that these funds tend to be narrow and risky, like the gold funds that did so well in this year's first quarter. Some coverage emphasized that the long-term returns from gold and gold funds remained dismal, but the mere reporting of gold's gains inflamed investor passion.
One quarter's express trains can become the next quarter's derailments. Say, as an experiment, you had taken the five best-performing stock funds at the end of each quarter and held them through the next quarter. Asked to calculate the results, apart from any sales charges, Morningstar found that in only 9 of 25 quarters would you have beaten the average stock fund.
Following the hottest stocks and sectors can be even more dizzying. Consider the market's course since last October. First stocks of small technology companies soared on hopes that Bill Clinton would subsidize their research and development. Meanwhile, drug stocks collapsed under his pledge to control medical costs. By year-end, early cyclical stocks, like machinery makers, which do well in the beginning of a recovery, ran up on signs of economic strength.
This year, consumer growth stocks staggered as consumers and investors became less willing to pay up for brand names. Now, just six months after recommending those early cyclicals, many analysts are fast-forwarding to late cyclical stocks, like auto makers. And drug stocks have started to recover on hopes that Mr. Clinton will have trouble getting much of his health plan through.
Even if a small investor caught all these waves, the transaction costs could still practically wipe out his gains. As for getting in early when sentiment about a stock shifts, the little guy hasn't a chance. The first to learn of a stock analyst's change of mind are usually his firm's clients. Often, by the time news hits the press, investors have factored it into the stock price. When news reports do trigger a market response, the professional traders and big institutions are invariably the first to fire.
Many investors, including the professionals, respond by playing momentum, making the stock market one of the few where customers buy more when prices are raised, less when cut. Few researchers have found significant correlation between a stock's past and future performance, however.
In some respects, small investors are becoming more temperate in responding to the news. Instead of panicking and dumping stocks after market routs, they have often bought, damping the market's volatility.
The challenge is learning how to use the news and advice to your best advantage, making decisions that stand up over the longer term. For individual securities, distinguishing between the ephemeral and the lasting can stump the best professionals. As much as earnings surprises send stocks spinning, some research suggests that analysts under-respond, failing to adjust their earnings estimates sufficiently.
As for mutual funds, the publicity given to short-term performance can drown out other news that investors should know. Changes in management, which the Securities and Exchange Commission now requires mutual funds to disclose, should cause investors to ask whether they will continue to receive the same investment performance and style.
A manager's efforts to reverse a slump by shifting styles likewise can raise questions. After years of riding small technology stocks to attractive gains, the Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth Fund is now trying to overcome recent declines by looking at gold and energy stocks. "That is always kind of a red flag," said Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer & Janachowski investment advisers in San Francisco.
Some of the best picks among mutual funds, he said, come not among hot funds cheered by the news media but those whose sound, consistent investment practices are temporarily going unrewarded. He mentions the widely reported reversals at John Neff's Windsor Fund and Michael Price's Mutual Shares Fund, and their more recent turnarounds. "If you're looking at someone with a very strong record who is out of favor," he said, "you're probably going to buy in at a good time."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Pacific Rim Investments for the Long Haul

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The Van Eck Asia Dynasty fund is part of a flurry of new funds that are investing in the Pacific Rim countries to benefit from economic growth rates greater than those of the United States and other developed nations. The fund invests mainly in Hong Kong, with smaller investments in Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. While investments in emerging markets can be profitable, they are also risky.
Mutual fund investors can bet on the natural gas industry with Fidelity's Select Natural Gas Portfolio, which invests in companies that produce and distribute natural gas or that provide services or equipment to the industry. The fund's narrower focus may make it more volatile than Fidelity's Select Energy Portfolio. A 0.75 percent redemption fee applies to shares sold before 30 days; after that, the fee is 0.75 percent or $7.50, whichever is less. 
 The Janus Mercury Fund is an aggressive growth fund run by Warren Lammert, a protege of James Craig and Tom Marsico, who run Janus's successful Venture and Twenty Funds, among others. Like them, Mr. Lammert uses a bottom-up, fundamental approach to stock picking instead of betting on sectors that look promising. The fund is nondiversified, meaning it can own a big chunk of one issue. That means potentially bigger returns, but more risk.

HEADLINE: Consumer Index Is Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for June rose to 82.8, from 80.3 in May, suggesting more moderate economic growth in the months ahead, analysts said yesterday.
Even with the increase, the index remains below the post-election high of 91 set in December. 
 "We're not seeing any major improvement" in consumer confidence, said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "We're still below the first-quarter" average of 87.3 for the Michigan index. That reading suggests economic growth of 2 to 3 percent pace in the months ahead.
The record high for the index, which the university releases to clients, is 97.9, set in January 1989. The record low is 63.9, in October 1990.

HEADLINE: Campaign Finance Reform: Alive

 BODY:
The Senate's campaign finance reform bill isn't nearly as strong as the package recommended by President Clinton and Senate Democratic leaders. It leaves big holes that will need filling when the measure gets to conference with the House. That it passed at all, however, is a victory worth savoring. There was ferocious Republican opposition and stratospheric nervousness about campaign reform on both sides of the aisle.
Ignoring scandals and public disgust at corrupt and distracting campaign fund raising, Republicans have blocked meaningful change since 1974. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, deserves credit for breaking this gridlock with a difficult victory that keeps reform alive. Seven Republicans -- James Jeffords of Vermont, William Cohen of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona -- provided the crucial votes needed to break the Republican filibuster. 
 But to win this support, Mr. Mitchell and the bill's chief Senate sponsor, David Boren of Oklahoma, had to agree to a devilish bargain, striking the bill's publicly financed communication vouchers. Vouchers to pay for media and mail will now be made available only as a "backup" when an opponent exceeds the spending limit. The seven swing Republicans thereby hurt underfunded challengers of both parties and preserved the power of fat-cat donors. They were also hypocritical; all but Senator Kassebaum had supported similar public-financing legislation in the past.
There's still much in the bill to like. Its spending limits and curbs on political action committees would greatly reduce the financial advantage that incumbents now enjoy over challengers, and eliminate millions in favor-seeking dollars from the system. Reduced-rate television time and mailings can only enhance campaign debate by making it easier for challengers to get their messages across. The bill also preserves the integrity of contribution limits, prohibits incumbents' free mass mailings in an election year and shuts down the soft-money loophole that left both parties' Presidential candidates beholden to a long list of $100,000 donors.
The fight now moves to the House, where there's a danger the Senate's retreat on public financing will give House members the excuse they crave to do the same. The House bill, with its lenient approach to PAC's and generous spending limits, is already too protective of incumbents and the corruptive status quo.
House Speaker Thomas Foley says he remains an "enthusiastic" supporter of public financing and even calls it "the royal road to fairness." He can show real leadership and do a real service by challenging the Senate and waging the same aggressive fight for public financing that he waged for the President's economic plan.

HEADLINE: Family Preservation and Its Victims

BYLINE: By Patrick Murphy; Patrick Murphy is the Cook County Public Guardian. His office represents abused children and the disabled elderly.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Take any floor of a typical low-income housing project. In one apartment, there might be a single woman in her mid-20's with two kids, struggling on a meager welfare check to keep the kids dressed, clean and in school. Down the hall is a family of six. Despite months of looking, Mom works as a maid and Dad, unemployed, does a few odd jobs. At the end of the hall, there is a woman with three kids. She is a heavy crack cocaine user. Her present boyfriend is also her drug supplier, and when he gets angry he hits the kids. Sometimes they lock the kids in the apartment and go off for hours of partying.
The state decides to make life easier for one of these families. Which one? Under welfare laws in Illinois and other states, the mother doing drugs and allowing her boyfriend to belt the kids is the only one entitled to a free housekeeper up to five days a week. She can also receive up to $2,000 for a security deposit and the first month's rent on a new apartment, as well as furniture and up to $500 in cash. 
 So-called family preservation programs like this are in place in more than 30 states and receive more than $295 million in Federal funds a year. The Clinton Administration is seeking $1.4 billion for family preservation over the next five years. In Illinois, the Department of Children and Family Services spends $20 million a year on such programs.
Proponents of family preservation argue that it is cheaper for taxpayers and better for abused and neglected children to remain at home rather than be thrown into the often cruel foster care system. In some cases, this is true. But in most cases, giving services and money to parents who have abused their children does nothing but reward irresponsible and even criminal behavior.
How does it work in real life? In December 1991, the aunt of a 3-year-old girl told the family services department that her sister and her sister's lover had physically abused the child. State investigators confirmed the abuse: the child had bruises and rope burns on her body. Instead of bringing the case to court, the department provided a housekeeper and a social worker who between them went to the home a total of 37 times over the next 90 days. The housekeeper helped the mother clean up and make dinner. The social worker took her out for meals and shopping.
On March 7, 1992, the aunt telephoned the family services agency again, pleading that the child was still being abused. The agency ignored her. On March 17, the agency closed the case with a glowing report on how well the family was doing. Several hours later, the girl was dead. An autopsy revealed that boiling water had been poured on her genitals and that she had been struck on the head with a blunt instrument. Her body was covered with 43 scars, bruises and rope burns, most of which had been made in the previous few weeks. She weighed 17 pounds.
This is not an isolated incident. This spring, a drug abusing mother, who had been charged with criminal battery of her 2-year-old daughter, was given family preservation services after authorities found the girl and her 8-month-old brother eating out of dishes encrusted with rotten food and swarming with flies. Five days after the services began, the young boy was dead. Apparently the 2-year-old girl had tried to give him a bath while her mother slept into the afternoon, leaving them unattended.
In 1989, the Illinois Legislature commissioned a three-year study of the family preservation program by the University of Chicago. Last year, the researchers concluded that families receiving preservation funds were just as likely to have their children eventually placed in foster care as were families that received no funds. The report showed that the state was spending $20 million a year in an effort to save $2 million in foster-care expenses. Still, in the best tradition of bureaucracy, after the study was released the Department of Children and Family Services asked that the state expand the program.
The family preservation system is a continuation of sloppy thinking of the 1960's and 1970's that holds, as an unquestionable truth, that society should never blame a victim. Of course, the children are not considered the victims here. Rather the abusive parents are considered victims of poverty and addiction. This attitude is not only patronizing, it endangers children. The vast majority of poor parents do a decent job of raising their children under adverse conditions. In effect, the state is saying: Beat up or rape the kid next door and the government locks you up; beat up or rape your own kid and the government rushes in a housekeeper. What kind of message does this send?
Before more Federal money is turned over for these programs, the Government should demand that states prove they are effectively monitoring neglectful parents and can guarantee the safety of the children. Most importantly, we should insist that preservation services not be used to keep children with parents who have physically or sexually abused them.
There are alternatives. Many abused children have grandparents, aunts and uncles who can and do act as excellent foster parents. We should make it easier for these relatives to get public assistance if they take on the extra burden.
If there is no relative to care for the children, they should be placed in foster homes. If the parents straighten out their lives, they can reclaim the children. Indeed, the goal of reuniting their families should be an excellent incentive for parents to kick drug habits. Bribing abusive parents with housekeepers, cash and new apartments will only make them worse.

HEADLINE: Coup in Guatemala Nothing Like Peru's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Guatemala: Democracy Recouped?" (editorial, June 3), you presuppose an automatic similarity between the political process in Guatemala and Peru without attempting at least a cursory evaluation of the specific conditions in each country.
The outcome of events in Guatemala has already proved that the parallelism drawn was clearly wrong. President Alberto Fujimori of Peru has stated that the circumstances of the two countries are different, that the concrete situation of Peru does not lend itself to a facile comparison with any other country and that it should not serve as a model. He also stated that the destiny of Guatemala was, as it ought to be, in the hands of the Guatemalan people. 
 The depth and complexity of the crisis in Peru is unique in its magnitude and in the diversity of its manifestations. The response to this historic crisis since the election of the Peruvian President in 1990 has also been unique and, on the whole, successful. But the events that challenged Peru's capacity for sustained governance and led to a temporary adjustment in its political institutions last year have been overcome by newly elected democratic institutions, which have wide acceptance and clear legitimacy in Peru society and the international community.
It is in this context of democratic renewal that the modernization of the Peruvian economy and the growing success against the terrorist onslaught should be seriously assessed.
The assertion "that a white elite dominates an Indian and mixed-race majority" in a May 27 editorial also comparing Guatemala and Peru is simply a caricature to add to other groundless and negative references.
The so-called elite in Peru is, like the overwhelming majority of its society, the product of a fusion of races that began 500 years ago. Both white and Indian populations are relative minorities in relation to the "mestizo," the real protagonist of the political and social changes that have inverted the demographic topography of urban and rural Peru in less than a generation.

 BODY:

BECOMING A MAN: Half a Life Story
By Paul Monette. HarperSanFrancisco, $12.
Winner of the 1992 National Book Award for nonfiction, this autobiography chronicles Paul Monette's struggle to accept his homosexuality after years spent hiding it. "His fine memoir is affirmative and ultimately celebratory," Wendy Martin said here last year.
A GOOD SCENT FROM A STRANGE MOUNTAIN
By Robert Olen Butler. Penguin, $10.
Robert Olen Butler was an Army linguist in Vietnam and his experience infuses his first collection of short fiction, which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize. All 15 stories are told from the point of view of a Vietnamese emigrant to the American Gulf Coast, where his or her sense of loss is less a result of the war than of cultural displacement. Last year our reviewer, George Packer, praised the stories' originality, calling them "the work of a writer who is intoxicated by Vietnam and the Vietnamese, who loves what has alienated so many other Americans." 
 AFTER HENRY
By Joan Didion. Vintage International, $12.
These essays cover wide terrain, from Presidential politics to urban violence to the author's feelings regarding the death of her editor, Henry Robbins. "Joan Didion writes well," Hendrik Hertzberg said here last year. "More often than not, she writes beautifully."
COLLABORATORS
By Janet Kauffman. Graywolf, $11.
This novel concerns a young woman's almost suffocatingly close relationship with her mother. Writing in the Book Review in 1986, Ursula Hegi praised Janet Kauffman's "extraordinary gift for language and character development. . . . She brings a poet's sensitivity to her prose."
IN MORTAL COMBAT: Korea, 1950-1953
By John Toland. Quill/Morrow, $13.
The Korean War was, in its own time, as unpopular as the one in Vietnam years later. But, argues the military historian John Toland, it may prove to have been the deciding element in the chain of events that eventually unraveled Communism. "Mr. Toland's rendition is panoramic, gripping and, to a remarkable degree, original in its insights," Nicholas Eberstadt said here in 1991. In KOREA: The First War We Lost, by Bevin Alexander (Hippocrene, $16.95), the author takes a different view, asserting that the United States triumphed over North Korea but failed to curb Chinese strength. In 1986 our reviewer, Richard Halloran, found the book "well researched and readable." For an in-depth look at China's role, there is THE DAY THE CHINESE ATTACKED: Korea, 1950, by Edwin P. Hoyt (Athena/Paragon House, $12.95), which also evaluates the state of Chinese-American relations through the 1980's.
LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD: And Other Stories
By Randall Kenan. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $10.95.
In these interrelated short stories, Randall Kenan continues the saga of the residents of Tims Creek, the tiny, mostly black North Carolina hamlet he brought to life in his first novel, "A Visitation of Spirits." Last year our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, called the collection "nothing short of a wonder-book."
THE REAL THING: Stories and Sketches
By Doris Lessing. Harper Perennial, $11.
The pieces in this collection include keenly observed glimpses of contemporary London life as well as short stories that illuminate its emotional underside. Last year our reviewer, Eils Lotozo, said that the author continues to write with the "freshness and wonder of one newly arrived on the planet."
THE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS
By Ann Patchett. Ivy, $5.99.
In Ann Patchett's first novel, a pregnant young woman enters a Catholic home for unwed mothers not because she lacks a husband, but because she lacks a meaningful life. Last year our reviewer, Alice McDermott, called the book a "made-up story of an enchanted place. A fairy tale. A delight."
AMERICAN PLACES: A Writer's Pilgrimage to 15 of This Country's Most Visited and Cherished Sites
By William Zinsser. Harper Perennial, $10.
William Zinsser's itinerary included Disneyland and Rockefeller Center, along with less frequently celebrated locales like Abilene, Kan. (Dwight Eisenhower's hometown). "Mr. Zinsser personalizes each place, giving its history and adding his own keen observations," Herbert Mitgang said in The New York Times last year.
DAUGHTERS OF ALBION
By A. N. Wilson. Penguin, $10.
This is the third in A. N. Wilson's "Lampitt Papers" novels, a saga that revolves around, among other things, the possible murder of a famous historian by his biographer. Last year our reviewer, Joel Conarroe, found the book "an odd hybrid, revealing characteristics not only of the academic detective tale but also of the comedy of manners . . . and the novel of ideas."
HEAD TO HEAD: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe, and America
By Lester Thurow. Warner, $12.99.
The United States will probably lose this war, warns Lester Thurow, an economist, unless it is prepared to make radical changes. Last year our reviewer, Adam Smith, found the author's solutions debatable but described him as "a cogent analyst and an excellent interpreter of economic doctrine."
BOOTLEGGER'S DAUGHTER
By Margaret Maron. Mysterious Press/Warner, $4.99.
The daughter is Deborah Knott, the attorney heroine of Margaret Maron's latest mystery series, who is asked to investigate an 18-year-old murder case. "The country air encourages plot as well as plant growth," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.

NOBODY'S FOOL
By Richard Russo.
549 pp. New York:
Random House. $23. 
 YEARS ago, when I felt that the world weighed too heavily on my shoulders and believed (as only the young do) that the world would not willingly let me go, I used to dream of disappearing to some remote upstate New York town and checking in, a permanent guest, at its crumbling bleak hotel. Such towns, which I imagined to be off the edge of the map, are very much at the center of Richard Russo's fictional geography. His ambitious new novel, "Nobody's Fool," is set in North Bath, N.Y., a fractionally less blighted version of the blue-collar dead end where his earlier novels, "Mohawk" and "The Risk Pool," take place.
North Bath is the sort of community we might drive through without pausing, except to fantasize roomier lives for ourselves in its "aging clapboard Victorians and sprawling Greek Revivals that would have been worth some money if they were across the border in Vermont." But Mr. Russo encourages us to stop and look around; he shows us that what seems static is churning, underneath. And one soon realizes that no sensible person would go to North Bath to disappear, since life there, as Balzac wrote of the provinces, is lived entirely in public.
Perhaps that's the reason that small towns, like seagoing vessels, have always suited fiction: manageable little pressure cookers with a fixed cast of characters, whose lack of privacy and enforced proximity may cause the plot to boil over. What's turned up the heat in North Bath is the possibility that a theme park, to be called the Ultimate Escape, may be built there, and may breathe some economic life into the moribund former spa. Once a thriving resort, the town has declined steadily since 1868, "when the unthinkable began to happen and the various mineral springs, one by one, without warning or apparent reason, began, like luck, to dry up, and with them the town's wealth and future."
It's autumn 1984 and North Bath is "still waiting for its luck to change," but one senses its luck would need a fairly dramatic reversal to much affect the fortunes of Sully, Donald Sullivan, the novel's incorrigible and engaging hero: "Throughout his life a case study underachiever, Sully -- people still remarked -- was nobody's fool, a phrase that Sully no doubt appreciated without ever sensing its literal application -- that at 60, he was divorced from his own wife, carrying on halfheartedly with another man's, estranged from his son, devoid of self-knowledge, badly crippled and virtually unemployable -- all of which he stubbornly confused with independence."
Sixty years have knocked Sully from one part of North Bath to another, from his violent father's house to the rooms he rents now from the elderly Miss Beryl Peoples, his former teacher. A painful knee injury has him working odd jobs, off the books.
Sully is a partly domesticated, slightly maddened bear, feinting and jabbing at the center of the book's many subplots and hard-luck characters. His estranged lover, Ruth, has a husband she despises and a daughter whose own husband is trying to kill her. Sully's son, Peter, has serious marital troubles, two difficult children, a crazily possessive mother, a sick stepfather -- and he's been denied tenure at the small college where he teaches. Miss Beryl has been getting lost on her excursions around town, and she is compelled to fend off the grabby, selfish meddling of her banker son, Clive Jr. -- one of the main boosters of the Ultimate Escape. Even Sully's best friend, Rub (he's too dim to find trouble to get into), is undone by his wife's late-blooming kleptomania.
One wants to congratulate Mr. Russo for what he avoids. "Nobody's Fool" never slides into the corn-pone hokiness so often found in novels of small-town life, fiction in which the rural setting is either a Walker Evans photo or Dogpatch. In these books, the characters talk as if they were auditioning for the Henry Fonda part in "The Grapes of Wrath." But dialogue is what Mr. Russo does best, and the fun of this novel is in hearing these guys (and women) talk, giving one another a hard time -- they're funny, quick and inventive. (The novel's tone has the same low-key, smart-alecky intelligence as its characters.)
THESE people all have inner lives (you'd have to, in North Bath) and a range of expertise. They're capable of combining hard labor with metaphysical speculation: "Maybe sheetrocking wasn't one of Sully's favorite jobs, but like most physical labor, there was a rhythm to it that you could find if you cared to look. . . . Rhythm was what Sully had counted on over the long years -- that and the wisdom to understand that no job, no matter how thankless or stupid or backbreaking, could not be gotten through. The clock moved if you let it."
Like his characters, Mr. Russo deals with interesting themes (he'd have to, in all these pages): change and stasis, free will and obligation, luck, responsibility, forgiveness -- the bonds of community, friendship and family. He offers us apt observations of human types, human behavior. Here, for example, Sully's grandson reminds Sully of the boy's father: "Peter had been the same way, an almost comatose kid, it had seemed to Sully. If you didn't tell him to open a door, he'd just stand in front of it. At the time it had not occurred to Sully that the reason might be fear. The fear of doing the wrong thing. It seemed obvious now."
Having praised the novel, one has to say that it's not a consistent pleasure. Some characters are simply mistakes -- Peter's grad-student nympho girlfriend, for example. Near the ending, we feel Mr. Russo snipping and lining up the plot threads; we know where, and how neatly, the right knots will be tied. The Ultimate Escape park is built elsewhere because folks in North Bath are "funny-looking . . . like some failed genetic experiment." But, except for Clive Jr., no one minds very much. There's a sentimental pulling back from the exigencies of these lives as bittersweet music swells behind a warming vision of father-son reunion. A final grace note extends this beneficent spirit even to a semi-paralyzed Doberman pinscher, "its nub of a tail twitching in what -- who could know? -- just might be contentment."
More problematic is the novel's length. It's never exactly unreadable, and a lot does happen: punches are thrown, trucks and marriages wrecked, there's litigation, death. But at times it's maddening; you want to stick a pin in the novel and watch the subplots leak out. The observed asides and set pieces are among the best sections in the book, which requires a pace that's loose enough to accommodate the slow spots. Still, there's too much of a good thing -- too many mini-biographies of walk-on characters, too many points of view, too many idle hours at the OTB parlor and the diner. You wish Mr. Russo had been tougher in editing his book.
It makes the experience of reading "Nobody's Fool" a little like spending time in North Bath. Mostly you're curious and pleased, glad for a chance to eavesdrop and see into these lives, these souls. Then, after a while, you begin to fear that you'll never get out of this place alive. But as the end of your stay approaches, you feel a premature nostalgia -- you'll miss the town, especially Sully -- and you look around fondly, regretfully, as you speed up and drive on through.

DECLINING FORTUNES
The Withering of the American Dream.
By Katherine S. Newman.
257 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $23. 
 THE great strategic insight of the Clinton campaign was the recognition that America's middle class was in turmoil, terrified that the ordered suburban existence it considered its birthright was slipping away. The principal political flaw of the Clinton Administration so far may be its failure to maintain that focus in day-to-day policy making.
It is easy for elites, liberal and otherwise, to move on to other things in nonelection years, to issues less prosaic than homeownership, job security and educational opportunity. But Katherine S. Newman, in "Declining Fortunes," makes a persuasive case that middle-class anger and middle-class fear will run deep in American politics for some time to come. In a New Jersey suburb that she gives the pseudonym Pleasanton, Ms. Newman goes beneath the poll numbers and glib generalities that color so much political discussion, and gives a poignant portrait of how broad economic trends affect individual lives.
That the 72 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 -- the so-called baby boomers -- represent "the first generation since the Great Depression that can expect to have a lower standard of living than its parents" is not a new insight. But Ms. Newman, whose previous books include "Falling From Grace: The Experience of Downward Mobility in the American Middle Class," does not make the mistake of treating the boomers as a monolithic victim class. In fact, she argues that the sharp differences among them are what keep them from becoming the potent political force that their parents became -- and remain. The older boomers view the younger as "hopelessly materialistic . . . utterly lacking in commitment," she writes. Younger boomers "often look over their shoulders at the flower-power generation as . . . people whose attitudes were fine for their own time but out of step with today's realities." The clash of culture and values obscures shared economic interests.
Based on interviews with about 60 families who were promised confidentiality to protect their privacy, "Declining Fortunes" tells the story of a community that was wide open to the World War II generation of upwardly mobile urban emigrants, but that, in an era of wage stagnation and enormous increases in real-estate values, is out of reach for their children. The fact that many of these children have educations and professional credentials that surpass their parents' only makes their troubles more perplexing to them.
Ms. Newman, an anthropologist who teaches at Columbia University, is particularly good on the boomers' dispossession. The men and women who moved to Pleasanton after World War II sit tight, amazed at the value their homes have acquired, but yearning for the children and grandchildren driven out into a kind of suburban diaspora, unable to afford to live where they grew up. She also shows how some of the basic beliefs of the postwar era -- that all things come to those who work hard and "wait their turn," for example -- obscure the fact that Government actions, from low-interest home mortgages to the G.I. Bill of Rights, helped create the vast middle class of the 1950's.
Such beliefs, of course, have important political ramifications for an Administration trying to make the case (however intermittently) that there is a role for Government in helping this new generation of middle-class Americans. Do Pleasanton's baby boomers want too much, too soon, as many of their parents seem to think? Or do they deserve a hand, like national service programs to help pay for their children's educations?
MS. NEWMAN gives a far more sympathetic portrayal of the baby boomers than they usually get. Yes, they had privileged childhoods, but many spend their adulthoods trying to duplicate -- with two careers -- the style of life their parents enjoyed on one.
They put off having children, sometimes with much regret, or have fewer children than they want. And the women "worry -- a lot -- about the consequences for their children of their absence from the home," Ms. Newman writes. The women who came of age with the feminist movement find staying at home with their children a luxury that is out of reach. "Isn't that ironic?" one boomer says. "The deal was going to be that you didn't have to stay home. Now it's like you can't stay home if you wanted to."
It is such voices, and the voices of the boomers' parents, that give "Declining Fortunes" much of its power. In fact, the reader is left hungry for more texture, more detail on the residents of Pleasanton, particularly how this generation's turmoil affects its views on the issues percolating through politics today. One wants to hear more, for example, about how boomers who feel their own childbearing choices are limited react to "the new paternalism" that attempts to regulate the behavior of mothers on welfare; one suspects they are not appalled.

HEADLINE: Airborne Spirits Lose Altitude

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES; WILLIAM GRIMES, a culture reporter for The Times, is the author of "Straight Up or on the Rocks" (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
WAVE farewell to the three-martini flight. The days of the airplane as a flying cocktail lounge are pretty much over, as health-conscious passengers and business travelers on tight schedules forgo cocktails and cognacs in favor of a little wine or water.
Overall consumption of alcohol on planes is down, with a decline of about 10 to 15 percent a year for the last several years at most airlines, according to food and beverage managers at major domestic and foreign carriers. Passengers who do drink spirits tend to drink vodka, but most others are ordering beer or wine or water. 
 Back in the good old days, recalled Peter Nixon, manager of wine and beverage development at British Airways, in the late 1970's when he started working in cabin service for the airline, the 20 passengers in first class would go through four bottles of whisky on a typical trans-Atlantic flight. "Now you have one," he said, "and that's still half-full when you land."
The airlines do not make it easy to put the drinks picture in focus. In fact, it's as murky as a Pernod and water. Some, like British Airways and Trans World Airlines, can provide fairly detailed information on beverage purchases and drinking trends. Others supply only anecdotal information. And caterers at Air France claim they don't have any information on beverage consumption at all.
Even with good record-keeping, assessing the trend is difficult, since consumer behavior depends on such factors as the length and time of the flight, the destination and the nationality of the traveler.
The airlines themselves find it all a bit confusing. T.W.A., facing a 15 percent decline in drinks sales in each of the last six years (with consumption holding steady in first class and business class, where the drinks are free), ran a test on selected flights for a week three months ago, reducing by $1 the price of its drinks from the industry-standard $4 for spirits and $3 for beer.
"Average sales per passenger did not decline," said Stan Henderson, the airline's director of in-flight services operations. While this test proved that the lower price halted the general decline, another one showed that a price change reversed the trend. "We ran a test on another set of flights in which we charged a flat $2 for all drinks," he added, "and consumption of soft drinks went down 5 percent, while beer and liquor sales per passenger went up 10 percent."
Encouraged, T.W.A. adopted the $2 policy system-wide. But so far this year, the airline is still down 15 percent in sales, according to Mr. Henderson, who speculated that the ban on smoking may have something to do with the results. "A lot of people have to have a cigarette if they drink," he said. "Also, there are more hub flights on T.W.A. now, and so there are more short flights, and more flights that start before 2 P.M."
Vodka, which mixes easily with fruit juice and soda, has come on strong in the past 10 years and now accounts for about half the airborne spirits market on domestic flights, said food and beverage managers at several airlines. Scotch accounts for about a third, and the rest of the pie is made up of very slim slices of rum, gin, bourbon, brandy and assorted liqueurs, such as Amaretto and Kahlua, with Bailey's Irish Cream, a whisky-based liqueur, a strong up-and-comer in recent years. "With Bailey's," said Gary Franson, director of food services for Northwest Airlines, "the volume is so high we almost don't think of it as belonging to the liqueur category."
Like his counterparts at other airlines, Mr. Franson theorized that increasing numbers of businesswomen account for the Bailey's boom.
On international flights, national drinking preferences can skew the totals. The British still prefer gin to vodka. On Alitalia, vodka and Scotch dominate the spirits, but passengers order a fair amount of Punt e Mes, a bitter aperitif, Peroni beer and Vecchia Romagna brandy. Rum sells well on flights to the Caribbean, but when Delta Airlines test-marketed margaritas on its Mexico City flights, response was weak. The strongly international clientele did not share the American love for cactus juice.
According to Mr. Nixon of British Airways, his airline uses more vodka and bourbon on North American routes than on others. "In Europe, where we have more British passengers, we use more gin," he explained, "and we use more whisky and cognac on the Far Eastern routes."
Brand preference is difficult to gauge, since airline pasengers are a captive audience, and space limits mean that only a couple of brands can be stocked in any category. Beverage managers have decided that it's better to be deep than to be broad when stocking spirits.
The big news, however, is not in spirits but in wine, which is on the upswing, even as overall consumption of wine in the United States declined by 10 percent between 1980 and 1990. "One of the most significant trends is the increased popularity of red wines, because of that '60 Minutes' program," said Bob Sobczewski, manager of food and beverage planning at United Airlines. The TV program, broadcast in November 1991 and repeated in July 1992, presented recent findings by medical researchers that a glass or two of red wine each day reduces the risk of heart attack by lowering cholesterol levels. Overnight, wine store owners and the airlines registered a sharp increase in the demand for red wine.
"We recently increased the red wine we carry in coach, and we can't seem to stock enough," said Mr. Henderson of T.W.A. "At the moment we serve all wine from splits in coach, but we're seriously considering going to fifths." (A split is a single-serving 187-milliliter bottle.) In the three years that Alitalia has been serving wine free in the back as well as the front of the plane, consumption has tripled.
The airlines have become more innovative in drawing up wine lists for their first-class and business customers, and in a classic case of trickle-down economics, coach passengers, now limited to mass-produced screw-cap chardonnays and cabernets, may soon reap the benefits enjoyed by their more fortunate fellow passengers.
Delta recently hired the wine writer Anthony Dias Blue as a consultant. Instead of purchasing wine for the entire system, Delta has divided the United States into four regions, each with a different wine list, a practice that allows the airline to buy wines from smaller producers.
"We've looked for wines with assertive varietal character," said Mr. Blue. "Not airline-type wines, but restaurant wines." Recent purchases include a sauvignon blanc by Hanna, a California winery that produces only 15,000 cases yearly. For the first time in five years, wine consumption on Delta is up, although Denise Poole, the system manager for food and beverages at the airlines, said she did not know by how much. "We expected to have the wines on for three to four months," said Mr. Blue, "but we ran through them in a month."
British Airways relies on a powerhouse tasting team for its wine list: Colin Anderson, who holds the title of Master of Wine, conferred by the Institute of Masters of Wine in London; Hugh Johnson, the British wine writer, and Michael Broadbent, head of the wine department at Christie's in London.
The airline's policy of stocking wines native to the country of destination is in force on flights to the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and will soon be extended to South American flights, which will carry Chilean wines, and short-haul trips to Spain and Germany.
"About four years ago we were using 250,000 cases of wine a year," said Mr. Nixon. "Now we go through 340,000 cases. There have been more passengers, but not enough to account for that kind of increase."
THE problem for beverage managers is that boutique wineries cannot afford to supply wine in the splits that airlines serve in coach, so imagination runs up against an economic wall. One solution is to pour from full-size bottles, as T.W.A. is considering doing. That's messier and more time-consuming. At Delta, Mr. Blue has begun approaching mid-sized wineries, like Wente Brothers in California, to supply splits with a bit more character than the usual airplane wines. Whether passengers will recognize the difference, and reach for their wallets, remains to be seen.
The wine boom on planes presents another problem. Unfortunately for the airlines, when passengers give up spirits, they drink bigger. The tiny mini of bourbon takes up a fraction of the space required by a single-serving bottle of wine, beer or designer water. So the crunch is on.
"We're getting more and more requests for nonalcoholic beer, so we're running a test to see what kind of demand is out there," said Ms. Poole of Delta. "But we're cautious about committing because of space limits."
Shall there be no more cakes and ale? There certainly shall. That's why they invented Las Vegas. With the same trend-resistance that made Wayne Newton king, the city attracts a different kind of flier, the kind that still cannot believe that anyone would pay money to drink water. "We have to put twice as many liquor kits on board for that group," said Ms. Poole of the airline's Las Vegas flights.
It's somehow reassuring to know that somewhere up there, at 30,000 feet, at least someone is having a high old time.

Seen the One Where Arnold Sells Noodles?

BYLINE: By LAUREN DAVID PEDEN; Lauren David Peden writes about entertainment for Us magazine and the Ladies' Home Journal.

 BODY:
Americans abroad will not have to wait for the foreign release of "Last Action Hero" or "Sliver" to see Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone this summer. All they'll have to do is turn on the television and wait for an ad.
Along with earning millions from summer blockbusters, stars reap additional benefits from commercials shown in foreign countries. Not surprisingly, American celebrities who reluctantly endorse products at home are only too happy to appear in ads abroad. 
 In Italy, Kim Basinger models hosiery, while Woody Allen has written and directed a series of commercials for the country's largest grocery chain, Co-op Italia. Ms. Stone stars in one racy ad for Pirelli Tires and another for Freixenet champagne in Europe.
Nowhere are celebrity ads more prevalent than in Japan. Mr. Schwarzenegger can be seen pitching Nissin Cup Noodle and Chi Chin vitamin drink. Turn on a television or flip through a magazine and you're likely to spot Harrison Ford hawking Hondas, Bruce Willis selling Subarus, Demi Moore pushing cosmetics, Tom Berenger smoking Larks and Sylvester Stallone eating baked ham.
Why do stars endorse such products on foreign shores but not at home? "There are still those film stars who you're just not going to see doing a product endorsement here in the States," says Noreen Jenney, president of Celebrity Endorsement Network, a California company that represents advertisers seeking stars. "They think it's selling out. But when you make the kind of money they make doing it, and nobody knows you do it, that's a different story."
Ms. Stone, for instance, received between $1 million and $2 million for her Pirelli endorsement, and Mr. Allen was reportedly paid from $1.5 million to $5 million for the Co-op Italia ads.
Before the Japanese economy took a nosedive, American actors routinely made millions there: Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner each received $1 million to represent Kirin beer. Today's foreign ads typically pay from $250,000 to $600,000 for a couple of days work in New York or Los Angeles.
As for what Mr. Schwarzenegger earns, all lips are sealed. But he's obviously being paid enough to look silly. In his Chi Chin vitamin drink series, he's seen carrying an ancient Asian woman on his back; then the shot changes and she's seen carrying him (presumably after downing some Chi Chin). In another ad, Mr. Schwarzenegger -- done up in a too-tight suit, slicked-down hair and horn rims -- is harassed in the subway by an angry mob. He drinks some Chi Chin and -- presto! -- the walls of the subway fall away to reveal a pumped-up Arnold, dressed in black and ready for action.
For Takeda Pharmaceutical, he's seen straddling a rocket that blasts off and shoots him out of the frame; in a Cup Noodle ad, he's dressed in a kimono, with a dish of noodles on a table in front of him: He just stands there, smiling and making weird, mimelike hand motions.
"The Japanese do very unique commercials," says Stephen Carbone, an executive vice president at International Creative Management. "They're ofttimes very oblique, and the actor or actress has fun with them."
It is Mr. Schwarzenegger's willingness to entertain that has made him the leader of the ad pack, according to Hal Lifson, a consultant at Dentsu Advertising in Los Angeles, the agency responsible for many of the Japanese celebrity ads. "Certain actors are unwilling to do certain things," he explains. "They're just not willing to bend their own rules. Schwarzenegger, because of 'Twins,' has a softer image in Japan than Stallone, and he became the hot ticket. Stallone was always viewed as the prototypical American 'Hawk' character -- Hercules. And Hercules is not really comedic and self-deprecating."
On Japanese television, Bruce Willis spoofs his action-movie image by crashing through a plate-glass window, rolling on the floor and swinging from a chandelier and onto a food-laden table before quenching his thirst with a bottle of Post Water, a mineral water.
Japan Airlines has featured Richard Gere singing Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry." Jodie Foster, in a Honda ad, flirts with a group of men to the tune of the Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives Me Crazy."
While Japanese ads may lose something in translation, European ads have more universal (read: American) appeal. In Ms. Stone's Pirelli ad, the star steps off an airplane and into a waiting car. The handsome young driver watches in the rear-view mirror as she removes her sunglasses, then her scarf, earrings and jacket. When she tells him to pull over (or so we imagine, since there's no dialogue), he stops the car and nervously loosens his tie. Then he gets into the back seat, and she climbs behind the wheel. The tagline ("If you're going to drive, drive") flashes as they exchange a look in the mirror.
"Pirelli's brand image is very Italian, quite sexy," says Tim Lindsay of Young & Rubicam in London, the agency that did the ad. "We chose Sharon Stone because of who she is -- very sexy, grown up, in control."
The stars commonly have nondisclosure clauses in their contracts, specifying that the ads cannot be shown -- or sometimes even discussed -- outside the country for which they were intended. ("Entertainment Tonight" has, nonetheless, broadcast some clips from the commercials.) Actors "believe that knowledge of that endorsement should stay within that country," says Rick Hersh, worldwide head of commercials at the William Morris agency.
Mr. Lifson concurs: "Generally, big stars are not interested in being positioned as a spokesperson, because it's not viewed as a creative endeavor. It's viewed as a cash-in, cash-out capitalistic maneuver. And, to the performer, that's not an acceptable way to make money, because they're not acting in these commercials, they're endorsing."
Ah, yes, but they're acting on the inside.

For Car Renters, The News Is Bad

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
AUTO renters who have been saving the cost of a collision damage waiver because a credit card or charge card provided this protection will need to take a close look at any new rules coming from their credit card company or bank. The protection may be disappearing.
American Express and the Visa card and Mastercard issued by Chase Manhattan Bank are cutting back. American Express is limiting the number of companies in the United States where its card will provide a C.D.W. alternative, and has eliminated coverage in Italy and New Zealand. The Chase Bank's standard Visa and Mastercards will no longer provide a C.D.W. alternative at all. 
 "Cost-effectiveness" and "redirection of enhancement efforts" were cited by the card issuing companies; still more reductions may be ahead.
The new changes on the Chase-issued cards do not affect the gold cards, only the standard or "classic" Visa or Mastercards issued by Chase. As of June 30, these cards will no longer provide repayment plans equivalent to the collision damage waiver in the event the rental car is stolen or damaged. Visa and Mastercard have always left it to the issuing bank to decide whether to provide this benefit, and Citicorp, the biggest issuer of these cards, with 20 million standard cards estimated in use, never provided it. Chase, the second-largest issuer, will not disclose its numbers, but Kevin T. Higgins, editor of Card Industry Directory in Chicago, puts the number of standard Chase Visa cards and Mastercards at 11.5 million.
At the same time, Chase is dropping free card insurance that provided a benefit of $50,000 in the event a card holder was accidentally killed or dismembered when traveling on a bus, train, ship or scheduled airline. Card "enhancements" like these were heavily promoted by credit and charge cards in the 80's when high interest rates would pay the premium. American Express estimated the C.D.W. cost at $1.25 for each card-holder annually.
 
15 Rental Companies
 American Express took action to restrict the rental-car coverage provided on standard, gold and Optima cards other than those provided to employees of big corporations. Bill Moss, an American Express spokesman, estimated that 21 million cards would be affected. The changes are effective Aug. 1.
The major change limited the domestic use of American Express Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance to rentals from 15 major companies in the United States and its territories. The 15 companies are:
Advantage, Agency, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, Inter American, National, Payless, Rent-a-Wreck, Snappy, Thrifty and Value.
Mr. Moss said 95 percent of all rentals charged to American Express were through these agencies. The rub is that in smaller places, where a local auto sales lot or a leasing company may be the only game in town, the American Express card-holder is in the same fix as someone without the card. Jan M. Armstrong, executive vice president of the American Car Rental Association, said smaller companies would be hard hit, and that the group would have preferred that American Express simply eliminate the coverage. Gary Rubin, editor of Auto Rental News, affiliated with the association, said the 15 companies represented 33 percent of the 26,291 rental locations in the United States.
Those who own a car and maintain collision and theft coverage on it are usually covered at the same level when they rent a car in the United States. The card typically covers the deductible and any difference in value between the new rental car and the renter's own car. This is known as secondary coverage. For those who do not own cars, and therefore have no car insurance, the card coverage is primary, meaning it reimburses the renter for any money paid for damage or loss of the auto.
As before, to activate the card coverage, the renter must charge the rental on the card and decline the rental company's collision damage waiver, under whatever name it is offered.
American Express also added while taking away, improving its domestic C.D.W. coverage providing, of course, that the rental is at one of the listed agencies. Formerly, the coverage was limited to 15 consecutive days; this has been extended to 31 days. Four-wheel-drive sports-utility vehicles were formerly excluded. Now, American Express says, the insurance will cover "four-wheel drive vehicles, including but not limited to Jeep Renegade, Jeep Cherokee, Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Bronco and Suzuki Samurai," but only when driven on paved roads.
 
Overseas Cuts
 American Express has also cut back on its protections for certain auto-renters overseas: As of Aug. 1, it will provide no coverage for travelers who rent in Italy or New Zealand. The rental companies in Italy, according to Avis, Hertz and National, have been suffering rising losses through auto theft, and the credit card companies were sharing in these losses. The losses were apparently outstripping the car rental companies' yield through the sale of waivers, so what amounts to a surcharge on a surcharge was devised. In January 1993, auto rental companies operating in Italy agreed to require that renters buy a separate theft-protection policy, which costs 16,500 lire a day, or $11, for a car in the middle range, and 22,500 lire a day, or $15, for a bigger car.
The credit card coverage could still be used for the collision part of the coverage in Italy, but when this was done, the rental agency often put a "hold" on the card, effectively freezing $5,000 to $14,000 in available credit, depending on the value of the car. For people operating with one card, it often seemed easier to pay for the C.D.W., since it did not tie up their cards' credit.
Summarizing this from the standpoint of American Express, Mr. Moss said the common practice in Italy of requiring the customer to buy the C.D.W. or put down a huge cash deposit meant "we were offering something useless."
The New Zealand situation is different, and American Express said that regulations there made its coverage moot, so customers are being notified accordingly. According to Kim Wong of the New Zealand Tourism Office in Santa Monica, Calif., New Zealand car rental agencies have never accepted card coverage in lieu of the C.D.W. All car renters are required to buy insurance costing the equivalent of $7 to $8 a day, depending on the company, she said. In addition, they must present a deposit, known as a "damage excess," of $325 to $400 in cash, traveler's checks or credit-card charge, refundable upon the safe return of the car, or must pay a further daily fee of $2.75 to $3.25. Car renters with the American Express card clearly assumed that waiver of the damage excess was to be refused, but if they were in an accident, sought a repayment of the deposit. Mr. Moss said that actually the purchase of the insurance invalidated the card coverage, but the situation was creating great confusion.
The gold card C.D.W. coverage by Visa, Mastercard and Diners Club had not changed as of June 14. In a time of apparent flux, however, anyone planning to refuse a waiver and use credit card coverage should call the information number given in the card literature.

HEADLINE: Town-House Sales Pick Up as Their Prices Fall Off

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
LIKE those of much of the New York residential real estate market, the sale prices of one-family town houses in Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side and other prime Manhattan neighborhoods have been, for the most part, falling for the last five years.
The decline, however, has now left prices at what some real estate brokers believe are bargain levels and, according to several recently released reports, has prompted a small resurgence in sales in some parts of the city, particularly on the Upper East Side. 
 There were, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, 55 one-family town houses sold in Manhattan in 1992, compared with 54 in 1991 and 42 in 1990.
Sotheby's International Realty, which tracks town-house sales in Manhattan south of 96th Street, recorded an 11.1 percent increase in the sale of one- and two-family houses, to 70 in 1992 from 63 in 1991.
Sales volume in dollars, according to the Sotheby's report, increased 2.7 percent,to $111 million from from $108 million.
The average sale price, though, declined 7 percent, to $1.59 million from $1.71 million.
Kathryn A. Korte, a vice president at Sotheby's, attributed the increase in sales more to realistic pricing than to a surge of interest from foreign buyers, who are often unable to buy co-op apartments, commercial users, such as physicians, or foreign missions and consulates.
"A lot of these properties have been on the market for some time," she said. "Over the past few years they have gone for 75 to 80 percent of the asking prices."
Ms. Korte said that the sales volume was particularly strong among town houses priced under $1 million. She said that sales of these homes made up almost 50 percent of the total sales in 1992, compared to 38 percent for 1991.
She also said that the number of town homes sold this year was likely to surpass last year's total. "The number of sales we have achieved so far this year is more than we had at this time last year," she said.
"The average are in the $2 million or so range," she added.
Ms. Korte also said that most of the activity was on the Upper East Side and the least in the East 30's and 40's -- Murray Hill and Turtle Bay.
"In general, we are pleased," she said. "We have a lot of buyers looking for the right place and the right price."
CLARK HALSTEAD, president of the Halstead Property Company, noted that on the Upper East Side, where most of the city's one-family town houses are, there were 10 sales in the first five months of 1993 compared to five in the same period in 1992.
He said there were 32 town-housesales for all of 1992 on the Upper East Side, attributing this to a belief by buyers that prices had bottomed out and that there were many good buys on the market.
He also said that, apart from the more favorable economy, particularly the lower mortgage interest rates, the rising number of sales was evidence that, despite the growing popularity of lofts -- which are configured horizontally -- multi-level town-house living continued to have strong appeal in a city where buyers paid a premium for space.
Most of the town houses sold on the Upper East Side this year are about 3,500 square feet.
"It seems to be much stronger in terms of the number of deals," he said.
The largest sale in 1992 was of a town house at 44 East 71st Street for $10.8 million. The 11,900-square-foot home, which has a swimming pool and garage, was sold to the Korean Mission for use by the Korean ambassador.
Mr. Halstead added that the median sale price of town houses on the Upper East Side fell 4.6 percent, to $1.42 million, for the first five months of 1993 from $1.49 million for all of 1992. He also said that the median price per square foot was $354 in 1993, as opposed to $450 in 1992.
The most expensive town house in square footage was 17 East 92d Street, which sold this year for $536 a square foot or $2.8 million, according to Mr. Halstead. In 1992, the most expensive town house, 178 East 64th Street, sold for $1,000 a square foot or $3 million.
Sales prices have been especially weak for the few new buildings that have been built.
For example, a new town house at 16 East 85th Street, on the Upper East Side, was sold this year for $3.2 million, the highest price paid for a town house this year.
The owner, however, had originally asked for $6 million.
The home, which is one of two new town-homes that were built side by side, was designed by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates, an architectural firm best known for its vacation homes in the Hamptons.
ANOTHER new development, Greenwich Mews, at Greenwich Street between Christopher and West 10th Streets, consists of seven town houses that have been on the market since 1990 for $1 million each. So far, two have been sold.
The overall town house market, however, has not plummeted, as it has for many co-ops and condominiums. The unusual size and luxuriousness of town homes are primary reasons, as is location. Most town homes are in historic districts or in gentrified areas.
Moreover, town houses are rare. According to the city's Department of Finance, there are only 967 one-family mansions or town houses in the city. By comparison, there are, according to the Real Estate Board, about 120,000 co-ops and condominiums.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Looking for the Right Space;
Why Mastercard Stayed in Manhattan

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
AS it turns out, Mastercard International isn't leaving Manhattan after all. Instead, the fast-growing interbank organization, which has been bursting out of its headquarters space at 888 Seventh Avenue, at 53d Street, will spread out across some 350,000 square feet at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, the old Burlington House at 55th Street.
New York City gets to keep 450 jobs now and a promise of more than double that number before the decade is out. Mastercard gets as much space as it needs at an excellent price, gets its name on the door of a Class A building in central Manhattan and doesn't have to put any employees through the enervating process of relocating. 
 Staying in New York should have been a clear-cut choice, right?
Wrong.
In fact, Burlington House didn't enter the picture until the 11th hour of what had been a three-year corporate odyssey to find exactly the right state, then the right city, and then the right space. And until Burlington House showed up, whether Mastercard would stay in New York or move to Westchester remained hotly disputed.
"To the last minute it was a 50-50 race and a roller-coaster ride," said F. David Brangaccio, the Mastercard senior vice president who headed the search for a new headquarters.
Mastercard's decision to stay in Manhattan represents the culmination of a process that involved consultants, architects, brokers, Mastercard employees at every staff level and local officials -- not to mention landlords and leasing agents who wanted to snare the high-profile tenant for persistently vacant spaces in their buildings.
The way Mastercard went about eliminating various locations and buildings makes a good case study of how intricate a space search can be and how its result can be as much a matter of serendipity as it is of economic calculations.
Perhaps even more important, it illustrates how much a company's corporate strategies are reflected in its real estate decisions.
"Corporate decisions on where to locate are no longer only real-estate-driven," said Les J. Cranmer, a principal of PHH Fantus Consulting, a management consulting firm in Florham Park, N.J. that Mastercard hired to help it evaluate the repercussions of moving. "Maybe an expiring lease is the catalyst, but corporate strategy is the driving force behind a move."
IN the beginning, only one thing was clear: Mastercard could no longer abide the cramped existence it had been living. This was a company that outgrew its quarters as quickly as toddlers outgrow clothes.
Over the last decade or so, it had supplemented its basic credit card business with a gold card, travelers' checks, corporate accounts, affinity cards, travel insurance, all kinds of accoutrements that required more and more people to market and administer.
In 1978, when it first moved into 34,000 square feet at 888 Seventh Avenue, it had about 150 employees in New York. By the mid-80's that number had doubled. The company kept taking more space -- and outgrowing it. By 1990 it had nearly 400 employees crammed into 154,000 square feet, sprawled across nine noncontiguous floors.
Meanwhile, the company's data-processing center in St. Louis had 581 people in 117,000 square feet.
By late 1990, although it had five years more to go on its New York lease and 12 years in St. Louis, it had had enough of this catch-as-catch-can approach to space. It asked itself the obvious question: Should it consolidate its St. Louis and New York facilities? If so, where should the newly combined company be set up?
If Mastercard had opted for consolidation, Manhattan would never have had a chance. Midtown rents may have dropped sharply from those of four or five years ago, but they are still high enough to effectively rule out siting any kind of data center or other back-office operation in Manhattan.
Economically, suburban Chicago, suburban Washington, even suburban New York seemed to make sense. And St. Louis, where so many people could stay put, made the most sense of all. By moving everyone there, the company would benefit not only from lower occupancy costs, but also from easier communications between its technical staff and its headquarters folks.
But strategically, consolidation just didn't seem to work. It was unlikely that, wherever Mastercard landed, all its people would move with it. And, with the competition against Visa, American Express and other credit-card companies getting fiercer, the turmoil caused by disrupting the staff could easily make any talk of long-run benefits academic.
"The attrition costs of consolidation would have just been too much for us to bear," Mr. Brangaccio said.
Deciding to keep the company's two halves separate was easy; figuring what to do with the New York contingent was not.
By the fall of 1991, Mastercard had narrowed its sphere to midtown Manhattan or close-in Westchester, the two areas that were most accessible to the highest number of Mastercard's employees.
WITH PHH Fantus's help, it put together a preliminary space plan that laid out its needs. And it hired as architects Gensler & Associates, as brokers Cushman & Wakefield and Douglas A. Edwards and as construction consultant Robert Bennis to help it investigate sites and buildings and to serve as checks and balances on one another.
With the space plan done by Fantus, the brokers wouldn't be tempted to skew it to favor buildings their firm manages or that pay better commissions; with Mr. Bennis checking the architect's preliminary designs, anything that would cost too much to build would get caught at the outset.
"It's always a good idea to have team members who will challenge each other," said Mr. Cranmer of Fantus.
According to Mitchell Barnett, a Cushman & Wakefield director, Mastercard and its brokers and consultants looked at about 15 buildings and proposed buildings in Westchester and 30 in Manhattan. By the middle of 1992 it had narrowed its search to four sites in Westchester and eight in New York.
In Westchester there was 100 Manhattanville Road, the old Nestle building in Purchase; 400 Summit Lake Drive in Valhalla; One Gateway Plaza in White Plains and 10 Main Street, a not-yet-built office complex, also in White Plains.
IN New York there was the Mobil Building, at 150 East 42d Street; 335 Madison Avenue, near 42d Street; the McGraw-Hill building, at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street; the CBS building, at 51 West 52d Street; 277 Park Avenue, near 48th Street; 666 Fifth Avenue, near 53d Street; the Citicorp Building, at 153 East 53d Street; and 1585 Broadway, at 47th Street. All of these Manhattan buildings had large blocks of space available and their occupancy costs were within 10 percent of one another's.
Mastercard executives and representatives of employees at all levels visited each of the buildings and reported back on their gut feelings. The brokers, architects and other assorted consultants visited, too, and came back with more technical evaluations.
"Certainly not every vote counts the same, no company is a complete democracy, but we did try to do this in a participative way," said Alex W. Hart, Mastercard's president, who is universally known as Pete. Just as important, the employee representatives would serve as management's conduit to the staff, who could both explain to the employees how decisions were made and give management early warnings of disgruntlement that any prospective move might cause.
When employees reported that the small, dark floors available at the CBS building made them feel hemmed in, for example, or that they didn't like walking through a lot of retail space to get into 666 Fifth Avenue, those comments were all factored heavily into the building's rankings.
In November, Mastercard's executive committee met with the brokers and consultants for a detailed presentation of every one of the short-listed buildings. Bob Bennis discussed each building's technical aspects. Mitch Barnett and other Cushman brokers discussed the occupancy costs and other financial parameters. The architects kicked in with talks about potential layouts.
By the end of that meeting, it looked as though White Plains would be the winner. Yes, the company liked the idea of being in a global city like New York, but even Mr. Brangaccio, who was in the stay-in-Manhattan contingent, conceded that the city's sometimes-difficult life style, with its crowds and high living costs and crime problems, and the "questionable future" of the Times Square redevelopment project and other proposals to make the city more pleasant, couldn't be ignored. The main problem, said Vito A. Fragala, Mastercard's vice president, administrative services, was that "nothing we saw in New York really excited us."
Indeed, each building on the short list had its own deal-killer drawback. 666 Fifth Avenue dropped out because it was too old and had too much retail space to go through to get in. The floors available in the CBS building, at 335 Madison Avenue and the McGraw-Hill building were too low and too dark.
The Citicorp building was just too closely associated with Citicorp, something that a membership organization of banks did not feel appropriate. And 277 Park was also an old building; but more importantly, Mr. Brangaccio says it got thrown out of the running when Mastercard executives decided that a Park Avenue address seemed a bit "uppity" for a not-for-profit membership organization.
Westchester was seen, by contrast, as a backwater, but it was easy to reach and it had several campus-like sites that were approved for office complexes and that developers would build to suit for Mastercard.
"In a company that's trying to put its stamp on the business worldwide, we needed a signature building," said Mr. Hart. Although the company's internal guesstimates were that it would lose about a third of its people if it moved to White Plains, it figured it could handle that amount of attrition.
Moreover, a delegation of Westchester officials, including Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio of White Plains, had come down in September to tout their quality of life and fiscal soundness . Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York and assorted city officials countered with talks about cultural and business vibrancy and plans to revitalize Times Square and otherwise enhance safety and quality of life.
At that point, Westchester sounded better.
Not only that, but the New York contenders were dropping out rapidly. By late 1992, the process of elimination had narrowed Mastercard's search to four buildings. There was state-of-the-art 1585 Broadway, with a gleaming facade, no other tenants to usurp Mastercard's limelight and a layout perfectly suited to its space needs. But it was in the hands of its banks, the banks were squabbling and negotiations were impossible.
The McGraw-Hill building came back into the running when some tower floors with more light and better space became available. The building's management agreed to prominently display Mastercard's name in the Avenue of the Americas plaza and in the lobby, but in the end Mastercard still balked at being just another tenant in someone else's signature building.
"The building was too big, it was identified with another company and we just felt we'd get lost in there," Mr. Brangaccio recalled.
Yet no one was really excited about anything they had seen in Westchester.
"Since the company was clearly leaning in that direction, we went back to look again at the Westchester marketplace," Mr. Barnett recalls. The brokers came back with an added contender: Kings Wood Corporate Center, a yet-to-be-built four-building complex in Armonk that had originally not been considered because it was more than 15 minutes from the White Plains train station. But it was close to highways and near the North White Plains and Valhalla train stations and the landlords were happy to build to Mastercard's specifications.
KINGS WOOD came very close to snagging Mastercard. But then word came out from 1345 Avenue of the Americas: Smith Barney, Harris Upham, which occupied floors 44 through 50, would probably be moving out. That, combined with other vacant space in the building, was enough to accomodate Mastercard's present and future needs.
"Here we were, all in hiatus while the Mastercard executives are evaluating all the reports, and then the Burlington building just popped up," recalled Robin Klehr Avia, Gensler's vice president.
The Burlington space was about as close to Mastercard's optimum space plan as an existing structure could come. Mastercard had decided it wanted floors that were between 35,000 and 40,000 square feet; Burlington House's floors were 40,000 feet. The cafeteria was available, as was mailroom space in the basement. And the Fisher Brothers, the building's owners, were happy to rename the building Mastercard World Plaza.
Suddenly Mastercard began to rethink leaving the city. It took a closer look at possible attrition, even printing out a list of people it thought would leave. Many were key to the company. "We'd save a few dollars in White Plains, but it wasn't worth losing a few steps in our competitive march," Mr. Brangaccio said.
Mastercard made its final decision in early February and signed the lease this month. It is leasing seven floors, about 270,000 feet, now, and has committed to take two more floors in five years, for a total of 350,000 square feet. The 20-year lease includes flexible expansion and contraction options that kick in every five years. The deal specifies a rent in the high $30's per square foot, along with a contribution of close to $60 a foot to the cost of building the offices, plus more than a year's free rent.
Even in this depressed market, that represents a good deal.
Surprisingly, both New York City and Westchester waited until the last minute to offer any financial incentives. In fact, neither White Plains nor Armonk had a chance to make a concrete offer: By the time New York came through with what was a fairly small incentive package -- $2 million in tax breaks over the next 20 years if Mastercard maintained its employment level of 450 people, four times that if it doubled its workforce -- Mastercard had already sold itself on staying in Manhattan.
"People like to say they feel trapped here, but the fact is most people are living and working in New York by choice," said Mr. Hart. "And the roar from the staff when we announced our decision made me realize we were doing the right thing by everyone."
New York couldn't be more delighted.
According to the city's estimates, the retention of Mastercard with a staff of 450 would yield some $81 million to city coffers from corporate taxes, personal income and sales taxes and related business travel. With a staff of 900, the boon is estimated at $176 million. Mastercard projects that its New York workforce will grow to 1,200 by 2005.
"Now that the recession has bottomed out, we can focus on companies that will grow," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "And the bulk of benefits from Mastercard are in its growth."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: 110-118 Riverside Drive;
A Mixed Window Dressing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IT'S just the kind of thing that drives preservationists nuts: Over the last 20 years the 1929 apartment house at 110-118 Riverside Drive has gone window-wild.
With no master plan for replacements, tenants in the nonlandmark co-op have installed windows in a wild variety of colors and the place looks like a test lab for a fenestration institute. 
 This wacky heterogeneity is against every tenet of historic preservation, which prizes the uniform in such situations. But now the co-op board of directors is implementing a master plan governing replacement windows, in a search for energy savings and uniformity in the 3,000-window building.
The orange brick building, designed by Gronenberg & Leuchtag, who were active in apartment design for speculative builders, was built along the gentle, inward curve of the block between 83d and 84th Streets.
The original architectural drawings show four-, six- and eight-over-one windows: that is, upper sashes divided into multiple panes over a lower sashes of larger, single panes.
There is not much writing on window choice of that period, but critics generally thought that apartment house design got far too little study. In 1930 the Architectural Forum editorialized that typical apartment houses on the major avenues were "dry, monotonous and uninspiring."
In the early 19th century most windows had small panes for purely economic reasons. When the manufacture of large plates of glass became feasible at mid-century, one-over-one windows became common in brownstones, tenements and commercial buildings. There was a mild reaction to this in the 1880's, when Queen Anne-style buildings adopted widely varying window sizes, glazing and shapes. But one-over-one was still the standard until the turn of the century.
The Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts styles revived a certain amount of variety in window patterns, but the big shift was the Colonial revival, which brought back multipane windows to both private and apartment houses. Even today, an 1870's brownstone with six-over-six windows is a telltale sign that it was altered in the 1920's or later.
There were many apartment houses with multiple panes in the top and bottom sashes, but a common variant was multiple panes in the top and one in the bottom. With little else to go on, the modern observer presumes the upper multilight pane broke up the glare and the lower single pane provided a view. But to judge from historic interior photographs, the idea of "view" was not very important -- typical apartment windows are heavily draped, with additional glass curtains or blinds. The "picture window" as we know it today did not exist in the 20's.
Because of the influence of historic preservation, the prevailing wisdom now is that apartment house windows should be uniform; a building with a scattering of different windows seems like an esthetic affront, even if, like 110-118 Riverside Drive, it's not a landmark.
But this building's window alterations have been left mostly up to the tenants. There are all manner of window frames in seven different colors. In some cases the brick panels separating paired windows have been knocked out for picture windows. Any critic calling it lovely in its comic orneriness would be considered a subversive crank, but even the most orthodox preservationist should make an inspection trip, if only to confirm dearly held opinions.
A MASTER window plan passed in the mid-80's has been casually enforced. But now the board is serious about performance and appearance standards for new windows. "Uniformity is much more esthetically pleasing" says Ewen R. Gillies, co-chairman of the operations committee, who has been most involved in the project. But he also looks forward to the day when the building won't be wrangling with repairs to 15 to 20 different makes of windows and the time when all the windows are up to the same level of energy savings.
"We'll have control of the whole skin," Mr. Gillies says.
The co-op's standard requires any new windows to be the ubiquitous bronze in color, but they can be single pane or one-over-one, from selected contractors, at a cost of about $650-$850 each. About 100 to 200 of the modern replacement windows are so terrible that they will have to come out this fall, Mr. Gillies says, but all later replacements can remain until they begin to fail.
Although done in the name of uniformity, in fact the last bit of uniformity in the building will vanish: Another priority this year is to replace the remaining original wooden windows, about 1,600, to avoid continued painting and other costs. Is some sentimentalist claiming the right to keep the wooden windows?
"Not in this building they don't," says Mr. Gillies.

HEADLINE: Race and the American Workplace

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
THERE are nights Harold Thomas lies in bed, kept awake by the words that still scream through his head, words he heard for years over the paging system at the Miller Brewing Company plant in Fulton, N.Y.
A production supervisor in the packaging department, Mr. Thomas has no idea whose voice it was, calling him: "Harold, the . . . ape, Thomas." But by early 1991, he had grown so distraught that a psychiatrist advised him to take a leave. Upon his return almost a year later, a voice rang out over the paging system, "Welcome back, Harold, but you're still a nigger." 
 For almost a decade, through last year, many black and female employees at the plant in Fulton, a small industrial town north of Syracuse in central New York, say they were targets of racial epithets or sexual comments over the speaker system or were harassed by other means, such as messages written on restroom walls, obscene drawings and prominently placed items, like a noose, that spoke of overt hostility.
While these kinds of incidents are not necessarily characteristic of Miller plants, they are remarkably common in the American workplace -- and may even be on the rise. Efforts by companies to hire more minorities and women, often at the expense of white males, coupled with the wave of corporate downsizings that has further threatened job security, have led to a backlash against minority workers, Federal authorities and management experts say.
Since 1990, complaints of racial harassment filed through local and regional offices of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and state human rights agencies increased nearly 17 percent, to 6,038 filings last year. Among the recent cases is a class action suit against the Ford Motor Company charging racial discrimination and harassment.
"It's not just limited to blue-collar workers," said Mildred Saunders, a New York-based consultant on equal employment matters. "In academia, in government, among professionals, wherever people are different and fewer jobs are available because of the economy, these kinds of issues are commonplace."
One reason the problem persists is that companies often deny it exists or fail to eradicate it at its base levels, forcing victims to turn for action to the courts, as Mr. Thomas has. Lawrence Kunin, general counsel to the New York State Division of Human Rights, said that sometimes a company "has established a culture, without realizing that it's discriminatory."
 
The View From Milwaukee
 While perhaps extreme, the Miller case in Fulton provides a compelling study of how bigotry endures in the workplace, even after victims complain repeatedly and managers experienced in diversity are brought in to help.
At Miller's headquarters in Milwaukee, officials maintain that their efforts to catch the Fulton perpetrators were adequate, if unsuccessful. Michael Brophy, a Miller spokesman, said that through the years in question senior managers in Fulton had taken "corrective action" in the form of a tape monitoring system and surveillance by security personnel.
"Were we concerned? Of course," he said. "Do we believe the problem was rampant? Of course not. We're talking about a plant where there are 1,200 to 1,400 pages a day, about 550,000 a year, more than 5 million over 10 years. How many offensive pages are we talking about? Maybe 12 or 14." Largely for that reason, he said, the paging system, the principal means of abuse, was retained until last year.
A Miller lawyer in Milwaukee, Bert Butler, insisted Miller has always complied with state and Federal antidiscrimination laws. He said that over a 16-year period no "formal complaint" of racial harassment reached the office of the Fulton plant manager. He said Miller officials in Milwaukee would not have known about complaints from people like Mr. Thomas to their superiors or how the superiors handled them.
Mr. Thomas and others -- managers as well as union workers -- said complaints were largely ignored.
How much harassment might be considered too much? Speaking in general terms, Mr. Kunin said, "After 35 years of civil rights laws, I have to question a response of 'I didn't know,' or 'It happened at such a low level,' or 'It was too subtle.' I have to question even one statement over a loudspeaker."
Several employees have filed complaints against Miller for discrimination. Mr. Thomas and Waverly Faison, a former Miller employee who was laid off in 1984, presented enough evidence to the United States Attorney in Syracuse last year to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate whether Federal criminal civil rights laws had been violated. To prevail in a criminal action, a prosecutor must show that racial harassment included physical harm or a threat of physical harm.
In addition, Mr. Thomas and two other black ex-employees filed separate civil claims against Miller with the New York State Division of Human Rights, in which a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination occurred. Mr. Faison has challenged Miller in New York State Supreme Court under the same civil rights laws.
 
The Lure of Fulton
 A vast complex about 10 miles south of Lake Ontario, Miller's Fulton plant opened in 1975 and quickly became a magnet for college graduates of all races seeking management careers. In an economically depressed town of fewer than 13,000 residents, 98 percent of them white, it was an oasis of diversity.
Mr. Faison was a typical recruit, part of an initial work force of more than 2,000. Now 43, the former Marine with a degree in history and education from North Carolina Central University was hired in 1976 as a packaging supervisor. Within three years, he said, he became the first black at the plant to be promoted to middle management. As a packaging superintendent, he managed nearly 75 people, "about 90 percent of whom were Caucasian," he said. "That's when the trouble started."
Easily accessed through hundreds of telephones around the plant, the paging system became a vehicle for foul language and abusive comments. "Nigger," black employees say, was a common term.
At his supervisors' suggestion, Mr. Faison began a written log of derogatory remarks in September 1982, keeping it at a desk a floor above the packaging area. "It was a feeble attempt to do something," Mr. Faison said. In the first three months, at least two dozen racial or sexual references to him and other employees were logged.
"It was humiliating," Mr. Faison said. "They talked about my mother, my mother's sexual preferences, whatever they wanted. And the log shows only part of it. You couldn't always stop working to run up the stairs to write in the log."
The log was discontinued in 1983. Testifying in a 1984 sexual harassment case against Miller, Bruce Olm, a supervisor and custodian of the log, said the abusive messages on the paging system had ended by then. However, nearly a dozen current and former Miller employees -- black and white, management and union -- dispute that.
"What bothered me so much," said Michael Oldenburgh, a white manager who worked at the plant until 1984, "was that this was a company using its commercials to portray itself as the All-American company. But guess what? They failed miserably in Fulton."
Mr. Butler, the Miller lawyer, said the corporate office first became aware of a problem with the paging system in 1983, when Mr. Faison "said he had been subjected to two abusive pages." Mr. Butler said that plant officials attempted to learn the identify of the abusers, to no avail.
But Mr. Faison, who said his complaints were far more numerous, pointed out, "If that's all I complained about, why did the F.B.I. agree to look at the case?"
Meanwhile, other objectionable behavior persisted.
George Clarke, a black who retired as superintendent of maintenance in 1988, recalled several incidents. "Chicken bones kept appearing in my desk," he said. "They also erected a tombstone in the courtyard with a sign that said, 'George Clarke, rest in peace,' and there were chicken bones sprinkled over the grave. These people went to great lengths."
He said he informed his superiors of each incident, but never discovered who was responsible.
Cynthia Brewer, a black who resigned last September, has a claim against Miller in the state human rights division, charging that plant officials discriminated against her after she spoke to the F.B.I., in her role as head of security and safety manager, as part of its investigation of Mr. Faison's charges.
Mr. Faison, now the human resources director for the municipal bus company in Syracuse, said he once encountered a noose hanging from a gate and said that people periodically left racially offensive messages on his beeper number.
Black union workers say they suffered similar indignities. J.D. Smith, a 38-year-old machinist who has worked in the plant since 1976, said that in addition to harassment, black union workers were often assigned to "less responsible jobs" than whites. He said he complained to union representatives, Miller officials and state authorities. None, he said, took action.
Frank Carelli, business manager for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, local 2587, and a former Miller employee, said that "in an industrial complex that large, sure they have racial incidents. Nobody is immune to that and I truly believe that the Miller Brewery is no different than General Motors or anybody else. You just have to adjust and deal with it."
But a union representative (who, like Mr. Carelli, is white) who spoke on the condition of anonymity said black workers in the plant suffered "unmerciful and unrelenting" abuse and that "until recently," Miller officials "never dealt with it."
Jerry Church, manager of the plant for 10 years until his retirement in 1990, said the paging system caused "sporadic problems," but that he never heard any objectionable remarks himself. He also said "never was anything formally" brought to his attention. "But in hindsight," he added, "the company should have dealt with it."
Miller apparently recognized a need to address racial tension at the plant. To replace Mr. Church, it brought in David Green, who had spent 11 years at Miller's brewery in Albany, Ga. Mr. Green, who is white, said his success in harmonizing a racially mixed work force in Georgia earned him the transfer. (At Miller, neither Mr. Butler nor Mr. Brophy would discuss Mr. Green's selection. "That's personnel stuff," Mr. Brophy said. "If we discussed any aspect of it, we'd be in trouble.")
As Mr. Green recalled it: "When I got there, it was obvious what the problem was. Miller wasn't focusing on the harassment. They were chasing people rather than heading off what was at the heart of the issue, and it wasn't getting any better."
Mr. Green formed a multicultural steering committee and instituted "consulting pairs," in which one black employee discussed issues with one white, or one man with one woman. He also met with managers to stress the need for attitudinal change and got agreements from union officials and other plant leaders that any objectionable behavior would stop.
But incidents continued. In two, during the fall of 1990, security officers found messages in restrooms saying to "kill" black people.
Harold Thomas, now 43, was a graduate of Morris Brown College in Atlanta with a degree in biology and psychology when was hired by Miller in 1977. He was promoted a year later to production supervisor, a position he still holds.
He said he felt so threatened by the verbal abuse, vandalism (a tampered air valve on a front tire, a smashed patio window at home) and overall atmosphere at Miller that "sometimes I couldn't do my job effectively." Those feelings led to his medical leave of absence, beginning in February 1991, at partial pay.
Mr. Thomas said he never filed a formal complaint at the plant because he "had always been told to follow the chain of command. . . . I'm not a boisterous person. If I started shouting and jumping on tables, they would have thought I was out of control."
But in a sworn affidavit filed with his state case in June 1991, Mr. Thomas listed 21 instances in the seven months leading to his leave in which he was paged in the plant or on his beeper in an offensive context. He said he notified a superior each time.
The personnel administration manager for the plant at the time, Michael C. Sigona, who has since left the company, argued in response that the complaint should be dismissed because the brewery had "done everything it could be expected" to do to learn the identity of those responsible for the pages.
The offensive pages subsided when Mr. Thomas began his leave, according to Mr. Green, but resumed when Mr. Thomas returned 11 months later. Mr. Green decided to remove the paging system. A month later, he was asked to resign.
Mr. Green said that subordinates had complained to the corporate office, a view shared by several former Miller employees. Sam Crumpton, a black who is a retired Miller supervisor, said people in Milwaukee were told by his colleagues that Mr. Green was engaged in "white-male bashing." Mr. Butler and Mr. Brophy again declined to discuss any aspect of Mr. Green's employment.
By late last year, Mr. Thomas began wondering if these episodes had violated his civil rights. His lawyer recommended he meet Anita Roberts, whose client, Mr. Faison, was proceeding along the same path. Mrs. Roberts suggested the two combine efforts, in taking their case before the United States Attorney in Syracuse.
 
Enter the F.B.I.
 The F.B.I. "largely substantiated" some of the allegations, according to a letter to Miller's lawyers in Syracuse from Paula Ryan Conan, an Assistant United States Attorney. But without evidence to identify the perpetrators, she wrote, neither her office nor the Justice Department could take any action against Miller.
But she chastised the company for what "may be a deep-rooted problem at the plant" and for the "appearance of endorsement-by-inaction" that allowed the alleged acts to continue.
Unsatisfied, Mr. Faison presented the F.B.I. a list of additional witnesses, some of whom, he said, "have direct knowledge" of who was responsible for various of the incidents. Mrs. Roberts said that the F.B.I. is still interviewing witnesses.
Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, reports to work each day. "I still look over my shoulder," he said. "They have threatened my life. But I'm not leaving. If I walk out, I'm gone, and Miller will never address the issue."

 
 
THE CASE AGAINST FORD

CLARENCE A. HOLCOMB, a 44-year-old manager for the Ford Motor Company in St. Louis, claims he has suffered racial discrimination and harassment as a Ford employee since 1977. He says he was passed over for promotions and pay increases, made the butt of racial slurs, and, after he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, subjected to false claims of bad performance, threatening his employment.
Mr. Holcomb's charges are included in a class action suit filed earlier this month against Ford in Federal district court for Minnesota. He is one of 12 plaintiffs -- black managers at Ford facilities around the country -- with at least one common complaint: that they suffered as a result of unfair performance evaluations.
Judith Muhlberg, a Ford spokeswoman, said the company has a "very well-developed and disciplined program for considering the performance of all employees," but charges of discrimination of this kind are hardly unusual in America. Last year, the E.E.O.C. compiled 125,217 complaints of racially motivated discrimination or harassment nationwide, up 8.5 percent from 1991.
"We probably get 200 queries a week," said Paul C. Sprenger, whose Minneapolis firm, Sprenger & Lang, specializes in employment litigation. The growing number of complaints is a result, he added, of relaxed labor-law enforcement under the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
In the case against Ford, the plaintiffs charge that the company has "engaged in a general practice of discriminating against black persons and denying them equal opportunities." Ford is also charged with failing to hire and recruit blacks on an equal basis with whites.
This, Mr. Sprenger said, is a "second generation" suit. The first generation meant getting minorities hired. "Now," he said, "we have to make sure they are treated fairly."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Budget Plan, or What's Left of It, Is Off and Running 

"We are putting our economic house in order," President Clinton said, pointing proudly to the progress of "his" budget plan. But it's no longer his plan, of course. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee did some wrenching fine-tuning before agreeing to a compromise they could all live with -- like scrapping a broad fuel tax for a more modest tax on transportation fuel, and making deep Medicare cuts. Still, the committee did manage to agree on a bill -- which the chairman, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, called "the most progressive change in taxes since World War II" -- and that gets the process through a tight bottleneck. So suddenly it seems very possible that a good part of Mr. Clinton's vision will become law later this summer. As for the rest, the horse-trading still angers the President. "We can't simply balance the budget," he said, "on the backs of the old, the sick," and the poor.
 
Space Trek, the Next Generation
 
For the moment, the space station is not dead -- just a little smaller. President Clinton, saying we "cannot retreat from our obligation" to the future, asked Congress for a $10.5 billion model, with spending spread over five years. In keeping with what has quickly become the Age of Compromise, that's at least $1.5 billion more than Mr. Clinton had sought, but a lot less than the $17.6 billion the original would have cost taxpayers. To make more drastic cuts could have got Mr. Clinton into a global mess, since Canada, Japan and Europe are already big investors. But that's not to say the station will survive; many lawmakers have no home-district suppliers to protect and thus no reason to vote for it.
 
So Where Are the New Houses?
 
Everything looked good for home building. Sales boomed in early spring, construction jobs were up, mortgage rates were at 20-year lows, lumber prices had eased. And if housing was strong, it's a good bet the broader economy would be, too. But when the numbers on May housing starts came in last week, they showed a disappointing 2.4 percent rise -- so housing is likely to do little to help the economy this quarter.
 
Mortgage rates should stay low for a while, as there was more evidence that earlier rumblings of inflation were fading. Consumer prices showed only an 0.1 percent rise for May, reinforcing the recent message that producer prices were flat.
 
I.B.M., Springboard to the Sky
 
Many corporate jobs are rungs in a ladder, orderly steps upward. But where do you go after running I.B.M.? For John F. Akers, the answer was this: something "different from what I've done in the past." He's certainly found that. Last week Mr. Akers, who left I.B.M. this spring, joined forces with Frank Lorenzo, former head of Texas Air, in his venture to run a low-cost East Coast airline. "This is about as different as I can imagine," Mr. Akers said. But "it's a lot easier to start with a clean sheet of paper" than to change an established organization. And this is not, he said, alien territory -- he did spend four years as a Navy pilot. Mr. Akers will own 5 percent of the new carrier and will do whatever Mr. Lorenzo thinks "could be useful."
 
Silent Summer Runways
 
This may not be the time to get into the airline business. Vacationers, spoiled by fare wars past, are balking at this summer's higher fares, and businesses, nibbling costs right and left, are trimming travel budgets. What this is adding up to, American Airlines said last week, is disappointing earnings. Investors seemed primed for such tidings: shares in AMR, its parent company, fell sharply, and other airline stocks quickly followed.
 
Surgery at Empire Blue Cross
 
Empire Blue Cross is probably wishing it had better health coverage for itself; it's displaying more and more symptoms of a pretty nasty illness. Its chairman was forced out recently, after directors learned that he had kept crucial facts from them. Now it turns out that data the insurer sent to New York State regulators and to legislators had only a passing link to the truth. Empire must get state approval to raise rates for small groups and individuals, so it's been tinkering with the numbers to make its losses in that area look bigger -- thus bolstering its case for rate rises. It also used the false data in a push to change insurance laws. Last week the correct numbers surfaced -- and the company came clean. It suspended its top financial officer and rescinded bonuses just granted to 68 executives.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
This Is Clear: It Was No Genie
 
No surprises, please. When people shell out extra pennies for a familiar brand, they're buying the cozy glow of absolute predictability. For the products' makers, this is normally fine: loyalty equals sales. But let a crack appear, and a mass market becomes a mass public-relations nightmare. For Pepsi last week, it was a tiny crack indeed -- scattered reports (many proven false) of odd objects in soda cans. But it was enough, Pepsi feared, to make shoppers hesitate as they reached for the Pepsi shelf -- and (Horrors!) go for the Coke instead. So Pepsi pulled out all stops to reassure the soda public, with its chief executive, Craig Weatherup, turning up so often -- on late news, early news, on "Nightline" and "Larry King Live" -- that he seemed to be running for President.
 
Kodak Starts Its Shrinking Act
 
Yes, Eastman Kodak can change -- but at its own pace, thank you. Investors have urged Kodak to cut its debt -- and cheered the arrival this year of an aggressive finance officer, Christopher Steffen. But when Mr. Steffen made a quick exit, pressure mounted on Kodak's more deliberative chairman, Kay R. Whitmore -- and the stock slid back into the pre-Steffen dumps. Mr. Whitmore vowed to sell a big piece of the company, and last week he did so, saying Kodak would spin off its chemical business to shareholders. This is a big belt-tightening: Eastman Chemical will be the nation's No. 10 chemical company. And the stock ended the week at $53.25, up from $47.25 at Mr. Steffen's departure.
 
Once Sculley Saw Greenwich . . .
 
John Sculley already seemed to be looking beyond Apple Computer. He'd bought a house in Greenwich, Conn. -- on the coast his family prefers. He'd been mentioned for some political role. Some described him as detached from the daily Apple -- one analyst referred to "Sculley's view from 10,000 feet rather than down and dirty." And Apple seemed to be looking beyond him, too. With PC profits pinched and the stock slumping, the board was said to be pressuring him to step aside. So it was no shock last week when Mr. Sculley, 54, who came to Apple 10 years ago, handed the chief executive's title to Michael Spindler, now president. This frees Mr. Sculley, still chairman, to think bigger thoughts -- and to spend more time in the East.
 
A Warehouse-Sized Merger
 
The big are getting bigger. The nation's No. 2 and No. 3 warehouse clubs, Price and Costco, joined forces last week, saying they planned to merge in a $2 billion-plus stock swap. With $16 billion in annual sales, Price/Costco will vault past Sam's Club to head the field of mammoth discount retailers. Maybe there's some cosmic cycle here. Stores grow ever bigger, mergers create huge companies to run the huge stores, and pretty soon they put a roof over the whole country and create a single, giant store. Then, in some forgotten corner, hundreds of miles from the checkout counter, a mom-and-pop grocery store is born. And it all starts again.
 
Litton's Guns, Litton's Butter
 
The post-military landscape is taking shape. Companies are facing the fact that guns are giving way to butter, and one has decided that the side that's buttered must be given its due. Last week Litton Industries said it would split in two, with one company focusing on its commercial businesses and the other on the declining weapons market. The commercial business -- which includes oil-field services -- is growing fast and now accounts for 40 percent of revenues, up from 15 percent six years ago. The stock market approved heartily, as Litton shares soared $8.125, to $65.125.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
G.M. Doesn't Frighten Lopez
 
Ignacio Lopez made his own declaration of independence last week. "We are a free continent," he said, when asked if any threats by General Motors would stop his new employer, Volkswagen, from building a plant in Spain. The deciding factor is what "is best for our customers," he insisted. He stopped short of saying the plant would be built, saying negotiations were under way, but he did not seem worried by G.M.'s warning that it would sue if it appeared that a plant was based on ideas Mr. Lopez developed in Detroit. A radically low-cost plant has been dear to Mr. Lopez since his days as G.M.'s shining star, and he does not plan to be sidetracked now.
 
Trade Gap Refuses to Shrink
 
The April trade deficit was supposed to shrink after a huge jump in March to a four-year high. But instead it rose even more, as the imbalance with Japan hit a five-year high. That will certainly give President Clinton something to talk about -- if he feels like taking on this touchy topic -- when he goes to Tokyo in a few weeks for an economic summit meeting. But perhaps Americans seeking culprits should look to their own gas tanks: the United States bought $3.7 billion worth of imported oil in April, up from $3.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Technology;
Through TV-Tinted Glasses

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND

 BODY:
STROLLING through a shopping center in Phoenix one recent Friday evening, Roberta Trengrove attracted quite a few stares with her oversized, shiny black wraparound visor. She barely noticed.
"Oh look," she said to no one in particular. "It's Miss Finland. Wow, look at that red dress." For an instant, Mrs. Trengrove forgot that only she could see the televised beauty pageant. 
 Pulling off the visor, a test model of a new product called Virtual Vision Sport, she laughed. "It's hard to remember that you're the only one watching," she said. "It could be totally antisocial. It really tugs at your eye."
Watching television while cruising the mall, sitting on a bus or basking in the stadium bleachers has been possible for years with miniature battery-operated sets. But now a start-up company near Seattle, using technology first developed for Air Force flight simulators, is selling a television system fit into a pair of tinted glasses.
Slip them on, hit the switch and a broadcast appears before your eyes. In a technique akin to reading with bifocal glasses, you can focus on the screen, or look through the glasses to see the world around you.
Introduced in May, the Virtual Vision system is currently available in New York, Miami, Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle and through the Sharper Image catalogue. By August, Virtual Vision Inc., of Redmond, Wash., plans to have the product in stores across the country.
At $900, it's hardly an impulse buy. But sociologists take note: Virtual Vision will let consumers, who in the United States already have their television sets on an average of 7 hours a day, watch television virtually anywhere at any time.
There may be limits, of course. Robert Sights, who runs an independent film production company, was impressed when he tried Virtual Vision recently. But he wasn't sure the glasses would be useful in Los Angeles, where he lives.
"In other places, people read the newspaper or get ready for work on the subway," he said. "But in L.A. we do that while driving. I can just see getting arrested for driving while watching TV"
Mr. Sights also balked at the gadget's price. "But if the price gets to be $395," he allowed, "I might buy one."
Virtual Vision uses a technology the company calls virtual imaging, meaning it creates pictures that seem to float in space, appearing about the size of an ordinary television screen about a dozen feet away.
The actual image is produced by a postage-stamp sized liquid crystal display imbedded in the bridge of the glasses and reflected into a wearer's field of vision with a mirror.
The display is on only one side of the glasses, so it projects into the wearer's dominant eye -- something that the salesperson can help the buyer easily determine before selecting a "right-eyed" or "left-eyed" version. Because the system exploits the natural tendency for the dominant eye to share images with the weaker one, the picture seems to be visible to both eyes -- without undue strain.
The broadcast is picked up by the antenna on a 3-pound belt-pack tuner and sent to the screen through a thin electrical cable. The sound is heard through earphones attached to the visor's frame, and the whole apparatus is powered by a rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery on the belt pack. Unlike virtual reality, the futuristic technology that seems to immerse a viewer in a completely artificial world by blocking out all other sights and sounds, the Virtual Vision picture is restricted to the bottom of the wearer's vision field.
When industry experts look at Virtual Vision, they see applications beyond television, such as using the technology to replace computer screens in the workplace.
"It is the future of display," said George Gilder, an economist who frequently writes about telecommunications and is author of the book "Life After Television." "It gets rid of the cathode ray tube, the scanning display with tremendously high wattage. All the residual mechanics of computers are overcome."
But for now, Virtual Vision is purely an entertainment device. The system can be plugged into a cable-ready VCR, allowing the wearer to watch either cable programming or videotapes, although the obvious lack of mobility would seem to defeat the whole point of the product unless the user is toting a portable VCR.
Nevertheless, the company plans to introduce a wireless adaptor by this fall, which would allow a viewer to watch cable or videos in another room, while washing the dishes, say.
And the Virtual Vision visor can be used in place of the viewfinder on any video camcorder, by plugging the cable into the camera. An amateur cameraman can tape a child's birthday party, for example, by watching the whole scene on the glasses' screen while aiming his camera anywhere, even over his shoulder.
The system does have its drawbacks, however. The reception isn't perfect, because the TV set relies on a small antenna, and the small liquid-crystal display screen tends to produce a grainy image. And like any television, the picture is worst outdoors where bright light makes the image difficult to see.
THAT'S unfortunate for people who want to watch television at the beach -- despite the company's ads, which depict a televised football game seen clearly against the backdrop of a tropical shore.
But many people who have tried the device seem willing to look beyond its limitations. "The resolution was good, it was usable resolution," said Nolan Murdock, research and development project director for Panavision, the maker of movie cameras for films.
"A lot of directors rely on video now to get an immediate replay of what they're filming," Mr. Murdock said. "I could see them wearing these glasses to see the picture as it's being filmed." And yet, as with many who have tried the glasses, Mr. Murdock wondered whether looking back and forth between the image and the real world a lot would strain the eyes.
Not to worry, says Dr. Barbara Arnold, an ophthalmologist and professor at the University of California at Davis, who has no ties to the company. "I wouldn't anticipate any problem whatsoever."
The focusing muscles in eyes of people over 45 years old might tire sooner than in younger people using Virtual Vision, Dr. Arnold said, but that would be about the extent of the danger. "Its like aerobics," she said. "You use a muscle, go home, rest up and are fine."
The television visor is the first product of Virtual Vision Inc., a privately held company that was formed in early 1992 and now has about 60 employees.
THE company is tight-lipped about sales so far of the visor, which is based on military research done by Tom Furness, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the university's Human Interface Technology Lab.
Professor Furness, who in addition to helping to develop flight simulators and heads-up display helmets that let airplane pilots see gauges and flight data without having to look down at the instrument panel, holds the patents to the Virtual Vision technology, which he licensed to the company.
Rusty Bennett, Virtual Vision's vice president of sales, said that the product incorporates some of Professor Furness's earlier research. "We use parts of heads-up technology from fighter planes," he said, "including the parts that allow you to see an image that is not actually there."
The company is not entirely alone in developing glasses-style viewers. The Sony Corporation has been working on a headset called Visotron for watching videos, and a British inventor holds a patent for a television visor he calls Goggle Vox. But both devices block a wearer's vision. neither one is yet being manufactured.
"I look at Virtual Vision and devices like it towards their future applications," said Andrew Kessler, an interactive media analyst with Unterberg Harris, a financial firm in New York.
"It will take software and titles developed specifically for that device, but I don't think it's five to 10 years away," Mr. Kessler said. "I think its probably two years away."
Already, Virtual Vision executives are exploring new avenues for their product. The company says, for example, that it is talking with physicians about applying the technology to microsurgery. Rather than stopping to check the surgery's progress on a video monitor, as doctors do now, surgeons could glance down at the glasses' monitor as they operate.
THE company also hopes it may be able to capitalize on the fact that movie theaters, in order to comply with Federal regulations for the handicapped, will soon have to supply subtitles for deaf customers. Virtual Vision proposes a solution: let those customers rent the video visors in the lobby and the subtitles could be electronically transmitted to only those whose need to read them.
Airlines could be another possibility, renting Virtual Vision glasses instead of headphones. Passengers would be able to watch the movie without worrying that someone in the next row was blocking the screen.
And the company says it plans to create glasses that plug in to laptop computers, so that a passenger could work on his computer without the bored person in the adjacent seat reading the screen over his shoulder.
Fine. But what about the here and now, which in the case of Virtual Vision seems to be plain old TV. Do couch potatoes and their tater tots really need to do their viewing on the move?
Virtual Vision executives say the glasses, like VCR's and portable audio cassette players, simply offer people more of the flexibility they want in their lives.
"I don't see this changing most people into TV addicts if they weren't already," said Mr. Bennett, the Virtual Vision vice president. "People do sit inside and watch TV when they know they should be doing something else," he said. "Maybe with this product they'll do both. So maybe that will be an improvement."
 
MORE THAT MEETS THE EYE
 Someday, watching TV on Virtual Vision may seem as quaint as viewing nature scenes on great-grandmother's stereoscope.
Researchers at the University of Washington, where Virtual Vision technology was born, believe they may have found a way to step sprightly into whole virtual worlds. Their hope is to do away with the cumbersome headsets and bulky cables currently required for experiencing 3-D, computer-generated virtual reality.
At the university's Human Interface Technology Lab in Seattle, a team of engineers led by Joel Kollin have developed a technique that dispenses with miniature television screens or liquid crystal display panels.
Instead, Mr. Kollin's group is at work on a system that projects 3-D images directly onto the retinas of a person's eyeballs. The technology is meant to offer a realistically clear, depth-of-field view into lifelike worlds that exist only as computer data.
Although the Virtual Retina Display, as it is called, is still a workbench model several feet long, the researchers hope within a few years to have developed a full-color, high-resolution, panoramic version that would be small and lightweight enough to mount onto a pair of eyeglasses and would cost only a few hundred dollars. The images might be piped in through fiber-optic strands attached to a portable computer.
The current benchtop model uses a series of laser scanners, lenses and mirrors to project a video signal onto the retina that the brain perceives as a 3-D image. Though the field of vision currently is fairly narrow, Mr. Kollin says the goal is a wide field of view approaching 140 degrees for each eye.
The Virtual Retina Display is bright enoughthat Mr. Kollin is confident that computer-generated images could someday be superimposed on the real world -- allowing such trompe l'oeil effects as placing a television character right in the viewer's living room.
Anyone who watched such virtual-reality capabilities depicted on the recent television mini-series "Wild Palms," can begin to image the possibilities . . . PATRICK COTTER

HEADLINE: Hospitals Begin Streamlining For a New World in Health Care

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The Genesys Health System plans to close its four hospitals in Genesee County, Mich., and replace them with a single streamlined hospital with 439 patient beds, half as many as the old hospitals. Genesys, based in Flint, is shrinking to get ready for the new world of managed competition in health care under which hospitals and doctors may have to bid against one another for insured groups of patients. And it is struggling to make health care more affordable so that the county's dominant employer, the General Motors Corporation, will not close any additional local factories, further reducing the hospital's potential pool of patients.
Under an avalanche of economic and political pressures, hospitals nationwide are reinventing themselves. In addition to cutting costs and delivering care more efficiently, they are providing services unheard of in the past like making house calls and competing with insurers in processing claims. 
 At stake is their survival. As cost-conscious employers and insurance companies pushed for shorter hospital stays, occupancy in the nation's hospitals dropped to 66 percent by 1991 from 76 percent a decade earlier, according to the American Hospital Association's latest survey. Since 1980, about 1,000 hospitals have closed or merged as a result.
In the latest large merger, Galen Health Care agreed earlier this month to a $4.1 billion deal to merge its 73 hospitals with the Columbia Hospital Corporation, based in Fort Worth, which has 26 hospitals. After previous acquisitions, Columbia closed a number of hospitals in cities where it wound up with more than one. Galen, based in Louisville, Ky., was created in March to take over Humana's for-profit hospitals.
And industry executives say hundreds more hospitals will disappear in the next few years because of continuing pressure from big payers and now, from the Government. The shrinkage will accelerate, hospital executives say, if the Clinton Administration succeeds in putting Government limits on health-care spending.
"The hospitals' worry beads are well worn," said Gary Ahlquist, a managing vice president at Booz-Allen Health Care Inc., a consulting firm.
According to Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a trade association in Washington, "In a four-hospital town, No. 4 is gone unless it can change." He said the survivors will also be smaller because increasingly patients are seeking less expensive care in doctor's offices and walk-in clinics.
So how are hospitals preparing for the new world? Perhaps the most sweeping change is that a growing number of them are allying with networks of primary-care physicians, giving these family practitioners, internists and pediatricians greater influence in the health maintenance organizations and other medical networks that predominate under managed care.
Formerly these doctors had taken a back seat to surgeons and specialists in most cities. But now, they are typically deciding which hospital to use for routine treatments. And their authorization is often required before a patient consults a specialist.
As a result, MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn, Ill., a blue-collar suburb of Chicago, actively woos family physicians to help keep its 427 beds occupied. MacNeal will pay the doctors a salary or, if they prefer, provide an office and assistants in a neighborhood where doctors are scarce, said Luke McGuinness, MacNeal's president.
Many doctors look forward to warmer ties with hospitals, instead of the "sometimes hostile relations" of the past, said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a family physician in Richmond, Tex., a small city 35 miles from Houston. Doctors and hospitals will probably "share much more closely in the risks and benefits," she said.
Insurance companies also see the changes. "Hospitals used to be the center of the universe," said David Willis, who is in charge of policy and programs for more than 200 physician and hospital networks for the Aetna Life and Casualty Company. "In the new world, we start with the physicians and talk to them about their hospitals."
Hospital profits (or surpluses in nonprofit hospitals) have been rising, on average, since 1988, as managements have tightened up, introduced operating efficiencies and even begun to charge for things that were not previously separate charges. Operating profits jumped 28 percent, on average, at 167 large hospital groups surveyed by Modern Healthcare, a weekly trade magazine.
And a few hospitals with international reputations, including several in New York City, are still spending heavily for new buildings and equipment that is often duplicated at other institutions just a few blocks away.
But the golden era may end for many hospitals. Many are already being forced by employers and insurers to give up the lucrative practice of submitting jumbo bills listing hundreds of difficult-to-monitor services. Now, rather than charging for each pill, injection and service, "well over 80 percent of hospitals" are paid either a fixed daily fee or a preset amount for each illness treated, Mr. Willis of Aetna said.
THIS cuts down on overhead and helps reduce the number of errors. At least 92 percent of hospital bills are riddled with errors, said Bob Dubester, a vice president of American Claims Evaluation Inc., based in Jericho, L.I., which audits large hospital bills for employers.
"An American hospital bill is a joke," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist.
Also forcing medical efficiencies is the increasing practice of health maintenance organizations, including some owned by hospitals, to pay a uniform annual or monthly sum, or capitation, for each H.M.O. member.
"Capitation is the coming thing," said Dick Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association. He predicted 80 percent of health coverage would be financed by per capita payments by the year 2000, in contrast to only 10 percent now.
At the Henry Ford Health System, an eight-hospital group in Detroit that is often cited as a model of things to come, about 45 percent of the patients are under capitation. "Capitation is the single most important factor in changing the system," said Gail L. Warden, president of the group, which also has several H.M.O.'s, with 1,000 salaried physicians. With capitation, he said, doctors and hospitals have a financial interest in avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures.
"WE don't consider ourselves as being in the hospital business," Mr. Warden said. "We view hospitals as a cost center, not a revenue center as in the past."
The system seems to have curtailed costs at Henry Ford. Mr. Warden said that overall costs had risen 7.7 percent annually in recent years, compared with 10.5 percent nationally.
Per capita payments offer strong incentives to keep all but the sickest people out of hospitals. When hospitalization is necessary, low-cost community hospitals are used increasingly for routine cases like appendicitis and many children's diseases, instead of leading teaching hospitals.
The prestigious teaching hospitals may have a hard time maintaining their expensive mix of teaching, specialized medicine and research as the drive to cut costs intensifies, said Dr. David Blumenthal, head of health policy research at Massachusetts General Hospital, a Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate in Boston. The teaching hospitals will have fewer beds and fewer residents in clinical specialties, he added.
At the same time, they will develop a greater commitment to the community around them, typically in the inner city, Dr. Blumenthal said. "We will be much more involved with training people to be community-based practitioners," he said. "There will be researchers who study and define primary care." That field has been neglected, he said, because it "was not fashionable or technology intensive or profitable for drug companies to support."
In another change from past practice, because patients are being quickly discharged from hospitals -- on average staying fewer than eight days -- many hospitals are providing follow-up care in the patient's home or a nursing home, which costs less than keeping them in the hospital.
"The winning hospitals are transforming themselves into integrated delivery systems," said David Rey, a managing partner in San Francisco with the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. "They can offer a complete package of services at a capitated rate."
Some hospital groups may end up bypassing the insurance companies and dealing directly with employers and other groups. "The typical insurer go-between role has been lessened," said Bernie Ferrari, a partner who heads health care consulting at McKinsey & Company.
Jack McNamara, president of Sentara Health System in Norfolk, Va., vehemently agrees. "Folks like Cigna and Aetna and Blue Cross really add no value for the purchaser of health care," he contended. Sentara, which has hospitals, H.M.O.'s and nursing homes, is learning to perform insurer services -- actuarial science, claims processing, marketing and member services -- so that it can eventually deal directly with large purchasers of health care, Mr. McNamara said.
It is too early to know whether the Clinton Administration's proposed changes in the health-care system will allow room for companies like Sentara to short-circuit the insurance industry's role.
Genesys in Flint also includes home-care service, a nursing home and hospice care, so patients are placed in the most appropriate -- often the least expensive -- setting, said Young Suh, Genesys's president. The new hospital will be "so efficient that G.M. can really benefit," Mr. Suh said. "We want to assist G.M. by saving money, so they will have a reason to stay in Genesee County."

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
Peace, Love And Chompers

BYLINE: By Bob Morris

 BODY:
THE roster of superwaifs, vegetarian grunge actors and musicians in Birkenstocks and beads continues to grow like late-summer squash in the garden of some California commune. That's why the New York Shakespeare Festival's black-tie fund-raising event under a tent at Tavern on the Green on Wednesday, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the tribal love musical "Hair," carried more cultural weight than it would have two years ago.
It was nice, a relief even, that some of the performers singing about the Age of Aquarius, peace, love, harmony and understanding -- they included Kevin Kline, Ben Vereen and Betty Buckley -- were actually old enough to have lived through the hippie era. And if the event was yet another revival in a season of revivalism, at least it was inspired by a breakthrough moment of political and spiritual intention in musical-theater history. 
 "It was a time of caring for one another," said Mr. Vereen, who was in the original cast of "Hair." He sang "I Got Life" wearing kente cloth over his black tie.
George C. Wolfe, the new producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, who grew up in the segregated town of Frankfort, Ky., said: "I had an Afro and a pair of jeans with patches all over them. The patch on my butt said, 'Kiss me, I'm black.' You couldn't live through a year like 1968 and not feel the dynamics of it. Everything you wore was an expression of defiance. When you're 13 or 14, that's all you have. You can't control the universe, but you can control what you look like."
As happens at a society party in a society on image overload, things got a little confusing. There was the designer Randolph Duke, for instance, who remarked that the soft recycled look now gripping New York and Los Angeles would be in for the rest of the decade. "It takes the rest of America a long time to catch up," he said. There was Gabe Doppelt, the editor in chief of Mademoiselle magazine, who wore a peasant-style hippie dress and said she had never even seen "Hair" but was considering renting the movie this weekend in the Hamptons. And there were the gift bags stuffed with the June issue of Allure magazine (a sponsor of the party), which featured an article called "A User's Guide to Bell-Bottoms."
And then, alas, there were two young women in oversized white T-shirts, red spandex bicycle shorts and air-pumped running shoes. They had slipped away from the crowds at the Corporate Challenge that had brought 10,000 runners into the park that evening. The two women stood in the tent holding the drinks they'd sweet-talked from the bartender and ogled the 600 bold-faced names who had paid at least $500 to support the festival and revel, momentarily, in an era when tribal culture didn't suggest gatherings around a Stairmaster or at a finish line.
 
Too Multicultural to be True
 Many ethnomusicologists, sociologists, urban anthropologists, community organizers and multiculturalists would like to make Don Byron into some kind of a politically meaningful, bridge-building symbol. But he doesn't want to be a symbol. All the 34-year-old, classically trained musician wants to do is to keep developing his music.
Of course, you can't blame people for getting a little politically expectant when they first hear him play. There's something so ripe about a young black jazz clarinetist who grew up in the Bronx and who is so deeply into klezmer music (he refers to it as Jewish hip-hop) that he's recorded an entire album of it. "It's the kind of story a lot of cats can sell," Mr. Byron said with his downbeat cool between sets at the Village Vanguard on a recent Thursday.
"You're so full of humor and surprises," a fan told Mr. Byron, whose dreadlocks were hanging down over his wire-rimmed glasses.
"I work on it," he said.
Mr. Byron's lavish repertory also includes ragtime and postmodern experimental music. One night he can be found at the Knitting Factory playing songs from his klezmer album, "Don Byron Plays the Music of Mickey Katz," with Joel Grey singing solo (Mickey Katz, the clarinetist and klezmer band leader was Mr. Grey's father). On another night he can be found on the "Tonight" show playing hypnotically delicate jazz compositions from his album "Tuskegee Experiments." Once in a while, when he's in town from his home in Boston, he can also be found playing the recorder in the birdhouses of the Bronx zoo. "Stravinsky liked birdy things and Messiaen actually transcribed bird calls and wrote them down," he said.
Mostly, he tries to keep his music and politics in separate cages. Not long after the Crown Heights disturbances in August of 1991, for example, Mr. Byron was asked to give a concert in Brooklyn. He refused. "I'm not going to be an instrument to placate people," he said while cleaning his clarinet with a rag. "If people want to talk about economic issues and access and school boards and community centers, I'm down with that. But if it's just a matter of my getting up there to get people to chill out, I don't think so. I want people to talk about what's bugging them, not to shut up."
Mr. Byron, who is to perform at Central Park's Summerstage on July 4, has been downwind of some pretty strange comments over the years. Once someone came up to him and told him that it was nice to see a black person making money from Jewish music after seeing so many Jewish people making money from black music. At another gig, someone asked him if he was a falafel.
"He meant a Falasha, which is an Ethiopian Jew," Mr. Bryon said. "But I didn't say anything."
 
Scenes From a Screeningsaurus
 New York is in a Jurassic state of mind. The city is in the monstrous and all-consuming jaws of a juvenile action movie deemed by many parents to be too frightening for their children. On Tuesday, at a showing of "Jurassic Park" at the Worldwide Cinemas on Eighth Avenue, Christine and Austin Hearst were sitting with their friends Courtney and Bob Arnott and the two couples' 5-year-old children.
Megan Hearst and Bobby Arnott Jr. were squirming, switching from one parent's lap to the other's with each threatening thud of each approaching dinosaur footstep. Right before each of the scariest scenes, Austin Hearst, who had prescreened the film for the sake of the children, would push firmly downward on their heads, and they'd sink below the seats. That way, they could only hear the movie and the screams of the adults.
Afterward, in the Rotunda of the Museum of Natural History, at the postshow supper party (to benefit the museum and Ronald McDonald House), Susan Crile, a girl who likes to say she is 8 but is still only 7, was sitting between her parents beneath a massive cast of a barosaurus skeleton. "Wasn't it too scary for you?" her father, George Crile, a "60 Minutes" producer, asked her.
"No," she said, as she fingered her "Raptor Attack" coloring book and "Jurassic Park" souvenir lunchbox.
Like most children, she had already seen so many movies that a few animatronic reptiles alive with teeth as large as fists eating people alive just didn't faze her.
"The movies that really disturb her are the ones in which kids are abandoned or badly treated," said her mother, Susan Lyne, the editor of Premiere magazine. "Also, the good things about this movie is that there aren't any dinosaurs, so there's not going to be any dinosaur under the bed at night. 'Jaws' was terrifying because you had to go back into the ocean. For her, a scary movie like this one is just an emotional release."

HEADLINE: RUNWAYS;
Turns of Fashion's Wheel

BYLINE: By Suzy Menkes; Suzy Menkes is fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
THE store is so crowded that customers fight to hand over their money. The atrium is a seething, swirling mass of humanity clutching shopping totes. Women with glossy hair and sleek suits rub padded shoulders at the beauty counter. Outside on the sidewalk, yuppie couples juggle attache cases and ice cream.
A shopping mall in America? A rerun of a 1980's movie? An ad man's fantasy? No. Just an ordinary shopping day in Shanghai. 
 The People's Republic of China is where shopping is still happening. Where a passion for fashion has only just been ignited. It is farewell to Mao suits and welcome to power suits. It is also the place to see the postwar cycle of dress and excess starting over.
The Western world is mostly bored with fashion, its consumers faced with bursting closets and its designers determined to tear up -- literally or metaphorically -- the established wardrobe. By contrast, China represents fashion's glad, confident dawning.
In Shanghai, in the peacock parade in front of the Garden Hotel, in the old French quarter of the city, 22-year-old Li Chiu is wearing a passable imitation of a Chanel blouse in cream silk, black pants and gold jewelry that is a hot seller in the stores. Her companion, describing himself as a "salary man," meaning office worker, is playing Michael Douglas in "Wall Street": double-breasted pearl-gray suit, custom-made shirt and flashy gilded watch. Only his sturdy bicycle is not in keeping with the image.
"Everybody in Shanghai likes fashion because you can choose the clothes you wear," said Ms. Li, who is a member of the last generation brought up in the Mao suit, the severe uniform that faded from the urban scene a decade ago.
The shock of Shanghai is overwhelming for those who still think of China as drab and monolithic. On Nanjing Lu, the main shopping thoroughfare, and on Huaihai Lu, women hit the streets in pastel silk suits and matching pumps. The shops sell bright, colorful mass-produced clothes that are made in China and rarely cost more than $60 for an outfit. The First Department Store in Shanghai, with a thronged bridge that spans the street, had a turnover of about $237 million in 1992 and a record 300,000 shoppers during the Chinese New Year period in January.
Beijing is a fashion notch behind Shanghai. Typically, the department stores are cheap and cheerless and look like pictures of stores in postwar Europe. An appetite for clothes is filled by substantial stock without any fancy presentation. But capitalist fortunes are already being made, and with new money comes status dressing. The Palace Hotel in Beijing has a mall with glittering fountains and stores for Louis Vuitton and Ermenegildo Zegna.
So great is the urge to dress for success that in May, the Hong Kong luxury-goods entrepreneur Dickson Poon opened a store to sell women's suits that had Charles Jourdan labels sewn on the sleeves. He is also selling fancy watches, the most overt signs of success. In Guangzhou, tailors make shirts with the left sleeves a little more than an inch shorter than the right ones, the better to show off your Rolex, fake or real.
Why the label craze in China?
"Luxury products offer an individual identity," Mr. Poon said, adding that a sudden increase in disposable income has made people look for ways of defining their success and has inevitably led them to be status conscious.
Mary Wong, the assistant director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in Hong Kong and an expert on the Chinese market, said that in 10 years the consumer cycle had gone from bicycle, watch and sewing machine, through refrigerator, washing machine and television, to the current craze for fashion.
"The consumer market is pretty green." she said, to explain why clothes with labels at fancy prices are the new benchmarks.
To see the state of fashion and consumerism after another turn of the wheel, you have only to go from mainland China to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong public is still "aspirational" (no shredded bluejeans or tattered-and-torn clothes here) but they have already seen it all. Giorgio Armani, Chanel, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein all have shops there, and business at most of them seems as slow as at their New York equivalents. The shopping action in Hong Kong is now in medium-priced stores, filled with some shoppers who have graduated from factory outlets and street markets, and others who are trading down.
"I would like to buy designer clothes, but I can't afford them," said a customer at one of the Episode shops in the Central district, who identified herself only as Amy. She was trying on a suit that sold for around $200. Significantly, one of the glossy air-conditioned malls that seems to be doing best is Pacific Place, on Hong Kong Island; it specializes in medium-priced clothes and designers' secondary lines.
And so to Tokyo, which has been the Asian fashion mecca for 15 years, a place where newly rich consumers in droves bought designer-label clothes and where international designers have sometimes done 30 or 40 percent of their overall annual business. Now the stores in the Ginza neighborhood are deathly quiet, visible proof of Japan's gloomy economic statistics.
But down in Shibuya, Tokyo's hip shopping area, there is plenty of action. A new generation is voting with its feet and striding out in clompy shoes under long, loose layered clothes that are oceans away from European status-label dressing.
"I made it myself," said Maiko Maeda, 18, of her apron-dress, for which she recycled a pair of denim overalls by attaching it to the bottom of a man's shirt. Other young women were wearing baggy shorts with hefty boots, long skirts with high-top running shoes and clattering clogs.
In the Harajuku district, fashion has already started to deconstruct: torn jeans, shredded T-shirts, bondage leather and punk hair are worn by rock fans as Tokyo's fashion politics of protest.
Now that the new generation in Japan has started to reject the status clothes their parents craved, will the rest of Asia inevitably follow the same cycle -- fashion boom to fashion bust over 25 years?
Countries that have given up their own traditional costumes turn to the West for a fashion identity, whether defined by American sportswear or by European status labels. It is not surprising that China, its cultural roots brutally severed by revolution, should be such fertile fashion ground.
Nor is it surprising that the world's luxury-goods companies see the emergence of China as the ultimate opportunity for the next millenium. In September, Donna Karan will open a DKNY store in Shenzhen, the special economic zone near Hong Kong; Estee Lauder is China-bound in the new Isetan department store in Shanghai. The mantra chanted by all hopeful China traders is that if you get just 1 percent of the 1.3 billion potential customers, you sell more than 10 million items.
Shanghai's nouveau clothes horses can be seen as proof of fashion's resilience and of its abiding hold on hearts and minds.
In a Beijing market last month, two Russian-speaking women were seen beating down a Chinese vendor to reach their own bilateral agreement. At stake were track pants in flimsy fabrics and screeching colors that were selling for $15 for a pack of 12. Few people in the West would give the items closet room, even at those prices. Yet for these and other similar treasures, the women had traveled for days by train from the former Soviet Union and were about to start the long trek back.
Thousands more from the former-Soviet republics are thronging China's northern cities, sometimes bargaining for clothes so cheap that the Chinese even export them to India.
How awesome to us, with our jaded fashion palettes and sated appetites, that fashion still has so many hungry fans asking for more.

The colorful clothes on the streets of Shanghai surprise many first-time visitors to China, who may be expecting to find crowds dressed in drab uniforms. TOKYO: The Asian fashion mecca for 15 years is now moving away from its infatuation with European labels. Fashion is deconstructing here: large, clompy shoes appear under long, loose layered dresses. The truly hip take part in the fashion politics of protest. THE WAY IT WAS: The severe Mao suit, seen far left in a 1974 political drama performance on a commune, was once de rigueur. It has now faded from the urban scene. A sexier style, left, was the snug-fitting traditional cheongsam, like the one worn by Nancy Kwan in the 1960 film "The World of Suzie Wong."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Ukraine's Not A Kid Brother Anymore

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
RELATIONS between Russia and Ukraine were bound for trouble from the moment the old Soviet Union broke up 18 months ago. Even now, most Russians find it difficult to adjust to the loss of territory that for centuries they considered their own, while Ukrainians are learning that independence requires something more than a flag, a quasi-currency and a foreign policy that has been mostly about proving to the world, and to Russia, that theirs is a serious country, worthy of respect.
But as they try to forge a new relationship, these two Slav neighbors, the two most populous former Soviet republics, have received little help. Their shared history has proved more of a burden than a guide. Both governments, mired in internal crises, have had to fend off nationalist oppositions, while the outside world has taken a laissez-faire attitude that has left both Russians and Ukrainians feeling a bit put out. 
 It has only been recently that the West, its attention riveted on the significant nuclear arsenal that remained on Ukrainian territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union, has taken serious notice of the inherent problems in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship. The United States took the first step with visits first by its special envoy to the former Soviet Union, Strobe Talbott, and later by Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who came from Washington bearing messages of understanding, if not sympathy, for Kiev's security concerns.
Just as Ukraine had expected all along, nuclear weapons were the key to this turnaround. The more politicians in Kiev began to talk about "temporary" nuclear status, the more the West began to think hard about the consequences of two large and potentially unstable nuclear powers living together in uneasy proximity. Even discounting alarmist theories about Ukraine's secret hopes of taking control of the disputed weapons, just the lingering presence of almost 2,000 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian soil is enough to conjure a mini-cold war on Europe's easternmost edge.
In retrospect, many diplomats now agree that it was perhaps a little naive to expect, as the West did a year ago, that Ukraine would simply hand over the strategic nuclear weapons it had inherited to Russia, as it promised to do in the heady days after the Soviet Union's collapse.
 
'Unpleasant Feeling'
 "It is not difficult to understand the unpleasant feeling of sitting on this territory, next to a neighbor they see no reason to trust," said a diplomat in Kiev. "Both the Russians and Americans have to understand just how touchy they are here."
After a meeting last week between Presidents Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, there are signs that the two countries may be ready to accept a face-saving solution, floated by the Americans, to create an international commission charged with taking control of the disputed weapons, pending their final elimination.
The two Presidents also took steps toward speeding the division of the Black Sea Fleet, another issue that has assumed proportions far greater than the strategic value of the fleet itself. The agreement would also give the Russian navy leasing rights at the Crimean port city of Sevastopol.
 
'Little Brother'A Strike, a Flurry of Flags
 This was not the first time the two Presidents have reached around a crisis to produce an agreement. In the past cases, however, problems arose later as the agreements got thrashed over by recalcitrant bureaucracies and political opponents. This time, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk stipulated that their proposed solution for the Black Sea Fleet be ratified by their respective parliaments, no sure thing in either case.
The problem is that in neither country has the leadership been able so far to put together a consensus on their new relationship. As the larger, richer and militarily more powerful of the two, Russia continues to treat its neighbor as a "little brother," a role that Ukraine is determined to reject.
From Kiev, there is an even more ominous view, shared not only by the nationalist opposition but by many diplomats, that Russia has been carrying out a policy designed to weaken Ukraine and bring it back under Moscow's sway.
They point to an outbreak of strikes in the mainly Russian-populated Donbass region of the Ukraine; to the most recent incident in the Black Sea Fleet dispute, in which more than 200 supply ships simultaneously hoisted the Russian Navy flag; to recent hikes in Russian fuel prices, and to provocative visits by Russian politicians to the Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that is to Russian nationalists what Alsace-Lorraine was to France before World War I.
"I don't think these are uncoordinated Russian tactics," said a Western diplomat in Kiev. "Russia does not seem to hesitate to make their life more difficult whenever the opportunity arises."
Back in Moscow, diplomats and other observers tend to attribute conspiracy theories to over-developed sensitivities. They note that the Russian Government these days is hard-pressed to carry out its stated policies, let alone covert ones.
Furthermore, Russian Government experts here note that Ukraine is now considerably in arrears on payments to Russia for oil and gas supplies, at prices set directly by oil-producing regions that are still at 30 to 50 percent below world market prices. According to one recent published report, Ukraine now owes Russia 572 billion rubles, or $523 million.
Given their intertwined economies, and their even more intertwined populations (11 million ethnic Russians in Ukraine and 4.5 million ethnic Ukrainians in Russia), the chances of a Yugoslav-type conflict breaking out between the two former Soviet republics is considered highly unlikely. But that does not mean the road to normalized relations will be easy.
In an interview with a Moscow newspaper, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Leonid Kuchma, said cooperation between the two countries was essential if both were to pull out of economic crises. "Earlier in the country that was once called the U.S.S.R., the life of all republics was regulated by very close interrelations," he said. "But then we began erecting a new building, pulling everything down. Now when the stones of the old foundation are scattered around, we are looking back to see what has happened to us. I think it is time to gather those stones."

HEADLINE: The Enemy Within;
Mexico's Drug Habit Is Giving It Shivers

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AFTER the first car bombs exploded last year in one of the dusty capitals of Mexico's drug trade, and after traffickers started attacking one another in resort towns like Puerto Vallarta and Cancun, a strange word began to gain currency here. People spoke of "colombianizacion." Then the gunmen of drug gangs shot a Roman Catholic Cardinal 14 times in a battle outside a busy airport last month, and the fear was no longer so abstract: Were the traffickers not starting to menace Mexican society, people asked, the way the cocaine suppliers in Colombia menace theirs?
The investigation into the killings of Juan Jesus Cardinal Posadas Ocampo, his driver and five other people in Guadalajara has again exposed a significant difference between the two countries. The greater threat to Mexico, it would seem, is not a war against the state waged by drug lords, Colombian style. It is that collusion with traffickers by elements of the state may run so deep, much deeper even than in Colombia, as to be beyond the Government's reach. 
 To outraged countrymen, the Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari vowed that neither the killings nor the wider corruption they exposed would go unpunished. The intended target of the Guadalajara attack, Joaquin (El Chapo, or Shorty) Guzman Loera, probably the most powerful trafficker in Mexico, was seized in Guatemala on June 9. Last week the Attorney General dismissed 67 federal agents, waiving his usual insistence on proof of criminal involvement and thereby giving new weight to mere suspicion. A new anti-drug force was ordered formed.
Despite the flurry of new effort, however, Mr. Salinas may continue to be haunted by an official ambivalence toward the drug trade that has lasted long after he promised to make the lives of Mexico's traffickers miserable. Barely a year before the next presidential election, the credibility of his long-ruling party has plummeted again. Mexico may not be sliding toward Colombia, but its rising violence may threaten Mr. Salinas's dream of pulling Mexico up from Latin America, of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada and the United States, of eventually finding it a way from the third world to the first.
The White House has offered little more than praise for Mexico's efforts, in contrast with criticism vented the last time Mexican traffickers claimed such a prominent victim -- the 1985 slaying of Enrique Camarena Salazar, an American drug agent.
On Capitol Hill, however, Mexico's rising violence and concerns that its traffickers might exploit freer trade between the two countries have stoked an old mistrust. And it is in Congress where the fate of the still-unratified North American Free Trade Agreement will be decided this fall.
Two aides to Mr. Salinas described him as "furious" that the Cardinal had been killed, and at such a bad time. In private, such officials often argue that their governance is in part a matter of containing a dark, corrupt and violent old order that they hope to eventually bleed of power. But until recently, they have been freer about stating their lack of control over, say, the political bosses who try to rig elections. They have tended to play down a threat to law, order and foreign investment from the rogue police who kidnap executives and conspire with traffickers.
The sensitivity of the drug issue in Mexico's relationship with the United States sometimes gets lost in the warm spirit of cooperation that has obtained in recent years. A commitment to fight drugs was central to Mr. Salinas's strategy for closer economic and political ties with the United States. It meant new programs to share drug intelligence, a sharp rise in seizures and eradication, and the capture in 1989 of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, then the country's leading cocaine trafficker, who has been linked to Mr. Camarena's killing.
In recent years, cocaine seizures and the destruction of marijuana and opium poppy fields have continued apace. But there have also been indications that while the Government struck at trafficking with one hand, it held the other behind its back. Mr. Salinas chose as his first Attorney General the man who governed Jalisco state when Mr. Camarena was slain there; at the time, the state was described by American officials as a cesspool of corruption. In addition, one drug-control chief appointed under Mr. Salinas is now a fugitive, and officials say he was the traffickers' most important ally on the force.
Until last month, Mexico had seemed to suffer its drug business relatively lightly by South American standards. Its innocents have died in small handfuls, not by the score. Its judges and prosecutors were targeted for retribution relatively infrequently. Because the Mexican traffickers are primarily in the cocaine-smuggling business, they generally have less territory to protect than do their suppliers, and less need to buy off politicians along with the police.
Traffickers like Mr. Felix Gallardo also seemed to play by rules. Though he is said by drug agents to have bought the protection of scores of police officers and politicians, he has kept such information to himself even after his jailing. And drug-related violence has generally been a private, almost discreet affair -- that is, until the recent escalation of a war pitting Mr. Felix Gallardo's group and that of his Tijuana-based allies, the four Arrellano Felix brothers, against the mafia headed by Mr. Guzman.
Until last fall, no other top traffickers followed Mr. Felix Gallardo into jail. And before his recent transfer to more secure quarters, Mr. Felix Gallardo continued to administer his vast empire from a prison office equipped with a fax machine and cellular telephones. Mr. Guzman's capture this month only revived the question of why Mexican officials are sometimes so smashingly able to strike at traffickers, and most of the time not.
To rebut such questions, Mr. Salinas's second Attorney General, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, kept a running list of the hundreds of agents and prosecutors he dismissed. He liked to replace the old cops with bright young lawyers like Rodrigo Esparza Cristerna, a star of the force who rose quickly to become its chief officer in Sinaloa state, the unofficial headquarters of Mr. Guzman's cartel.
In January, Mr. Morales Lechuga was sent off to Paris as the Mexican Ambassador for reasons yet to be made clear. Mr. Cristerna was fired last week on suspicion of involvement with traffickers, just a few months after he had given reporters an impassioned speech on the new breed in the Attorney General's office.
Of Mr. Morales Lechuga's contention that big drug seizures by his police officers were the proof of headway against corruption, one of the new senior officials said this: "They receive money from one group of traffickers and they cannot act against people from that group. But they have their hands free to arrest people from other groups."
The new Attorney General, Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, has yet to fully answer many questions about the shooting of the Cardinal, including why authorities so vigorusly hunted down Mr. Guzman but have yet to locate his would-be attackers, the Arrellano Felix brothers. But mindful of the Government's credibility problem, he seems to have been candid about the challenges before him. After the Cardinal's death, he conceded he was "surrounded by traitors."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
In a 90's War On Poverty, Who Hands Out Money?

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
FOR more than a quarter century, the broad outlines of the debate over how to provide social services to poor neighborhoods has been set in stone: Liberals have touted the work of community organizations financed with government and foundation money. The Clinton Administration shows every indication of trying to use them extensively, with Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, testifying last week before a House subcommittee in support of a new $50 million program to be funneled through neighborhood groups called community development corporations.
"I believe in community-based solutions," he said. "I'm convinced that it is imperative for us to build, nurture and maintain community-based capacities such as community development corporations."
Conservatives, from the early days of the war on poverty in the mid-1960's, have rolled their eyes over this arrangement, citing inefficiencies and questioning the very premise. 
 But as the once-fledgling community organizations have become entrenched in the politics of cities across the country, the debate has opened up in unusual ways. David Stoesz, a sociology professor at San Diego State University and the former social services commissioner in two East Coast counties, frequently finds himself the odd liberal at conservative gatherings at which the community organizations are lambasted. But after many years, he said he has concluded that they are "the postmodern Tammany Hall."
Michael Gecan, a board member of the Industrial Areas Foundation, a community assistance group, said any group that accepts government grant money is virtually doomed: "The minute you take government money whether you have good or bad intentions, you become very seriously affected by that funding and your relationship with government figures. The people controlling the money will work to keep those getting the money on a leash."
The disillusionment for many is the result of the most egregious irregularities that have beset many community organizations in large cities -- financial scams, cronyism and sheer ineptitude. Scandals have touched major community-based not-for-profit organizations in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Washington, among many other cities. Perhaps no "povertician" is more notorious than the South Bronx's Ramon S. Velez, who has drawn more than a million dollars in salaries and consulting fees from a network of community groups that have frequently been cited for poor service, questionable finances and thuggish behavior toward adversaries.
But beyond the flamboyant excesses, and in marked contrast to the quality organizations which exist in almost every city as well, are the drab agencies that, particularly in older Eastern cities with entrenched political machines, run uninspired programs while pursuing what seems to be their main goal: electing their political benefactors and operating patronage mills.
These developments are "a logical outgrowth of the negative aspects of the Great Society," said John Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, particularly in old-line Democratic cities with political machines that can co-opt the neighborhood groups. "It's a very telling feature of New York political culture in contrast to cities like San Francisco, Minneapolis, or Seattle, where there are stronger examples of community organizations."
In New York, where political power bases have evolved from government-financed groups in many neighborhoods, the city's social service agencies last year handed out 4,000 contracts to not-for-profit groups that were worth $2.8 billion. Nationally, because the money flows from so many agencies at so many levels of government, there seems to be no reliable figure for how much money finds its way to neighborhood groups .
The money in New York, while not going exclusively to neighborhood-based groups, has established what amounts to a fourth level of government, one that operates in many ways like government did a hundred years ago, without civil service tests, employee or vendor background checks, or ethics or bidding regulations anywhere as complete as those for government agencies.
 
'Patronage Empires'
 Susan E. Shepard, commissioner of the city's Department of Investigation, said: "The flow of billions of dollars to not-for-profits, operating in the poorest parts of the city, shifts political power to those who control their operations. The money translates into jobs and contracts that can support patronage empires comparable to those historically controlled by political clubhouses."
John Parr, president of the National Civic League, an urban reform group based in Denver, said that when money is distributed, far more emphasis should be placed on how well groups perform than on whether they purport to represent the community. Gladys Carrion, New York's community development commissioner, has spent a couple of years trying to change a grant selection process that for decades has been easily manipulated by neighborhood power brokers.
But others would go further.
"I would wipe all of the groups out," said Theresa Funiciello, a former welfare mother and organizer and the author of "Tyranny of Kindness." Ms. Funiciello argues that money for services should be distributed as much as possible directly to recipients, in the manner of Social Security checks.
Under the current setup, Mr. Gecan said, "you've got a lot of public money with very little accountability and with no real scrutiny. You can keep revealing how terrible some of these groups are, but they keep on rolling. They have no checks and balances."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Turkey, Still Climbing

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
AT first sight, the election last week of Tansu Ciller as Turkey's first woman Prime Minister seemed an anomaly in a society whose secular ideals are offset by a profound, Islamic conservatism.
In a way, though, the vote by the ruling True Path Party showed just how enduring the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk has proven to be since the founder of modern Turkey launched the land on an often-frustrated Western trajectory in 1923. 
 Ataturk's commitment to women's rights was revolutionary for its time and place. He banned the Islamic veil, insisted on equal rights and gave women the vote in 1932, earlier than some of their European counterparts.
Although it has taken 61 years to move from the voting booth to the Prime Ministry, the process has been comparatively rapid: it took longer, from the suffragette movement of the early 20th century, for Margaret Thatcher to become Britain's first woman Prime Minister. And most other Western nations, the United States included, seem still intent on keeping the top job, formally at least, for men.
These days, though, Ataturk's legacy seems more ambiguous. True, many women have professional status as a result of educational and social policies dating from Ataturk's day: 40 percent of physicists and chemists are women; so are a sixth of the lawyers and doctors.
But a resurgence of Islamic sentiment has brought the veil back onto some streets. In the countryside, women still form the bulk of the menial labor force, and wife-beating is common enough to persuade some municipalities to set up "safe houses" for battered wives. Women, moreover, may not work without their husbands' permission. Nationally, there are fewer woman legislators than there were in Ataturk's time.
Those developments, however, may not rank among Mrs. Ciller's most pressing priorities. The 47-year-old economist has been in politics for only three years and thus has to establish authority over both a troubled and overwhelmingly male party and an uncertain coalition. And she has still to achieve what she failed to do as an economic adviser to her predecessor (and the current President), Suleyman Demirel: bring down Turkey's 60 percent inflation rate to manageable proportions.

How Women Moved Up in Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
A BARRIER fell in North America last week when Canada's governing Progressive Conservative Party elevated Kim Campbell as its leader and the first woman to become Prime Minister.
But in Canada, obstacles to women in politics and society have been tumbling for years. When the Liberal Party leader, Jean Chretien, takes to the hustings for elections likely this fall, he'll be the only man of the three national party leaders. Four years ago, the New Democrats elected Audrey McLaughlin. Accentuating his isolation is Sheila Copps, chosen as the Liberals' first female deputy leader two years ago. 
 "Campbell is no accident," said Glenda Simms, president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. "This is part of the outcome of the struggle of our women over many years."
"In the political process," she added jubilantly, "we are now achieving a critical mass."
While Canadians are generally more culturally conservative than Americans, they are well ahead of the United States in the achievement of feminist goals, in part as a result of Canadian traditions of social welfare and a stronger union movement.
Canadian women incorporated an equal rights amendment into their constitution in 1982. The sort of vehement opposition from the religious right and other groups that killed the E.R.A. in the United States never materialized in Canada.
A Canadian maternity-leave statute has been on the books since 1972, allowing 17 weeks off, 15 of them paid through unemployment insurance. In the United States, it was only this year, under the new Democratic Administration, that Congress gave workers the right to take unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks.
Women have 13.5 percent of the seats in the House of Commons, relatively low by the standards of northern Europe but well above the 8.5 percent of seats held by women in the United States Congress.
A strong and committed women's movement is leading the Canadian rights charge. There are rape-crisis centers, interval houses for battered women, immigrant women's working groups. All major universities finance women's studies programs. "I am not so sure the women's movement in the U.S. is as strong or united as in Canada," says Kay Armatage, professor of women's studies at the University of Toronto. "You don't have the political extremes here, or the fragmentation."
Not only is the religious right less active; there is less anti-feminist backlash. Lacking the individualistic bent of their southern neighbors, Canadians take more to quiet collective action.
The main women's organization, the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, has 500 member groups representing 3 million Canadian women. Canada's total population is only 27 million. Thirty percent of the committee's $1 million annual budget comes from the Government. In contrast, the National Organization of Women, the largest women's rights organization in the United States, gets no Federal money.
The Canadian organization has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. It used to be an exclusively white, middle-class network of professional women. Now a third of its members are from minorities or native groups. Native women seeking greater rights on reservations, strongholds of male domination, are among the more vocal members. The organization's new president is a 35-year-old single mother from Vancouver, Sunera Thobani, who reflects Canada's multicultural character. Born in Tanzania of a family that came from India, she is the first non-white to lead the organization.
In both English- and French-speaking Canada, the women's movement gained strength in the 1960's, as in the United States, with an influx of women in the work force, the formation of advocacy groups and wide availability of the pill.
A royal commission was set up in 1967 to look into women's needs. This led to the establishment four years later of a Cabinet minister responsible for the status of women. The involvement of senior levels of government differentiates the movement here from the United States.
Canada's feminists won the main tool of their struggle, the equal rights amendment, in the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which says the human rights of the charter are "guaranteed equally to male and female persons." It makes specific allowance for affirmative action.
Marilou McPhedran, a lawyer who helped draft the amendment, said, "When a situation arises in any area of government policy or law and we are able to demonstrate an unequal result being borne by women because they are women, then we have the tool of our Constitution to challenge and have our law or policy either struck down or modified."
The Government has put up millions of dollars to help feminists finance court tests of discrimination. One result was a landmark 1988 decision by Canada's Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional criminal penalties against a Quebec doctor for performing abortions at his private clinic in Montreal rather than at a hospital (90 percent of abortions are performed in hospitals and paid for by national health insurance). The judgment left abortion a civil matter of personal choice.
Another defining moment was the massacre of 14 women by a gunman in Montreal on Dec. 6, 1989, which resulted in a public outcry and gun control legislation shepherded through Parliament last year by Ms. Campbell as Justice Minister. The killings put intense focus on the issue of violence against women.
While ahead of the United States on equal pay, maternity leave and representation, Canadian women lag behind northern Europe. French, Belgian, Italian and Scandinavian women get child care that "North American women would die for," says Doris Anderson, author of "The Unfinished Revolution: The Status of Women in Twelve Countries," which was published last year.
Still, hope is high for further change here. Feminist studies show that women in office, regardless of affiliation, tend to be more supportive than men of so-called women's issues like abortion and day care. Polls now even show that women have a better chance than men of winning elections, and in the coming elections Canada's parties are expected to field a record number of women.
Ms. Campbell, who describes herself as a feminist, was nevertheless criticized by many in the women's movement when as Justice Minister she walked a fine line between progressive policies and the conservatism of her Tories. Yet even one of the critics, Ms. Thobani of the National Action Committee, called her elevation "a historic moment for all the women of Canada."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Human Rights: The West Gets Some Tough Questions

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: VIENNA

 BODY:
IT is tempting to reduce the global human rights debate today to a clash of good guys against bad guys, of Western democracies against Asian dictatorships, of countries defending the principle of universal human rights against third world attempts to water down the concept with economic, cultural and religious arguments.
It is all the more tempting because the attack on traditional "Western" human rights is being led by the likes of China, Syria and Iran, countries not exactly renowned for their love of democracy. Further, with barely a blush, the Asian bloc seems to have assumed the Soviet bloc's old role of opposing international "meddling" on human rights. 
 Yet halfway through the World Conference on Human Rights, the first such gathering in 25 years, it is apparent that the debate is becoming more complicated: not only do some of the third world's economic arguments have validity, but lobbies in the West are now claiming special rights for, say, women, children, indigenous peoples, migrant workers and the handicapped.
As a result, the notions enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- the right to life and security, along with a host of "negatives," such as the rights not to be tortured, raped, imprisoned without due cause or "disappeared" -- are in danger of becoming lost in a broader discussion about democracy, development, culture and religion.
Led by the United States, Western nations -- now backed by Moscow and its former satellites -- say they prefer to end the Vienna conference without agreement Friday if the alternative is a final document that threatens the principle of universal human rights. They are also determined to give the United Nations greater power to monitor and denounce human rights abuses.
In this, they are being strongly supported by delegates from over 1,000 non-governmental organizations, including many from Asia, who dismiss the third world's "relativist" arguments as nothing more than excuses for authoritarian regimes.
The meeting last week verged at times on the surreal. On the first floor, human rights groups busily denounced everything from attacks on Guatemalan Indians to trafficking in Thai women. One floor above, the diplomats could discuss only general principles.
Yet, by positioning itself as judge of the world's behavior, the West is also vulnerable to charges of upholding double standards. Today's worst atrocities are taking place in Bosnia, and the West has done little to stop them. Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, also had to recite a public mea culpa last week about the "xenophobic outrages" in his own country.
In addition, it is not forgotten here that the West was once happy to back anti-communist dictatorships and now protects despotic Arab monarchies out of fear of Islamic fundamentalism.
Yet perhaps the greatest weakness in the West's case is that it has traditionally emphasized political over economic rights. "It's hard for people who have never faced hunger or illiteracy to understand how crucial they are to a majority of mankind," Reed Brody of the International Human Rights Law Group said. "Ask an American about human rights and he'll say: freedom of speech. Ask an African woman about human rights and she'll say: the right to feed her children."
In a switch in American policy, the Clinton Administration has decided to recognize the "right to development." Last week, most Western countries also paid lip service to the "indivisibility" of human rights which means, as Pierre Sane, the head of Amnesty International, put it, that "you can't choose between torture and starvation." Yet the West's focus at this conference is still on civil and political rights.
As a result, while repressive regimes in say, China, Cuba, Iran, Burma, Vietnam and Syria may have little credibility when they claim that human rights are strictly internal matters, they and others -- among them, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia -- have won more sympathy for their argument that economic development is a more immediate priority than Western-style democracy.
Indeed, without bothering to point to democracy's dismal record in lifting third world countries out of poverty, many Asian one-party states can boast extraordinary economic growth of late. "The argument that human rights is the precondition for development is unfounded," said China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Liu Huaqiu.
In justifying his country's one-party system, Singapore's Foreign Minister, Wong Kan Seng, recalled that the United States, Britain and France took 200 years to consolidate democracy. And he argued that democracy can still be interpreted differently. "Singaporeans, for instance, do not agree that pornography is an acceptable manifestation of free expression or that homosexual relationships are just a matter of life style choice," he said.
He also said that "too much stress on individual rights over the rights of the community will retard progress." For example, he went on, Singaporean society protects itself by requiring anyone "who behaves in a suspicious manner" to be tested for drug use. Elsewhere, "the community's interests are sacrificed because of the human rights of drug consumers and traffickers."
Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, went further, arguing that, because human rights exist as a function of history, culture, value systems, geography and phases of development, they are "the competence and responsibility of each government." In other words: West keep out.
But this is not another North-South schism. Most Latin American and some African countries now agree that universal human rights exist. Last week, Nigeria, Gambia and Uganda endorsed the American proposal that a new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights be appointed.
Indeed, in a sense, the conference can already claim success. If Asian countries are attacking universal human rights, it is because they are under closer scrutiny. And if non-governmental organizations are stronger, it is because peoples' awareness of their "right" to human rights is growing. "This movement is more important than the conference," one American official said.

HEADLINE: BILLIONS IN LOSSES SEEN IN MORTGAGES INSURED BY H.U.D.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE with STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
After what its own auditors call years of neglectful management, the Department of Housing and Urban Development expects to lose as much as $11.9 billion as hundreds of apartment building owners default on their Government-insured mortgages.
Most losses, which are expected to occur in the next few years, would be borne by taxpayers through Congressional appropriations. The troubled loans represent more than a quarter of the $43 billion in mortgages insured by the department under programs to encourage the construction of apartment buildings. 
 The expected losses could eventually bring hundreds of thousands of apartments under the ownership of the housing agency, which has a track record of allowing problem projects to deteriorate into slums. The buildings in question range from luxury apartments to tenements and are found all over the country, though there is a concentration in the troubled real-estate markets of the Northeast and Texas.
 
Potential for Huge Losses
 Under the loan programs, the Government sought to increase the nation's housing supply by encouraging banks to make loans on projects they might otherwise have passed up. Most of the loans were reviewed in advance by H.U.D., which promised to repay lenders in full if the developers defaulted on their mortgages. In reviewing the loans, H.U.D. was supposed to deny insurance on those deemed exceedingly risky.
Henry G. Cisneros, the Housing Secretary, acknowledged "the potential for massive losses" and in a written statement on Friday called the forecast "the single largest problem I have inherited" in a department rife with management problems. He pledged aggressive actions to mitigate the losses, including moving faster to resell buildings acquired through loan defaults.
 
Poor Management Cited
 Housing officials have known for years that they faced significant losses in the insurance program, under which the department paid the banks in full for any mortgages on which apartment owners defaulted. But the extent of the problem became clear only in April after a study by Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, indicated that the amount of bad loans was more than double the department's earlier estimates.
A copy of the confidential report was obtained by The New York Times.
Much of the projected loss stems from the general downturn in the real-estate market, which has also brought large losses to private lenders. But reports by the agency's inspector general have also emphasized neglectful management practices by H.U.D., which may have added billions to the bailout's eventual costs. There is no way to determine how much of the loss could have been averted through more vigilant oversight.
The inspector general's office has been particularly critical of computer shortages and staffing cuts that have left the agency unable to keep track of its huge financial portfolios. In some instances, a single department official has been left to keep track of 100 projects, a workload six or seven times the industry average.
The $11.9 billion projection is the department's best guess, under current economic forecasts, of the amount the Government will lose by paying off the failed loans. Actual losses could be greater or lower, depending on the health of the economy, the steps Congress takes and the success of the department's management strategy.
 
Will Add to Deficit
 Mr. Cisneros said he was "working daily" with the White House to draft a bill that would give the department greater flexibility, and additional money, to manage distressed properties. Part of that strategy involves seeking additional money to renovate and sell the properties.
That notion has drawn early approval from Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who said this week, "This a question of whether we're willing to spend a dime to save a dollar." Mr. Kerry is a member of the Senate subcommittee on housing and urban affairs, which will hold a hearing on Tuesday on the issue.
A small portion of the $11.9 billion would be covered by the insurance premiums paid by building owners. But the majority would come from Congressional appropriations, increasing the deficit, and squeezing the amount left over for housing assistance for the poor.
As of 1991, H.U.D. estimated that it was likely to lose $5.5 billion, with the bulk, $3.6 billion, coming from a troubled Reagan-era program. That program, co-insurance, gave lenders handsome fees for issuing loans without H.U.D.'s advance approval, but it left the Government with most of the risk.
But the Coopers & Lybrand audit prompted H.U.D. to raise the estimate of its losses in other insurance programs to $7.8 billion, up from $1.5 billion. That raised the total expected losses to $11.9 billion, with co-insurance accounting for about 30 percent.
The warning of multibillion-dollar losses comes four years after a series of scandals earned H.U.D. a reputation as one of the Government's most corrupt and inept agencies.
 
Vulnerable to Fraud
 Audits by the inspector general have credited the Bush Administration's Housing Secretary, Jack F. Kemp, with improving H.U.D.'s ethical culture. But the reports have also said that the department's management systems remain vulnerable to waste and fraud because of staff shortages, computer problems and lax accounting.
Among the unresolved questions about the losses is whether Mr. Kemp could have done more to prevent them. Mr. Kemp referred questions about the program to a spokesman.
"We took a horrendous situation and improved it," said the spokesman, Bill Dal Col, who served as Mr. Kemp's chief of staff at the department. He noted that it was Mr. Kemp who abolished the co-insurance program and commissioned the Coopers & Lybrand study to get reliable estimates of the fund's financial health.
But C. Austin Fitts, a former top aide to Mr. Kemp, painted a critical picture this week of his management of the program. She said an amount "in the billions" could have been saved through a more aggressive management strategy, including striking deals with business owners. The idea, common in commercial real estate, is to give borrowers small concessions, like reduced payments, to keep them from defaulting on their entire loan.
Ms. Fitts said Mr. Kemp opposed such arrangements, fearing he would be accused of giving developers the sort of sweetheart deals they had enjoyed under his predecessors. She characterized Mr. Kemp's attitude as "one could be done on a corrupt basis, and I could get a bad headline."
Ms. Fitts served as Federal Housing Commissioner for 18 months until 1990, when she was dismissed by Mr. Kemp, in part because of disagreements over this issue.
 
Single-Family Plan Solvent
 Mr. Dal Col said aggressive dealmaking would have been reckless, given a recent history of unscrupulous developers winning windfall Government concessions.
The insurance programs are run by the Federal Housing Administration, an arm of H.U.D., and they have existed for decades.
H.U.D.'s $43 billion worth of insurance covers approximately 15,000 projects with a total of 1.8 million apartments. The F.H.A. backs more than $353 billion in mortgages under a similar program for single-family homes. That fund, which is intended to sustain itself through insurance premiums paid by borrowers, is considered financially sound.
Investment in apartment buildings is considered inherently more risky, and it was always anticipated that Congressional appropriations would be needed beyond the premiums, though not of the magnitude now forecast.
If building owners are more than 30 days late with their mortgage payments, the lenders can invoke the insurance and have the Government repay the full value of the mortgage. In such cases, the housing department takes over as the lender, collecting the monthly payments from the apartment owners. That is now the case with 2,422 of its 15,000 projects, representing about 360,000 apartments.
But the owners of more than half of those projects are delinquent in their payments to the department. H.U.D. may then foreclose, take ownership of the properties and resell them to recoup its losses.
The growing defaults threaten to flood the department with apartment buildings it is unable to manage. As recently as 1990, H.U.D. owned only 10,000 apartments through insurance foreclosures. That figure will soon rise to 69,000 as a result of foreclosure proceedings now under way, according to the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress.
 
650,000 Units at Risk
 If H.U.D. forecloses on all troubled loans identified in the Coopers & Lybrand study, it will find itself owning as many as 650,000 apartments. Department officials say their management plan will avert such scenarios.
In the meantime, the department lacks the money and the skill to manage the buildings it now controls, most of which are being supervised by subcontractors and are deteriorating.
The department's problems are being aggravated by a 1987 law requiring H.U.D. to attach expensive new subsidies to all the foreclosed apartments before it resells them, to insure they are affordable to people with low incomes.
The General Accounting Office estimates that the department needs as much as $3 billion in new subsidy money before it can sell the 69,000 apartments in the process of being foreclosed. Last year, it received only $93 million.
 
A Decade of Problems
 H.U.D. took over Grant Manor, a 185-unit project in Boston's South End, in 1984, but local officials have still not sold it. "We needed subsidy dollars to sell it, and we didn't have them," said Ken Salk, the acting director of housing at the Boston regional office.
In the last 10 years, the department's staff has been cut to about 13,500, from 17,000, and reports from the inspector general have repeatedly warned it can no longer manage its programs.
Ms. Fitts complained that travel budget cuts had prevented the department's staff members from monitoring distressed projects. In a 1989 memorandum to Mr. Kemp, she wrote that while the reduced budget "saved $50,000 last year, we lost tens of millions of dollars in multifamily foreclosures."
In 1989, the department hired the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse to audit the insurance fund and prepare a statement on its financial health. But the accounting firm said the program's records were too disheveled for it to come to any conclusions.
As a result, H.U.D. hired Coopers & Lybrand, which wrote that it found the central office's database so flawed that it "failed to pass even minimal integrity tests." The auditors then traveled to field offices and reconstructed records on a sample that covered 13 percent of its loan portfolio.

HEADLINE: Where Chinese Yearn for 'Beautiful' U.S.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: XIAMEN, China, June 19

 BODY:
As the hogs outside grunted their protests at the drizzle, R. T. Liang sipped cheap tea from one of his set of cracked cups and spoke of the Beautiful Country with a reverence that Americans might find both flattering and unsettling.
"The United States -- what a place!" Mr. Liang said wistfully, as family members clustered around him in his home, next to a porcelain God of Wealth apparently erected less in gratitude than in hope. "It's so rich! If there weren't restrictions, everybody would leave here. We would go to look for work in America, Hong Kong or Taiwan. If we could figure out how to get there, we would all go. The villages would become empty." 
 Mr. Liang is still searching for a way out, but tens of thousands of others from Fujian Province here in southeastern China have already found a path to Mei Guo, the "Beautiful Country," as the United States is known in Chinese.
Fujian Province, a lush green land of peasants, fishermen and -- perhaps more relevant -- smugglers, is the homeland of most of the 320 or so passengers on the Golden Venture, the ship that ran aground off New York this month. The incident spotlighted Fujian as the prime source of the deluge of Chinese boat people seeking a new life in the United States.
Three days of interviews here in southern Fujian, from the noodle stands of Xiamen to the tiny mud paths of the surrounding countryside, underscored how difficult it will be to control the migration. The provincial government has just begun a crackdown on the "snakeheads" who organize the human smuggling, but it seems that for every Fujianese who has made the journey so far, thousands more would like to join the line.
The reason for the migration is not exactly that the 32 million people who live in Fujian are poor, for in fact they are richer than they ever have been, and Fujian today is one of the more prosperous parts of China. Rather, the underlying factors seem to be the growth of the money culture, the rise of criminal gangs that arrange the smuggling, and the increasing boldness and mobility of peasants.
"Why do Fujianese want to go abroad, even though we're richer than other Chinese?" mused a history teacher in Xiamen as she munched on a 90-cent bowl of beef noodles in a street stall. "We're on the coast, and so we know more about what life is like abroad. So while we're better off, we also know more than people in other parts of China what we're missing."
In a larger sense, the problem appears to be that the Communist Party is relaxing its grip, in some respects perhaps losing its grip, on peasants and workers. Party slogans no longer motivate people -- money has taken over that role -- and the authorities seem as overwhelmed by the boat people as by corruption, prostitution, narcotics, smuggling and crime.
"The police don't interfere," said a young street tough, who goes to work each day outside a Xiamen hotel. "After all, this is the reform period, so they leave people alone."
Having resolved the theoretical issue, he then tried to persuade a visitor to change money on the black market ("there's a very good rate today") or to hire the services of a prostitute ("she's very cheap and convenient").
 
A Model Migrant Can't Get Out
 In a creek-side village 50 miles and a world away from the Holiday Inn, Y. H. Chen is the kind of clean-cut, hard-working, ambitious young man who causes American immigration officials to tear their hair out. Mr. Chen, 27, strong and sturdy, with a hint of a mustache, lives with his parents and some of his nine brothers and sisters in a grimy stone house decorated with pictures from a 1991 calendar.
Mr. Chen has only one-third of an acre to support himself and his wife, so he has roamed the region trying to improve his life. At times he found construction jobs paying about $30 a month, but they did not last long. For a while he sold chickens on the free market here, winning business by charging low prices. Then the other sellers beat him up and drove him away.
In recent years, Mr. Chen tried to sneak into Taiwan and Macao, but both times he was caught immediately and sent back. The "snakehead" who arranged his trip to Macao was a trickster, Mr. Chen complained.
"He promised he would have a good job for me, paying 3,000 yuan a month," Mr. Chen said, referring to the equivalent of about $535, a princely sum. "But it was all lies. He cheated me."
 
He Tried to Join A Migrant Boat
 A few months ago, Mr. Chen heard that people from a nearby village were arranging a ship to go to America, and he rushed over and pleaded to be allowed to join in. But they were wary of outsiders and refused to allow him on board. He has heard a rumor that they made it to the United States and now have good jobs, but he does not know if it is true. These rumors take on a life of their own, and they help feed the desperation to leave.
"I'd love to go to the U.S., but I don't know how," Mr. Chen said, sitting on a tiny chair next to a faded old tea table. "You need lots of money to take care of everything, and we're very poor here. So there's just no way."
It began to rain outside, so the villagers quickly took off their shoes and went barefoot to avoid splotching their shoes with mud from the footpaths. Mr. Chen's older brother, Y. C. Chen, entered the room and poured himself a cup of tea, explaining that he too would like to go abroad.
It is not that either man is particularly unhappy, for both readily acknowledge that life is getting better each year. Fujian is part of a belt of coastal China that is experiencing economic growth rates of more than 15 percent a year, probably the highest in the world. Prospects are bright, because economic ties are growing with Taiwan -- a bit more than 100 miles offshore -- and more and more Taiwan companies are moving their assembly lines to Fujian.
But for all the improvements in the standard of living -- the black-and-white televisions that most villagers now own, the bicycles and radios that are ubiquitous, the opportunities for women to give birth in a hospital instead of at home -- ambitions are spiraling at an even faster clip. People want to get ahead and to impress their neighbors, and the easiest way to impress people in the China of the 1990's is with a stack of cash.
 
'Everyone Thinks Only of Money'
 "These days everybody thinks only of money," the older brother mused as he sipped his tea. "That's why we want to go abroad."
"With money, you can do anything," he added. "You just give some presents to officials and police, and nothing is impossible."
Money even appears to have purchased a refuge in Fujian for a couple of leaders of international criminal gangs engaged in the smuggling of migrants. Two reputed gang leaders, Paul Jin-Fei Wong and Guo Liangqi, both wanted in the United States, are said to be hiding out with their bodyguards in northern Fujian Province.
For now, it is impossible to verify their whereabouts, partly because the Government bans journalists from northern Fujian. In any case, their presence would not necessarily indicate complicity on the part of the central Government. Local party or military officials could easily provide weapons and hideouts to gang leaders in exchange for a cut in the profits.
The national authorities are trying to crack down on the human smuggling operations, not least because the Government finds it embarrassing that so many people should want to flee. The leaders of Fujian held a conference on the topic a few days ago and announced a crackdown on the "snakeheads," as well as a propaganda campaign to warn peasants about the dangers.
The official newspapers have published accounts of the Golden Venture episode, in which at least six people died, but peasants rarely read newspapers. None of the villagers interviewed had ever heard of the case.
Nor did they seem particularly interested, perhaps because they were too busy asking a visitor all kinds of questions about the United States: Are there villages in America? How many children are Americans allowed to have? You're all rich, aren't you?
And the most common questions: Does America need Chinese workers? How can I get to the United States?
 
China Arrests 210 In Illegal Emigration
 The Government announced that in the first five months of this year it arrested 210 smugglers involved in 37 cases of illegal emigration. These were apparently only a small fraction of the number of shiploads of migrants to leave Fujian.
"Coastal areas will start by strengthening local Government powers and make great efforts to impose law and order," People's Daily declared a few days ago. "They will use every method to reveal the conspiracy of snakeheads and overseas gangs, while strengthening propaganda and education for the masses so as to prevent people from being cheated."
One headache for the authorities will be how to handle the boat people who are returned. Punishing them severely would discourage others from going, but it would also provoke charges of human right abuses and perhaps bolster the efforts of those already abroad to claim asylum.
According to nearly everyone interviewed, the procedure for boat people who are returned is to detain them for a few days to make sure that they are not wanted for some crime. Then they are normally fined, based on what the police think the market will bear: a wealthy entrepreneur may be fined thousands of dollars, while an impoverished peasant pays virtually nothing.
Some boat people are also sent to a labor camp for "re-education" for a few months, particularly if they are repeat offenders or seem to have a "bad attitude."
The peasants suggest that few of the boat people are politically active, although one of the first things most learn about the United States is that they should claim to be pro-democracy campaigners facing prison if returned to China. For good measure, they learn to say that they have already had their quota of one or two children and face forced sterilization if repatriated.
It is true that female peasants are often forcibly sterilized if they have had all the children they are allowed, but most boat people are men. Only in Sichuan Province is it quite common for men to face sterilization.
 
Smuggling of Goods Is Big Business
 While the crackdown on the snakeheads is just beginning, the Government has been trying for more than five years -- without any success -- to stop the smuggling of cigarettes, computers, video players, cars, pornographic videotapes and other products along the Fujian coast.
The authorities lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year in duties and taxes to the smugglers. Crooked police and customs officials play a central role in the smuggling operations, so perhaps it is not surprising that the police have been less than effective in eradicating the smuggling.
Any crackdown in Fujian also runs against a tradition going back to the 17th century of emigration to start a new life abroad. Most of Taiwan's inhabitants trace their roots to Fujian, and large numbers of Fujianese now live in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.
One of the first things any Fujianese learns is that the world abroad is full of opportunity, and that those who go abroad often become fabulously wealthy and successful. For most of the Communist era, tight police controls made it impossible to flee, but in the last decade the boom in contacts with Taiwan and the proliferation of private boats have allowed Fujian to resume its traditional role as an export base for workers.
"Lots of people from here have gone to Hong Kong or elsewhere, and they've gotten rich," said a worker in Xiamen whose older sister married a Chinese-American and is now living in Washington. "We see that. They come back and start factories and become big bosses."
He added: "We Fujianese think of the United States as a kind of heaven. We worship the United States. I would love to go and work there, if only I could find a way."

HEADLINE: Japan's Crisis: U.S. to Profit?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 19

 BODY:
For the better part of four decades America has held tight to the view that the unshakable dominance of a single, conservative party in Japan is essential to Washington's most critical alliance in the Pacific -- first as a bulwark against Communism, and second as a platform for one of the world's most remarkable economic success stories.
But as the party grew bloated with power, and the endless payoffs and influence-peddling became an international embarrassment for Japan, American officials increasingly found themselves forced to avert their eyes from the system's rotting core. 
 Though Washington was loath to criticize the decay of Japanese democracy publicly, the corrupt bonds between politicians and business became an integral part of the often invisible barriers that make it so frustrating for foreigners to break into the Japanese market.
 
For Better or Worse?
 So today, as the country's governing party continued to spin apart in the fractious generational battle that brought down the Government on Friday night, American and Japanese officials alike struggled with the question few are ready to answer: Will the uneasy relations between the two nations be better or worse off if the aging leaders who built Japan's postwar alliance with the United States finally lose power?
For years, critics of the one-party domination of Japan's political system have argued that only when a centrist alternative emerges will Japan begin to respond to the needs of consumers rather than manufacturers. That in turn could pry open the country's markets in ways that legions of trade negotiators could never accomplish.
But a more contentious political system may also be one that America has a more difficult time handling. For four decades Washington has been able to go to the governing party to solve its problems, and in every area except trade it has almost always obtained results. That era may be about to end.
 
Many Prepared to Bolt
 By this afternoon, it seemed that the end could come very soon. After the rebellion within the party that led to a vote of no confidence against the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the Cabinet declared that an election would be held on July 18.
But by some counts, nearly a quarter of the members of Parliament who make up the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year-old majority in the lower house are preparing to bolt from the party. Ten announced today that they were breaking away, and the leaders of the group that ousted Mr. Miyazawa are expected to announce the formation of a new, competing conservative party on Wednesday.
Today they received considerable encouragement. "Now is the time to make good use of ballots to put an end to the L.D.P.'s one-party rule," the Asahi Shimbun, a major daily, argued in an editorial.
In private, leaders of the old guard surrounding Mr. Miyazawa conceded that it would be virtually impossible to hold on to the majority it has commanded in the lower house of Parliament beginning in 1955. That was before 40 percent of Japan's population -- now 123 million people -- were born.
 
Coalition a Possibility
 "It is doubtful that there are enough votes for anyone to decisively take power away from the L.D.P.," Yasunori Sone, a professor of political science at Keio University, a leading training ground for politicians, said today. "But there certainly are enough to cripple it, forcing a coalition. It could take years before the new lines of power are really established."
The early date set for the election means that the paralyzed caretaker Government will be in the midst of a desperate campaign -- with candidates' sound trucks blaring through the streets of Tokyo -- by the time President Clinton and the leaders of fiveother major industrial nations arrive here in three weeks for their summit meeting.
But the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party felt they had no choice but to hold the election as soon as possible. If they waited even a week more, election day would take place just after the start of a criminal trial against Shin Kanemaru, the power broker who until last year epitomized the party's awesome power, appointing and dismissing prime ministers at will, and receiving millions of dollars in illicit payments. Mr. Kanemaru is accused of evading taxes on tens of millions of dollars found in his home and offices this year, including several hundred pounds of gold bars kept in an aging safe.
Mr. Kanemaru's hoard of gold exemplifies America's dilemma in dealing with Japan's leaders. He often described himself as America's close friend and was treated that way: when he visited Washington last year, just before scandal erupted around him, President Bush invited him to the family quarters of the White House for coffee.
When the United States needed Japanese help -- a huge $13 billion contribution to the Persian Gulf war, or aid to Russia, or big contributions to America's space station, or the cost of stationing American troops in the Pacific -- it was Mr. Kanemaru and his circle of fellow septuagenarians who always came through. The huge faction that he and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita headed could solve in a single phone call problems that American negotiators otherwise might take months or years arguing about with Japan's bureaucracy.
 
Help From the C.I.A.
 It is a relationship with nearly a half-century of history. "When the American occupation of Japan began, we purged the right wing," Robert Orr, a political scientist as Temple University's campus here, noted today. "Then in 1947 we reversed it all, put them back in politics to counter the Socialists and the Communists, and began to imprison the leftists."
For decades, many Japanese and American officials say privately, the Central Intelligence Agency even financed the Liberal Democratic Party to make sure it did not lose ground to its opposition. And Japanese voters came to associate the party with stability and anti-Communism: even when it was last threatened with a split, in 1980, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and other cold war tensions brought it to victory, to Washington's relief.
But by the 1980's the rampant corruption and arrogance that underpinned the faction's power -- and eventually set off its collapse and the party split that brought down the Government on Friday night -- often worked very much against American economic interests. No American construction company, for example, had a prayer of competing for huge Government contracts with Japanese companies that propped the faction up with millions of dollars in secret donations.
Thus, as the relationship of America with Japan has turned from security to trade, many have argued that its interests are changing.
"With the end of the cold war, I think you can argue that it is far better for our interests if there are two centrist parties, alternating power," said Michael Mochizuki, a professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Japanese politics. "I'm one of those who always thought that the L.D.P. was more part of the problem than part of the solution."
The argument is simple: with two such parties actively contesting seats, one is bound to take up the interests of consumers -- and thus the interests of American business, whose goods here would make Japan's markets far more competitive. Until now, consumer interests have always been subjugated to the interests of Japan's manufacturers, who are also, of course, the money supply for the Liberal Democrats.
 
More of the Same Is Possible
 Many argue that their day is long gone. "Having accomplished what they set out to accomplish after the war, none of the parties today any longer serves Japan's needs," Kenichi Ohmae, a well-known management consultant, has said. He recently started a reform movement to change all of Japan's political parties.
The problem with the argument is that while it may make sense in American terms -- politics often turns on pitting the interests of producers against consumers -- no one knows whether it will have much appeal in Japan.
For decades Japanese voters have associated the growth of industry with the growth of their own wealth. Japan's consumer movements are tiny. Though some new political groups, like the Japan New Party, have begun to appeal to consumer interests, they have yet to pick up much steam.
Moreover, the rebels who downed Mr. Miyazawa are old wine in new bottles. Ichiro Ozawa, the "reformer" who masterminded the political coup this week, was trained by Mr. Kanemaru, and before that by Kakuei Tanaka, the Prime Minister most associated with the Lockheed scandal of the 1970's and a range of other shady deals.
In short, what could emerge from all of this turmoil is more of the same. Political chaos in Japan is an invitation for the most conservative force in Japan to step forward: the bureaucracy.
The weakness of political leaders plays into the hands of the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which traditionally have represented the interests of Japan Inc. In the short term, at least, that could mean a far more difficult time for American negotiators, at least until clear political leadership emerges that could be pressed to overrule the bureaucrats.
What could weaken them the most, of course, is open debate in Japanese politics about national policy. That has always been missing here, washed away by patronage and cash. "The biggest hope," said Professor Mochizuki, "is that what will emerge from all of this is some vision of a new Japan."

HEADLINE: As Hispanic Presence Grows, So Does Black Anger

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 19

 BODY:
When Cuban refugees began arriving here 30 years ago, Ruth Page was working as a seamstress in a tailoring and cleaning shop, and she says she had no strong feelings one way or another about the Spanish-speaking people. But when she lost her job to a Cuban, her attitude changed.
Now Mrs. Page remains resentful,and worried about the still-growing Hispanic presence in Miami. So when the Dade County Commission met last month to consider abandoning a requirement that all county business be conducted in English, she was one of several black Miami residents who attended the meeting to speak out. 
 "They are taking over, and I am a victim of that," Mrs. Page, who is now retired, complained after the commission voted unanimously to rescind the English-only rule.
Mrs. Page's attitude is shared by many other blacks as the city's Hispanic population has grown to dominate the economic and political life.
And although the language vote was among recent events that led some Hispanic and black officials to declare that "a new era" of tolerance and understanding was at hand, many of the deepest differences between the two groups remain unresolved.
The way those differences are settled, or not hold lessons not just for Miami but the entire country, prominent members of both groups say.
"The situation we are living in Miami today will be true of most major cities in America in the next 10 years," said Eduardo J. Padron, president of the Wolfson Campus of Miami-Dade Community College and a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
In Dade County, which includes Miami, the Hispanic population has grown, in a little more than 30 years, from 5 percent to a majority of the two million residents. In the same time, the population of non-Hispanic blacks has risen slightly, to about 20 percent from about 15 percent. These two trends have generated tensions over issues like jobs, government contracts, claims on public services and the distribution of political power.
Complicating the population shift is a clash of two very different concepts of race and ethnicity. English-speaking blacks are increasingly alienated from their Spanish-speaking counterparts, who identify themselves by their linguistic and cultural heritage, rather than their race, and associate mostly with other Spanish speakers, of whatever color.
 
New Responses Required
 In some important respects, though, Miami's situation diverges from that of New York, where Puerto Ricans are the main Hispanic group, and other cities. In New York City, for instance, Hispanics for the most part have not come as political refugees, and are on average poorer than blacks.
American blacks have long been accustomed to being the principal minority group in a given locale, with whites the majority. But situations in which Hispanic people outnumber blacks, or have replaced non-Hispanic whites as the dominant group, as is the case here, are new, requiring all three groups to find new responses and make new accommodations.
That demographic phenomenon is likely to occur with increasing frequency over the next decade in cities around the country because of continued immigration and high birth rates.
Hispanic people, who totaled 22.3 million nationally in the 1990 census, already outnumber blacks in Los Angeles and Houston, are rapidly pulling even in New York City and Dallas and are expected to overtake blacks as the nation's largest minority group between 1997 and 2005, according to various demographic projections.
"As a nation, we have pretty much developed our notion of minority policy based on the black population, and just stuck Latinos and Asians into that profile," said David Hayes-Bautista, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who has studied relations between minority groups. "The problem is that the profile doesn't fit. We're used to thinking of a unified minority agenda, but as the minority population becomes less black, the issues become different.
"Language and immigration, for instance, have never been part of the traditional black agenda, or are in conflict with it," Dr. Hayes-Bautista continued. "On the other hand, low levels of participation in the labor force, high levels of family disintegration and certain types of health problems are not Latino issues, frankly."
 
Minority Concept Challenged
 That conflict is already being played out here, where some prominent blacks maintain that Hispanic residents, especially Cubans, should not be regarded as a minority group because of their numbers and their economic success.
"In South Florida they are doing excellently," said Gary Siplin, a lawyer who is president of the New Miami Group, which seeks to encourage black leadership in government and business. "They own radio stations, TV stations, schools, banks, buildings, businesses. They have the jobs."
H. T. Smith, a black lawyer, said that as far as he is concerned, Cuban-Americans are simply "white people whose native language is Spanish."
Some black legislators here have argued that because Hispanic people now constitute the majority here, they should lose eligibility for certain minority benefits, like preferential treatment in government contracting or consideration under the Voting Rights Act.
But other blacks say there must be more effort in the black population to become bilingual and adapt to the city's changed character. "We can't move Miami," said Marvin Dunn, a professor of sociology at Florida International University who has written extensively on race relations here. "The reality is that Spanish is becoming the dominant language here. It's one thing to complain, but you can't hold back the tide."
Contributing to a recent mood of conciliation between black and Hispanic residents was an agreement last month that ended the boycott of tourism here by blacks. With Mr. Smith, the lawyer, among the leaders, the boycott was called after Miami's Cuban-dominated government snubbed Nelson Mandela when the South African anti-apartheid figure visited here.
The boycott is estimated to have cost Miami up to $50 million in revenue, and the agreement that black groups negotiated with business, civil and political leaders to end it, calls for increased loans and training programs for black businesses, as well as "fair hiring for African-Americans" in the hotel and tourism industries.
Black and Hispanic officials here acknowledge, however, that barriers between the groups are more than merely economic. Dr. Dunn said said English-speaking blacks are "being surrounded by this sea of brown, Spanish-speaking people, and becoming more entrenched in our own isolation."
Many American-born blacks here and in cities like New York and Chicago seem perplexed, for instance, by the tendency of black Cubans, Dominicans, Panamanians and Puerto Ricans to define themselves not by the color of their skin, but by their language and culture. "You can't tell if you just look at somebody," Mr. Smith said. "I can be walking down a street and I say, 'Hey, brother,' and they speak back to me in Spanish."
According to the 1990 census, the desegregation of housing is occurring more rapidly in Dade County than elsewhere in Florida or in the nation as a whole. But that is the result largely of the willingness of Hispanic whites and blacks to live together, or mixed with Haitians and other Caribbean blacks, in integrated neighborhoods that are largely free of racial tension.
For the most part, native-born, English-speaking blacks remain the most segregated group in Miami, and continue to reside in clearly identifiable pockets in the northwest section of the county. They also tend to be poorer as a group than white or Hispanic people, which both increases their frustration and limits their choices.
"A big chunk of the working-class Anglo community has simply left," because of growing Hispanic dominance here, Dr. Dunn said, referring to the estimated 250,000 whites who have moved out of Dade County since 1980, most of them to other parts of Florida. "But most of the blacks have no place to flee."
Not only here, but in cities as far-flung as Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Houston, competition between black and Hispanic citizens over the drawing of legislative districts and the allotment of seats is intensifying.
"There is a real tension across the board," said Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy in New York. "Generally, the black leadership has felt, 'We sacrificed all these years, we got the laws on the books, and now all these Latino interlopers are coming in.' The black population is stabilizing, while ours is growing, and there is a reaction on the part of blacks. You hear comments from blacks like, 'These Hispanics, they just got here, and they want to take over.' "
Though both black and Hispanic voters, with the exception of Cubans of both colors here, tend to vote for Democrats at the national level, their voting patterns are starting to diverge in local contests. In New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger for mayor, has made overtures to Hispanic voters by picking a Puerto Rican, Herman Badillio, to run for comptroller on his ticket, and in Los Angeles last week, Richard Riordan, the Republican, received about 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in winning the mayoral contest.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Drive Up Unemployment Tax

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 19

 BODY:
High jobless rates in 1992 are likely to force employers to pay between $16 and $145 more a year in unemployment taxes for each employee starting in July.
"We're having the calculations reviewed, but it looks like there will be a slight increase in all employer tax rates," said George Krause of the state Labor Department. 
 The increase appears to be needed to build up the balance in the unemployment trust fund, from which benefits are paid. Mr. Krause said his figures indicated that the fund had $2.2 billion earlier this month, down from $2.4 billion a year ago.
Mr. Krause said a final decision was expected next week.
Under New Jersey's law, unemployment taxes on businesses are divided into about a dozen brackets. Companies that frequently lay people off pay the highest rates, which in the current system were as much as $869 a worker, said Joe Fogarty, an unemployment insurance consultant with the Frick Company in Mount Holly.
In addition to the claims-related brackets, the law requires the Labor Department to determine each year if enough money is being paid into the trust fund to cover anticipated claims.
Another increase could be in store next year as well, because the Legislature lowered the amount workers contribute to the fund. That could lower the balance in the fund to the point where further employer contributions would be required to keep it at a mandated level.

HEADLINE: A Teacher, Her Pupils And Lessons Learned

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
When school began last September, Patricia Cullen was as much a novice as the first-grade students assigned to her class at Public School 116 in Manhattan. It was her first teaching job, their first time in grade school. By the end of that first week, Mrs. Cullen looked pummelled, and the wiggling, giggling children had mastered only one lesson: standing in line.
But as the school year winds to an end, it is clear that much has changed inside Room 205. 
 Last fall, at least half of the children could not read or write more than a few basic words. One, when asked to write "dog," etched out "bkg." Now everyone, including the "bkg" child, can read and write scores of words. They can add and subtract two-digit numbers, count by fives and work word problems. And Mrs. Cullen, 29, has not just learned to keep order among her little minions. She has learned to teach.
"This has been the toughest year I have ever had," she said after a morning session last week. "I have learned so much. So much that I never learned in school."
 
The Secret: Stickers
 Indeed, Mrs. Cullen, who left a job at CBS Records to pursue a master's degree in education, found that the secret to teaching first graders has less to do with curriculum than with consistency, insistence and stickers. Students who spoke out of turn did not get called on. Ever. Those who spoke out two or three times had to sit alone for a brief "time out." And those who behaved well were rewarded with praise and colorful round stickers, placed, like badges of honor, on their tiny chests.
"They love these things," Mrs. Cullen said one morning as she stickered two children for sitting quietly. They smiled proudly. "In the end," she said later, "the most important thing to me is that they learn to respect each other and feel good about themselves."
It has been a long, hard year at P.S. 116, a five-story brick building on East 33d Street. But despite political and economic turmoil in the New York City school system, it has been a successful one for Mrs. Cullen and her students.
In addition to the academic strides, other changes came as well. During the first week of school, the class was packed with 34 children, several of whom spoke little English. Mrs. Cullen struggled to hold their attention for more than three minutes. Since then, the class size has dropped to 24, as the students with limited English and the more advanced readers have moved into other classes. The first graders have established clear routines, like working in learning centers or pushing in their little chairs whenever they get up from their work tables. They offer deliberate "excuse me's" when they accidentally elbow each other. And they raise their hands if they want to speak out in class. Most of the time.
 
Tired but Confident
 As for Mrs. Cullen, she moves through reading, writing and math lessons in an old room without air conditioning that has become a menagerie of student art work, number charts and children's books. The young teacher is clearly tired, but confident and effective with her students. Gaining that confidence, she said, has meant assembling an eclectic set of skills, some of which she learned through an array of teacher workshops offered by the local school district. Others came through trial and error.
Take, for example, the art of discipline. She began the year by having the class write out its own rules: "Raise your hand to speak" or "Stand quietly when in line."
But within just a few weeks it was clear that that was not enough. That's when the stickers came into play. "I've had a lot of support," Mrs. Cullen said. "But you never know if something is going to work unless you try it yourself."
She has also learned from her mistakes. She recalls one November afternoon when a first grader gave her a smothering hug and she sat on the carpet. Within seconds, the others piled on, burying the 98-pound teacher under a mound of little bodies. She couldn't move.
"There they were on top of me," she recalled. "And I realized I hadn't really established the lines between us well enough."
Another teaching trick came to her one fall day when she was trying to make homework seem more appealing. Suddenly, she remembered what another teacher had told her about trying reverse psychology on the children. "If you are good you get homework!" she announced enthusiastically. Suddenly, she said, the students straightened up in their chairs and acted as if homework were a prize, not a punishment.
 
Capturing Imaginations
 To capture the children's attention, she learned that she also had to capture their imaginations. Instead of always copying and illustrating the work of published poets, for example, they began writing their own poems, and copying and illustrating each others' work. They often make up their own work problems in math. And they are encouraged to think up different routes to solve equations.
But with the successes have also come challenges, both inside and outside the classroom. Mrs. Cullen, who defected from the corporate world to what she hoped would be more fulfilling work, has now joined the ranks of New York City's public-school teachers, who are still working without a contract because of stalled negotiations between the Teachers Union and the city.
Budget pressures, on both the local and national levels, have left the school with little money for extra supplies. Mrs. Cullen spent more than $500 of her own money this year on pens, paper and extra children's books. Next fall, cuts mean that P.S. 116 and other city schools will lose thousands of dollars in public money, including some of the financing they received as a Chapter One school, or one with a large number of children from low-income families.
Faced with the contested "Children of the Rainbow" curriculum, Mrs. Cullen, at the recommendation of her principal, Anna Marie Carrillo, used the curriculum as a general guideline. But she steered clear of material that dealt directly with AIDS or homosexuality.
"I just don't think some of the parents are ready for it," she said. If the topics had come up in class, she said, she would do her best to explain the issue, then talk about "how important it is to respect everyone."
 
Homeless Students
 In many ways, she has had her own rainbow to deal with. Some children come from nearby homeless shelters. Others from more affluent families, where both parents are professionals. Some are very sheltered. Some have already been exposed to violence on the street or at home.
But as she stood in the school yard at the end of the day last week, it was clear that Patricia Cullen had managed, as she had hoped, to make a difference with both parents and students.
Shirley Lee, who arrived early in the yard that afternoon, said the first-grade teacher had worked wonders with her daughter, Cathy, 7. "Her reading is very good," Mrs. Lee said. "She behaves more, too. And the teacher is very, very nice." Other parents have asked Mrs. Cullen if she planned to move to second grade, so she could teach the children again. And before heading out of the yard, Shante Sapp, 6, reached up and put a big round sticker on her teacher's blouse.
"Here's a sticker, Mrs. Cullen," the girl said with a smile. "You were good today."

HEADLINE: Move to Curb Incentives To Businesses

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Concerned that some cities and counties in New York have gone too far in their efforts to attract new jobs and to keep companies that are being wooed by other states, the State Legislature is seriously considering measures that would curtail some of the incentives that could be offered.
The proposals are intended to increase accountability and to limit some of the incentives, like sales-tax waivers, that local industrial development agencies have offered to companies, usually to keep them from leaving town. While such incentives have been used liberally by New York City to keep companies like Prudential Securities and the Morgan Stanley Group from moving to New Jersey or elsewhere, the legislators say their bills are aimed at abuses that have been reported around the state. 
 Still, because of the city's reliance on such incentives, Carl Weisbrod, New York City's top economic development official, says he fears the legislation will hurt the city's ability to compete for jobs.
 
'More Vigilant Than Ever'
 "With New Jersey sitting on a $200 million strike fund that is aimed like a dagger at New York City's economy, which they're using to induce New York City businesses to move there, and with Connecticut offering companies significant capital grants for even a small number of jobs, we have to be more vigilant than ever," said Mr. Weisbrod, head of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
While the Legislature has considered but failed to pass similar proposals in recent years, this year appears to be different, officials say. Negotiations between Senate and Assembly officials continued last week in an effort to reconcile the two bills, and legislative aides said it was likely that some development reform measure would be passed and sent to the Governor.
Assemblyman Francis J. Pordum, a Democrat from Erie County who is the primary sponsor of an Assembly bill and a strong proponent of development agency reform, said such a measure was needed to make industrial development agencies "accountable to the people and the governments that created them."
 
Agencies Created in 1969
 He added, "Many of the I.D.A.'s give away tax breaks, and very often the only one that benefits from the tax break is the corporation that locates there and the I.D.A. itself" through fees.
The Legislature created the development agencies in 1969 at a time when there was concern that not enough was being done to attract or keep companies in the state. Their mandate was to use various inducements, like bond issues, sales-tax and real estate-tax breaks, often in conjunction with state officials. But reports of possible abuses have led some legislators to conclude that the agencies have gone too far.
Mr. Pordum cited Roosevelt Raceway in Nassau County, purchased by a real-estate developer and horse breeder with the aid of $52 million in tax-free bonds provided by the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency. He later sought to close the track and sell or develop the property despite charges that he had promised to keep the track open, and a state inquiry criticized the development agency for not fully investigating the raceway project before it granted the money.
Other development-agency activities cited by supporters of change include a decision in Troy, N.Y., to use development money to help local investors buy and operate a National Hockey League farm team, and to help the city with debt refinancing with development money. There have been other scattered reports that sales-tax breaks in development packages have been used to pay for custodial services, or that development money has been used to refurbish legal offices.
 
Trying to Reconcile Bills
 While Mr. Weisbrod said some abuses had occurred, he insisted that New York City's development efforts had never come under criticism, and expressed the hope that the Legislature would use "a scalpel, not an atom bomb" to correct problems.
Senate and Assembly officials are trying to reconcile the Pordum bill with another development reform bill, this one with joint sponsorship in both houses, in the Senate by William J. Larkin Jr. of Hudson Valley and in the Assembly by Robin Schimminger, Democrat of Erie County. The Pordum bill is much tougher.
Mr. Weisbrod said the city was particularly concerned about parts of the bills that would prohibit development agencies from using money to assist "professional services" that do not create substantial private-sector jobs. The sponsors of the bill say they are aiming to cut abuses, not to hurt efforts to keep and attract financial-services companies. But Mr. Weisbrod said a broad definition of "professional services" would not only restrict use of money for redecorating legal offices, but could also keep New York City from focusing on such financial-services companies as Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns and Prudential Securities.
Mr. Weisbrod's office worked out a $39.6 million package of incentives running 10 years to keep Morgan Stanley's headquarters in Manhattan and its back office in Brooklyn, a $106.2 million package over 20 years to keep the Prudential Securities headquarters and its 5,000 jobs in Manhattan, and a $17.6 million package to induce Bear Stearns to move 1,500 workers to Brooklyn rather than New Jersey. Last week, the city lost the Witco Corporation, a Manhattan-based manufacturer, and 200 jobs to Connecticut.
 
Limits on Sale-Tax Waivers
 Provisions in the two bills would also limit sales-tax waivers granted to businesses. Such waivers are used frequently "as a means of reducing the cost differential between New York and Connecticut and New Jersey," Mr. Weisbrod said. Both the Larkin-Schimminger and Pordum bills impose two-year limits on sales tax waivers; the Larkin-Schimminger bill exempts computer sales and service contracts, while the Pordum bill does not. Mr. Weisbrod noted that some New York City deals have included tax waivers that ran longer than two years or covered things like maintenance on mainframe computers, which could well be prohibited by the Pordum bill, thus restricting the city's ability to attract high-technology businesses.
Mr. Weisbrod also said city officials are worried about limits on the use of development money for retail projects, and about a provision that would give the State Comptroller's office control over such agencies.
"I don't think anyone intends for this to be an anti-New York City bill, but I think the consequences of it are anti-New York City," Mr. Weisbrod said, adding that the Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns and Prudential deals would all have been impossible under the current wording of the bills.
Mr. Pordum said he could not address Mr. Weisbrod's concerns on those issues because he was not familiar with the specific deals in question, but he said that when bad development packages are granted the taxpayer suffers. "I'm sure that there are many deals that were done before my legislation that couldn't have been done with it, but that wouldn't have been good for the community as a whole," he said.
 
How Far Is Too Far?
 Mr. Schimminger said he believes that Mr. Pordum's bill "goes further than I think appropriate" in restricting the development agencies' activities in several areas, including comptroller control and limits on retailing.
He also said his bill was not intended to hamstring the agencies, and added that he had no intention of limiting efforts to attract and keep financial-services jobs, because "to the extent that white-collar jobs in New York State can result in the importation of dollars and the exportation of services, they are an absolute benefit to New York State."
A spokeswoman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Juanita Scarlett, said Mr. Cuomo would not take a position on the bill until it has reached his desk for signing and he has had a chance to review it.

HEADLINE: Murder Trial in Beating by Detroit Officers Begins

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 19

 BODY:
A jury that took two painstaking weeks to assemble will have to decide whether the fatal beating of a black motorist was a wild exercise of raw power by the police or the action of committed officers confronted by a struggling man in a high-crime area.
As opening arguments began Friday in the trial of three white former officers, many people here wonder whether what happens inside the courtroom will ignite an explosion in the streets. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. 
 Live gavel-to-gavel television coverage is planned, and extra security has been added. The first witnesses are expected to testify Monday.
Two of the defendants are accused of second-degree murder in the beating death of the motorist, Malice Green, a 35-year-old unemployed steelworker. A third is charged with assault in the beating in a curb-side confrontation on a clear November night last year.
The incident has haunted Detroit for seven months and led to the country's third racially charged trial this year involving police officers accused of abusing a black motorist, after those in Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla.
 
Tense Relationship
 Like those trials, the Detroit case, known in local newspaper headlines as the Deadly Encounter or the Fatal Force Case, grows out of the often tense relationship between law-enforcement officials and black and other minority residents in the country's inner cities.
Two juries, one for former Officer Walter Budzyn and one for former Officer Larry Nevers, will hear testimony at the same time, seated a few feet apart in Courtroom 402. Originally, the men were to be tried by one jury, but Mr. Budzyn's lawyer, Michael Batchelor, asked for a separate trial, asserting that the defense of the former partners could be antagonistic, as each defendant tried to blame the other.
To save time and money, the judge in the case, George Crockett 3d, decided to try the men together with with a double jury, a fairly common practice in Michigan. The panels will hear prosecution witnesses together, but jurors will be taken out of the courtroom during proceedings that do not involve the defendant whose fate they will decide. Of the 32 jurors and alternates, 26 are black, as are about 70 percent of the people in Detroit.
The third defendant, former Officer Robert Lessnau, has requested a bench trial, and his fate will be decided by Judge Crockett.
 
Officials Moved Fast
 Seven months ago, as word of the fatal beating spread, Detroit officials moved quickly to calm the tension. The Mayor, Coleman A. Young, said he was shocked and sickened by what he called a murder by the police.
Eleven days after the beating, Mr. Budzyn, 47, and Mr. Nevers, 52, were charged with second-degree murder, and in mid-December they were dismissed by the Police Department. Mr. Lessnau, 33, was also dismissed and charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Four other officers, including a black sergeant, were suspended.
The incident began shortly after 10 P.M. on Nov. 5, when Mr. Green was stopped by two plainclothes police officers, Mr. Budzyn and Mr. Nevers, in front of a suspected drug house on the city's west side.
The officers, on the lookout for an armed-robbery suspect driving a red car, ordered Mr. Green to show his driver's license. Halfway out of the car, he leaned over to the glove compartment and apparently had something in his hand. The officers told him to unclench his fist and then started to beat him with their fists and heavy metal flashlights.
Mr. Green was pulled out of the car, and the beating continued as two emergency medical service crews and several more police officers, including Mr. Lessnau, arrived on the scene.
 
Compared to Relay Team
 The prosecutor, Mr. Baker, said Mr. Green did not struggle, even as the two officers took turns beating him. Mr. Baker likened the beating to a relay team handing off a baton.
"At this point," he said, "Mr. Green is massively injured. Blood is literally streaming from his head, through his hair and down into the street, where literally a puddle is formed."
Mr. Baker said that Mr. Budzyn struck first and that when he was winded Mr. Nevers took over.
But the only people to see Mr. Budzyn hit Mr. Green were residents and customers of the drug house, and Mr. Batchelor told the jury that none of them have said they saw Mr. Budzyn strike Mr. Green in the head.
By the time Mr. Nevers began beating Mr. Green, an ambulance had arrived. One driver was so shaken by what he witnessed, Mr. Baker said, that he retreated to the back of his vehicle to compose himself.
Then Mr. Lessnau arrived and at one point kicked Mr. Green in the head while he was handcuffed on the street.
Within 15 minutes of the beating, Mr. Baker said, Mr. Green died from at least 14 blows to the head.
Mr. Nevers's lawyer, John Goldpaugh, hinted that he would challenge the cause of death because Mr. Green had cocaine in his system when he died.
While the death of Mr. Green has not caused any disturbances in Detroit, the Rev. Wendell Anthony, the president of the city's N.A.A.C.P. branch, said he believed that a lot of anger was just below the surface.
Marvetta Davis, who lived near where Mr. Green died and has now joined the Justice for Malice Green Coalition, sees the trial as a test of the justice system.
"Police violence happens every day in the black community," she said. "It's the normal thing. If these cops get convicted, it will be history because they always get away with everything."

HEADLINE: Woman in the News;
Immigration Expert Who Takes Broad Approach -- Doris Marie Meissner

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
4 A child of immigrants, Doris M. Meissner grew up in a German-speaking household in Milwaukee during World War II and suffered the anguish of ethnic discrimination early.
"I can clearly recall sitting on buses and streetcars and hearing my mother tell me not to talk, because it wasn't good to be heard speaking German," she said in a telephone interview from Milwaukee. 
 Ms. Meissner, 51, is now expected to become the custodian of the hopes of today's immigrants and those trying to gain entry. President Clinton nominated her on Friday to be Commissioner of Immigration, which requires Senate confirmation.
Ms. Meissner (pronounced MICE-ner) has specialized in immigration issues for nearly two decades, serving at the Justice Department in Democratic and Republican administrations. She served briefly as acting Commissioner in 1981.
Her family nurtured her longstanding interest in government and public issues, she said. "I think it probably came from my home and from my parents' strong feeling that you give back," she said. "They were always very grateful to have been here and to have built a life here."
 
Paying a Debt
 She has spent her life trying to give something back to her country, in two areas: women's rights and immigration policy. "I'm committed to the full participation of women in the life of our society," said Ms. Meissner, who for a time led the National Women's Political Caucus.
Ms. Meissner has won plaudits for bringing diverse groups together during 13 years at the Justice Department and during her present role as director of the Immigration Policy Project of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"Immigration has traditionally been the province of advocacy groups only," she said. "We have created a dialogue that looks at these questions as serious policy questions, not just as questions for advocacy groups."
"We have to place the issues in an international context," she continued. "The movement of people is emerging as one of the critical global issues of our age. It is based on huge deficiencies in human rights and deep economic differentials."
When she takes over the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Ms. Meissner will be charged with, in President Clinton's words, insuring that the United States does not "lose control of our borders." Ms. Meissner indicated in the interview that she would take a broad approach to that mission.
 
Treating the Cause
 "Today, people have information and cheap transportation," she said. "They know what their circumstances are and can act on it. We can't deal with this only as an enforcement issue in the United States. We have to look at it worldwide and attack the conditions that create the desperation."
Her nomination won immediate praise from those involved with immigration issues.
Doris Marie Meissner was born in Milwaukee on Nov. 3, 1941. Her mother, Hertha Borst, was 10 when she came to this country from Berlin, Germany, and her father, Fred Borst, was 22 when he arrived from Stuttgart, Germany.
Her father was a tool and die maker and her mother a bookkeeper. "My parents were definitely the pivotal influences on my life," Ms. Meissner said. "They were both very hard-working and absolutely devoted to their kids. Our family life was very much devoted to our German heritage.
"Good parents make kids feel special and are proud of what they do. When you grow up in that kind of an environment, you're ready to meet the world when that time comes."
She attended public schools and met her husband, Charles Meissner, now an economist with the World Bank, when they were both undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. She stayed to earn a master's degree in political science when he served in the Army during the Vietnam War.
 
Drawn to Politics
 While studying, she recalled, "I wanted to get involved in a campaign, some kind of political activity." She managed the campaign of Midge Miller, an opponent of the war who defeated a 20-year incumbent for a place in the state Legislature.
After the election, her husband returned from Vietnam and the couple moved to Washington. Ms. Miller provided the connection that enabled Ms. Meissner to become a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and its executive director in 1971.
In that post, she assailed both national political parties for not providing campaign financing for women. She devoted special effort to the successfulcampaign of Patricia Schroeder for a House seat.
Ms. Meissner won a White House fellowship in 1973 and went to work at the Justice Department, where she later specialized in immigration issues, becoming Acting Commissioner in 1981 and Executive Associate Commissioner from 1982 to 1985.
Ms. Meissner and her husband have two children: Christine, 28, a high school teacher, and Andrew, 24, a film student.
She inherited her parents' sense of family. "The most important thing is to be there for the people who are closest to you: family and close friends," she said. "And it's important to do work that is satisfying to you and useful to the world. If I can do those two things, I'm satisfied."

HEADLINE: Short of Money, U.N. Refugee Official Asks for Aid

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 18

 BODY:
Faced with a serious shortage of money, the United Nations official charged with caring for the world's 18.9 million refugees plans to summon representatives of the richest countries to a meeting here in July to ask them squarely whether they are willing to continue paying the bill.
"With this funding we can't continue," Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in an interview at her headquarters here this week. "For most operations I've only got money for another month or two." 
 In a poignant reflection of world disorder, the number of people fleeing war or persecution in their homelands has risen almost without interruption every year since the mid-1970's. But the total has soared by some 4 million since 1989, largely as a result of turmoil in former Yugoslav republics, some Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, Iraq, and African countries including Somalia, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Liberia.
 
Costs Doubled in Two Years
 The agency's costs in caring for refugees have doubled in the last two years alone, to almost $1.1 billion from $544 million in 1990. Mrs. Ogata, a Japanese citizen educated in the United States, says she will need $1.3 billion this year to feed and protect homeless victims of war and civil disorder across the globe and help a few return home.
But so far this year, the 22 governments on which Mrs. Ogata relies on for voluntary contributions have offered only $480 million, less than half of what she needs. "Last year I never thought we'd make $1.1 billion, but I'm far less optimistic today that we can get $1.3 billion this year," she said.
Ernest Chipman, chief of fund raising for the refugee agency, added: "The momentum runs out. The last dollar is always much harder to find than the first."
Money for the world's refugees is drying up mainly because the United Nations agency always had a narrow base of support, with the United States, Japan, the Scandinavian countries and the European Community providing the overwhelming bulk of its financing. Governments of those countries are now being forced to cut spending where possible because of an economic slump in which declining tax revenue and rising unemployment compensation costs have widened their budget deficits. .
"Our requests are increasing just when the donors are all going through difficult budgetary times," Mrs. Ogata said.
But there is also a feeling among agency officials that the public is beginning to tire of the issue as the number of refugees mounts year after year without even stabilizing, let alone recording a decline.
"Yugoslavia is a third of our budget, and people despair at its leaders' lack of will to make peace," Mr. Chipman said, in a reference to the three-way struggle between Serbs, Croats and Muslims in the region. He said the unending crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina had led to "aid fatigue."
 
Three Million Victims
 Many of the agency's biggest emergency programs are seriously underfinanced. Only $178 million has been raised for the most costly effort, the $420 million it plans to spend on feeding, clothing and caring for more than three million victims of fighting and "ethnic cleansing" in Croatia and Bosnia.
Nations and nongovernmental groups have provided only a third of the $475 million that the High Commissioner wants to spend helping refugees return home to Afghanistan, where 14 years of civil war and more recent fighting between rival Muslim factions in a new Government has driven millions from their homes.
The refugee agency's $55 million budget for repatriation of people in Mozambique, where a peace accord was signed last year, has attracted only $15 million in pledges so far. Yet the refugee agency's $28 million appeal to pay for the return of some 350,000 Cambodian refugees was oversubscribed by almost $1 million.
 
Big Political Stake
 The peacemaking effort in Cambodia was the biggest ever undertaken by the United Nations, and the United States, France and other major powers had a big political stake in its success. Thousands of Cambodian refugees had to be repatriated so they could vote last month in national elections, which were viewed as the culmination of the peace effort.
Mrs. Ogata is uncertain about what she can expect this year from the United States, which was her agency's biggest source of funding last year with a contribution of $240 million. The United States has contributed $97 million so far in 1993, only a third of the $280 million it must provide if it is to continue shouldering 22 percent of the refugee bill.
"Vice President Al Gore promised me full Administration support when I visited Washington last month," Mrs. Ogata said. "But when I went to Capitol Hill, they didn't say no, but they said it won't be easy."
Mr. Chipman is more pessimistic. "I expect a temporary dip in American funding this year," he said.
The 12-nation European Community, the second-biggest contributor at $226 million last year, has fallen seriously behind. "This time last year they had reached 76 percent of their target, but this year they are only at 12 percent," Mr. Chipman said.
Mrs. Ogata said she was particularly worried by shrinking international support for refugee aid in Bosnia.
 
Effect of Cold War's End
 From 2.7 million in 1976, the number of refugees worldwide had nearly quadrupled to 10.3 million in 1982 before reaching 18.9 million last year as visions of post-cold-war stability crumbled and one disaster after another forced people to flee their homes.
Next year Mrs. Ogata feels the total might really start to decline as sizeable numbers of refugees return home in Central America, Mozambique, Somalia and perhaps parts of the former Yugoslavia. She hopes the High Commisioner's budget will then slip back to the $1 billion mark.
"But that's always provided we don't have another disaster, another civil war somewhere else," she warned.

HEADLINE: Call for Moscow Aid Office Splits Wealthy Nations

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The United States is pressing the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations to set up an office in Moscow to coordinate Western aid, but Britain and France oppose the idea, Western officials said this week.
The goal of the plan is to give the seven nations a more effective and aggressive role in distributing aid to Russia, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Germany backs the American proposal, and officials said Japan appears to be willing to go along. But Britain and France are resisting the idea on the grounds that it would create more bureaucracy in Moscow, which they maintain is already too bureaucratic. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Community and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development already have aid offices in Moscow, while the Group of Seven has always acted without a permanent office or staff.
Some monetary fund officials also dislike the American proposal because they fear it would reduce the commanding role the Group of Seven gave the fund last year to oversee economic aid and advice to Russia.
 
Americans See a Missing Link
 But American officials see a missing link in the aid process: While the monetary fund provides advice on general economic policy, and the World Bank gives aid and advice for specific industries, no one is coordinating the billions of dollars in country-to-country aid the seven leading industrialized nations are providing. In addition to the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and France, the Group of Seven includes Canada and Italy.
Officials who support a Group of Seven office said its staff would survey the Russian economy and suggest where new aid might be needed. One official suggested that the office might work with Russian officials to help them jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to speed aid from the World Bank and the monetary fund.
American officials say they hope their proposal to open the Moscow office will win enough backing to be approved by the Group of Seven's leaders when they assemble on July 7 in Tokyo for their annual economic conference.
The American plan was discussed Thursday and Friday at a meeting of the group's deputy finance ministers in New York, and officials said the plan was not aimed at diminishing the role of the monetary fund and World Bank.
 
Bentsen Criticizes Camdessus
 Nonetheless, the proposal comes at a time when Clinton Administration officials have publicly criticized the monetary fund for dragging its feet on aid. In an unusual personal criticism, Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen criticized the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, by name last week for not having already provided a $1.5 billion loan promised to Russia.
Fund officials said Mr. Camdessus would ask the fund's executive board to approve the loan before the Group of Seven conference. That would enable group leaders to give the good news to President Boris N. Yeltsin at the Tokyo meeting.
Fund officials said that before seeking approval for the loan, Mr. Camdessus wanted Moscow to take certain basic steps to show its commitment to stabilizing its economy and reducing inflation, such as raising interest rates. But some American officials said Mr. Yeltsin had already demonstrated that commitment, and that the aid should already be flowing.
French and British officials said in interviews that they feared a permanent office in Moscow could be the first step in creating an official institutional bureaucracy for the Group of Seven, and that they preferred a coordinating mechanism that was less ambitious.
 
Yet Another Office
 "If you have yet another office, one labeled G-7, how is that going to help?" one European official asked.
Some Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said France objects to the plan in part because it fears that the group's office would be dominated by the United States. One French official said that if the group opens an office in Moscow, it might face pressure to open offices elsewhere, perhaps in Ukraine or India. British officials said they were not irrevocably opposed to the American idea, but that they remained unconvinced that a new office would improve the distribution of aid or the advice Russia receives.
Better than a new office, one British official said, would be some forum led by the Russians that would bring together the ambassadors of the seven nations to Moscow.
Jeffrey Sachs, a prominent professor of economics at Harvard who advises the Russian Government, said that a Group of Seven office was needed because, in his view, the monetary fund and World Bank have not acted vigorously enough in helping Moscow. He contends that the lending institutions are being overly cautious just when Russia is undergoing drastic change and needs quick financial aid to lessen its trauma and undertake further painful reforms.
"Maybe they were miscast as leaders," he said. "Therefore maybe the United States has become the leader. But then it needs a different coordinating mechanism."
Several officials said they expected the group to agree on a plan over the next few weeks that would be less ambitious and potentially less bureaucratic than the American proposal.

HEADLINE: Questions About Wealthy At Heart of Rent Debate

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18

 BODY:
At the heart of the legislative battle over rent laws is a basic question: Should the wealthy continue to benefit from rent regulation, a system that protects thousands of New Yorkers from drastic rent increases?
The answer is an emphatic "No," say many landlords and their supporters in the Legislature. And to bolster their arguments, they trot out the names of several well-to-do celebrities who they say milk the system by living in rent-stabilized apartments at posh Manhattan addresses. 
 But the question has been complicated by the difficulty of defining wealth in a city where real-estate prices are perceived by many to be exorbitant and where housing can be difficult to come by.
The question of whether wealthy people should benefit from rent regulation laws is one of the major issues facing the Legislature as it considers proposals that could bring some of the most drastic changes to the city's rent-control system since it was developed in the 1940's.
 
Another Deadline Looms
 Although the Legislature dodged one deadline last week involving extending or altering the system, it faces another on Wednesday. Among the proposals being considered is the ending of rent-stabilization protection for people who make more than $100,000 a year or who rent an apartment for more than $2,000 a month.
Advocates for tenants are lobbying against the slightest change in the current system, which allows anyone, regardless of income, to lease a rent-stabilized apartment. Tenants' advocates say the exclusion of some people from the system, no matter how few, would set a dangerous precedent.
They are also particularly afraid of another proposal that would end rent stabilization on apartments as they become vacant, allowing landlords to charge whatever the market will bear. Tenant supporters believe that measure would completely deplete the stock of rent-regulated apartments in 15 years.
"The judgment of 50 years of Democrats and Republicans is that this system is better than the alternative," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who along with the Democrat-led Assembly supports the tenants' position. "When you try to get the occasional movie actress who has a rent-controlled apartment, you endanger two million middle-class people."
 
No Complex Calculation
 Regulations that limit rent increases on nearly 900,000 apartments in New York City and surrounding counties came within minutes of expiring last Tuesday night, with the Assembly and several Republican Senators from New York City at odds with leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate, who support the landlords. Although a late-night compromise was struck to extend the laws by eight days, legislative leaders have only a few more days to resolve their differences before the laws are again in jeopardy.
Although complaints about wealthy people taking advantage of the system have been voiced for years, officials say this year's fight promises to be among the most hard fought. Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Garden City, L.I., who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Housing and Community Renewal, said the focus on people making more than $100,000 was not based on any complex mathematical calculation.
"It was my judgment," he said, "that to objective onlookers, $100,000 in income or $2,000 in rent was certainly upper class."
Estimates of the number of rent-stabilized apartments in New York City that fit the Senator's definition range from 20,000 to 32,000 -- a small percentage of the city's nearly 800,000 rent-stabilized units. Michael McKee, a tenant advocate, said the median household income for those living in rent-stabilized apartments in New York was $21,000 a year; the median income for rent-controlled apartments, which are usually cheaper and are gradually being phased out, was $12,075.
 
'Absolute, Direct Subsidy'
 The way Senator Hannon sees it, the current system gives the wealthy a subsidy by keeping their rents lower, thereby reducing the value of buildings and decreasing the property taxes paid on them. Lobbyists for landlords, including John J. Gilbert, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, believe New York City could collect tens of millions of dollars in additional property taxes by freeing the apartments of the wealthy from rent regulation.
"It's an absolute, direct subsidy," Mr. Gilbert said. "It's a subsidy with a means test and the means test is serendipity, being in the right place at the right time."
But Mr. McKee, chairman of the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, objects strenuously to the characterization of rent regulation as a subsidy. The system, he said, serves as a marketwide mechanism to protect all tenants from rent increases and eviction during a housing crisis.
"It does protect people," Mr. McKee said. "It protects poor people. It protects the middle class. It keeps the middle class in the city and therefore protects its economic base. It makes housing more affordable and the city more livable."
 
Definition of Wealthy
 Mr. McKee and other tenant advocates questioned the choice of the $100,000 benchmark, saying it is not necessarily a lot of money for a household in New York City, particularly if a family is caring for a chronically-ill relative or putting children through college. And what, he wonders, would happen under Mr. Hannon's proposal to a group of recent college graduates who pooled their resources to live in an apartment and, when combined, had a household income of $100,000. Would they be considered wealthy?
To which Mr. Hannon replied: "The yuppies? I'm sorry. I wish I had that out of college."
Other troubling questions, tenant advocates say, concern how such a program would be administered, who would pay the administrative costs, which agency would verify tenants' incomes and, if that verification involved the examination of confidential tax records, would it be an invasion of privacy?
Senator Hannon argues that the process could begin with a simple, annual question from landlord to tenant: Is your income above or below $100,000? For verification purposes, the process could involve any of several state agencies, perhaps communicating by computer. He said he would strive to make such a system "the least intrusive and most administratively simple."

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
Clinton Issues Call to Arms at Northeastern U.

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 19

 BODY:
President Clinton told a cheering audience of Northeastern University graduates today that their futures depended on the ability of leaders in Washington to make tough decisions, and he challenged recalcitrant politicians in Congress to start making some.
Mr. Clinton made no effort to hide the campaign-style nature of his remarks, directing his criticism at opponents in Congress who he said have opposed his plan to reduce the deficit and raise taxes without providing workable alternatives. 
 "My job is to make your future worthy of the efforts that brought you here today, to try to help to create a national interest that triumphs over anybody's special interests," Mr. Clinton told 2,195 graduates and their guests in the sweltering Boston Garden arena. "You have done your part. It is now time for the leadership of the country to do ours."
Such a call to arms, on this occasion cloaked in the high-minded rhetoric suitable for an academic ceremony, has become common for the President. But today, Mr. Clinton had a special mission: he sought to capitalize on the week's successes, including the passage of an amended version of his economic plan by the Senate Finance Committee.
The theme of the President's remarks was repeated today in his weekly radio address, in which he accused his political opponents of "playing politics with your economic future, screaming old slogans like 'tax and spend.' "
Mr. Clinton, who received more than 200 invitations to speak at college commencements this year, said he chose Northeastern because the university required its students to work off campus.
Mr. Clinton was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service today and congratulated the graduates who greeted him with high-five hand slaps and barking cheers for "surviving the Boston traffic jams."
"That's the second greatest example of gridlock in the United States," he said.
Mr. Clinton was accompanied today by Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts; Michael S. Dukakis, the former Governor of Massachusetts who was the 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee, and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, whom Mr. Clinton has nominated as Ambassador to the Vatican.
 
Northwestern University
 Georgie Anne Geyer, the columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, delivered the main address yesterday to 4,312 graduates at Northwestern University's 135th commencement exercises on the Evanston, Ill., campus.
A Northwestern alumna, Ms. Geyer was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
"The problem for the United States in your lifetime will, strangely enough, be related to the problems we see in the Yugoslavias, the Tajikistans and indeed the Russias of our world," Ms. Geyer said. "It is the problem of national and cultural disintegration. For in our own way we are allowing organizers, activists and ambition-ridden political putative leaders to divide this country in much the same ways that Yugoslavia has been deliberately divided since 1987."
In addition to Ms. Geyer, the university awarded honorary degrees to Bruno Bartoletti, artistic director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago; the Rev. Raymond Baumhart, president of Loyola University of Chicago; Cyrus R. Vance, the former Secretary of State; William J. Wilson, professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Chicago, and Richard N. Zare, professor of chemistry at Stanford University.

HEADLINE: Mayors, Meeting in New York, Have Eyes Set on Washington

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Five months after a new President took office with a pledge to tackle the problems of the nation's cities, more than 200 mayors gathered in Manhattan yesterday for a meeting dominated by the question: what happened to the early promise of the Clinton Administration?
Many at the 61st convention of the United States Conference of Mayors said that despite Mr. Clinton's stumbles, they were still optimistic that he would succeed in helping their cities. But they also said they were disappointed that some of his legislation had foundered -- although they went out of their away to avoid criticizing the President personally. 
 "As an executive I recognize that very often the initiatives that we propose are not able to be achieved," Mayor David N. Dinkins said, referring to the President's proposed economic stimulus package, which would have included grants to New York City. "The failure of that legislation meant $175 million. I am gravely wounded by it."
 
Hopes for a Reversal
 Some mayors acknowledged that they may have harbored unreasonably high hopes that a Democratic President might reverse the pattern of Republican Presidents who, the mayors said, ignored the needs of the cities.
"We were so excited after having 12 years of being out in the desert, that there was a real question of whether it was humanly possible for any individual to reach our expectations," said Mayor Jerry E. Abramson of Louisville, Ky., a Democrat.
The mayors were to have met in Colorado Springs, but after Colorado voters last November approved a constitutional amendment banning special protection for gay people under civil rights laws, Mr. Dinkins persuaded the mayors to come to New York. The mayors, and representatives of other organizations involved in urban issues, are meeting at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in midtown.
 
Anger Toward Republicans
 While there was some grumbling about the President's decision not to address the conference in person -- he will instead deliver a speech by satellite -- the mayors directed much of their anger toward Republicans in Congress who prevented passage of the economic stimulus bill in April. The legislation would have provided money for extra unemployment benefits, education, highways and other public improvements and summer jobs.
Even the president of the conference, Mayor William J. Althaus, a Republican from York, Pa., assailed his fellow party members. Mr. Althaus described the filibuster by Republican Senators that doomed the package as "unconscionable."
"When they took inner-city low-income swimming pool renovations and said, 'No, that's pork,' what I heard was, 'The United States Senate can have a swimming pool, but the poor children of my city cannot,' " he said. "And that offends."
Even though the mayors seemed sobered by the last few months, they said they had not lost faith in Mr. Clinton.
"The Cabinet that this President has is one that is tremendously receptive," Mr. Dinkins said. "The whole attitude is vastly different."

HEADLINE: Israel Seeks to Keep North Korea From Aiding Iran

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 19

 BODY:
Although the countries have no diplomatic relations, Israel has quietly had a series of contacts with North Korea, hoping that a lure of economic cooperation may stop the Koreans from providing nuclear technology and a nuclear-capable missile to Iran, officials here say.
The missile, Rodong 1, also known as Scud-D, is still being developed. But Israeli officials have already expressed great concern because it is believed able to carry nuclear or chemical warheads and because, unlike earlier generations of the Scud, it has a stated range of about 600 miles and would put Israel within striking distance of missile sites in western Iran. 
 Similarly, Japanese officials fear that the Rodong 1 would enable the North Koreans to hit some of their most populous cities.
The worry here is that the hard-pressed Pyongyang Government plans the missile mostly for export, and intends to sell it to Iran in return for oil. "As far as I know, Iran has placed an order for 150 of these missiles and has sent five high-ranking delegations to North Korea this year," said Prof. Ben-Ami Shillony, an expert in East Asian affairs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
"The Iranian threat is taken very seriously," an Israeli official said, adding that the worries extend to technological help North Korea is reportedly giving to Iran's attempts to become a nuclear power. "These missiles are in a trial stage, and can be stopped if one makes an effort."
As a result, Israel has discussed possible business ventures with Pyongyang, the goal being to make it economically worthwhile for the North Koreans to abandon their planned missile sales. Officials here say the North Koreans have been eager negotiators, going so far as to offer to sell Israel a gold mine in their attempts to raise cash and ease their diplomatic isolation.
The officials said the contacts began in October with a secret visit by senior Israeli officials to Pyongyang but were suspended recently at the urging of the United States. Washington wanted to deepen the North Koreans' isolation after they had announced in March that they would withdraw from the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
On June 11 the Koreans agreed to suspend the withdrawal, although they gave no sign that they would let inspectors look at their most sensitive nuclear sites. Three days later, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel met in Vienna with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and asked for permission to resume contacts with North Korea in light of the latest shift by Pyongyang, Israeli officials said.
Officials said this week that Washington had given them a go-ahead, confirming a report in the newspaper Davar that Eitan Bentsur, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director general, would leave soon for Pyongyang to restart negotiations.
According to press reports here, the North Koreans have discussed the possibility of $1 billion in investments, both from Israel and from Jewish-owned businesses elsewhere that might respond to Israeli appeals. But Government officials asserted that the talks have not reached that sort of detail.
"We haven't reached that phase yet," an official said. "They didn't say that if they get X billion dollars, they won't sell missiles to Iran."
In recent months, Israelis have been warning with increasing insistence about Iran's nuclear program, which has received assistance from China as well as North Korea, and the threat they say it presents to this country and to the entire Middle East. The Israelis have long been presumed to have their own nuclear capability. But they regard it as their equalizer in a hostile region, and say the balance would be lost if other countries followed suit, especially an implacable enemy like Iran under strict Islamic rule.
With North Korea, the Israelis say, their goals are limited to preventing missile and nuclear-technology sales to Teheran, and they are not pursuing formal ties. "It's a courtship with a very precise strategic aim," the official said.
Israel has diplomatic relations with South Korea.

HEADLINE: NO QUICK SOLUTION IN HAITI FORESEEN

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 18

 BODY:
Diplomats involved in efforts to resolve Haiti's nearly 21-month political crisis say they consider it unlikely that Haitian military leaders will respond positively to a United Nations oil embargo imposed on their country until the reality of functioning without fuel sinks in.
Haiti's oil supplies, needed for transportation, power generation and industry, are thought to guarantee four to six weeks of normal consumption. 
 The diplomats do not rule out the possibility that conversations with senior Haitian military officers and political leaders before the sanctions take effect on Wednesday may lead to a breakthrough. But they said there was little sign that Haiti's military leaders were ready to begin good-faith discussions on the restoration of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Father Aristide was overthrown by the Haitian Army in a violent coup on Sept. 29, 1991.
 
Role of Dominican Republic
 Diplomats involved in mediation efforts in Haiti say they will approach the Government of the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola, to ask that it prevent overland oil shipments, which would be Haiti's only source of supply if the United Nations oil embargo is enforced.
In recent weeks the Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, who had a tense relationship with President Aristide during his brief tenure in office, has criticized international sanctions against Haiti's military-backed Government. But diplomats said poor roads linking the two countries, a legacy of difficult relations, would sharply limit the amount of fuel that could travel overland.
Haiti's authorities have frustrated repeated diplomatic initiatives aimed at restoring Father Aristide. Diplomats involved in the mediation said they believed that even now, given a last-minute removal of enforcement provisions in the Security Council action that would have allowed the inspection of ships steaming to Haiti, the military believed that life would continue as usual.
United Nations officials said they were confident that the Security Council would obtain international cooperation in cutting off Haitian oil supplies.
People close to the Haitian military high command said on Friday that the army Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, had said in recent days that only United States military action in Haiti could force his army to accept Father Aristide's return under conditions laid out by the United Nations. Those conditions include the departure of the present high command and the return of the exiled President after he forms a new Government.
 
Aristide Cool to Direct Talks
 Diplomats said the efforts had been complicated by Father Aristide's own reluctance to take part in direct talks with the army.
Reaction among people opposed to Father Aristide in the political and economic elite has been a mixture of nervous defiance and fatalism.
"We have been under an embargo for 200 years, and we are the poorest country in the hemisphere," said Ebrane Cadet, a senator who opposes Father Aristide's return.
Among Haitian business people, many predicted the collapse of the country's currency, the gourde, and a progressive halt to economic activity if the sanctions were rigorously applied.
"I know a lot of people who are very mad and starting to be afraid," said one leading businessman, who like most spoke only on condition of anonymity. "They are afraid because sanctions will change their lives. But if Aristide comes back, it will be civil war. We will start having a lot of killings."
Many in Haiti's tiny elite strongly oppose the return of Father Aristide, a populist priest, whom they consider to be an advocate of violent class struggle. Feelings like these have not softened, even though Father Aristide, since his exile, has repeatedly spoken of his belief in nonviolent change.

Rudolph's Legacy: Triumphs Over Pain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WILMA RUDOLPH sat in an oversized chair looking very cool, very casual. The roses that had begun to arrive that morning in honor of her 53d birthday next Wednesday accented her natural elegance. It was what Ed Temple, her track coach at Tennessee State, liked to call "that charisima."
"I thought I'd be able to sneak this birthday in," she said smiling. "Everybody knows. It's really fascinating; I still get gifts and letters from people around the world." 
 There was another gift of sorts last night when Rudolph, along with Arnold Palmer, Ted Williams, Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, received the first National Sports Awards at Constitution Hall here.
Rudolph exploded on the international scene in 1960 during the Rome Olympics when she became the first American woman to win three gold medals in one Olympics.
By 1963, Rudolph had retired from competition. Call it pride, call it vanity, but she refused to run past her prime. She left at the top, and began a multifaceted career as a teacher, an inspirational speaker and, recently, the president of her own company, which basically schedules her appearances worldwide.
Earlier this month, Rudolph agreed to assist Berlin in the city's bid to bring the Olympic Games to Germany in the year 2000. She explained that many of her greatest triumphs occurred in Germany and that the German people have always treated her royally. Asked whether the memory of Hitler's snub of Jesse Owens -- her friend and mentor -- during the 1936 Berlin Games left a troubling residue in her mind, Rudolph said it did not.
"Remember, that as a race of people we've been discriminated against all our lives," she said. Rudolph pointed out that the year she won three gold medals in Rome, several American cities -- including Nashville, where she was a student at Tennessee State -- were torn by racial tension and violence over the question of whether blacks could even eat in segregated restaurants.
"Hitler's attitude toward blacks wasn't all that different from what attitudes were in the United States," she said.
At a time when female athletes are asserting their right to equal access to and distribution of college funds, it is fitting that Wilma Rudolph is the only woman selected for an inaugural National Sports Award. Rudolph more than any other athlete stirred the interest among women in track.
Nell Jackson, the first black Olympic track coach, explained: "Wilma's accomplishments opened up the real door for women in track because of her grace and beauty. People saw her as beauty in motion."
Few who saw the beauty in 1960, and few who see the grace today knew the suffering Rudolph endured to reach international acclaim. She is a testament to overcoming obstacles by making adversity an impetus for success.
The 20th of 22 children, she contracted polio at the age of 4 and suffered from pneumonia and scarlet fever. Rudolph survived the illnesses but lost the use of her left leg and was forced to wear leg braces. Her mother drove 45 miles on her off day for therapy, and her older brothers and sisters who had learned a massage technique designed to strengthen her leg, rubbed her down several times daily.
After five years, Rudolph shocked her doctor and mother by removing the cumbersome braces and walking unassisted. She wore a supportive shoe until she was 11. By 12 she was one of the fastest runners -- boy or girl -- in the neighborhood.
What she could not remove were the deep emotional scars inflicted by cruel playmates who teased her, called her names and ostracized her.
"Back then kids were not nice to people with braces," she said.

Under the tutelage of Temple, the legendary coach, Rudolph made the Olympic team in 1956 as a high school student at the age of 16 and earned a bronze medal for her part in 4 x 100 meter relay.
While her story is inspirational, Rudolph laments that duplicating it is becoming increasingly difficult for young athletes with potential. Not because of a scarcity of young people capable of overcoming odds, but because of fewer opportunities for economically disadvantaged young people to discover themselves -- and education -- through athletics.
"Business people and community groups -- especially in the black community -- have to step up and contribute," she said. "Until they do, we'll continue to have gangs and murders."
Wilma Rudolph is now firmly entrenched and at peace with her life's work: using athletics to help young people get from point A in their lives to point B.
During the next year she plans to expand her company's mission and establish community-based track and field programs in at least two cities through the use of private funding and matching government grants.
"If I left the earth today," she said, "my great moment would be knowing that I have tried to give something to young people."

Racing Report Ignoring The Key Question: How

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Many racing people reacted with skepticism yesterday to the report by the Governor's special commission on horse racing, and suggested that the commission had tried to be all things to all people in a business surrounded by red ink, an unknown future and politics.
Nobody disagreed with the warning issued by the chairman of the commission, Vincent Tese, who also serves as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's director of economic development: "Unless there is change in the way this industry does business, I can guarantee you that in three years the purses will be down. Unless there is change, this industry is in for a long, deep slide." 
 But having posed the problem, Tese and his eight fellow members of the commission produced a sweeping 100-page report that apparently tried to avoid stepping on too many political toes.
 
Real Question Is How
 For example, it ordered the New York Racing Association to open a dialogue leading to a merger with its longtime competitor, New York City's Offtrack Betting Corporation. But except for visualizing a "joint venture," it gave no clue to the sort of merger that might unite two natural enemies who fight for the lion's share of more than $1 billion a year in betting money.
The title of the report was certainly soaring: "Racing Into the 21st Century. A Plan to Reform, Restructure and Revitalize the Horse Racing, Parimutuel Wagering and Breeding Industry in New York State." But the scenario for reviving the industry was often lost in a mix of facts and fantasy.
In one pointless section (paragraph 7.3 of Appendix A, which blueprints the "joint venture" between the N.Y.R.A. and OTB), the report stipulates: "Meetings of the Board of Directors. The time, place and manner of holding meetings of the Board of Directors shall be determined by the Board of Directors."
 
Praise, But . . .
 But for now, the ranking officers of both organizations were circling each other with all deliberate wariness. Both expressed approval of the concept of working together, but neither expressed a desire to be swallowed up by the other.
Allan Dragone, chairman of the N.Y.R.A., congratulated Tese and his fellow commissioners "for the time and energy which was applied to examining the problems currently facing racing in New York State." He also sent a letter to the chairman of OTB, Ed Lewis, requesting a meeting and conceding that it would be useful to consolidate "certain operations." But he did not withdraw the N.Y.R.A.'s longstanding proposal to take over off-track betting.
Hazel Dukes, the president of OTB, also said she was grateful to the commission and looked forward to "a realistic dialogue" with the N.Y.R.A. But she added that the dialogue should lead to a future "that will be advantageous to all constituents in the industry, while continuing our mission of providing needed revenue for New York City."
 
Two Dissenters
 Two members of the commission attached a memorandum to the report that endorsed the concept of a joint venture between the N.Y.R.A. and OTB, but dissented strongly on creating a new state agency to run the show and on other proposals in the report.
The two dissenters -- State Senator Ronald Stafford, a Republican from Rochester, and Willard Anderson, a businessman from upstate -- also said: "There are countless issues and concerns that need to be addressed, discussed and resolved." As a result, they added, "we could not agree on a final draft prior to further discussions."
 
Aquilegia Wins at Belmont
 Scotty Schulhofer and Julie Krone, who teamed with Colonial Affair to win the Belmont Stakes two weeks ago, teamed with the filly Aquilegia yesterday to win the 50th running of the New York Handicap at Belmont Park.
Aquilegia, a 4-year-old daughter of Alydar, snatched the victory in the final lunge to the wire after Krone escaped a traffic trap by veering to the outside. They edged Via Borghese by a nose with Ginny Dare less than a length back in third place.

Looking at New Jersey, But Thinking of Queens

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
IT happens every spring, or so it seems, the rumble emanating from the Bronx concerning a potential move by the Yankees.
This time, though, the rumbles may be for real. George Steinbrenner, baseball's version of the boy who cried wolf, may be about to unleash a bite of his own. 
 Why? The Yankees are in a foot race with the Mets with ramifications far beyond the won-lost columns. And the Yankees are losing.
The Mets, sitting a universe away from the nearest pennant race, still outdraw the contending Yankees. Through 32 home games this season, the Mets have averaged 24,730 fans a game, or a total of 791,379. The Yankees' average through 34 games was 22,151 fans, or a total of 753,137.
The primary reason given for the lukewarm support is the location of Yankee Stadium, at 161st Street and River Avenue, in one of the poorer areas of the Bronx. To get there, fans must fight through an endless number of traffic jams spilling from area bridges. Then they must deal with a neighborhood frequently portrayed as one plagued by high crime.
Whether that perception of crime is also the reality could surely be debated for days. The fact is, the Yankees have used the argument and the public appears to be listening, as the attendance shows.

 If that were not enough, now there is a potentially new and back-breaking threat on the horizon. For it is one thing to have to compete with the Mets as that team sits out in relatively better environs at Shea Stadium on Flushing Bay. It's another to look into the future and picture the Mets sitting in what may be the city's ultimate sports complex/mega convention-entertainment center.
For the Mets are talking about building anew near Shea's present site. The proposal, being vigorously pursued by the team's co-owner, Fred Wilpon, calls for a huge complex with a domed stadium, a new subway spur and tons of parking, both for baseball and hard-pressed La Guardia Airport. Preliminary discussions with the city, the Port Authority and the Transit Authority, are under way. That underscores one thing, said an executive familiar with the team's proposal: "The Mets are very, very serious about the project and equipped with a terrific concept."
Since the state and the city will have to make some tough financial calls on the proposal, one has to wonder if either level of government is economically equipped to help out both the Mets and Yankees. Assuming that there is but a finite amount of money that can be given or raised, it makes sense that Steinbrenner's eagerness to push for a solution is keener than ever.
Now both Wilpon, a developer of some renown, and Steinbrenner have clout. Steinbrenner also has to hope he has other resources. The most important, of course, is leverage. And that includes the ultimate threat: picking up and moving.
Given the scenarios, there should be some antsiness in the Bronx. Residents there see no one riding in suggesting a mammoth undertaking like the one proposed in Flushing; Steinbrenner certainly hasn't. All they hear from him and his team is talk of moving, the tone of which suggests there's more to all this than your usual bluff-calling, headline-seeking, election-year arm-twisting.
And let's face it, the Yankees do have some legitimate complaints. The area around Yankee Stadium, if not as crime-infested as touted, is, at minimum, in great need of refurbishment. The argument over who failed in previous negotiations -- the city or the Yankees -- doesn't matter, now. The fact is, the needed care hasn't come and that neglect has ushered in a crisis.
If the city won't give the Yankees the parking and safe avenues to the stadium that Steinbrenner has demanded for years, or come up with a viable alternative in Manhattan or another borough, New Jersey could.
In the past, Steinbrenner was told by at least two previous baseball commissioners he could move to the Meadowlands, where a promised 3 million fans a year await. But there was a catch -- he could go, but the team name would stay in New York. For obvious reasons, Steinbrenner didn't jump at the prospect of parting with the most famous and marketable team identity in history. Now, though, there's no commissioner to put up any such impediments. And there's little belief that Steinbrenner's fellow owners would or could stop him.
"It could happen if the city doesn't take it very seriously," said yet another executive who is acutely familiar with Steinbrenner's arguments for a change, if not a move. "And it could happen, anyway, because I think George's strategy will be to force the city into playing hardball with him if he can, then use that as an excuse to go."

 No less than Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins seem to realize that, now, too. On Thursday, Cuomo said the state was willing to work with the Yankees to see what can be done to improve the current site. He also said that the state would consider offering revenue-generating bonds to both teams to assure they relocate within the state.
Now to some, it probably seems obscene that a city or a state seemingly cares more about the finances of the Yankees than about the hard-pressed families living right next to the stadium. Others might argue that the issue here is not the Yankees, but more potential flight from the Bronx. The Yankees, like any other corporation, are an integral part of the Bronx's financial web. If they leave, any dream of revival dies a little more.
"It's a very tough issue," the second executive said. "Taking a conservative view, it's difficult to justify putting public money up. The problem is New Jersey will put it up. It is, after all, a competitive world."
The Mets and the Yankees know that more than ever, especially since the arena and the prize -- New York City -- are one and the same.

HEADLINE: Sharpening the Focus and Going Global at Dresser

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE pact that Dresser Industries signed a few months ago to build gas turbines and compressors in Russia was a classic example of how John J. Murphy has reshaped the nation's most diverse supplier of energy-related equipment.
The deal required little capital from Dresser and involved a huge customer -- in this case Russia's dominant producer, transporter and distributor of natural gas, Gazprom. And some analysts think the deal will help push Dresser's yearly revenues from Russian deals above $400 million by 1996, from about $100 million last year. 
 The Gazprom deal is emblematic of Mr. Murphy's strategy since taking over as Dresser's chief executive 10 years ago in August. Since then, Dresser has become more tied to the global energy market than its three prominent rivals in the oil-field service sector, Schlumberger Ltd., the Halliburton Company and Baker Hughes Inc.
Gazprom, for instance, delivers 32 trillion cubic feet of gas a year through its pipeline system -- far more than the 20 trillion cubic feet transported last year within the United States. Mr. Murphy says there is no telling how many turbine-and-compressor units will be built or how soon, or the profit potential for Dresser. But his best guess is that Gazprom will need at least 100 new units a year, worth about $8 million each.
"It will be substantial, I'm sure, but there are just too many variables," he said. "But we're a lot happier with 20 percent of a good deal than we would be with 100 percent of zero." Dresser will own up to 30 percent of the partnership with Gazprom and Kirovsky Zavod, the operator of the former military plant in St. Petersburg where the turbine-and-compressor units will be produced.
While making Dresser more global, the 61-year-old Mr. Murphy, only the sixth person to head the company in its 113-year history, has at the same time been narrowing its focus, hoping to exclusively supply global energy producers with products ranging from the pipeline couplings it sold in 1880 to multi-million-dollar plants for processing liquified natural gas.
Since he took command he has auctioned off more than 30 units, including a life insurer, an automobile leasing firm and a maker of fire hydrants. And he has bought 24 energy-related companies, generally at conservative prices, buying as he has at a time when oil prices were heading down from an average of $34 a barrel in 1981 to below $16 in 1986. Dresser also has an interest in four large joint ventures, which contributed more than $1 billion of its $4.8 billion in total revenue last year. The transformation, Mr. Murphy said, should allow Dresser this year to exceed his elusive objective of earning at least 15 percent on shareholder's equity for the first time since 1985.
BUT Mr. Murphy's disciplined march to overhaul Dresser has not produced as much for the company's stockholders in the last year as decisions by Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes to stick closer to oil-field services.
Surging natural-gas prices in the United States, which have nearly doubled from 15-year lows a year ago, inspired investors to stockpile shares of companies in the oil-field service industry on the logic that higher prices will raise drilling activity and orders for drilling equipment.
Shares of Halliburton and Baker Hughes have retreated somewhat from their early June highs and from their gains of about 70 percent since late last year. But they have soared far higher in that period than Dresser's, whose share price increased 36.2 percent to a high of $23.50 on June 7, from a low of $17.25 last July 8. It closed Friday unchanged, at $23.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
James L. Carroll, oil-field service analyst at Paine Webber Inc., estimated that Dresser is generating three-fourths of its operating income from projects unrelated to oil-field exploration and production, while the percentage is reversed for Halliburton and Baker Hughes. That means a rise in the drilling rate in North America, which increased for eight consecutive weeks until declining by 30 rigs this week to leave 681 exploring for oil and gas, will have a bigger and faster impact on profits for those companies than at Dresser. Dresser says acquisitions this year of TK Valve and Bredero Price should raise oil-field-related revenues to about 45 percent of the total.
"Dresser is well-positioned to participate in this long-term, downstream spending pattern," Mr. Carroll said. "It simply is not their turn yet."
Suzanne L. Cook, energy analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., said that investors have underestimated Dresser's prospects. "We don't think Dresser deserves the price discount," she said. "Its ability to grow and show good earnings momentum is not being completely recognized today."
OVERALL, Dresser's operating earnings fell slightly, to $22.2 million, from $23.9 million in the first half of the fiscal year, but would have risen if not for a special charges of $65 million. Revenues rose by 9.3 percent, to $2.0 billion, from $1.8 billion.
Fueling the improvement is the M. W. Kellogg Company, acquired in 1987 at $115 million, or just $35 million after Dresser applied $80 million in Kellogg's treasury toward the price. Kellogg's sales and profits have risen steadily since the deal because of rising orders for petrochemical plants, liquified natural-gas plants and other big petrochemical engineering projects. Its operating profit soared to $67.3 million last year, from $53.0 million in 1991, and doubled in the first six months of fiscal 1993, which ended April 30, to $25.7 million.
According to Mrs. Cook's estimates, Dresser's earnings will reach $1.10 per share for the fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, and at least $1.30 in 1994. Mr. Carroll's forecast was slightly lower, at $1.00 in the current fiscal year and $1.25 next year.
PROSPECTS further into the future hinge in large part on how much sales and profits eventually are mustered from Mr. Murphy's commitment to the promising but turbulent economies in Russia and China. By current measure, Saudi Arabia has the biggest oil reserves, at more than 260 billion barrels of the world's 1 trillion barrels.
But geologists for years have been intrigued by the crescent pattern in which hydrocarbon reserves have been discovered near the Persian Gulf, rising northward through Iran and into western Siberia. Many geologists at major oil companies believe the Russian reserves, currently listed at 60 billion barrels, actually exceed 400 billion barrels.
Mrs. Cook said that by some estimates 30 percent of all sales of oil-field services and equipment for exploration projects by oil companies could be focused in Russia and other former Soviet republics if political risks are reduced. Dresser has sold equipment from its Moscow office since 1930 and has the best knowledge of the Russian market, she said.
It would appear so. Mr. Murphy said that Dresser's deal with Gazprom and Kirovsky Zavod was initiated a year ago by Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then head of the Russian natural gas ministry and Gazprom's chairman, now Russia's Prime Minister.
Mr. Murphy, who has advised the last three Administrations on Washington's policies toward Moscow, said a deal was possible partly because the Russians agreed to pay Dresser in hard currency from gas exports. He concedes that Dresser's payoff in Russia may take years to develop, but soaring orders in Southeast Asia and China have persuaded him that that region is the world's strongest emerging energy market.
"If you think that economic growth and the financial well-being of people is the important thing, then China is right. The change there is phenomenal."

HEADLINE: Don't Let the Pesticide Polluters Fool You;
We're All Lab Animals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Mother Nature's Pesticide Factory" by Michael Fumento (Op-Ed, June 9): Environmentalists are correct in wanting to ban potentially toxic chemicals, and Carol Browner, Environmental Protection Administrator, is equally justified in seeking a revision of the Delaney Clause, though not for the right reasons.
Since 1958 the Delaney Clause has allowed innacurate and misleading data to steer regulation. Until the flawed methodology behind its guidelines is replaced, humans will continue to be industry's real guinea pigs, irrespective of the chemicals tested. 
 There are some 70,000 chemicals on the market, almost half in common use. Of these, only 800 have undergone standard rodent tests used to try to predict human cancer risks.
The cost of running a typical pre-chronic and long-term rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is $1.6 million to $2.5 million per chemical in 1986 dollars. With more than 25,000 commonly used chemicals awaiting evaluation, to test them all would cost $50 billion to $75 billion, not counting inflation and administrative costs.
As we have seen in the case of such pharmaceuticals as thalidomide and Bendectin, and chemicals that commonly find their way into our food chain like Alar, Captan and Lindane, animal tests do not prevent these chemicals from being marketed.
The diverging opinions of scientists, regulators and private research organizations about rodent bioassay results have too often led to repeated testing of the same chemicals at various doses in different species. Each new generation of testing further delays regulation and allows the proliferation of potentially dangerous chemicals in our environment.
While many toxicologists believe that completely replacing animal tests remains in the future, many are merely reluctant to abandon familiar methods to explore new ground. Countless nonanimal technologies around the world are awaiting validation, while others have been validated and used. X-ray technology has been used, with human cells and subjects, to measure the mutagenic effects of chemical agents accurately.
These modern and often technically superior methods are not only cost-effective, but also allow the dangers of individual chemicals to be observed in a few hours or days, as opposed to the 8 to 10 years needed for rodent bioassays.
Ultimately, if our aim is to protect human health, we need fewer pesticides, fewer food additives and fewer toxic ingredients in household products and cosmetics. These are not the myopic desires of "environmental extremists," as Mr. Fumento suggests. They are universally embraced by concerned individuals everywhere who want to protect their health and the environment.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut;
State Eases the Plight of Small Landlords

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN the final hours of the last day of the legislative session on June 9, Connecticut lawmakers made life marginally easier for the state's mom-and-pop landlords.
They passed a bill that permits direct payment of rent by city welfare agencies to the landlord after one month of nonpayment by the tenant. But measures that would speed the eviction process, and let towns require rent to be paid into the local housing court until the landlord gets a certificate of occupancy, did not reach the floor. Currently, tenants may stop paying rent when no such certificate exists. 
 The direct-payment measure, effective Oct. 1, is optional, not mandatory.
"It's not much, but it's a step," said William Cornish, president of the New London Association of Landlords. Retired from his 30-year job at Southern New England Telephone, he relies on income from 16 low-priced rental units and a small grocery store.
His association is one of several formed throughout the state to lobby the legislature. The first emerged in 1990 in Willimantic, when William C. Meehan, a former teacher, founded the Windham County Landlords Association with 10 members. It now has 150.
"This is a source of income mostly for retired people," he said. But landlords say that it has turned sour during the recession and that an influx of low-income tenants or tenants on welfare who don't pay rent has devastated small landlords.
"Tenants use their government subsidies for other things," said Mr. Meehan.
Unable to deal with unfamiliar court proceedings or because of day jobs, landlords usually hire lawyers to handle evictions. "The lawyers often can't meet deadlines, tenants don't show up and proceedings are delayed for months, costing thousands of dollars in legal fees," Mr. Meehan said.
Ted Sackowski, the Tolland County Sheriff, serves the notices of eviction and eventually removes tenants and their belongings. "There has been a dramatic increase in evictions in the past three years," he said, "about 25 percent, primarily in 3- to 5-family units with rents around $400 a month."
Most owners of such properties, bought during the 80's, now find that the buildings are worth far less. Often the rents don't cover the mortgage and tax payments and banks won't reduce interest rates as they do for one-family homeowners.
"THE banks are becoming the largest property owners in the area," said Kevin Skiest, president of the 100-member New Haven Landlords Association, formed last year. "The market adjusted the rent numbers downward, now we need to adjust the expense numbers."
A total of 3,843 evictions were recorded by the Housing Section of the New Haven Superior Court last year; through May of this year there have been 1,457.
"In the last two years there have been a lot of foreclosures," said Suzanne Colasanto, chief clerk for housing matters at the court. "The banks sometimes evict because they feel they can market the property better without tenants. They have that right if the lease subordinates to the mortgage holder." She noted that evictions could take from six weeks "to the end of time." Three months is the average.
Mr. Cornish believes the recession is only partly to blame. "Poorly written and managed laws favor the delinquent tenant," he said, "so landlords are boarding up the buildings and giving them back to the banks.
"New London has more homeless people than ever before," Mr. Cornish said, "and last year the city had its first auction of residential buildings for taxes."
A major sticking point with small landlords is the elimination of mandatory direct payment of rent to the landlord by the city welfare agencies. "It was a help," said Mr. Cornish. But last year the legislature made it voluntary, and the cities stopped doing it to avoid the clerical work.
Behind the change was a philosophical component that Claudette Beaulier, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Income Maintenance, explained. "The legislature wanted recipients to be more independent, to accept responsibility and learn to manage money."
"We reimburse the towns for 85 percent of their expenditures in General Assistance," she continued. "The towns still have the option of making direct payments to landlords."
Reductions in state benefits from $325 a month for rent to $314 has increased applications for assistance with evictions at New Haven's Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit agency serving families with incomes under $18,000 and individuals earning less than $9,000.
"Unless the landlord is not providing heat and hot water, or the rent is excessive, or there are no smoke detectors, or there is lead paint present, we can't take these cases," said Angelica Allen, head of the organization's housing unit.
WHEN such conditions exist the landlord is expected to correct them to get a certificate of occupancy, required for each new tenant. "The majority of owners don't have them," said Kenneth Rideout, head of a landlords' association in Granby, "because the process is so cumbersome, and landlords are afraid of minor reasons why a certificate would not be issued." He owns an eight-unit building.
"First thing tenants do when evicted is call us to ask if there's a C.O.," said Norman Winuk, acting chief of the New Britain Building Inspector's office. "Then they call for an inspection, which can take a couple of weeks. The tenant can be uncooperative -- make excuses not to let the landlord in to fix the violations, or he breaks whatever was fixed. Meanwhile he doesn't have to pay rent for months."
For some, of course, the very word "landlord" is a red flag. But the small army of residential landlords in Connecticut, some 600 of whom have joined regional landlord associations to date, is trying to change that.
"We call ourselves the New Britain Apartment Owners Association of Hartford County," said Mr. Rideout. "Landlord has a negative connotation. We want to focus on educational forums for members and we are working up a data base for the use of tenants and landlords alike."
Buying supplies and appliances in bulk, swapping equipment, a referral system, and property insurance are other services that the associations hope to provide.
"We don't need more affordable housing," said Mr. Meehan in Willimantic. "We need to bring down the cost of what exists."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday in copies distributed in Connecticut and Westchester, about small-landlord associations, included an erroneous status report from a legislative aide on a measure in the Connecticut Legislature. The measure, allowing towns to require tenants to pay rent into escrow accounts when landlords lack certificates of occupancy, did reach the floor, and was passed.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Railroads Are a Growth Industry, for a Change

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
IN Washington, the Virginia Railway Express is about to celebrate its first anniversary, carrying commuters from Union Station to Manassas and Fredericksburg. Amtrak is well on the way to a historic improvement in the tracks from New York to Boston, electrifying those east of New Haven with overhead power lines that will allow faster trips, possibly luring substantial patronage from the air shuttles. And in Miami, a makeshift commuter line that helped to ease traffic to West Palm Beach during major construction on Interstate 95 is now permanent.
Railroads are trying to make a comeback.
Around the country, air pollution from cars seems to be a nearly intractable problem, and society is concluding that in many places it cannot build enough highways or runways to cure congestion. The decision to build commuter rail lines, said William E. Loftus, president of the American Short Line Railroad Association, is "a recognition that you can live an hour away from work and still have a pleasant commute." 
 Washington is offering more help of late, in the guise of anti-recession employment programs. The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 are also a factor, calling on areas with the worst pollution to reduce the number of miles cars are driven.
According to Ross B. Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, plans are afoot for commuters in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Jose, San Diego, Seattle and Tampa -- major cities without any commuter rail service.
New York's Metro-North Commuter Railroad is studying whether it can run to the beaches of Long Island, far from its territory. Last week it said that a bridge or tunnel across the Hudson River to the fast-growing suburbs of Rockland and Orange counties would be cost-effective, but well over $1 billion. What is striking is that Metro-North's expansion involves new tracks and new rights-of-way. The last new tracks in the area the railroad serves were laid before the turn of the century.
But it's not always easy. Boston planners are trying to determine if they can connect North Station and South Station, which would allow a traveler to go seamlessly from Maine to Miami; the only unbroken route for that journey today is the interstate highway. The connection, some of it passing underneath the subway system, is estimated to cost $1.8 billion. All the construction would be done by union workers. A hundred years ago, railroad companies took cheap labor right off the boat and laid track almost anywhere they pleased.
Hitches in Metro-North's idea for the Long Island beach train are simple but annoying, like the third rail: trains in the northern suburbs pick up power from a shoe that slides under the rail; on Long Island the train shoes slide on top.
And there are money questions. Metro-North justifies the heavy tax subsidy of its lines -- 45 percent of operating expenses and 100 percent of capital expenses -- as being a benefit to society. Specifically, each car not driven to mid-town Manhattan during a weekday rush hour is said to be worth $14.25 in reduced congestion and pollution.
Is a car not driven on the Long Island Expressway on a sunny July Saturday worth the same amount? Is a journey generated simply because the rail link is available something the rest of the region should subsidize? The questions raise deep, impassioned debates over the alternative, cars. The private auto enjoys various subsidies, from the general tax dollars that go into road maintenance to the right to pollute the air to the use of the United States Army to keep Middle East oil fields out of hostile hands.
But incrementally, train service is returning. One indication is the backlog of orders for railroad passenger cars; five years ago, as measured by Railway Age, it was 946 cars, and at the beginning of this year it was 2,221.
 
More People, Fewer Stops

 
 According to the American Public Transit Association, commuter rail trips totaled 324 million in 1991, a slight dip from the previous year, probably because of recession, but way up from the recent past; in 1975 the number was 260 million.
In the intercity market, Amtrak is now logging 6 billion passenger-miles each year. In 1970, the year before Amtrak began operating, the national total was less than 5 billion miles. The growth is particularly significant because the number of cities served has declined, which means that more people want to ride the trains even if they are going to fewer destinations.
"Many people are just beginning to realize how congested the roads and highways are," said Molly A. Hart, vice president of the Railway Progress Institute, a trade association based in Washington.
Metro-North argues that a rail line can carry a 1,000-passenger train every 2.5 minutes, or 24,000 passengers an hour; a traffic lane would carry only about 2,000 cars, the railroad calculates. At an average occupancy of six people for every five cars, that is only 2,400 people. And while the train goes a mile on three gallons of diesel oil, moving the same 1,000 people would take 835 cars, burning about 33 gallons a mile.
Mr. Capon of the National Association of Railroad Passengers noted that since 1988 Amtrak has returned to such diverse cities as Santa Barbara and Bakersfield in California, Houston, Montgomery and Birmingham, Milwaukee and Atlantic City. On other routes, frequency has increased to once a day instead of two or three times a week.
But there is still far to go. A Swedish express train, the X-2000, ran in commercial service from Boston to Washington earlier this year and attracted raves because its design enables it to travel fast around curves. Then it went on tour to Buffalo, Chicago, St. Louis and various stops in Wisconsin, Washington and Oregon; it may still go to California, New Mexico and Ohio. But most of those places have no electrification, so the train had to be pulled by old-fashioned diesel engines.

POWERFUL PEOPLE maneuver for position," said the outsider Bill Clinton about Washington moments after he was sworn in as the 42d President, "and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down." The new man's derogation of clout was in the grand tradition; leaders always resist outside assessments of the jockeying for power that goes on within. King Lear derided the way "poor rogues talk of court news," which he described as essentially "who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out."
Three months into his Presidency, Clinton was still deriding as a "political smoke screen" reports that "somebody's up and somebody's down." But soon afterward, he had to backtrack: "We think that there needs to be a little tighter coordination here," he admitted, and announced that his chief of staff, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, was being given a second deputy, freeing Clinton's best friend from kindergarten days to give unspecified policy advice. 
 We poor rogues talking of court news could tell that somebody was surely up (in that case, Roy Neel, Al Gore's chief aide and an experienced Senate hand), and somebody was at least seen to be down ("Mack the Nice," as the courteous McLarty is known). That was the first public sign that the power lines of the Clintonites were being adjusted to reflect the realities of administering a Government and wrestling with the negative reaction to its surprising early ideological shift.
A couple of weeks later, after a flip-flop by Christopher and a haircut from Cristophe increased the Presidential nose dive in opinion polls to warp speed, the up-and-downing intensified. Clinton, deciding to blame communications more than content for his plunge, put David Gergen, a Nixon-Ford-Reagan Old Pro, out front and pulled the media-battered George Stephanopoulos in close.
People -- appointees -- determine policy. The Earl of Chesterfield's idealistic assertion that "measures, not men, has always been my mark" was nicely skewered by George Canning in 1801 as "the idle supposition that it is the harness and not the horses that draw the chariot along."
The warm desire for diversity and the cold political trade-offs that led to the molasseslike peopling of the Clinton Administration have given way to the force of personality in small meetings and examples of good and bad judgment in public view. The little boxes and dotted lines on a table of organization are shaking down to "guys we can trust and guys we're stuck with."
BILL CLINTON IS THE first President in American history to entrust the top power positions in his Administration to two people he cannot fire: the First Lady and the Vice President. He could not fire his lifelong best friend, the chief of staff, either, which explains why the selfless McLarty, along with the alter ego Stephanopoulos, were elevated to more advisory positions -- with others being inserted as "the Hammer" or "the Persuader" alongside them.
Some Clinton watchers thought the disciplinary role -- which Mack insists that he had planned from the start, but that his choice, Harold Ickes Jr. of New York, ran into flak -- would go to Rahm Emanuel, 33, a hard-edged, soft-eyed former Chicagoan with the grace of a ballet dancer who squeezed $100 million out of fat cats to finance the campaign. ("If you had a flow chart," Emanuel says of those halcyon days, "it would be a kaleidoscope.") But he remains the political director, running the daily 5 P.M. meeting in the Ward Room of the White House mess, with David Wilhelm, the Friend of Bill who now runs the Democratic National Committee; Mandy Grunwald, the media maven; Stan Greenberg, the pollster; David Dreyer, the press aide who doubles as a speech writer; Dee Dee Myers, the formerly token press secretary who is now assuming a more traditional, out-front position in briefing the press, and James Carville and Paul Begala, the pop-'em-with-populism campaign consultants, along with schedulers and advancers.
These are the image-protectors and Permanent Campaigners, trying to figure out how Mike Deaver did it in the first Reagan term and wondering why the Inaugural air has gone out of the balloon. Their goal, as Emanuel puts it: "To make Clinton the first Democratic President since Roosevelt to be re-elected." (Though Truman served nearly two terms, he was elected President once; that means no Democrat has been re-elected in nearly 50 years.)
At lunch in the White House mess -- first time back since I was a Nixon speech writer 20 years ago -- Mack's soft-spoken, color-free demeanor was broken only once, when he burst into sudden laughter at the question: "Were you the genius who chose April 15 as the day to float the notion of a value-added tax?" I learned elsewhere that the genius was the ebullient Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has little to be ebullient about: the health portfolio was stripped from her by Hillary Rodham Clinton and given to Ira Magaziner, a certified Deep Thinker and longtime friend of the Clintons; meanwhile, reform of H.H.S.'s chief human service -- the promised end of "welfare as we know it," in candidate Clinton's words -- was not even given modest financing in the budget submitted this spring. Clintonites say Magaziner is "narrow but deep," his clout derivative but considerable.
About the only Cabinet member lower on the totem pole at this moment than Donna Shalala is Hazel O'Leary, the utilities executive from Minnesota. She got the job as Energy Secretary when former Senator Tim Wirth's ex-colleagues in the Senate turned on him after his scathing article about that body in this magazine; he now deals with drug-running at State while Mrs. O'Leary presses her nose to the power window.
Why do I feel no regret in reporting the lowly spots in the pecking order of these intelligent, reputable Clinton appointees? Because it may well help them bureaucratically: the Democratic political consultant James Carville, "the ragin' Cajun" or "Jugular Jim," tells me that around Clinton, "to be down is to be up. You write that I'm in a state of exile, and if Clinton reads it, for the next week I'm the one he has traveling with him. Clinton spots the most vulnerable person in the room and protects that person."
Such protection is already being given the Interior Secretary. Clintonites go out of their way to extol the loyalty and patience of the former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, which suggests he has lost more than a few internal battles on grazing fees and public lands. If being down in the Cabinet is to be raised up, Babbitt, Shalala and O'Leary are due for a boost -- and in fact, Babbitt is a leading contender for the opening on the Supreme Court.
MOST EXPERIENCED politicians are doing well in the Clinton Cabinet. Henry Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio who wisely ducked the rigors of a Texas Senate race to take on Housing and Urban Development, is considered a persuasive spokesman for the Administration, as is the Cabinet's other Hispanic member, the former Denver Mayor Federico Pena, at Transportation. Mike Espy, the first black to be sent to Congress by Mississipians in this century, was underrated at the start at Agriculture but is thought to be performing well. Not one of the trio can be called a major player, but all have modest places at the power table.
So does Ron Brown, the Democratic National Committee chairman who solved the Democrats' Jesse Jackson problem, making him the choice for Commerce; although he has a demerit for sponsoring the O'Leary pick (the Energy Secretary will be lionized at the next Cabinet meeting, if the Carville vulnerability theory is correct), Brown has worked out a nice-cop-tough-cop technique with Mickey Kantor, the trade negotiator, on Japan. The smooth Brown had previously exploited Kantor's explosive abrasiveness in the Bush-Clinton-Perot television debate negotiations; together, Brown and Kantor took the vaunted Baker-Teeter-Darman team to the cleaners on debate formats, and hope to do the same to the Japanese on trade balances.
As the low-key Robert Rubin takes over building support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, a political tar baby, the high-key Kantor will keep the heat on the GATT talks, the world-trade negotiations. Working closely with Kantor and adding intellectual depth and telegenic feistiness to the economic group is Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the University of California at Berkeley economist inclined to apply affirmative action to Japan's trade imbalance. Kantor, at the pinnacle of Clinton Clout last year as campaign chairman, sought aggressively to be transition chief and later chief of staff; after his take-charge bid was blocked by Bruce Lindsey, Stephanopoulos and Hillary, he came back, subdued, to take a lesser role. "Mickey will be in varying shades of In," says an insider, "but he won't be Out." And he won't be blamed, as Rubin is very likely to be, for the rift that develops with organized labor over allowing American plants to "run away" to Mexico. The Kantor Lesson: in a loose, free-flowing, grimly antihierarchical staff structure, where collegiality is a virtue, don't try too hard to get to the top of the heap.
ONE CABINET MEMBER vouchsafed to me the secret behind Bill Clinton's running of the Executive Branch: "Where power is not delegated, proximity is all."
She or he (sources who place their political lives in my hands to help compile the Clout Ratings are protected) explained the power lines at this stage of the new Government: the new President brought a small group of loyalists into his White House, filled with a spirit of solidarity and a sense of the gladness of change. Slowly, suspiciously, Bill and Friends fleshed out the skeleton of the Departments with appointees, many of them relative strangers, and conveyed to them the trappings of office but declined to delegate the power to make decisions even about their own staffs.
For example, when Hillary Rodham Clinton's third and final choice for Attorney General was put in place, Janet Reno soon discovered the A.G. de facto was Mrs. Clinton's Arkansas law partner, Webster Hubbell: in the aftermath of the Branch Davidian disaster in Waco, Tex., it was the trusted Associate Attorney General Hubbell, not Reno, whom the White House consulted. The moment that revealed the distance between the third-choice A.G. and the President came when she told Tom Brokaw she was unable to talk to Bill Clinton immediately after the suicidal fire; instead, Webb Hubbell was the point of contact. Reno got her revenge when she refused to accept the choice of chief of the criminal division from Hillary: a law partner of Susan Thomases, the First Lady's First Friend, was passed over, generating some independence at Justice and not a little ill will from the power center. (Susan Thomases, who retains her clout, should not be confused with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, whose clout diminished in the wake of her husband Harry's haircutting and travel advice.)
"Close counts only in horseshoes and hand grenades," goes the adage; not so in Presidential power-playing. Closeness to the President counts for everything -- when power is not delegated.
GEORGE Stephanopoulos -- "stuffin' envelopes" is the mnemonic, though some prefer Sesame Street's "Snuffleupagus" -- was, in the First Clinton Administration, the third member of the power trio around the President. Not since James Hagerty advised Eisenhower while managing his press relations had a "communicator" counted for so much in a White House, and not since Ted Sorensen served as John F. Kennedy's alter ego had an adviser been so closely attuned to his principal's principles and mind-set.
In contrast to longtime Friends of Bill like Bruce Lindsey and Mack McLarty, the slight, 32-year-old bachelor came aboard only a year ago, a refugee from Dukakis and Mondale campaigns who had learned the hard way how not to lose.
At the start, he was the intellectual straw boss, consulted on everything, active everywhere and spread too thin. His judgment to move quickly to deliver on promises to abortion rights groups was well received by press and public, though he got no credit for it; however, his judgment to pay back homosexuals for their support in the first weeks of the Administration was faulted by the news media and insiders alike.
Ensconsced in the Press Secretary's traditional office, his leg hooked over an arm of the Queen Anne chair, touseled head resting in the corner, Stephanopoulos would dismiss criticism of a paucity of press conferences as "elitist," and moments after that, he would fence with the press corps, gutsily rejecting the premises of loaded questions. A visitor came out of the office once occupied by Ron Ziegler with the impression that Stephanopoulos delighted in what he was doing, and most of the time -- unlike most of his youthful cohorts, frazzled by policy all-nighters, courting exhaustion as a kind of fraternity initiation -- Stephanopoulos found running a country from its communications center to be fun.
Then the First Clinton Administration came to an end. The communications chief was not along on the trip when the hairdresser, Cristophe of Beverly Hills, recommended by the Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, blew-dry the Clinton image of folksiness. But he was closely involved in the firing of the veteran White House travel staff at the behest of two campaign helpers: Thomason, who wanted a crack at the White House press-travel business for an outfit he partly owns, and the President's young cousin, who also happened to be the friend of a Stephanopoulos deputy. To justify the old-style divvying of the political spoils, Stephanopoulos -- unwarned by counsel Bernard Nussbaum's aides -- went a bridge too far, eliciting an unusual formal F.B.I. statement of the existence of a criminal investigation; this unthinking abuse of police power for political purpose reminded oldtimers of the Nixon sins. "When Christopher and Bentsen aren't around the White House," said one exasperated observer, "it's 'Home Alone.' "
From this episode, Stephanopoulos learned that there are some battles that cannot be won, and that some awkward situations called for backpedaling rather than brazening. He called around to those he misled to apologize. "We learn every single day in this office," the roughed-up young man told the press corps in a brief flash of genuine contrition. "We'll continue to learn."
But when the news media reaction to Scalpgate and Travelgate combined with the deeper political rebellion against the leftward lurch to pound down public support of the new President, the Clintons realized the politics of change itself needed a drastic early-course change. "Communications" and "partisanship" were blamed, rather than strategic policy blunders, and Stephanopoulos took the fall; he was gathered into the Oval Office bosom as "Senior Policy Adviser," where he will lie low until the next turn of the clout-rating wheel.
He was replaced as the symbol of the Second Clinton Administration (I steal this construct from F.D.R.'s Brain Truster and speech writer Raymond Moley, who divided the First and Second New Deals) by David Gergen. The moderate Ray Price brought David into the speech-writing ranks of the Nixon Administration; he went on to serve Gerald Ford and, when his hoped-for post at the head of Ronald Reagan's U.S.I.A. went to a Reagan crony, became a top press aide in the White House, barring access to reporters he considered "hostile." He successfully crossed the street to magazine and television commentary, taking generally sensible and libertarian positions on the right, and identified the motive for his recrossing as "patriotism." Clinton was indeed on the ropes: his economic plan passed the heavily Democratic House only because, in the Oklahoma Democrat David McCurdy's words, "We couldn't afford to let him die." Time was overripe for a switch to the center; the choice of Gergen represents that recognition of a need to end the leftward lurch.
BRUCE LINDSEY, the eminence grise around the White House, is the Clintons' confidant, the closest-in adviser; I am told by one of his many nonadmirers that he sought the job of Chief of Staff, but both Hillary and her husband felt he would not be as good an administrator as the other longtime friend, Mack McLarty. Lindsey's consolation was to be given greater access to the President's ear; in addition, he was given the specific task of staffing the Administration with loyalists and an affirmative representation of women and minorities. At first Lindsey tripped over Nannygate, and as a result was cautious to a fault in selecting sub-Cabinet appointees; as one support-deprived official puts it, "Zoe froze the system." But the protected Lindsey, unlike the exposed McLarty, took no heat. He performs a function that Bebe Rebozo performed for Nixon: sounding board for the Clintons' resentments at ill treatment from the press.
Harry Thomason's clout rating, which had soared to 7.4 after he and his wife, Linda, produced the Inaugural extravaganza, has taken a tumble to 3.7. He can still flash the coveted White House "resident's pass," allowing him john privileges in the family quarters, but the Hollywood set, which began to advertise its clout with "the long hug" of Bill Clinton by Barbra Streisand at the gala, found its influence on the wane -- at least until next fund-raising time.
AL GORE IS HAVING FUN, but he tries not to let it show. He subscribes to the notion that in national politics, stuffiness is next to godliness, and only lately, and with the most sober second thought, has he begun to lighten up. The Vice President -- grimly obsequious to the President in public -- lays it on the line in private without the formal deferrence exhibited by the Secretary of State or the professorial shuffling of the nation-al security adviser. I ran into him just outside the Oval Office one day, tossed the singles-bar line at him -- "Do you come here often?" -- and was cheerfully told, "All the time."
I had known him only as the Senate's "Mr. Green," who would trudge over to newspaper offices with large charts to demonstrate why we were not devoting enough space to global warming. Now near the top of the heap, he has extracted small victories for biodiversity and environmentalism from the economic group, which is concerned about the fallout on the job market. Clout is not transferrable, however; though Gore placed his Senate aide, Carol Browner, at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, she is not regarded as a heavy hitter.
As a longtime Washington hand -- son of a Senator, eight years a Senator himself -- Gore helps prepare the President for the arcane ways of the capital. For example, before Clinton's State of the Union Message to a joint session of Congress, it was Gore who pointed out that when the President called for change, only half the chamber would rise and applaud, and the speaker at the rostrum should not expect the entire audience to react positively. Seems obvious enough, but that night, Clinton called Gore to thank him for the heads-up, admitting he would have been thrown by the sight of so many sitting on their hands had he not been forewarned.
More important, Gore is one of the very few willing to beard the lion in his den. Clinton, winging his foreign policy at the start, told The New York Times that he wanted to "depersonalize" the conflict with Saddam Hussein; that was duly reported as a dramatic change from Bush's policy, which had been to insist on the dictator's ouster before relations with Iraq could be resumed. Clinton reacted with anger and confusion, insisting that no policy change had been made. Christopher, testifying to Congress that day, put some daylight between himself and the President's blunder, and Tony Lake, the scholarly national security adviser, is not the sort to storm into the Oval Office to straighten out a petulant President. It took Al Gore, shirt-sleeved but somber, to go in and say he would go on a talk show the next day to wrench the position back into line. Clinton agreed to let Gore "walk back the cat." Later, the lawyerly Secretary of State found a way of making Clinton's dovish "de-personalize" seem even more hawkish on Saddam than Bush had been -- by welcoming Kurdish leaders to Washington and telling them that it meant that only a true democratic replacement for Saddam, and not some successor Iraqi thug, would be acceptable to the United States.
Who swings the most weight with Clinton in the formulation of foreign policy? So far, there have been two big decisions -- one easy, one hard. The easy one was to back strongly Boris Yeltsin and his reformers in Russia, as Richard Nixon was urging and as George Bush had failed to do. Strobe Talbott, the former Time columnist who was a Clinton chum at Oxford and now has the former Soviet Union portfolio at State, pressed for a summit embrace. Tony Lake deferred to his judgment in this area: "Tony is spooked by Talbott," mutters an N.S.C. colleague. A political honcho said, "We couldn't save Wyche Fowler in Georgia; how are we gonna save Yeltsin?" Secretary of State Christopher (who must suspect Talbott covets his job) was cautious as usual but leaning toward giving Yeltsin a world spotlight before his referendum. Defense Secretary Les Aspin (who must suspect Jim Woolsey, the C.I.A. director, covets his job) is a mature Washington hand and a possible distance runner, if his health holds up; Aspin and Gore were outspokenly for it. Clinton then arranged to see Nixon, who had been rebuffed when he tried to get Bush to support the reformers, and who showed the new President how foreign aid could be presented as a palatable way to protect planned defense cuts. Clinton came down cleanly for Yeltsin, and picked up deserved credit when the reformers won the referendum.
Bosnia was the hard one. When the Munich analogy clashed with the Vietnam syndrome, Clinton's National Security Council split. Tony Lake, Les Aspin and United Nations Ambassador Madeleine Albright were the hawks; Christopher and Gen. Colin Powell (soon to retire and be replaced as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs by an airman, with more faith in bombing) were the doves. Gore was not usually identified as taking a point of view, because he would have to be out front selling whatever Clinton decided, but I'm told that in advising the President, Gore "took an aggressive posture."
After the television pictures of the siege of Srebrenica pushed editorial and some public opinion toward intervention, Clinton let it be known he favored fairly hawkish allied action: "lift and strike," lifting the United Nations embargo that kept arms from Bosnian Muslims and air strikes to suppress Serbian artillery and cut supply lines. Like Bush during the televised flight of terrified Kurds from the wrath of Saddam Hussein, Clinton had been swayed by the widespread revulsion at the slaughter of civilians -- but not swayed enough to take the leadership required for action.
Clinton first made certain the world knew the United States would not go this alone, in effect giving the Europeans a veto over any American plan; that was his first mistake. His next was to dispatch Christopher to Europe to "consult" with Britain and France, which wanted no action beyond economic sanctions.
Christopher interpreted Clinton's words as instruction to actually consult -- which in this case meant to bring back an answer of "no." The tip-off came in Brussels, when Manfred Worner, the NATO Secretary General, told Christopher he was ready to convene a meeting of allied ambassadors at which NATO would firmly support joint action. If Christopher wanted a "yes" to take home, he would have jumped at the opportunity; instead, President Clinton's man turned the NATO meeting down. Then, one by one, he made what British Prime Minister John Major told associates was a "bloodless" presentation to the major allies. Christopher returned not with the grudging approval of the allies, as Clinton had hoped, but with a convenient "out"; gutless Europe, not the courageous American President, was to blame.
Frankly, I thought at the time that Clinton must have sent his Secretary of State to Europe with the mission of being turned down, but I am assured that the President was sincere in wanting to coerce the Serbs into a cease-fire and was knocked off-course by his Secretary's ineptness.
What happened to Christopher's clout rating? Amazingly, it went up; Clinton has exhibited no irritation, publicly or privately, with the failure of his Secretary of State to carry out his mission. On the contrary, the make-the-most-of-it President nearly boasted of a decision to refuse to "go it alone." Sixth-floor professionals at State may be sick at heart, and seventh-floor political appointees, like Under Secretary Peter Tarnoff, may be rebuked when they blurt out a too-poor-to-lead policy, but the Clintons were drawn closer to "Chris" by his first diplomatic fiasco.
THE NATIONAL Economic Council is a bureaucratic counterpart to the National Security Council. This new power center was created to show the public that in the new era, economic policy would be at least as high a priority as national security; more important, it moves the center of gravity on economic policy away from the Treasury and into the White House.
The President and Hillary's choice to head the council was Robert Rubin, a New York investment banker who, at 54, had risen to the top of Goldman, Sachs & Company. He knew Mickey Kantor from his years as a Democratic fund-raiser, which brought him into the Clinton economic inner circle during the campaign. Rubin was also a longtime friend of Lloyd Bentsen's, and had served as trustee of the Texas Senator's blind trust; each man had recommended the other to be Treasury Secretary, although Bentsen subtly made it known he really wanted that role as the principal spokesman for economic policy. Rubin dutifully settled for Mr. Inside; because he has no aspirations for elective office and no need to top last year's $26 million income, he is content to have the President's economic ear. The council is too big; Clinton let every Cabinet officer sit on it who asked to, but Rubin gets around that time-wasting expansiveness by breaking it down into subcouncils.
Here's an example of how Rubin's operation works: A hardball strategy, devised by Howard Paster, a legislative aide, to ram a "stimulus" package through the Senate, succeeded only in uniting Republicans in opposition; a filibuster organized by Bob Dole shifted the issue from "job creation" to "pork." The first legislative defeat of a Clinton initiative encouraged Ross Perot to go public with his objections to a failure to cut spending, and it became apparent that the entire Clinton plan to sell a historic tax increase by calling it budget reduction was in trouble. Pollster Greenberg, in the 5 P.M. Ward Room meeting, confirmed that the public did not trust Clinton to use the new money to sop up red ink. The poor rogues reporting court news were prepared to consign the economic plan to a "crisis of confidence."
Bentsen, a Texas patrician with a moderate image -- and at 72, the Grand Old Man of the Clinton Administration -- had Rubin convene a meeting of a portion of the council in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The G.O.M., who had absented himself from heavy lobbying on the losing stimulus plan, liked the idea being pressed by Representative Charles Schumer of New York to create a "trust fund" in which new tax money would go, earmarked for reducing the deficit. Never mind that Democrats had denounced a similar "tax-return checkoff" proposal made the year before by President Bush as a feckless gimmick; the public wanted ironclad assurances that new taxes would not be diverted to new spending, and Bentsen felt the idea's time had come.
Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was all for it. Panetta has long been a Washington maverick: I remember him from the Nixon Health, Education and Welfare Department, where he ran the Office of Civil Rights and angrily quit to co-write a book entitled in sarcasm "Bring Us Together." A generation ago, he switched parties, won a seat in Congress and ultimately became the Democrats' leading House budgeteer; when the didactic Alice Rivlin bored Bill Clinton stiff in a job interview -- "she's more loyal to cutting the deficit than to the Clintons" was one assessment -- the faithful, good-humored Panetta won the top job at the Office of Management and Budget.
Panetta saw the "trust fund" idea as a way of enforcing fiscal discipline. For months, he had been losing this battle; in the formulation of the economic plan, his pleas for $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases were countered inside the economic council by the passionate, articulate arguments of Robert Reich. That Harvard political economist, rewarded with the Labor secretaryship for his years of loyal Friend-of-Billhood, is an unabashed spender on (in his preferred term, investor in) Government programs to train workers and finance the creation of jobs. In the early planning, Reich urged taxation for new spending; Panetta wanted to use most of the new tax money for deficit reduction; Bentsen was in the middle. Rubin, inexperienced in politics and focused on the impact of the promise of deficit reduction on interest rates and the bond markets, came down on the side of Reich.
In the trust-fund meeting, Reich again pressed the liberal side, arguing against the fund because it might turn out to be more than a gimmick and might hamstring the spending necessary to train a new work force. But the climate had changed; Stephanopoulos sided with Bentsen, who felt the President now needed to present to suspicious taxpayers some sort of anti-deficit guarantee. Reich then asked for a parallel "investment trust fund," to set aside money saved by spending cuts in defense for his training programs; that didn't fly. Rubin made the decision by asking his deputy, Gene Sperling, to do the paper work to make sure the fund would not unduly tie the Administration's hands. Next morning, in a 15-minute meeting with the President, the pros and cons of a trust fund were presented and Clinton chose the pro. The fund was in a speech the next day. Then Alice Rivlin shrugged it off as mere "display" and had to be told to get with the program.
THE HILLARY FACTOR is pervasive. She has apparently decided that health will be to the Clinton Administration as Social Security was to F.D.R., as highways were to Eisenhower -- the lasting legacy to show that one couple can make a difference.
The most severe internal struggle so far has been the fitting of health reform into the budget package. Leon Panetta urged that first things should come first: agreement with Congress on taxing and spending for this fiscal year, with the second bite -- the health plan with its accompanying taxation -- coming in the fall. Hillary disagreed; she insisted that the health reformation come close on the heels of the budget, while the Clinton mandate was still fresh.
She lost that one. But she won on the economic plan, tilting it toward Reich and away from Panetta, and her influence is felt in most of the Administration's appointments. Did she have an input on Bosnia? She expresses no position on foreign affairs, but as several insiders say, in the same words, "They talk about everything." The First Lady -- with so much at stake in her health reform, and with a more focused mind than her husband -- was said to exert her influence on the side of letting the Bosnians down and concentrating on America.
That's why, in the current indexation, she outclouts 'em all. Clinton staff members, who tend to absolve the President of blame with the traditional "if the Czar only knew," say the mistakes made in recent months would have been minimized "if only Hillary were here" and not occupied with the health task force.
But just as a nonpartisan face was being put on the Second Clinton Administration, there was Hillary making a fiercely partisan speech against the "special interests" among the health care providers. As the President pulls in his spending horns, the First Lady, with more clout than anybody, presses for the heavier spending option in the health plan.
It's not easy to keep up, but to cloutologists, turbulence has its attractions.
 
WILLIAM SAFIRE'S CLOUT RATINGS
William Safire's Clout Scale, used here for the first time to rate the political influence of members of the Clinton Administration, is based on criteria pioneered by the developer of the Richter scale to measure seismic disturbances and the Saffir-Simpson scale to measure the force of hurricanes.
On a scale of 0 to 10 -- with 0 indicating total political impotence and 10 signifying Undisputed Leader of the Free World, a rating automatically given a new President -- cloutologists give Administration members numerical ratings based on the sum of these criteria: (a) job title (with 5 for the top four Cabinet positions and the Chief of Staff, 3 for minor Cabinet posts and National Security Adviser, 1 for Veterans Affairs, .5 for Environmental Protection Agency, etc); (b) proximity to the President's ear (up to 7 for Closest Adviser); (c) quality of intellect and force of personality during internal struggles; (d) ability to sell the President's programs on television or through deep-backgrounders; (e) longtime F.O.B. status; (f) political savvy, and (g) last-minute secret weighting by the author to reflect irritation at inaccessibility or salivation at the potential of future leaks.

CLIMBING JACOB'S LADDER
The Enduring Legacy of
African-American Families.
By Andrew Billingsley.
446 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster.
$27.50. 
 IN 1890, according to United States Census studies, 80 percent of all black families with children were headed by married couples. In 1960, the proportion was 78 percent. But after 1960, it declined steeply: 1970, 64 percent; 1980, 48 percent; and by 1990, it had plummeted to 39 percent. (In 1990, the corresponding figure for whites had fallen to 81 percent.)
What makes "Climbing Jacob's Ladder: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families" so welcome is the calming way Andrew Billingsley, the chairman of the family studies department at the University of Maryland and the author of "Black Families in White America," guides us past simple, often heated interpretations of such data. He combines an unflinching look at current troubles in the black family with an appreciation of its abiding strengths. The balance between these two viewpoints is the hidden gift of this book.
Since Daniel Patrick Moynihan published "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action" in 1965, much of the academic discourse on the subject has crackled with attack and defense. During the Reagan-Bush years, those who tried to illuminate the relation between economy and culture, the context and interior of family life, generally held opposing views. Either they were "conservatives" who forgot the context -- the economy, racism, class divisions among blacks -- and focused on cultural deficiencies in the poor black community. Or they were "liberals" who focused on the context and ignored culture. "Climbing Jacob's Ladder" bridges the gap between these two positions and moves the debate in the direction of inquiry.
Mr. Billingsley begins by setting the modern black family in a historical context. He describes the family in West African society, under slavery, during Reconstruction and Jim Crow. He traces black migration to Northern cities, and documents the de-industrialization that has eroded the cores of these cities and the black families within them. It is ironic, he reflects, "that the traditional family system that slavery could not destroy during 200 years may be dismantled in a few short years by the modern industrial transition."
Drawing from the University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson's research, Mr. Billingsley argues that the decline of black marriage is largely due to the impact of job loss experienced by black men, especially in the working class. Between 1955 and 1980, employment for black men aged 20 to 24 declined from 78 percent to 55 percent. This decline, he says, is "a major reason for the downturn in their marriage rates and the upturn in unmarried parenthood."
Some of his data confirm this economic interpretation, and some of them don't. For example, the black two-parent family declined in the 1970's and early 1980's when the economy was in recession. But the two-parent family did not decline during the Great Depression of the 1930's. Furthermore, marriage rates fell in the 1960's when the economy was expanding and black income and college enrollments were rising. Mr. Billingsley argues that black men who lost jobs in the 1970's and 1980's often broke up their marriages. Other data suggest that so did black men with jobs, to a lesser degree but also at a rising rate.
Economic trends are important, but they're not the whole story; we are left wondering how culture fits in and not really told. The timing -- the 1960's -- might suggest that the sexual revolution and social upheavals that destabilized white families did the same to blacks, though Mr. Billingsley doesn't say so. His discussion of cultural context is more descriptive than analytic.
More generally, Mr. Billingsley makes the reasonable argument that the strength of the family depends on the strength of the support it receives from the institutions around it -- the church, businesses, the military. But the chapters he devotes to each become a series of tails that wag the dog. And he doesn't make a persuasive case that a decline in these institutions causes a decline in black marriage. So while I like his initial approach -- setting out reams of data, including dozens of tables -- I am left with more questions about the black family.
The moving stories he tells, drawn from personal experience and research, show how black families reach out to help -- taking in needy relatives or children who need raising. Black families formally and informally adopt more children than white parents of comparable means, he says. He writes of the Rev. Otis Moss of Cleveland, whose mother died when he was very young. A few years later, his father died in a car accident. "While young Otis was standing viewing the wreckage, a woman completely unrelated to him took him by the arm and said, 'Come home with me' " -- and she raised him. The author notes that this is a "not uncommon form of African-American family life."
Kent Amos, a successful businessman and a Vietnam veteran, "quietly designed an after-school program" for his son and his friends in their home in 1981. Within six years, there were 50 boys helping with chores, homework and dinner. Nearly 10 years later, 36 of them were in or had graduated from college. "Most of the others were employed or in school," Mr. Billingsley writes. "Only a few had been lost to the streets."
THE best chapter of the book is based on his own research on the black church. In it, Mr. Billingsley describes the Third Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in a poor neighborhood of New Orleans. In 1988, drug traffickers boldly set up two crack houses across from the church, he says, and began stealing the church's typewriters and the public address system. Instead of moving away, Shiloh used its building fund to buy the crack houses, tore them down and built apartments, employing parishioners to do the job. The church plans to use the rent to pay for a tutoring program.
Other churches described in the book set up AIDS education workshops and foster grandparent programs. Male parishioners in one Los Angeles church put six crack houses out of business by patrolling the streets in front of them, 50 to 200 strong, every weekend. Not every affluent black man is Kent Amos, and not every black church is like Third Shiloh. Still, Mr. Billingsley gives us a glimpse of inspiring people we hear far too little about.
In "Climbing Jacob's Ladder," Andrew Billingsley calls for developing a strategy to prevent family problems from occurring in the first place, a strategy backed by government, with nonprofit and private support. Guiding it, I hope, will be research that neither avoids the context of culture nor addresses it in tone-deaf ways, but research that looks outward to economy and society, and inward to the heart.

HEADLINE: Who's Got Clout

BYLINE: By William Safire; William Safire, the New York Times political columnist whose latest book is "The First Dissident: The Book of Job in Today's Politics," also uses his Clout Scale to measure earthquakes, groundswells and landslides.

 BODY:
POWERFUL PEOPLE maneuver for position," said the outsider Bill Clinton about Washington moments after he was sworn in as the 42d President, "and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down." The new man's derogation of clout was in the grand tradition; leaders always resist outside assessments of the jockeying for power that goes on within. King Lear derided the way "poor rogues talk of court news," which he described as essentially "who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out."
Three months into his Presidency, Clinton was still deriding as a "political smoke screen" reports that "somebody's up and somebody's down." But soon afterward, he had to backtrack: "We think that there needs to be a little tighter coordination here," he admitted, and announced that his chief of staff, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, was being given a second deputy, freeing Clinton's best friend from kindergarten days to give unspecified policy advice. 
 We poor rogues talking of court news could tell that somebody was surely up (in that case, Roy Neel, Al Gore's chief aide and an experienced Senate hand), and somebody was at least seen to be down ("Mack the Nice," as the courteous McLarty is known). That was the first public sign that the power lines of the Clintonites were being adjusted to reflect the realities of administering a Government and wrestling with the negative reaction to its surprising early ideological shift.
A couple of weeks later, after a flip-flop by Christopher and a haircut from Cristophe increased the Presidential nose dive in opinion polls to warp speed, the up-and-downing intensified. Clinton, deciding to blame communications more than content for his plunge, put David Gergen, a Nixon-Ford-Reagan Old Pro, out front and pulled the media-battered George Stephanopoulos in close.
People -- appointees -- determine policy. The Earl of Chesterfield's idealistic assertion that "measures, not men, has always been my mark" was nicely skewered by George Canning in 1801 as "the idle supposition that it is the harness and not the horses that draw the chariot along."
The warm desire for diversity and the cold political trade-offs that led to the molasseslike peopling of the Clinton Administration have given way to the force of personality in small meetings and examples of good and bad judgment in public view. The little boxes and dotted lines on a table of organization are shaking down to "guys we can trust and guys we're stuck with."
BILL CLINTON IS THE first President in American history to entrust the top power positions in his Administration to two people he cannot fire: the First Lady and the Vice President. He could not fire his lifelong best friend, the chief of staff, either, which explains why the selfless McLarty, along with the alter ego Stephanopoulos, were elevated to more advisory positions -- with others being inserted as "the Hammer" or "the Persuader" alongside them.
Some Clinton watchers thought the disciplinary role -- which Mack insists that he had planned from the start, but that his choice, Harold Ickes Jr. of New York, ran into flak -- would go to Rahm Emanuel, 33, a hard-edged, soft-eyed former Chicagoan with the grace of a ballet dancer who squeezed $100 million out of fat cats to finance the campaign. ("If you had a flow chart," Emanuel says of those halcyon days, "it would be a kaleidoscope.") But he remains the political director, running the daily 5 P.M. meeting in the Ward Room of the White House mess, with David Wilhelm, the Friend of Bill who now runs the Democratic National Committee; Mandy Grunwald, the media maven; Stan Greenberg, the pollster; David Dreyer, the press aide who doubles as a speech writer; Dee Dee Myers, the formerly token press secretary who is now assuming a more traditional, out-front position in briefing the press, and James Carville and Paul Begala, the pop-'em-with-populism campaign consultants, along with schedulers and advancers.
These are the image-protectors and Permanent Campaigners, trying to figure out how Mike Deaver did it in the first Reagan term and wondering why the Inaugural air has gone out of the balloon. Their goal, as Emanuel puts it: "To make Clinton the first Democratic President since Roosevelt to be re-elected." (Though Truman served nearly two terms, he was elected President once; that means no Democrat has been re-elected in nearly 50 years.)
At lunch in the White House mess -- first time back since I was a Nixon speech writer 20 years ago -- Mack's soft-spoken, color-free demeanor was broken only once, when he burst into sudden laughter at the question: "Were you the genius who chose April 15 as the day to float the notion of a value-added tax?" I learned elsewhere that the genius was the ebullient Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has little to be ebullient about: the health portfolio was stripped from her by Hillary Rodham Clinton and given to Ira Magaziner, a certified Deep Thinker and longtime friend of the Clintons; meanwhile, reform of H.H.S.'s chief human service -- the promised end of "welfare as we know it," in candidate Clinton's words -- was not even given modest financing in the budget submitted this spring. Clintonites say Magaziner is "narrow but deep," his clout derivative but considerable.
About the only Cabinet member lower on the totem pole at this moment than Donna Shalala is Hazel O'Leary, the utilities executive from Minnesota. She got the job as Energy Secretary when former Senator Tim Wirth's ex-colleagues in the Senate turned on him after his scathing article about that body in this magazine; he now deals with drug-running at State while Mrs. O'Leary presses her nose to the power window.
Why do I feel no regret in reporting the lowly spots in the pecking order of these intelligent, reputable Clinton appointees? Because it may well help them bureaucratically: the Democratic political consultant James Carville, "the ragin' Cajun" or "Jugular Jim," tells me that around Clinton, "to be down is to be up. You write that I'm in a state of exile, and if Clinton reads it, for the next week I'm the one he has traveling with him. Clinton spots the most vulnerable person in the room and protects that person."
Such protection is already being given the Interior Secretary. Clintonites go out of their way to extol the loyalty and patience of the former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, which suggests he has lost more than a few internal battles on grazing fees and public lands. If being down in the Cabinet is to be raised up, Babbitt, Shalala and O'Leary are due for a boost -- and in fact, Babbitt is a leading contender for the opening on the Supreme Court.
MOST EXPERIENCED politicians are doing well in the Clinton Cabinet. Henry Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio who wisely ducked the rigors of a Texas Senate race to take on Housing and Urban Development, is considered a persuasive spokesman for the Administration, as is the Cabinet's other Hispanic member, the former Denver Mayor Federico Pena, at Transportation. Mike Espy, the first black to be sent to Congress by Mississipians in this century, was underrated at the start at Agriculture but is thought to be performing well. Not one of the trio can be called a major player, but all have modest places at the power table.
So does Ron Brown, the Democratic National Committee chairman who solved the Democrats' Jesse Jackson problem, making him the choice for Commerce; although he has a demerit for sponsoring the O'Leary pick (the Energy Secretary will be lionized at the next Cabinet meeting, if the Carville vulnerability theory is correct), Brown has worked out a nice-cop-tough-cop technique with Mickey Kantor, the trade negotiator, on Japan. The smooth Brown had previously exploited Kantor's explosive abrasiveness in the Bush-Clinton-Perot television debate negotiations; together, Brown and Kantor took the vaunted Baker-Teeter-Darman team to the cleaners on debate formats, and hope to do the same to the Japanese on trade balances.
As the low-key Robert Rubin takes over building support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, a political tar baby, the high-key Kantor will keep the heat on the GATT talks, the world-trade negotiations. Working closely with Kantor and adding intellectual depth and telegenic feistiness to the economic group is Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the University of California at Berkeley economist inclined to apply affirmative action to Japan's trade imbalance. Kantor, at the pinnacle of Clinton Clout last year as campaign chairman, sought aggressively to be transition chief and later chief of staff; after his take-charge bid was blocked by Bruce Lindsey, Stephanopoulos and Hillary, he came back, subdued, to take a lesser role. "Mickey will be in varying shades of In," says an insider, "but he won't be Out." And he won't be blamed, as Rubin is very likely to be, for the rift that develops with organized labor over allowing American plants to "run away" to Mexico. The Kantor Lesson: in a loose, free-flowing, grimly antihierarchical staff structure, where collegiality is a virtue, don't try too hard to get to the top of the heap.
ONE CABINET MEMBER vouchsafed to me the secret behind Bill Clinton's running of the Executive Branch: "Where power is not delegated, proximity is all."
She or he (sources who place their political lives in my hands to help compile the Clout Ratings are protected) explained the power lines at this stage of the new Government: the new President brought a small group of loyalists into his White House, filled with a spirit of solidarity and a sense of the gladness of change. Slowly, suspiciously, Bill and Friends fleshed out the skeleton of the Departments with appointees, many of them relative strangers, and conveyed to them the trappings of office but declined to delegate the power to make decisions even about their own staffs.
For example, when Hillary Rodham Clinton's third and final choice for Attorney General was put in place, Janet Reno soon discovered the A.G. de facto was Mrs. Clinton's Arkansas law partner, Webster Hubbell: in the aftermath of the Branch Davidian disaster in Waco, Tex., it was the trusted Associate Attorney General Hubbell, not Reno, whom the White House consulted. The moment that revealed the distance between the third-choice A.G. and the President came when she told Tom Brokaw she was unable to talk to Bill Clinton immediately after the suicidal fire; instead, Webb Hubbell was the point of contact. Reno got her revenge when she refused to accept the choice of chief of the criminal division from Hillary: a law partner of Susan Thomases, the First Lady's First Friend, was passed over, generating some independence at Justice and not a little ill will from the power center. (Susan Thomases, who retains her clout, should not be confused with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, whose clout diminished in the wake of her husband Harry's haircutting and travel advice.)
"Close counts only in horseshoes and hand grenades," goes the adage; not so in Presidential power-playing. Closeness to the President counts for everything -- when power is not delegated.
GEORGE Stephanopoulos -- "stuffin' envelopes" is the mnemonic, though some prefer Sesame Street's "Snuffleupagus" -- was, in the First Clinton Administration, the third member of the power trio around the President. Not since James Hagerty advised Eisenhower while managing his press relations had a "communicator" counted for so much in a White House, and not since Ted Sorensen served as John F. Kennedy's alter ego had an adviser been so closely attuned to his principal's principles and mind-set.
In contrast to longtime Friends of Bill like Bruce Lindsey and Mack McLarty, the slight, 32-year-old bachelor came aboard only a year ago, a refugee from Dukakis and Mondale campaigns who had learned the hard way how not to lose.
At the start, he was the intellectual straw boss, consulted on everything, active everywhere and spread too thin. His judgment to move quickly to deliver on promises to abortion rights groups was well received by press and public, though he got no credit for it; however, his judgment to pay back homosexuals for their support in the first weeks of the Administration was faulted by the news media and insiders alike.
Ensconsced in the Press Secretary's traditional office, his leg hooked over an arm of the Queen Anne chair, touseled head resting in the corner, Stephanopoulos would dismiss criticism of a paucity of press conferences as "elitist," and moments after that, he would fence with the press corps, gutsily rejecting the premises of loaded questions. A visitor came out of the office once occupied by Ron Ziegler with the impression that Stephanopoulos delighted in what he was doing, and most of the time -- unlike most of his youthful cohorts, frazzled by policy all-nighters, courting exhaustion as a kind of fraternity initiation -- Stephanopoulos found running a country from its communications center to be fun.
Then the First Clinton Administration came to an end. The communications chief was not along on the trip when the hairdresser, Cristophe of Beverly Hills, recommended by the Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, blew-dry the Clinton image of folksiness. But he was closely involved in the firing of the veteran White House travel staff at the behest of two campaign helpers: Thomason, who wanted a crack at the White House press-travel business for an outfit he partly owns, and the President's young cousin, who also happened to be the friend of a Stephanopoulos deputy. To justify the old-style divvying of the political spoils, Stephanopoulos -- unwarned by counsel Bernard Nussbaum's aides -- went a bridge too far, eliciting an unusual formal F.B.I. statement of the existence of a criminal investigation; this unthinking abuse of police power for political purpose reminded oldtimers of the Nixon sins. "When Christopher and Bentsen aren't around the White House," said one exasperated observer, "it's 'Home Alone.' "
From this episode, Stephanopoulos learned that there are some battles that cannot be won, and that some awkward situations called for backpedaling rather than brazening. He called around to those he misled to apologize. "We learn every single day in this office," the roughed-up young man told the press corps in a brief flash of genuine contrition. "We'll continue to learn."
But when the news media reaction to Scalpgate and Travelgate combined with the deeper political rebellion against the leftward lurch to pound down public support of the new President, the Clintons realized the politics of change itself needed a drastic early-course change. "Communications" and "partisanship" were blamed, rather than strategic policy blunders, and Stephanopoulos took the fall; he was gathered into the Oval Office bosom as "Senior Policy Adviser," where he will lie low until the next turn of the clout-rating wheel.
He was replaced as the symbol of the Second Clinton Administration (I steal this construct from F.D.R.'s Brain Truster and speech writer Raymond Moley, who divided the First and Second New Deals) by David Gergen. The moderate Ray Price brought David into the speech-writing ranks of the Nixon Administration; he went on to serve Gerald Ford and, when his hoped-for post at the head of Ronald Reagan's U.S.I.A. went to a Reagan crony, became a top press aide in the White House, barring access to reporters he considered "hostile." He successfully crossed the street to magazine and television commentary, taking generally sensible and libertarian positions on the right, and identified the motive for his recrossing as "patriotism." Clinton was indeed on the ropes: his economic plan passed the heavily Democratic House only because, in the Oklahoma Democrat David McCurdy's words, "We couldn't afford to let him die." Time was overripe for a switch to the center; the choice of Gergen represents that recognition of a need to end the leftward lurch.
BRUCE LINDSEY, the eminence grise around the White House, is the Clintons' confidant, the closest-in adviser; I am told by one of his many nonadmirers that he sought the job of Chief of Staff, but both Hillary and her husband felt he would not be as good an administrator as the other longtime friend, Mack McLarty. Lindsey's consolation was to be given greater access to the President's ear; in addition, he was given the specific task of staffing the Administration with loyalists and an affirmative representation of women and minorities. At first Lindsey tripped over Nannygate, and as a result was cautious to a fault in selecting sub-Cabinet appointees; as one support-deprived official puts it, "Zoe froze the system." But the protected Lindsey, unlike the exposed McLarty, took no heat. He performs a function that Bebe Rebozo performed for Nixon: sounding board for the Clintons' resentments at ill treatment from the press.
Harry Thomason's clout rating, which had soared to 7.4 after he and his wife, Linda, produced the Inaugural extravaganza, has taken a tumble to 3.7. He can still flash the coveted White House "resident's pass," allowing him john privileges in the family quarters, but the Hollywood set, which began to advertise its clout with "the long hug" of Bill Clinton by Barbra Streisand at the gala, found its influence on the wane -- at least until next fund-raising time.
AL GORE IS HAVING FUN, but he tries not to let it show. He subscribes to the notion that in national politics, stuffiness is next to godliness, and only lately, and with the most sober second thought, has he begun to lighten up. The Vice President -- grimly obsequious to the President in public -- lays it on the line in private without the formal deferrence exhibited by the Secretary of State or the professorial shuffling of the nation-al security adviser. I ran into him just outside the Oval Office one day, tossed the singles-bar line at him -- "Do you come here often?" -- and was cheerfully told, "All the time."
I had known him only as the Senate's "Mr. Green," who would trudge over to newspaper offices with large charts to demonstrate why we were not devoting enough space to global warming. Now near the top of the heap, he has extracted small victories for biodiversity and environmentalism from the economic group, which is concerned about the fallout on the job market. Clout is not transferrable, however; though Gore placed his Senate aide, Carol Browner, at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, she is not regarded as a heavy hitter.
As a longtime Washington hand -- son of a Senator, eight years a Senator himself -- Gore helps prepare the President for the arcane ways of the capital. For example, before Clinton's State of the Union Message to a joint session of Congress, it was Gore who pointed out that when the President called for change, only half the chamber would rise and applaud, and the speaker at the rostrum should not expect the entire audience to react positively. Seems obvious enough, but that night, Clinton called Gore to thank him for the heads-up, admitting he would have been thrown by the sight of so many sitting on their hands had he not been forewarned.
More important, Gore is one of the very few willing to beard the lion in his den. Clinton, winging his foreign policy at the start, told The New York Times that he wanted to "depersonalize" the conflict with Saddam Hussein; that was duly reported as a dramatic change from Bush's policy, which had been to insist on the dictator's ouster before relations with Iraq could be resumed. Clinton reacted with anger and confusion, insisting that no policy change had been made. Christopher, testifying to Congress that day, put some daylight between himself and the President's blunder, and Tony Lake, the scholarly national security adviser, is not the sort to storm into the Oval Office to straighten out a petulant President. It took Al Gore, shirt-sleeved but somber, to go in and say he would go on a talk show the next day to wrench the position back into line. Clinton agreed to let Gore "walk back the cat." Later, the lawyerly Secretary of State found a way of making Clinton's dovish "de-personalize" seem even more hawkish on Saddam than Bush had been -- by welcoming Kurdish leaders to Washington and telling them that it meant that only a true democratic replacement for Saddam, and not some successor Iraqi thug, would be acceptable to the United States.
Who swings the most weight with Clinton in the formulation of foreign policy? So far, there have been two big decisions -- one easy, one hard. The easy one was to back strongly Boris Yeltsin and his reformers in Russia, as Richard Nixon was urging and as George Bush had failed to do. Strobe Talbott, the former Time columnist who was a Clinton chum at Oxford and now has the former Soviet Union portfolio at State, pressed for a summit embrace. Tony Lake deferred to his judgment in this area: "Tony is spooked by Talbott," mutters an N.S.C. colleague. A political honcho said, "We couldn't save Wyche Fowler in Georgia; how are we gonna save Yeltsin?" Secretary of State Christopher (who must suspect Talbott covets his job) was cautious as usual but leaning toward giving Yeltsin a world spotlight before his referendum. Defense Secretary Les Aspin (who must suspect Jim Woolsey, the C.I.A. director, covets his job) is a mature Washington hand and a possible distance runner, if his health holds up; Aspin and Gore were outspokenly for it. Clinton then arranged to see Nixon, who had been rebuffed when he tried to get Bush to support the reformers, and who showed the new President how foreign aid could be presented as a palatable way to protect planned defense cuts. Clinton came down cleanly for Yeltsin, and picked up deserved credit when the reformers won the referendum.
Bosnia was the hard one. When the Munich analogy clashed with the Vietnam syndrome, Clinton's National Security Council split. Tony Lake, Les Aspin and United Nations Ambassador Madeleine Albright were the hawks; Christopher and Gen. Colin Powell (soon to retire and be replaced as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs by an airman, with more faith in bombing) were the doves. Gore was not usually identified as taking a point of view, because he would have to be out front selling whatever Clinton decided, but I'm told that in advising the President, Gore "took an aggressive posture."
After the television pictures of the siege of Srebrenica pushed editorial and some public opinion toward intervention, Clinton let it be known he favored fairly hawkish allied action: "lift and strike," lifting the United Nations embargo that kept arms from Bosnian Muslims and air strikes to suppress Serbian artillery and cut supply lines. Like Bush during the televised flight of terrified Kurds from the wrath of Saddam Hussein, Clinton had been swayed by the widespread revulsion at the slaughter of civilians -- but not swayed enough to take the leadership required for action.
Clinton first made certain the world knew the United States would not go this alone, in effect giving the Europeans a veto over any American plan; that was his first mistake. His next was to dispatch Christopher to Europe to "consult" with Britain and France, which wanted no action beyond economic sanctions.
Christopher interpreted Clinton's words as instruction to actually consult -- which in this case meant to bring back an answer of "no." The tip-off came in Brussels, when Manfred Worner, the NATO Secretary General, told Christopher he was ready to convene a meeting of allied ambassadors at which NATO would firmly support joint action. If Christopher wanted a "yes" to take home, he would have jumped at the opportunity; instead, President Clinton's man turned the NATO meeting down. Then, one by one, he made what British Prime Minister John Major told associates was a "bloodless" presentation to the major allies. Christopher returned not with the grudging approval of the allies, as Clinton had hoped, but with a convenient "out"; gutless Europe, not the courageous American President, was to blame.
Frankly, I thought at the time that Clinton must have sent his Secretary of State to Europe with the mission of being turned down, but I am assured that the President was sincere in wanting to coerce the Serbs into a cease-fire and was knocked off-course by his Secretary's ineptness.
What happened to Christopher's clout rating? Amazingly, it went up; Clinton has exhibited no irritation, publicly or privately, with the failure of his Secretary of State to carry out his mission. On the contrary, the make-the-most-of-it President nearly boasted of a decision to refuse to "go it alone." Sixth-floor professionals at State may be sick at heart, and seventh-floor political appointees, like Under Secretary Peter Tarnoff, may be rebuked when they blurt out a too-poor-to-lead policy, but the Clintons were drawn closer to "Chris" by his first diplomatic fiasco.
THE NATIONAL Economic Council is a bureaucratic counterpart to the National Security Council. This new power center was created to show the public that in the new era, economic policy would be at least as high a priority as national security; more important, it moves the center of gravity on economic policy away from the Treasury and into the White House.
The President and Hillary's choice to head the council was Robert Rubin, a New York investment banker who, at 54, had risen to the top of Goldman, Sachs & Company. He knew Mickey Kantor from his years as a Democratic fund-raiser, which brought him into the Clinton economic inner circle during the campaign. Rubin was also a longtime friend of Lloyd Bentsen's, and had served as trustee of the Texas Senator's blind trust; each man had recommended the other to be Treasury Secretary, although Bentsen subtly made it known he really wanted that role as the principal spokesman for economic policy. Rubin dutifully settled for Mr. Inside; because he has no aspirations for elective office and no need to top last year's $26 million income, he is content to have the President's economic ear. The council is too big; Clinton let every Cabinet officer sit on it who asked to, but Rubin gets around that time-wasting expansiveness by breaking it down into subcouncils.
Here's an example of how Rubin's operation works: A hardball strategy, devised by Howard Paster, a legislative aide, to ram a "stimulus" package through the Senate, succeeded only in uniting Republicans in opposition; a filibuster organized by Bob Dole shifted the issue from "job creation" to "pork." The first legislative defeat of a Clinton initiative encouraged Ross Perot to go public with his objections to a failure to cut spending, and it became apparent that the entire Clinton plan to sell a historic tax increase by calling it budget reduction was in trouble. Pollster Greenberg, in the 5 P.M. Ward Room meeting, confirmed that the public did not trust Clinton to use the new money to sop up red ink. The poor rogues reporting court news were prepared to consign the economic plan to a "crisis of confidence."
Bentsen, a Texas patrician with a moderate image -- and at 72, the Grand Old Man of the Clinton Administration -- had Rubin convene a meeting of a portion of the council in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The G.O.M., who had absented himself from heavy lobbying on the losing stimulus plan, liked the idea being pressed by Representative Charles Schumer of New York to create a "trust fund" in which new tax money would go, earmarked for reducing the deficit. Never mind that Democrats had denounced a similar "tax-return checkoff" proposal made the year before by President Bush as a feckless gimmick; the public wanted ironclad assurances that new taxes would not be diverted to new spending, and Bentsen felt the idea's time had come.
Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was all for it. Panetta has long been a Washington maverick: I remember him from the Nixon Health, Education and Welfare Department, where he ran the Office of Civil Rights and angrily quit to co-write a book entitled in sarcasm "Bring Us Together." A generation ago, he switched parties, won a seat in Congress and ultimately became the Democrats' leading House budgeteer; when the didactic Alice Rivlin bored Bill Clinton stiff in a job interview -- "she's more loyal to cutting the deficit than to the Clintons" was one assessment -- the faithful, good-humored Panetta won the top job at the Office of Management and Budget.
Panetta saw the "trust fund" idea as a way of enforcing fiscal discipline. For months, he had been losing this battle; in the formulation of the economic plan, his pleas for $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases were countered inside the economic council by the passionate, articulate arguments of Robert Reich. That Harvard political economist, rewarded with the Labor secretaryship for his years of loyal Friend-of-Billhood, is an unabashed spender on (in his preferred term, investor in) Government programs to train workers and finance the creation of jobs. In the early planning, Reich urged taxation for new spending; Panetta wanted to use most of the new tax money for deficit reduction; Bentsen was in the middle. Rubin, inexperienced in politics and focused on the impact of the promise of deficit reduction on interest rates and the bond markets, came down on the side of Reich.
In the trust-fund meeting, Reich again pressed the liberal side, arguing against the fund because it might turn out to be more than a gimmick and might hamstring the spending necessary to train a new work force. But the climate had changed; Stephanopoulos sided with Bentsen, who felt the President now needed to present to suspicious taxpayers some sort of anti-deficit guarantee. Reich then asked for a parallel "investment trust fund," to set aside money saved by spending cuts in defense for his training programs; that didn't fly. Rubin made the decision by asking his deputy, Gene Sperling, to do the paper work to make sure the fund would not unduly tie the Administration's hands. Next morning, in a 15-minute meeting with the President, the pros and cons of a trust fund were presented and Clinton chose the pro. The fund was in a speech the next day. Then Alice Rivlin shrugged it off as mere "display" and had to be told to get with the program.
THE HILLARY FACTOR is pervasive. She has apparently decided that health will be to the Clinton Administration as Social Security was to F.D.R., as highways were to Eisenhower -- the lasting legacy to show that one couple can make a difference.
The most severe internal struggle so far has been the fitting of health reform into the budget package. Leon Panetta urged that first things should come first: agreement with Congress on taxing and spending for this fiscal year, with the second bite -- the health plan with its accompanying taxation -- coming in the fall. Hillary disagreed; she insisted that the health reformation come close on the heels of the budget, while the Clinton mandate was still fresh.
She lost that one. But she won on the economic plan, tilting it toward Reich and away from Panetta, and her influence is felt in most of the Administration's appointments. Did she have an input on Bosnia? She expresses no position on foreign affairs, but as several insiders say, in the same words, "They talk about everything." The First Lady -- with so much at stake in her health reform, and with a more focused mind than her husband -- was said to exert her influence on the side of letting the Bosnians down and concentrating on America.
That's why, in the current indexation, she outclouts 'em all. Clinton staff members, who tend to absolve the President of blame with the traditional "if the Czar only knew," say the mistakes made in recent months would have been minimized "if only Hillary were here" and not occupied with the health task force.
But just as a nonpartisan face was being put on the Second Clinton Administration, there was Hillary making a fiercely partisan speech against the "special interests" among the health care providers. As the President pulls in his spending horns, the First Lady, with more clout than anybody, presses for the heavier spending option in the health plan.
It's not easy to keep up, but to cloutologists, turbulence has its attractions.
 
WILLIAM SAFIRE'S CLOUT RATINGS
William Safire's Clout Scale, used here for the first time to rate the political influence of members of the Clinton Administration, is based on criteria pioneered by the developer of the Richter scale to measure seismic disturbances and the Saffir-Simpson scale to measure the force of hurricanes.
On a scale of 0 to 10 -- with 0 indicating total political impotence and 10 signifying Undisputed Leader of the Free World, a rating automatically given a new President -- cloutologists give Administration members numerical ratings based on the sum of these criteria: (a) job title (with 5 for the top four Cabinet positions and the Chief of Staff, 3 for minor Cabinet posts and National Security Adviser, 1 for Veterans Affairs, .5 for Environmental Protection Agency, etc); (b) proximity to the President's ear (up to 7 for Closest Adviser); (c) quality of intellect and force of personality during internal struggles; (d) ability to sell the President's programs on television or through deep-backgrounders; (e) longtime F.O.B. status; (f) political savvy, and (g) last-minute secret weighting by the author to reflect irritation at inaccessibility or salivation at the potential of future leaks.

 CORRECTION:
 An article on page 25 of The Times Magazine today assesses the relative influence of members of the Clinton Administration and others in the President's inner circle. In discussing Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, it says Mr. Babbitt is a leading contender for the Supreme Court. On Monday, after the magazine had gone to press, President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the opening on the Court.

HEADLINE: Surge in Free Lunches At Schools a Sign of Tough Times

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
IN what state and local education officials say is a good measure of a bad economy, the number of children receiving free lunches at schools on Long Island is rising. Even so, the officials said, many children who qualify for the lunches do not receive them because their parents are afraid or embarrassed to apply.
As more family incomes begin to feel the effects of long-term unemployment, the surge of applications for free or reduced-price lunches, which began to hit districts last year, has continued in the school year that ends this month. According to the State Education Department, the number of specially priced lunches served on the Island has also grown again.
 
21% Increase in Two Years
 Of the nearly 14 million lunches served in Long Island schools through February of this school year, 34 percent were free or reduced in price, up from 32 percent last year and 28 percent in the 1990-91 school year. That is, proportionally, a 21 percent increase over the two years. 
 The number of students receiving the lunches in that period increased in some communities by up to 65 percent, a sampling of districts shows.
In November of this school year, which the Education Department terms a representative month, Long Island districts received more than 61,000 applications for free or reduced-price lunches, up 26 percent from November 1990.
"It used to be that the applications came mostly in the beginning of the year," said the director of child-nutrition programs, Fran O'Donnell. Now, she said, "school districts are processing applications all year."
"More families are taking advantage of it and more families are needing it," said the school lunch manager for the Comsewogue District, Eileen Anderson.
The increases mirror a "major shift" across the state and nation, Ms. O'Donnell said. The shift took hold last year, when the number of students in the Federal Department of Agriculture's National School Lunch Program, which began in 1946, started to increase markedly.
More people entered into the qualifying-income category, in which a child from a family of four earning less than $18,135 receives free lunches, and one from a family earning less than $25,808 qualifies for reduced-price lunches costing 25 cents. At the same time, Ms. O'Donnell said, new rules made it easier to apply for the program. Parents could apply while enrolling for other benefits like food stamps. The state called the effort direct participation, and along with the worsening economy it helped to spark a year in which the number of free and reduced-price lunches grew in absolute and relative terms in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Nearly three million free or reduced-price lunches, or 30 percent of the total, were served in Nassau schools last year. That was 19 percent more than the year before, when 26 percent of the lunches were specially priced.
In Suffolk, 4.7 million specially priced lunches, or 33 percent of all lunches, were served last year. That is 16 percent more than the previous year, when 29 percent of all lunches were free or reduced.
Some of the fastest growth has been in wealthier districts like Hewlett-Woodmere, where the number of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches, although still small, increased 64 percent over two years.
This month, the district served specially priced lunches to 148 students, or 5 percent of the 3,046 students in the district. In the same month two years ago 90 students received the lunches, or 3 percent of the 2,858 students.
 
What the Applications Show
 The cook manager for the district, Emily Rein, said applications showed an increase in the number of men who had lost their jobs, children living with single parents and relatively poor Hispanic people who had moved into the district.
In Manhasset the number of students receiving free and reduced-price lunches, although still less than 5 percent of the nearly 2,250 students, has also increased because of the economy, said the director of school lunches, Virginia Southwick.
Less wealthy districts are also serving increasing numbers of free meals. The business manager of the Rocky Point district, Joan Niles, said the number of students who received free or reduced-price lunches this year increased 37 percent over two years ago. This year, 14 percent of the 2,700 students received free or reduced-price lunches, compared with 11 percent of the 2,600 students who did so in 1990-91.
Ms. Niles said the rise reflected an increasing dependence on many forms of welfare. "The economy on the Island is recovering a lot more slowly than the economy of the U.S.," she said.
 
Increase in High School Cited
 In Comsewogue the number of children receiving the specially priced lunches increased 65 percent. Last month 686, or 17 percent, of the 4,092 students received the lunches, compared with 415, or 12 percent of the 3,518 enrolled in the same month two years ago. The increase was particularly strong in the high school, Ms. Anderson said.
Some districts have levels equal to the statewide averages.
In Roosevelt about 55 percent of the 3,200 students receive free or reduced-price lunches, a figure that has remained about the same for two years, said the assistant superintendent for business affairs, Wesley Springhorn. In April, Mr. Springhorn said, the district served 21,323 free and 2,037 reduced-price lunches in 17 days of service.
He said the number of specially priced lunches did not increase in his district, because Roosevelt is relatively poor and its participation in the program was already extensive. "In Roosevelt," he said, "it's a chronic situation."
In Freeport, where 45 percent of the 6,600 children in the district received free or reduced-price lunches this year, the proportion of students receiving the lunches has stayed about the same even as the enrollment has risen, said the assistant business administrator, Gerard Dougherty.
Some districts, like Baldwin, do not participate in the national program. "It's something that's under study all the time," a spokesman for the district, Barry Edelson, said. "At this point there's no definite plan to change."
 
Reimbursement From the U.S.D.A.
 Despite the problems, proportionally fewer children on Long Island than in the state as a whole qualify for specially priced lunches. Districts interviewed charged from 70 cents to $1.50 for paid lunches.
Under the National School Lunch Program the Federal Government reimburses districts $1.53 for each free lunch and $1.13 for each reduced-price lunch. A combination of state and Federal money pays the rest of the $1.76 cost.
For a lunch to qualify for reimbursement, the students have to choose at least three of five components from the basic food groups provided at each meal. State inspectors monitor the schools to make sure that students are receiving the required lunch and that they are not openly identified as participants in the program.
Most officials expect the number of students who receive specially priced lunches to rise again in the new school year, partly because of new incentives for districts to increase the number of applicants. The officials say a new category of state aid, based on a formula that includes the number of lunch applications in a district, might spur greater efforts to attract participants.
 
'It's an Added Incentive'
 "Now that we know it's here," Mr. Dougherty said, "it's an added incentive."
Some of the parents of students who qualify but do not apply, Ms. O'Donnell said, are unaware of the program. Others are recent immigrants who, because of language difficulties and other barriers, are wary of the system and fear reprisals. Many are parents who have lost white-collar jobs and are unused to applying for Government benefits.
"We're reaching only those who are eligible who are inside the system," she said, "not those who are afraid or embarrassed to file." Asked whether their number was significant, Ms. O'Donnell said yes.
"I've always been suspicious that in the junior and senior high schools there are some remnants of pride," Mr. Springhorn said. "They may not want to participate, because it sets them apart."
"Pride or lack of knowledge prevent a lot from applying," Ms. Rein said. "Many fall by the wayside."

HEADLINE: Mentor to Some, Cult Leader to Others

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
TO his followers, he is Rama, a gifted teacher and spiritual leader with special powers who offers a path to enlightenment, happiness and career success. To his detractors, he is everything from a sophisticated con man to a dangerous cult leader.
Controversy has surrounded Dr. Frederick P. Lenz for the last 15 years as he has moved his base of operations to different cities around the country. Trina Walker, a former student, said that Dr. Lenz has more than a hundred students in Westchester County. He offers lectures at several places, including regular monthly lectures, by invitation only, at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase. The group has been renting space at SUNY for three years but is not affiliated with the college. 
 Last month Dr. Lenz was included in a list of groups labeled as cults in the Congressional Quarterly Researcher. The independent Washington-based publication -- owned by the St. Petersburg Times of St. Petersburg, Fla. -- describes him as follows:
"Rama (the American Buddhist Movement). Known as the 'yuppie guru,' Frederick P. Lenz, 43, lives in a Long Island mansion where, as Zen Master Rama, he offers business-oriented teachings. Some 900 members in several cities believe Lenz is the first earthly incarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu. To attend seminars and meditation sessions sponsored by Lenz's Advanced Systems Inc., adherents in such high-paying fields as computer programming allegedly pay up to $70,000 a year. Female members have said Lenz exploited them sexually."
 
'A Highly Ethical Person'
 Dr. Lenz, however, dismisses the allegations of psychological manipulation, financial exploitation and sexual abuse made at different times by former members of his group. Speaking to a reporter for the first time in several years to clarify what he said were gross distortions about his program, Dr. Lenz said such accusations were absurd.
"I am a highly ethical person," said Dr. Lenz, who has a doctorate in English literature from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "I'm a Buddhist, and I can't do stuff like that. I'd fry. I believe in karma. My experience is that people build you up and then shoot you down."
Dr. Lenz said that he taught a form of American Buddhism, in which he offered courses in meditation and computer science -- a field that he has always been interested in. "I'm mingling a few things -- the Oriental esthetic to life and meditation and, at the same time, a very American sense of how we as Americans can become successful," he said. People who meditated successfully seemed also to do well in computer programming, he added.
 
Doubts About the Master
 The accounts of Dr. Lenz's activities are a study in contrasts, depending on the source. For instance, Mark Laxer, one of Dr. Lenz's former students (from 1977 to 1985), said he remembers the first time that Rama announced that he had attained perfect awareness and true enlightenment. (Rama is the name for one of the incarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu.)
"Before he declared this he had us go on a 13-day fast, and I was pretty dizzy," Mr. Laxer said. "At that point he had about 100 disciples, and that's when he hit us with this news. It was like we were imprinted. After that, we were allowed to eat, but we had to stay up all night for a month."
Still, Mr. Laxer said he had his doubts about his spiritual leader's veracity. Some months later, Mr. Laxer packed his backpack and tried to leave the group, but he said that Dr. Lenz stopped him as he was about to head out the door.
"He managed to convince me to stay, but shortly thereafter he started giving me antipsychotic drugs, because he said the other spiritual techniques weren't working. Basically, at that point, my rational doubting side subsided for a few years," Mr. Laxer said.
Students who wish to study with Dr. Lenz usually begin with meditation courses, which are free or offered at a nominal cost. If they are invited to become formal students, they begin computer science courses, at which point the price tag increases. A five-day course with Dr. Lenz costs about $2,000, said several of his current students, all of whom are over 18. No one under 18 is accepted.
 
'Respect for His Judgment'
 Four students talked about their studies and their lives at the office of Dr. Lenz's lawyer, Jonathan Lubell. They said they had voluntarily switched careers after studying with Dr. Lenz.
Richard Harmon had been a graduate student in film school when he began meditation courses. He is now a computer consultant. Mordy Levine had been a partner in a trading firm on the American Stock Exchange. He has now been in the computer industry for four years. Marie Landis had been an artist; she is currently involved in computer programming. Terry Quirk had been pursuing a doctorate in earth science; she now has her own company providing software development and customization to corporations. They continue to pursue more advanced courses in computer science with Dr. Lenz.
All four said that they were happy and making considerably more money than they had in their former careers. Because their careers were so lucrative, they said they could easily continue to pay for Dr. Lenz's courses. They said they lived normal lives, were in contact with their families and had great admiration for their teacher, Dr. Lenz.
"Sometimes I feel this incredible love," said Mr. Levine. "It's not devotion or awe. But if he asked me to do something, say 98 out of 100 things he asked me to do, I would do, because I have incredible respect for his judgment, for his taking the right path."
The students brought up one of their most troublesome grievances. They said they believed that their names are on a blacklist, circulated by anti-cult groups to executive recruiters in an effort to prevent them from advancing in their careers. Richard Harmon likened critics of Dr. Lenz to Nazis. Studying meditation in America in the 1990's was "probably like being Jewish in Nazi Germany," he said. "The first thing they do is destroy you economically."
 
A Material and Spiritual World
 Dr. Lenz has been criticized for, among other things, his lavish life style, which includes a mansion in Long Island and travel by Lear jet. But he says that people have a misguided attitude that spirituality must be connected with poverty.
"People have gotten an attitude that somehow it is noble to be poor," Dr. Lenz said. "There is this tremendous negative take on the material world. It seems to me the material world is as spiritual as anything else," he said.
Dr. Lenz said that allegations of his running a cult are untrue, because among other things, his students are very much a part of the real world, holding jobs and living independently.
"There are no Branch Davidian compounds; there are no secret meetings," Dr. Lenz said. "The only time I meet people are at places like the Four Seasons or Tappan Hill or SUNY Purchase," he said.
 
'Under His Daily Control'
 Many people, however, consider Dr. Lenz a cult leader. Arnold Markowitz, director of the Cult Clinic, which is run by the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a social-services agency in Manhattan, said that "every cult-awareness group in the country has files filled with families and former members who have contacted them about Lenz."
"It's not just that he has a positive message of how to live one's life," Mr. Markowitz said. "It's that he has hundreds of people who are intimately under his daily control, which includes severing their ties with their families and helping to deceive their families."
Ms. Walker, the former student who studied with Dr. Lenz for five years, said that he told his students that families were filled with negative energy.
"He told us that our families did not want us to evolve spiritually, that they drain our energy," Ms. Walker said. "He had a lot of different ways to isolate us. If someone didn't like you, you should stay away from them. If they did like you, they just wanted to steal your energy. So you should stay away from them, too. And anyone in the group was competition."

 
'Parents Feel Betrayed'
 Dr. Herbert Nieberg, a psychologist with Four Winds Hospital in Cross River and an expert on cult mind control, said that he had worked with several parents whose children were involved with Dr. Lenz. Dr. Nieberg said the parents have been devastated by the involvement. "The children are no longer the people they knew," Dr. Nieberg said. "The parents feel betrayed; they feel bereaved. They've lost their child. We are not putting these groups down because of their religious beliefs. We are putting them down because of their destructive natures and what they do to people's lives. The stories are heart-rending."
One woman, who said she was in Dr. Lenz's group for five years and who agreed to be interviewed only on condition that her name not be used, said that he controlled every aspect of her life, despite her connections to the outside world.
"I lived independently, and I had a job the whole time, and I will tell you that during those years the clothes that I wore were the clothes he told us to wear, the only movies we were allowed to see were the ones he recommended," she said. "He used to spend hours on how we should behave."
The woman also said she had been sexually involved with Dr. Lenz. She said she was summoned to Dr. Lenz's mansion and told that sex with Rama was a speedway to enlightenment.
Dr. Lenz said that any sexual relations he had with female students involved informed consent. "I've never claimed to be celibate," he said, "but to suggest that in any way, shape, manner or form that I would do anything inappropriate to coerce a person to have sex with me is absurd."
Dr. Lenz attributed the numerous sexual-abuse allegations to the jealousy of unhappy lovers who felt that he had jilted them. He also provided a 107-page document that included personal profiles of people who had criticized him publicly in the past, most of whom Dr. Lenz accused of being mentally unbalanced.
 
A Dale Carnegie of the 90's
 As the national controversy over Dr. Lenz continues in the news media, the question over his continued presence at SUNY Purchase also remains an issue. Dr. Nieberg of Four Winds Hospital said that he was astounded that Dr. Lenz was allowed to operate on SUNY grounds. He said that if the president of the university had a son or daughter in the group, it would have been "off campus years ago."
But Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center, described Dr. Lenz as "no more than a Dale Carnegie of the 90's." Dr. Sheldon N. Grebstein, president of SUNY Purchase, also defended Dr. Lenz's use of the theater.
"They have been model clients -- they are orderly, pay their bills on time, arrive when they say and leave when they say," said Dr. Grebstein. "At SUNY Purchase we have directly witnessed none of the alleged cult activity."
Dr. Grebstein said that he and members of his college council have received a few letters of protest from several parents whose children were followers of Dr. Lenz and that he had consulted repeatedly with legal advisers concerning Dr. Lenz's use of the campus theater.

 
Signing a Disclaimer
 Dr. Grebstein added: "What these parents would like me to do is simply ban the group that we do business with called Advanced Systems Inc., which has been renting a theater in the Performing Arts Center for about three years. But the council has decided not to single out this group from all others, because it would involve an analysis or evaluation of the content of their programs. We do not make those judgments of the groups using the campus. Once we do that, are we going to approve the content of a symphony? You get into an impossible situation."
One thing that does distinguish the Advanced Systems lectures from that of a concert performance at the Performing Arts Center is the release form that student participants are asked to sign before attending. Under a paragraph titled "voluntariness," it reads:
"My attendance of the A.S.I. student program is entirely voluntary and any changes that I make in my personal life, life style, choice of career, place of residence, personal association or any other matters, including without limitation participation in martial arts of other physical development programs, are made entirely of my own free will and neither Dr. Lenz nor A.S.I. nor any agent or employee of A.S.I. or Dr. Lenz is responsible for any such change or changes."

HEADLINE: Avoiding Traffic Jams in the Computer Age

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
IT is 11 o'clock in the morning and an executive in White Plains is flying to Los Angeles at 2 P.M. Pressing a button on a computer in his office, the screen displays traffic information along the route to the airport and he sees a trouble spot on the far side of the Triborough Bridge and plans to leave the office early.
Such customized traffic-information programs are being marketed to companies by Westchester Commuter Central, a traffic-communications center in Elmsford and a joint venture between Westchester County and Metro Traffic Control, a Houston-based traffic reporting service, which operates traffic information centers in every state. Since November, the center has been supplying traffic and commuter information free of charge to county agencies, said Clifford Cole, the manager of the center.
 
5-Year Agreement With the County
 "Our traffic-information clearinghouse is the first public-private project of its kind in the country," Mr. Cole said. "It is also a showcase for our system." 
 Financing and operating expenses for the joint venture, he said, have been entirely supplied by Metro Traffic Control.
"Our costs are significant," Mr. Cole acknowledged. "In addition to office and salaries, we operate an airplane solely to monitor traffic conditions in Westchester, but we are investing in a long-term project.
"Westchester was desirable because it is a good location for our business since so many corporations are headquartered here. Eventually we hope to make a profit from commercial applications such as selling customized traffic-information programs to companies, installing traffic screens in shopping malls and hotels and supplying information tie-ins with local cable stations. We already have contracts with two radio stations, WXTS in Hawthorne and WRKL in Rockland County."
Westchester Commuter has a five-year agreement with the county to provide traffic and information on road conditions, Mr. Cole said. "In return the county gives us information from county agencies such as the Department of Public Works and the county's Bee-Line bus system," he said. "It's valuable information that a private company such as ours would normally not have access to."
In addition to Metro Traffic Control's own aircraft, traffic information comes into Commuter Central from a variety of sources, Mr. Cole said. They include police departments, the State Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, Metro Pool and Metro-North. Volunteers also transmit traffic information on the way to and from work and so do motorists who send in roadside reports, using CB's or cellular phones.
 
Being on Top of Conditions
 Mr. Cole said: "Every piece of information or tip we get is verified with a local police station within two minutes. The information is then immediately relayed to public transportation systems, Westchester police stations and local radio stations."
The goal, Mr. Cole said, is "to keep county drivers out of traffic jams by putting them on top of traffic conditions." He added: "Before we started operations, people in Westchester had to rely mainly on sources from outside the county. Now they get immediately updated information on local conditions."
Traffic reports are broadcast to radio stations and by computer-generated maps to television stations. The information is also sent by teleprinter and fax machines to more than 40 police departments and mass-transit agencies.
 
Avoiding Bottlenecks
 "Shortly after we opened, the value of our high-tech control system was graphically demonstrated by an incident that took place on the Sprainbrook Parkway in Yonkers," Mr. Cole recalled. "A car was going the wrong way on the parkway. We immediately notified all Bee-Line buses to avoid the area and alerted county and state police, who called in the Medivac emergency helicopter from the county medical center to oversee what might have been a potentially dangerous and fatal situation."
Shane Coppola, director of corporate development, said that traffic-information services are equally valuable to companies who want to alert their commuting employees to possible traffic problems.
"We feel any company with more than 100 employees is a potential customer," Mr. Coppola said. "We have a data-delivery system, Traffictrak, designed for business. With it we can transmit up-to-the-minute traffic information 12 hours a day to companies. The system uses a computer modem and screens displaying current traffic conditions, accidents, construction tie-ups and weather conditions. Employees see the information they need to get home from work and avoid the bottlenecks and usual delays on the road."
The cost of the service, Mr. Coppola said, ranges from $500 to $1,500 a month.
The company's Infotrak, a traffic and mobility information kiosk that displays updated information on customized traffic maps, Mr. Coppola added, is being marketed to shopping malls, hotels and conference centers.
"What it does, for instance, is this," Mr. Coppola said. "A shopper at the Galleria in White Plains who may live in Connecticut can punch a destination into a computer in the lobby at the Galleria and get the latest road conditions on Route 287."
 
Contract With Nynex
 The first commercial agreement with a corporation in Westchester, he said, was recently signed with Nynex in White Plains.
"It's a trial program for Nynex," Mr. Coppola said. "They are customizing our service with add-ons to promote use of their cellular phones. Customers in their Travel Assurance Program, which offers traffic information and will now include roadside, restaurant, hotel and medical-emergency information as well."
Mr. Coppola, who said he is spending most of his time finding out what customers want, observed that many want more than traffic information. "Some want company news beamed in; others want sports between the traffic spots, but we have the capability to provide all kinds of customized information."
By year's end, he estimated, Commuter Central will have 5 to 10 corporate subscribers. "Good, but it will mean we're not quite at the break-even point," he said. "Selling a service like ours in a recession is more difficult. We have to convince customers that in the long run what we will be saving them is money because we will be lowering stress and increasing productivity among their employees, which is what happens when people can get to and from work without traffic hassles."

HEADLINE: From Bosnian Crisis To All-Out War

BYLINE: By George Kenney; George Kenney, a consultant to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was State Department desk officer for Yugoslavia until he quit in August to protest U.S. policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The horror in Bosnia will not reach a natural equilibrium at which the fighting will stop. Nor will other areas of the former Yugoslavia remain quiet for long. It is likely that at least as many innocent people will die as have already died -- more than 200,000 -- and that the conflict will inexorably spread outside the former Yugoslavia.
Western leaders cannot pretend their policy failure is a success. Nobody, especially President Clinton, should think that because the West has abandoned Bosnia to partition the war will go away. The repercussions of inaction remain sobering. Here is a tour d'horizon and its likely development: 
In Bosnia, no party has any incentive to stop fighting. The Muslims will never lay down their weapons in unconditional surrender: Serbs and Croats would only kill them more quickly. Serbian forces have not yet met all their territorial objectives: In eastern Bosnia, they want Srebrenica, an important road junction; in western Bosnia, they want Bihac, another junction; across central Bosnia, they want a new corridor linking Serb occupied territories; finally, they intend to raze Sarajevo, because as long as it stands it is a vital symbol of Bosnia's existence.
The Serbs will be able to destroy Sarajevo if they make only a few more advances. Shelling is a serious problem, but it doesn't level the city. Up to now, the city has been spared the worst because Serbian tanks and artillery fire into it from hilltop positions that require a high trajectory for shells. Gravity deprives the shells of a terminal velocity sufficient to penetrate deeply into buildings. People who live below the top floors in high-rises are safe.
If Serbian forces capture a key bridge on the western outskirts of town, they could fire high-velocity shells horizontally into almost all buildings, bringing them down in rubble. With control of that position, Serbian forces could sweep the broad east-west avenues with gunfire, turning them into killing fields.
Three times this year, Serbian forces have fought for the bridge but lost. They aren't able to back up tank movements with infantry. But it is only a matter of time, once they take the bridge, before they can easily drive Sarajevo residents into hills to the north. There wouldn't be enough housing in the hills, nor would people have easy access to water or relief supplies. Sarajevo, goodbye.
Where can the Muslims go? Not Croatia. The United Nations worries that it may have to resettle Muslim refugees already in Croatia to somewhere else in Europe, because the Croatian Government is showing signs of wanting to throw the Muslims out. Not Croatian areas of Bosnia. Croatian forces do not allow Muslim resettlement, for fear of eventual Muslim demographic and political domination. Elsewhere in Europe? The United States? But the Muslims could not get out of Bosnia unless the international community evacuates all one million-plus of them.
Over the summer, the Serbs and the Croats will pack the Muslims into a few ever smaller areas, the main one being around and to the south of Tuzla. Those areas are not self-sufficient, but neither Serbs nor Croats will allow supplies through; only the international community's pathetically inadequate aid may get in, via Sarajevo or Tuzla airport. The Muslims will continue to fight. The better armed Serbs and Croats will continue the slaughter. By the middle of winter, the Muslims' cumulative death toll may reach over half a million.
United Nations "negotiations" over Bosnia are so utterly obscene they do not warrant serious comment. Only force on the ground counts. Lord Owen, abandoning the peace plan he co-authored with Cyrus Vance, admitted as much, despite his naive plea for negotiations to continue. Both diplomats bear a heavy responsibility for collaborating with Serbian aggression.
In Croatia, it is highly likely the Croatians and Serbians will renew full-scale war over Serb-occupied Croatia this summer. For weeks, both sides have been mobilizing. Some observers say Serbia has even brought heavy artillery within striking distance of Zagreb. Immense Serbian military convoys move regularly towards Croatia.
Each side demands the other's submission. Serbia will not allow Croatia peace on the Dalmatian coast because with normality comes billions of tourist dollars, which the Croatian Government would use to build its military into a threat to Serbian occupied areas. But for political and economic reasons, the Croatian Government absolutely cannot cede control of the coast to Serbia.
There is still breathing room because Croatia has not quite built up sufficient strength to go on the offensive, and the U.N. still provides something of a buffer. The U.N. mandate, however, expires June 30, and Croatia may not renew it. The Croatian Government is already beating the war drums for its domestic and expatriate constituencies.
What that Government seems not to realize is that given its complicity in the dismemberment of Bosnia, its poor record on human and civil rights for minorities -- mainly Serb -- and its lack of freedom of the press, it is unlikely to get much sympathy from the international community for a new offensive.
Perhaps Croatia counts on Austria and Germany, historic allies, to supply it in an all-out war. They may do so, but only in the teeth of extreme Russian opposition and probably also against the express will of the international community. European powers once again are about to line up behind Balkan clients. The Western alliance seems set to burst apart at the seams in a far more serious way than its previous dithering over who is to blame for NATO's failure to deal with this crisis.
Turning to Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic is becoming an increasingly authoritarian dictator. Until recently, he was content to control the mass electronic media, the police, the secret police, the military and some sectors of the economy, leaving the rest of society in chaos. Now that sanctions have broken open some of the fissures in Serbia, and with the ultra-right gaining strength, Mr. Milosevic must simultaneously clamp down on dissent and move to the right to protect his flank. As before, his main tool is to generate hatred and turn it outward.
What Western leaders consistently fail to understand is that President Milosevic must have a war; if he declared a real peace today (he could), the Serbian people would ask what he has done for them. Within months, he would be out of power.
In Vojvodina, Serbia's northern province, Belgrade is purposefully resettling Serb refugees from Bosnia who have experience in "ethnically cleansing" their neighbors. That threatens Vojvodina's ethnic Hungarians. Serbian dissidents from Vojvodina believe conflict could break out soon, but if Serbia pushes hundreds of thousands of Hungarians over the border into Hungary, that could drag Hungary into the war.
In the Serbian province of Kosovo, tensions continue to rise. Provocateurs are determined to set the spark that will give Serbian militants a pretext to drive most of the region's 1.8 million Albanians over the border into Albania or Macedonia.
American warnings that we are serious about Kosovo are no longer credible. The consensus in the American intelligence community is the same as last year: It is not a question of whether Kosovo will explode, but when.
In Macedonia, the Government waits desperately for American recognition in the hope that recognition plus economic aid and security guarantees may stop the conflict from spilling over or make it manageable if it does. The 300 American soldiers President Clinton is sending constitute the beginning of a trip wire, but our military mission must have a diplomatic backstop. Otherwise, the temptation will be too great to cut and run if the fighting starts.
Greece would like part of Macedonia, as would Albania and Bulgaria; if war breaks out there, the West would need hundreds of thousands to troops to quell it.
A general Balkan war is brewing. For the West, it's still not too late to begin to bring the situation under control. Here are several actions the U.S. and the West should consider:
Send Western troops to enforce Bosnian safe havens around Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Gorazde and Srebrenica. About 50,000 to 70,000 would do the job. If we won't protect the Muslims from slaughter, we should give them arms to defend themselves, including Swedish-made "smart" mortars and anti-tank weapons.
Enforce the U.N. injunction against Serbian resupply of Serbian forces in Bosnia. Put monitors on the border. If Serbia refuses them, use warplanes to destroy all traffic between Serbia and Bosnia.
Begin covert operations against the Milosevic regime. Psychological warfare is worth a try. Step up Radio Free Europe broadcasts. Increase by several orders of magnitude Western support for Serbian opposition movements. Change the U.N. mandate in Croatia to allow de facto U.N. control -- not de facto Serbian control -- of U.N. zones. Put in an additional 10,000 peacekeepers. If Croatia balks, threaten sanctions. If the Serbians balk, threaten war.
For the U.S., recognize Macedonia. Add 5,000 to 10,000 heavily armed U.N. troops. Provide large-scale economic aid.
Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration shows no stomach for U.S. involvement in the Balkans. But things change. As the crisis becomes more obviously the catastrophe that it is, President Clinton may yet decide to act. If he does nothing and a general war begins, however, he will clearly share responsibility for it.

HEADLINE: Ailing Giants Slow Economy

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA

 BODY:
AT the idyllic 120-acre head quarters of Reader's Digest here where employees grow vegetables and flowers in little plots during lunch hour and exercise on running trails that crisscross the estate-like grounds -- news of layoffs early this month shattered an image that this large corporation had of remaining untouched by the economic hard times.
But to regional economists, the announcement that the global publisher of magazines, books and home entertainment products was laying off 250 workers here -- about 10 percent of its work force in the United States -- came as just one more piece of hard evidence that the county continues to be bogged down by economic difficulties, even though other parts of the state and the nation are beginning to show signs of life. 
 "The great cloud of restructuring still hangs over Westchester and the Hudson Valley -- and will for some time to come," said Frank M. Surdey, an economist with the State Labor Department.
 
'A One-Company Town'
 Analysts say that Westchester is having trouble pulling out of the recession because it is top-heavy with large corporations that are laying off workers in tough times. Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the County Office of Economic Development, called the situation "a little like being a one-company town." The corporate reductions -- with more yet to come, the experts predict -- mask healthy growth being reported by many small and middle-size companies in the county.
A Reader's Digest spokesman, David Fluhrer, said the publisher was laying off 100 people immediately, with the remaining cutbacks spread out over the next 15 months. The company currently employs 2,500 workers in the United States -- 1,800 of which are at the headquarters here -- and another 7,500 worldwide.
 
Supporting Education and Arts
 The layoffs, which mostly involve hourly-wage jobs in customer-service and order-processing departments, follow a corporate decision to transfer some of those services to outside companies.
Reader's Digest, which was founded in 1922 by DeWitt and Lila Wallace, went public in 1990 and began selling voting stock last year, although 74 percent of the voting stock is held by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. The Wallaces died in the early 1980's and left ownership of the company to the two funds, which between them approved grants for more than $150 million to education and the arts last year. The two funds have combined assets of about $2 billion.
Although the company carries on the original owners' mission -- to educate, inspire and entertain readers -- it has had to meet modern-day economic pressures by instituting cost-control measures, among them the layoffs, said the company chairman, George V. Grune. Specifically, he cited a 6 percent decline from a year ago in United States revenues, primarily because of lower sales during the third quarter of the 1993 fiscal year in the books and home entertainment division, which markets music and video products as well as books.
Worldwide revenues for the company are up, however, to $737.6 million for the third quarter of the current fiscal year from $718.6 million for the third quarter of the 1992 fiscal year. Total worldwide revenues for fiscal 1992 were $2.6 billion; total United States revenues for the fiscal year of 1992 were $1.146 billion.
Thomas J. Spitznas, a regional economist and president of Thomas J. Spitznas Associates in Mount Vernon, said that although Reader's Digest was laying off mostly hourly workers, as opposed to middle management, it was otherwise following a typical corporate pattern. "Everyone's doing it, and the shareholders expect it," he said.
 
'You Have a Problem'
 Mr. Spitznas called the current hard times in Westchester "the worst suburban recession ever" and said that "when you live by the corporate headquarters complex, you die by the corporate headquarters complex."
He added: "In previous recessions, Westchester was late to go into it and early to come out, because white-collar workers were not affected. Now if you're in the wrong white-collar business, you have a problem."
At I.B.M., for example, the Westchester work force has declined from 12,000 in 1991 to 9,400 at the present time.
The latest figures show that the county's unemployment rate for April was 4.5 percent, down from 5.5 percent a year ago, all of which "doesn't look that bad on the surface," Mr. Surdey said. But the figures fail to take into account the many discouraged workers who have stopped looking for jobs. Also, unemployment figures this time of year traditionally drop, reflecting increased hiring of seasonal workers.
 
Figures Tell the Story
 In April, the most recent month for which figures are available, the unemployment rate statewide was 7 percent; in New York City, it was 9.8 percent.
But Mr. Surdey said the real story about Westchester's economy was to be learned from studying figures showing that the county lost 38,200 jobs since April 1989 -- down 9.3 percent in four years, to 368,800 from 407,000.
The number of jobs in the county during April was at the lowest point for this time of year since 1983, with factory jobs at an "all-time record low," Mr. Surdey said.
Manufacturing jobs were down to 46,600 in April, from 50,900 a year ago. And jobs in the service sector -- which includes transportation and public utilities, the wholesale and retail trade, and finance, insurance and real estate -- fell to 307,800 from 310,300 over 12 months.
 
Jobs in New York City
 By comparison, there has been a healthy increase in jobs statewide, "a real spark of life," Mr. Surdey said. And New York City has at least stabilized, gaining 1,000 new jobs in a one-month period from March to April.
The renewed activity in New York City, especially in health and social services and in the security and commodities fields, has provided some jobs for unemployed Westchester residents.
But the county's employment picture will continue to be dark, with more layoffs expected from I.B.M. and other companies that are still readjusting their work forces, along with the scheduled closing in the summer of 1995 of the General Motors North Tarrytown auto assembly plant, with 2,100 workers.
Similarly, the commercial real estate picture remains discouraging, with vacancy rates this spring at 26.4 percent countywide, and at 35 percent in the downtown area of White Plains. Those figures represent some of the highest vacancy rates for the county in the past 10 years, said David A. Doern, a partner in Rostenberg-Doern Company, a corporate real estate broker with offices in Purchase and Stamford.
 
Small Companies Thrive
 Although some Fortune 500 companies have vacated space, and others are leasing smaller quarters, Mr. Doern said rental activity from small and mid-size companies was brisk and may "in the long run represent a healthier trend -- a more balanced marketplace."
Small and mid-size companies specializing in technology and health- care services, for example, tend to be faring well in spite of the economy, said Ms. Preston of the county's Economic Development Office.
Among them is Micro-Bio-Medics in Pelham Manor, a distributor of supplies to doctors and hospitals. It also distributes sports medicine supplies -- elastic tapes, balms and other over-the-counter remedies -- to the Giants, Knicks and Rangers and to colleges and high schools.
 
'Record-Breaking Years'
 The company's president, Bruce J. Haber, said Micro-Bio-Medics, which employs 180 people, had "record-breaking years during the recession" and acquired smaller companies that were not faring well.
Similarly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, which develops drugs for neurological disorders, has been a recession-proof business, reported Fredric D. Price, vice president for finance and administration for the publicly held corporation. The company, which employs 220, discovers and develops what are known as biotechnological drugs, which are clones of proteins that naturally occur in the human body, to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example.
"Because we are in an area of high science and are developing drugs for the future, we have not been affected by the economy," Mr. Price said.
Municipal Bond Investor Assurance Corporation in Armonk has also seen record profits. "Because we insure bonds throughout the country, we have been insulated from some regional slowdowns," said David H. Elliott, the company's president. The company employs 325 workers and recently added 60,000 square feet of office space to its 100,000-square-foot headquarters, which Mr. Elliott said was "probably the only new commercial construction project in Westchester in two to three years."

THE FIFTIES
By David Halberstam.
Illustrated. 800 pp. New York:
Villard Books. $27.50. 
 THE 1950's are still part of living memory, but they already enjoy an uneasy status as a kind of political litmus test for retrospective distortion. Those who see as unmixed blessings the great 60's breakthroughs to sexual freedom and self-expression tend to look on the 50's as repressive and boring. Those, like this reviewer, who sometimes wonder if we'll ever recover from the mess the 60's got us into, think fondly of the 50's as a lost moment of sanity, stability and self-discipline. It is possible, of course, to hold both views at different moments of any given day, as you read the papers or watch the news.
Ideologically speaking, the years that David Halberstam brings to life in "The Fifties" are marked by mean politics as the Republicans and the Democrats, blowing the cold war out of all sensible proportion, push for bigger bombs while accusing each other of being soft on Communism. On the social scene, television sitcoms promote bland, puritanical conformity to parental authority. Bigger tail fins and planned obsolescence are turning Americans into a collection of shallow, shameless consumers. In flowering suburbia, women are miserable being wives and moms; even our economic success, which brought millions of people into the middle class, is a source of incipient moral disaster. "Were we as a nation already well on our way to becoming faceless drones, performing bland tasks that demanded no real skill save managerial obedience?" Mr. Halberstam asks at one point, taking C. Wright Mills and the New Left more seriously than they deserve.
But cheer up. In the midst of all the hypocrisy and conformity, fruitful seeds are germinating. Dr. Kinsey is at work trying to make us all talk more about sex. Goody Pincus is pressing in on the invention of the Pill. Up in Rockland County, New York, Betty Friedan is taking notes for "The Feminine Mystique." Meanwhile, Elvis Presley, James Dean, Jack Kerouac and Marlon Brando, with a little help from Hugh Hefner of Playboy, are about to make sex, teen-age melancholy and self-absorption a main stream in American life.
Happily for his readers, David Halberstam, the author of "The Best and the Brightest" and a string of best sellers, is a great reporter. His long, long thoughts are kept mercifully short. What he spends most of his time doing is presenting the 50's as a series of mini-biographies -- a sort of Dictionary of National Biography for the decade. Inevitably there are the familiar good old guys: Harry S. Truman, Dean Acheson, Adlai Stevenson. And there are the familiar bad old guys, for the most part (surprise!) hard-line, cold-war, cold-shower Republican Protestants whom, whatever our politics, most of us remember without affection. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, plunging toward the Yalu River to invite World War III -- and a deserved firing by doughty little Harry Truman. Tricky Richard Nixon, mealy-mouthing his way through the "Checkers" speech on television to keep his place on Dwight D. Eisenhower's ticket. (Nearly everything in this book either "signals" or "symbolizes" a future trend; this is one of many that let us know television is going to have a long-term grip on American politics.) And, naturally, Ike's self-righteous Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, who spoke blithely of brinkmanship and did not realize the anti-Communist policies more or less appropriate to Europe would be idiotic and potentially ruinous if applied to Asia.
Senator Joseph McCarthy (no cold-shower Protestant he) flashes through in a splendid cameo appearance that spares us most of the already overexploited horror-show stuff. But the author does etch in some fine detail from McCarthy's early attack-dog period, including a scene in which the Senator from Wisconsin and an assemblage of reporters sit in silence for 15 minutes -- at a press conference, no less -- because he has refused to make good on his claim that there is a Communist on the staff of The Milwaukee Journal.
To his credit, Mr. Halberstam, who generally tends to adore the press, blames journalists for reporting McCarthy's charges deadpan when they knew he was dealing in dangerous eyewash. One "Red" cited by McCarthy was a certain "Howard Shipley . . . a Harvard astrologer." This was as close as he could get to Harlow Shapley, a world-famous Harvard astronomer.
Mr. Halberstam is also a relentless synthesizer. For his section on the rise and significance of Elvis Presley, he seems to have digested 13 books written about the Pelvis. But he freshens it up a bit by lacing in some interviewing he did on the music beat as a reporter in Nashville in 1956. Other sections are often more than twice-told tales. But for every William Levitt, yet again seen building middle-class suburban conformity in Long Island at prices most folks could afford, there is a lesser-known figure. Kemmons Wilson, for instance, a Tennessee builder who got so mad at the accommodations he and his family encountered on a trip to Washington in 1951 that he started Holiday Inns -- the rest is motel history.
The book also delves into the fateful annals of Detroit to introduce "the Cellini of Chrome," the autocratic General Motors designer Harley Earl, who is said to be responsible for big tail fins and the switch to style over performance as the standard for American cars. And Mr. Halberstam exhumes the advertising man Rosser Reeves, one of the early masters of making uncheckable claims for a product on television, who created the first 15-second Presidential campaign spots -- for Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. ("Feeling sluggish, feeling sick? / Take a dose of Ike and Dick," ran a parody of the time.) Eisenhower hated them, but complied. Stevenson refused such help entirely.
Mourning the folly of an age with laughter, though, is decidedly not David Halberstam's thing, and he is most leaden when seriously weighing the value of fluff. For him the success of "I Love Lucy" merely signals the growing power of television and, as he sees it, the dread fact that viewers are confusing television with reality. When it comes to breaking a butterfly upon a wheel he can be right up there with the archfeminists, humorlessly trashing gentle, escapist comedy like "Leave It to Beaver" for being elitist (not everybody has a Mom and Dad like that) and for not providing a grimmer picture of family life.
What the author is best equipped to do is to bring to life again the civil rights struggles of the decade, starting with the Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954. Characteristically, he has found and interviewed little-known individuals whose experiences are remarkably telling, even in an age grown used to such accounts. Frederic Morrow is an example. A Republican and former N.A.A.C.P. field secretary, he became, under Eisenhower, the first black special assistant to work in the White House. But even so, in segregated Washington, humiliations multiplied. Taxis would not pick him up. He could not eat in white restaurants, and when at last he found an apartment, he was told he could rent it only if he used the freight elevator.
MR. HALBERSTAM draws on his own experience as a reporter in the South from 1955 to 1960 to re-create the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Money, Miss., and the subsequent trial in which the murderers went free. He also re-examines the 1958 struggle to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., when Eisenhower, flummoxed by Gov. Orval Faubus, finally had to send the 101st Airborne to keep order and escort nine black children to school.
It was the first time Federal troops had been ordered into a Southern state to protect the constitutional rights of black people since Reconstruction. Yet the most significant event of the 50's, here in the United States at least, was probably the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott, an unparalleled act of communal courage by blacks, starting with Rosa Parks's refusal to move to the back of a bus. Even if you have lately read Taylor Branch's "Parting the Waters," Mr. Halberstam's retelling is worth the trip. It is hard to read the short speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. just before the fateful boycott decision without feeling a sense of awe, and something like gratitude. It is the same feeling stirred by the greatness of spirit of men like James Madison, or George Washington warning his soldiers not to take arms against the feckless and cowardly Continental Congress because in so doing they will destroy everything they've fought for. "If we are wrong," King told the crowd, "the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. . . . If we are wrong, justice is a lie."

THE FIFTIES
By David Halberstam.
Illustrated. 800 pp. New York:
Villard Books. $27.50. 
 THE 1950's are still part of living memory, but they already enjoy an uneasy status as a kind of political litmus test for retrospective distortion. Those who see as unmixed blessings the great 60's breakthroughs to sexual freedom and self-expression tend to look on the 50's as repressive and boring. Those, like this reviewer, who sometimes wonder if we'll ever recover from the mess the 60's got us into, think fondly of the 50's as a lost moment of sanity, stability and self-discipline. It is possible, of course, to hold both views at different moments of any given day, as you read the papers or watch the news.
Ideologically speaking, the years that David Halberstam brings to life in "The Fifties" are marked by mean politics as the Republicans and the Democrats, blowing the cold war out of all sensible proportion, push for bigger bombs while accusing each other of being soft on Communism. On the social scene, television sitcoms promote bland, puritanical conformity to parental authority. Bigger tail fins and planned obsolescence are turning Americans into a collection of shallow, shameless consumers. In flowering suburbia, women are miserable being wives and moms; even our economic success, which brought millions of people into the middle class, is a source of incipient moral disaster. "Were we as a nation already well on our way to becoming faceless drones, performing bland tasks that demanded no real skill save managerial obedience?" Mr. Halberstam asks at one point, taking C. Wright Mills and the New Left more seriously than they deserve.
But cheer up. In the midst of all the hypocrisy and conformity, fruitful seeds are germinating. Dr. Kinsey is at work trying to make us all talk more about sex. Goody Pincus is pressing in on the invention of the Pill. Up in Rockland County, New York, Betty Friedan is taking notes for "The Feminine Mystique." Meanwhile, Elvis Presley, James Dean, Jack Kerouac and Marlon Brando, with a little help from Hugh Hefner of Playboy, are about to make sex, teen-age melancholy and self-absorption a main stream in American life.

HEADLINE: The Cotton Brief

BYLINE: By PAUL SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
YOU like to think of yourself as a member in good standing of the biosphere. You recycle, now that it's the law. You try to buy organic grapes and try not to buy plastic bags. You even give money to the National Resources Defense Council, though you're a little behind on your Amicus Journals. But you and Sting see eye to eye on the rain forest, and that's important. You believe in compost as a concept, and even though you voted for Al Gore, you nodded when former Environmental President George Bush said in 1992 that buying cotton instead of synthetics would "restore America's moral fiber."
No, you're not the arch-druid, but between your naked self and the world it's strictly natural fibers, right down to your briefs. You're green. 
 Or are you . . . the Toxic Avenger?
As any of the growing number of sellers of green clothes will tell you, cotton farming is one of the most intensive users of agricultural chemicals. And agricultural runoff is one of the greatest sources of water pollution: ground water in at least 38 states is tainted with pesticides. Furthermore, conventional cotton processing and dyeing involve a brew of chemicals that often end up down the drain, in the air or in the garment.
Manifestoes against cotton abound. Take, for instance, Ecosport's packaging of its brand-new line of underwear from organically grown cotton. Repeated in tiny type, wrapped around the border of the label, is this sentence: "In the U.S. alone, more than 20 million pounds of pesticides are dumped on cotton crops each year." Only certified organic cotton, the label says in other places, is raised without chemical pesticides.
And it's not just the environmental clothiers who are sounding off about King Cotton, either; its old nemeses, the synthetic fiber makers, are starting to chime in.
"People think of cotton as this little fluffy boll in the field," said Judith Langan, a spokeswoman for Wellman, a Fortune 500 plastics company. "But cotton is an environmental nightmare."
This fall, Patagonia's cold-weather fleece jackets will be available in Wellman's new Ecospun, a fiber that's made almost entirely from recycled plastic bottles. Ecospun is essentially, gasp, polyester, not a fabric generally worn with pride on Earth Day.
This may be a watershed year for the anti-cotton, eco-friendly clothing movement. The giant rayon manufacturer Courtaulds has introduced what it calls an "environmentally favorable" fiber called Tencel, which is already being used by Calvin Klein and Marithe and Francois Girbaud and in Esprit's Ecollection. One of the largest mills in the country, Dixie Yarns, isselling a line of minimally processed cotton clothes called Earthwise, and Banana Republic is test-marketing a few organic cottons.
The arrival of Tencel and Ecospun in the green clothing business will probably confuse consumers who thought that only natural fibers were friendly to Mother Nature. More than a few "visionary greens," the term American Demographics magazine uses for the 15 percent of consumers who regularly buy environmental products, will be left wondering what to wear. And the 20 percent at the other end of the spectrum, whom the magazine calls "hard-core browns," will be laughing up their polyester sleeves.
It's going to be a battle. Choose your fiber.
 
The Case for Organic Cotton
 "There are a million acres of soil here in California where I promise that no matter how hard you look you will not find an earthworm," Ed Davis said recently by telephone from his organic cotton farm near Bakersfield, Calif. Earthworms are a sign of healthy soil, he said. Earthworms are good. Before he raised organic cotton, Mr. Davis was one of California's most successful pesticide "consultants," the preferred industry euphemism for salesman. "I know both sides pretty well," he said modestly.
The absence of worms, or much of anything else in the way of beneficial organisms living in the soil on most conventional cotton farms isn't suprising, given the way the crop is usually raised. Before planting, cottonseed is treated with a fungicide, and the field is virtually sterilized with a general fumigant like aldicarb, a ground-water contaminant familiar to Long Islanders, or even methyl bromide, a ozone eater even more potent than the infamous chlorofluorocarbons.
Over the course of a summer, the cotton gets hit with as many as 10 doses of pesticides for mites, aphids and other bugs. Plant-growth regulators are applied several times a season; so are water-soluble fertilizers, which have an annoying tendency to wash downstream where they do wonders for algae but not for fish.
The spraying doesn't stop at harvest time. To remove the plant's leaves, which can stain the cotton or leave flecks in it during processing, a defoliant is applied. A usual choice for this job is paraquat, which is popular with the Drug Enforcement Agency for use on marijuana fields, or arsenic acid.
The chemicals linger. In fact, Mr. Davis said, the residues are so strong that it usually takes at least five years of careful mulching, composting and crop rotation before the soil is no longer toxic to worms. Cotton that is certified as organic is grown in a field that has not been treated with inorganic chemicals for at least three years.
The organic farmer tries to plant when weather's right: seeds that sprout quickly don't need to be treated with fungicide. Instead of the usual array of insecticides, the organic farmer relies on other insects, sometimes going as far as buying tens of thousands of lacewings and spreading them on a field. Hoes, lots of them, replace herbicides. Compost by the ton, bought from commercial composters, takes the place of inorganic fertilizers. And to defoliate the cotton at the end of the season, Mr. Davis said, "we pray for a frost." If there is no frost? "We pray some more," he said.
"I don't throw stones at the conventional farmers," Mr. Davis was quick to add. "They have to compete in the global market, where there are even fewer pesticide controls than here, and labor is almost free."
What's more, he said, they have to satisfy an American consumer who wants a perfect red apple and a cheap cotton T-shirt. For all their environmental drawbacks, he said, the chemicals do work: yields from fields treated with them are improved by 20 percent.
Lower yields and higher labor costs are two of the reasons why organic cotton currently sells for three to four times the price of conventional cotton. But these higher costs are offset by savings on chemicals.
"The rest of the price difference is risk," Mr. Davis said. "Most of the farmers I know around here would love to switch to organic if they were confident there would be a market. But the customer has to demand it."
Right now the organic cotton farmers of the San Joaquin Valley in California have more than a million pounds of last year's cotton looking for a buyer.
 
Greener Cotton
 Virtually all organically grown cotton is "green," but not all "green cotton" is organic. Such confusion arises from the fact that conventionally grown cotton's environmental difficulties don't stop at the farm, which explains how Higgins Natural and Earthwise are marketing their clothes as "environmentally forward" even though they are not organically grown. While clothes are either certified organic cotton or they aren't, the competing claims about everything that happens to cotton after it's ginned can confound even the most studious of eco-shoppers. Hence, "green cotton" has come to mean cotton that is conventionally grown but minimally processed after it's ginned.
Conventionally processed cotton is likely to be treated with formaldehyde, chlorine bleach and any of a handful of resins to whiten it, reduce shrinkage, prevent curling and otherwise make it easier to work with. All the green-wear companies have various alternatives to the conventional finishing processes. Bleaching is usually eliminated entirely or is done with hydrogen peroxide instead of chlorine. Instead of using formaldehyde to limit shrinkage, manufacturers preshrink the fabric by washing it. Starch may be used instead of polyvinyl acetate, the conventional anti-curling agent. Enzyme washes replace conventional softeners and fading agents. Zippers and other hardware are not electroplated, eliminating a process that creates hazardous sludge.
But the stickler continues to be the dyeing process. Because cotton is particularly resistant to coloring, conventional dying methods send as much as half of the dye down the drain. So-called natural dyes, made from roots, berries, insects, recyled coffee grounds, sound great but often require the addition of toxic additives like chrome, arsenic or copper to prevent them from fading. Some companies, like Earthwise, have eliminated the heavy metals in some natural dyes but only in a fairly limited range of colors.
Even more limited at this point are the naturally colored cottons grown by a company called Fox Fibre. For 10 years, Sally Fox has been crossbreeding cotton that grows, like Indian corn, in different colors. For reasons that aren't yet clear, her naturally colored cotton actually gets darker each time it's washed. So far only four colors are commercially available -- two browns and two greens -- and occasionally show up in Ecollection, the L. L. Bean catalogue and elsewhere as "naturally colored cotton."
Most environmentally sensitive clothiers rely on what are called "low-impact bi-functional" dyes. Though these are often trumpeted on many green-wear tags, bi-functional dyes are just conventional synthetic dyes, only vastly improved: only about 10 percent of the dye go down the drain.
 
Not Only God Can Make Tencel
 Like its uncle, rayon, Tencel is made from trees. In Tencel's case, they are mostly hardwoods from tree farms in the South that are turned into pulp. The pulp is then further dissolved in a solvent, extruded through a device that looks like a shower head and spun into fiber, in a process that Courtaulds spent 10 years and $100 million developing.
Tencel's environmental claims are based, in part, on the fact that pulp trees are a renewable resource that are not heavily treated with pesticides or fertilizers. And like most manufactured fibers, Tencel is much more amenable to dying than cotton, so less dye is wasted. But what really sets Tencel apart environmentally from rayon, which has a long and less-than-distinguished record of pollution, is that virtually all of the solvents used in the fiber-making process are recovered and re-used.
A potential crack in Tencel's green armor is the pulp-making process. The Council on Economic Priorities, a corporate watchdog in New York, said that American pulp mills released 144.3 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the environment in 1990, the latest year for which data are available.
"We rely on our pulp suppliers to be as reliable environmentally as they can," was all that Glyn Raven, the industrial marketing manager for Tencel, would say on that subject.
 
The Return of, Gasp, Synthetics
 "Your modern, state-of-the-art acrylic plant on 200 acres of land -- and that's pretty enough land to take your family there for a picnic -- produces as much fiber as 64 million sheep," said Paul T. O'Day, the president of the American Fiber Manuacturers Association in Washington.
Grazing that many sheep would require about as much land as there is east of the Mississippi, Mr. O'Day said. "There would be environmental consequences to that many sheep, not to mention the dry cleaning," he continued. "We all know how bad dry cleaning is for the environment."
Mr. O'Day's organization recently commissioned a cradle-to-grave analysis of a polyester blouse. The study by Franklin Associates, an independent environmental research group in Prairie Village, Kan., found that more than 80 percent of the energy consumption and solid waste over the lifetime of the blouse came from washing and drying.
The advent of recycled synthetic fibers like the Ecospun in the new Patagonia jackets ups ante even further. An independent "environmental report card" done by a company called Scientific Certification Systems found that Ecospun had a lower environmental impact than virgin polyester in virtually every category. "Unless you're willing to do a life-cycle analysis, you're not an environmentalist," said Ms. Langan of Wellman.
Both Herb Rabinowitz, the executive director of the Acrylic Council in New York, and Ms. Langan cautioned against expecting some sort of showdown between the synthetic fiber manufacturers and the cotton industry. Two of the three American acrylic manufacturers, Monsanto and American Cyanamid, Mr. Rabinowitz pointed out, are also major producers of agricultural chemicals: "They wouldn't want to upset their farmers."

GRAPHIC: Photos: TENCEL: Like rayon, Tencel is made from wood pulp. It is being used by Calvin Klein and Marithe and Francois Girbaud and in Esprit's Ecollection.

NO LONGER KING: Cotton's hegemony is being challenged by organic cotton, which sells for three to four times the price of the conventionally grown stuff.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Sailing Isn't Smooth, But It's Sailing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FIVE months into the Clinton Administration its pattern of governing is now starting to emerge.
The best way to capture it is to compare this Administration to the previous one. The Bush Administration on domestic affairs was like a boat that was perfectly trimmed, fore and aft, with the captain dressed to the nines. But it never left the dock. The Clinton Administration, it is now becoming clear, is like a boat headed out to sea, dragging its anchor, with half the passengers seasick and several of the crew having fallen overboard. There's constant trouble in the mate's mess, and the captain is navigating by the stars, having long ago lost his charts. 
 But, by gosh, it is forging along.
Hang onto your deck chairs, folks. This is the Clinton Administration. Its seamanship may leave something to be desired, but you may just get where you are going, and if you like the unexpected, you may even enjoy it.
Take last week, for instance. It began with the nomination Monday of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to replace the retiring Justice Byron R. White on the Supreme Court -- a choice hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike, but one which came after an 88-day search, in which the names, and reputations, of several candidates were raised and lowered by the White House as it lurched toward Judge Ginsburg.
After throwing a barbecue for the White House press corps on Sunday to kiss and make up after months of tension, President Clinton personally barbecued ABC News's Brit Hume a day later, when Mr. Hume asked Mr. Clinton about the "zigzag quality" of his search for a Supreme Court nominee. No matter. A day later, Mr. Clinton showed up in the pressroom and basically apologized to the newly married Mr. Hume, saying that the reason he got so mad at him was "because you got a honeymoon and I didn't." So with his on-again, off-again relationship with the press on again, Mr. Clinton swung his helm toward Capitol Hill.
Listening to the outcry there, with the Black Caucus up in arms against the President for giving away so many social-welfare programs, the House Democrats complaining that he had betrayed them in abandoning the B.T.U. tax and the Republicans claiming that he was simply making up his deficit-reduction numbers, it would have been easy to conclude that Mr. Clinton was sinking fast in Congress. But when you filtered out all the noise, it was clear that just the opposite was happening.
 
Lashing Down the Coalition
 A version of his $500 billion deficit-reduction plan was approved by the Senate Finance Committee. All 11 Democrats voted in favor of the compromise package of tax increases and spending cuts, which was opposed by all nine Republicans. The bill now goes to the Senate floor, but the real test looms later this summer, when Mr. Clinton, who has stayed neutral over the House and Senate versions of his own bill, tries to hold his fragile Democratic coalition together as lawmakers attempt to meld the Senate bill with the House one. The Senate bill relies on deeper cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security, and raises revenue with a gasoline tax, while the House version depends heavily on a tax on the heat content of all fuels, as measured in British thermal units, and trims entitlements only lightly.
In addition to the economic package, the Senate approved a version of Mr. Clinton's campaign-finance reform bill. He also won endorsement by congressional committees of his plan to offer college loans in return for community service.
This legislative agenda is driven, in part, by the substance of the proposals, but also by the winds of circumstance. President Bush argued, in effect, that the ship of state could ride at anchor in the harbor. President Clinton has argued that it must head into stormy seas, even if the captain doesn't always know what he is doing or precisely where he is going, because the bay is no longer safe. The unemployed, the underinsured, the undereducated, the crisis of competitiveness, the burden of debt make sitting idle impossible.
 
The Polls
 In other words, it is now becoming clear that Mr. Clinton's mandate for such change is an unusual one. It is based not on the magnitude of his electoral votes, but on the magnitude of the problems facing the nation. His base of political support at any given time is extremely small -- smaller now than any President's since polling began. But if the polls asked people not whether they thought Mr. Clinton was succeeding but whether they believed the nation can afford to let him to fail, his mandate for change might look enormous.
It is this latter sentiment that is really driving Mr. Clinton's legislation through Congress. It is a political regatta in which few people are willing to bet on the President, but most of the fans secretly want him to win, because if he doesn't, they lose. He, for his part, is succeeding in some of these huge tasks, despite losing some headway at times, because he has stayed well enough on course to take advantage of the anxiety-driven winds at his back.
The Washington press corps is naturally preoccupied with how Mr. Clinton steers, which is why his press notices gyrate wildly from week to week, but the public seems more focused on the general direction in which he's heading.
The Republicans are also in an awkward situation. Surely, many of them must think Mr. Clinton is going in the right direction -- the only direction available -- even if they don't approve of every turn. But they can't afford politically to give him credit for it. That is why they snipe at details of his program, but don't offer any alternatives. Said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell: "After a fog of rhetoric, after speech after speech after speech by our Republican colleagues about the need to cut spending, they had the right to offer any amendment they chose, and there was not one amendment to cut spending by a single dollar, not one."
When it comes to change, Mr. Clinton has not confined himself to domestic affairs. It became clearer last week how far he has tilted the balance between foreign and domestic policy in favor of the domestic. This too is driven by the public's sense that the nation is overextended and overburdened. Last week, the British news magazine The Economist dubbed Mr. Clinton "The Reluctant Sheriff." It is a moniker he seemed to earn when, during one of his news conferences, he was asked whether charges that he has been indecisive on Bosnia policy were fair.
He answered: "Let me tell you something about Bosnia. On Bosnia, I made a decision. The United Nations controls what is happening in Bosnia. I cannot unilaterally lift the arms embargo."
Technically, the President is right; he cannot lift a United Nations arms embargo himself. And diplomatically, not getting embroiled in Bosnia may indeed be the best policy. But there was, nevertheless, something jarring about hearing the leader of the free world complain that he could not adopt the policy he wanted on Bosnia because the United Nations and the allies would not let him. This is what gives the Clinton Administration foreign policy some of its unpredictable quality. For it is not at all clear any more where he will draw the line between initiatives of such fundamental interest to the nation that he will act unilaterally, and where he will take cover behind the veil of the United Nations.
On foreign policy, the public seems to want the ship of state to head back into port. The captain instinctively would like to remain at sea. But he is finding it very difficult to plot a consistent course without the old North Star -- the cold war with the Soviet Union -- to tell him where to go and to justify the cost of getting there.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AIDES SEE PROBLEM WITH VOW TO LIMIT WELFARE

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
Although President Clinton last week renewed his pledge to "end welfare as we know it," aides drafting his plan acknowledge that the effort could be expensive and might even force him to scale back action nationwide.
The centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's plan is his pledge to impose a two-year limit on welfare benefits. It was one of his most popular campaign themes and holds a special allure for the centrist and conservative legislators he is now courting, since it sounds like a tough-talking, economizing move. 
 But the architects of Mr. Clinton's plan have something very different in mind, a program with costly new services. To justify time limits, the working group wants to expand programs that provide child care, health care and job training, and that may even offer some welfare recipients Government jobs.
 
No Way of Saving Money
 Though the planners hope to enhance the lives of the five million families that receive welfare, they recognize something that much of the public does not: it is cheaper in the short run just to keep mailing public assistance checks.
"There is a fundamental dilemma, but this has not been sold as a way of balancing the Federal budget," said David T. Ellwood, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is serving as co-chairman of the working group. "Nobody's talking about this as a way of saving money. We're talking about spending money."
Mr. Ellwood stressed that he remained very encouraged "about fundamental transformations of the system."
But the price tag of a bold plan may take many people by surprise.
"I fear that time limits mean very different things to people in the Administration and to their audience, the public at large," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, through which the legislation must pass.
Mr. Ellwood introduced the idea of time limits in his book, "Poor Support" (Basic Books, 1988), written while he was a professor at Harvard University. He then advocated time limits as part of a broad expansion of services, including health care and the creation of some Government jobs. His book estimated that this could cost an additional $30 billion a year.
 
Changes in Phases
 No one is now contemplating such sums. In a December policy paper, Mr. Ellwood called for imposing time limits in only a modest number of states, saying a gradual phase-in made more sense given the budget deficit and the need for states to adjust.
Mr. Ellwood wrote that a phase-in plan is consistent with the President's call for bold action.
Combined state and Federal spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main cash welfare program, costs about $20 billion a year. Working group members say no formal budgetary guidelines have been set, but during the campaign Mr. Clinton talked of spending an extra $4 billion a year on training programs and $2 billion on tax credits for low-wage workers.
He has already exceeded those sums by separately putting forward a tax credit plan that, when fully in place, would cost an extra $7.6 billion a year.
An expensive welfare plan would require Mr. Clinton to return to a tax-spooked Congress for money for a politically unpopular constituency.
"It has the makings of a massive misunderstanding and recrimination when it all comes out," said one Democratic member of Congress.
In the broadest sense, the outlines of Mr. Clinton's plan are clear. He has pledged to put more money into the education and training programs that each state now runs under the 1988 Family Support Act.
He has pledged to increase the collection of child support from absent parents. And he has promised to give single mothers the child care and transportation they need to work.
But the core of Mr. Clinton's promise is to insist on a welfare limit of two years, and the main, unanswered question can be summarized with two words, "Then what?" Mr. Clinton has pledged to make people then take a job, but he has not specified what he means by that.
Members of the working group have estimated that roughly three million of the nation's five million welfare families are likely to remain on the rolls when the two-year time limit ends.
Work and training programs now exempt half of welfare recipients because their children are too young. If that remains the case, the planners still face the question of what to do with 1.5 million of the nation's poorest least-skilled, least-employable families.
Proposals in Florida and Wisconsin seek simply to withdraw benefits after two years, leaving families to fend for themselves. But the Clinton planners have no intention of just dropping aid.
Carol Rasco, the White House domestic policy adviser, said that whatever occurs at the end of two years should be a meaningful experience and "a piece on a career ladder."
"I feel very strongly about that," she said.
 
Skeptical About Deadlines
 Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has also expressed doubts about time limits. "I'm not a believer in artificial deadlines of that nature," he said in an interview last week, saying that many people would be unable to leave the rolls that quickly. Mr. Cisneros said he was expressing a personal opinion, rather than Administration policy.
One possibility being considered by the working group is to withdraw cash aid after two years, and substitute the offer of a public service job.
This would insure that former welfare recipients have a source income that pays better than welfare and would provide the public with needed services.
But it could also be prohibitively expensive. Creating 1.5 million public service jobs could cost $20 billion. Mr. Ellwood said the task force might recommend some number of public service jobs.
That leaves another option: a requirement that, after two years, welfare recipients take part in workfare in exchange for continuing to receive their welfare checks. Since the average cash welfare grant is only about $370 a month, this is much cheaper than creating jobs.
But the planners have estimated that even workfare plans can cost as much as an extra $3,500 a year for each families including child care and administrative fees. That means a program for 1.5 million families would have an annual cost of $5.3 billion.
In the December paper, Mr. Ellwood warned that a large workfare program would be a mistake since it would do little to help welfare recipients or reduce caseloads. Research has show such programs have done little to move people into private employment.
In a recent interview, Mr. Ellwood said that the Clinton plan would probably include some workfare, but he would not speculate on how many people might be covered.
The working group is also headed by Bruce Reed, a White House domestic policy adviser, and Mary Jo Bane, who is a nominee to become an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Citing President Clinton's call for time limits, about 40 House Republicans have endorsed a bill that requires welfare recipients to work 35 hours a week after two years, in exchange for their benefits.
"It doesn't bring them extra income, but we get them in a culture that is a much more positive one," said Representative Richard J. Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican a co-sponsor of the bill, which would spend $3.6 billion over five years.
But a pivotal Democratic legislator has already dismissed such a large workfare program out of hand.
"I will not even take that up in the committee," said Representative Harold Ford of Tennessee, who heads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources, which oversees all welfare legislation. "We're not talking about workfare."
Mr. Ford said he is drafting his own public employment program, which could cost $10 billion a year. Time limits would be unacceptable without such support, he said.
The effort to pass a welfare reform bill will grow even more difficult if the Administration does not first pass its health-care plan, which could easily cost more than $40 billion a year.
Many women now remain on welfare in order to get Medicaid for themselves and their children. Mr. Clinton has pledged to provide health care to women who leave welfare for work.

HEADLINE: Abandoned Filipinos Sue U.S. Over Child Support

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLONGAPO, the Philippines

 BODY:
Next to her son James, what Lucia Villegas Hill prizes most may be a handful of documents identifying his father as an American sailor at the United States Navy base that shut down here last year.
"He's so far away now," she said, handing over a crinkled 1975 marriage certificate and a faded photograph of a man whose features bear some resemblance to her son's. It has been years since Mrs. Hill's husband wrote or sent money, and she clings to a scrap of yellow paper with his last known address and phone number, in Port Orchard, Wash. 
 For centuries, women in diverse lands and cultures have been left to raise children alone after being abandoned by foreign soldiers.
But Mrs. Hill and thousands of others in this town next to the former Subic Bay Naval Station have taken a novel approach. Instead of pressing individual paternity or child-support suits, they have filed a $68 million lawsuit arguing that the United States has a legal responsibility to educate and provide medical care for an estimated 8,600 Amerasians in Olongapo.
The suit, filed as a class action in March in the Federal Court of Claims in Washington, argues that the Navy effectively fostered and regulated an elaborate night-life and prostitution industry, live-in arrangements and marriages here in which servicemen fathered thousands of children.
 
Sporadic Support Payments
 Mrs. Hill, for example, says she met her husband, also named James, in the Shamrock Club, a popular night spot.
"I'm very sad because of what happened," she said. "But I still have hope, and No. 1 is for my boy to meet his father."
Many mothers subsisted for a time on sporadic payments from the fathers, pressuring Navy officials when payments lagged. But the financial support began drying up in 1991, when the Philippine Senate barred the renewal of United States leases on the sprawling naval base and other installations in the Philippines. The United States had already decided that year to abandon Clark Air Base, its other major military site in the country, after it was damaged by a volcanic eruption.
When most American ships and planes finally left last year, the decades-long party was over at the Pussy Cat Bar, the Joy Club and hundreds of other hostess clubs, discotheques, brothels, massage parlors and short-stay hotels with neon signs just outside the gates of the Subic base.
Like tens of thousands of Filipinos who had worked at Subic or Clark in maintenance, food-service or similar jobs, mothers who had supported their children by working in the clubs suddenly found themselves unemployed.
 
Suit Has Stirred Skepticism
 "Nothing is being done to relieve the human damage which was done to those who were left behind, namely the thousands of forgotten children of American servicemen," the lawsuit contends. It was filed in cooperation with the local women's groups Preda, Buklod, Gabriela and Wedpro.
The lawyer representing the women and children is Joseph W. Cotchett, a former Green Beret from Burlingame, Calif., who won an $8 billion judgment last year against Charles W. Keating Jr. and three co-defendants on behalf of 20,000 savings and loan investors.
Although the Navy has declined to comment, the suit has stirred skepticism among United States military officials and some former G.I.'s, who argue that American taxpayers are not responsible for foreigners conceived by consenting adults.
Critics also argue that the children may have been fathered by foreigners who were not Americans, and that some women tried to get pregnant in the hope of marrying or moving to the United States.
 
Hurt, Anger and Yearning
 But talk of the missing American "tatays" -- Filipino for fathers -- stirs hurt, anger and yearning among women and children who meet regularly here at the Human Development Center, perched on a hill with panoramic views overlooking the old 14,400-acre base at Subic and the deep blue bay.
"I want to get to know him, and even though he left us here, I can remind him of his responsibility to help my studies," James Hill, 16, said of his father.
Nida Havier, 35, said she had lived with a Navy man for three years before he departed. It "was very painful, it hurt me very much," she said. Their son, Anthony, now 7, asks where his father is and says he wants to see him.
Mercedes Gervacio, who has four Amerasian children, teaches other mothers how to sell candy on the street to earn $3 or $4 a day. She said one boyfriend talked of marriage, "but it was just a promise."
The center where they shared their stories is run by an Irish priest, the Rev. Shay Cullen, who describes the young Amerasians as "throwaway children."
Children of interracial unions have been common in the Philippines since Magellan and his fleet arrived in the early 16th century.
But the departure of the American troops and the emergence of child support as a national issue in the United States have focused attention on the issue now. There is growing pressure in the United States to prevent absentee fathers from evading their obligations by crossing state lines.
"It is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring into this world," President Clinton said in an address to Congress in February. The lawsuit quotes Mr. Clinton and argues that the issue crosses international boundaries.
 
Government Has More Money
 The suit was filed against the United States Government mainly because the Filipino women and children cannot afford the legal costs involved in tracking down fathers or proving paternity. The average income in the Philippines is $740 a year.
Another reason the United States was chosen as the defendant, largely unmentioned, is that it has more money than the fathers do.
Papers filed in the case focus on establishing the Navy's direct role in the local bar and sex industry. The suit contends that the Navy helped regulate the clubs, some of which were owned by Navy officers or retirees; patrolled Olongapo with military police, and registered thousands of "hospitality" women and gave them information and medical care aimed at limiting venereal disease.
The Navy also approved off-base apartments where many sailors lived with girlfriends or wives.
Advocates of the class-action suit see a disparity in United States laws that exclude Filipino children from the special immigration rights granted to many other Amerasians.
 
Others Can Immigrate
 Just over a hill south of the Subic base, the United Nations runs a camp for Vietnamese refugees that still processes a trickle of Amerasians -- now adults -- who were conceived during the Vietnam War. Under United States law, they are entitled to immigrate under the sponsorship of any American. That coveted right also extends to children of American servicemen who were stationed in South Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.
But the children born to G.I.'s in the Philippines do not qualify for preferential status. The rationale is that Amerasians suffered from anti-American hostility and racial bias in the other countries but not here.
Critics say that assumption is faulty. While many Filipinos have mixed Chinese, Malay and Spanish ancestry, there is bias against people of darker skin. When the American parent is black, the child is often ostracized and taunted with racial epithets. Amerasian children are also often stigmatized as illegitimate.
Local views of the class-action lawsuit vary. The town's Mayor, Richard Gordon, himself the grandson of an American, called the suit simplistic. "It demeans us to ask for money," he said.
Mr. Gordon favors revising United States immigration laws to include the children fathered here by G.I.'s, and some lawmakers, including Senator Daniel K. Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat, have expressed interest in the issue.
But Father Cullen opposes uprooting children from their culture. "Are we saying the Philippines is not good enough for them?" he said.
The Pearl Buck Foundation, which contributes to education and health care for Amerasians and helps some apply to immigrate, says its biggest program is in the Philippines.
The head of the Philippine program, William S. McCabe 2d, dismisses estimates of children fathered by American servicemen as guesses. He said that many claims are legitimate but that fraud is common. "There's a game here called 'Get Out of the Country,' " he said.
President Fidel V. Ramos has called the future of the Amerasians the most important issue remaining from the American military evacuation, "the joint responsibility of both countries." But neither side has made a proposal to address the needs of the fatherless children.

HEADLINE: Tax Increases Considered By Republicans, Dole Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
Planning to offer an alternative to President Clinton's budget package when it comes before the Senate on Wednesday, Republican senators are considering a proposal that would include some tax increases, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said today.
Mr. Dole suggested that he might support a package with some tax increases and sizable spending cuts as part of a broad effort to reduce the Federal budget deficit. But he hastily added that he was only "speaking for myself," not as the party's leading elected spokesman. 
 The statement is nonetheless a departure for the Republicans, many of whom forswore new taxes when Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, and have campaigned on anti-tax themes ever since.
In an interview on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Dole maintained that Mr. Clinton's proposed budget was "tax heavy" and short on spending cuts. The White House says its proposal would reduce the deficit by $500 billion, partly through $249 billion in tax increases over five years.
 
Debating 2 Alternatives
 Citing figures produced by the Congressional Budget Office, the Kansas Senator said Mr. Clinton's proposal would cut the deficit by $346.7 billion and raise taxes by $265 billion, not $249 billion.
"It's about three-fourths taxes and very little spending cuts, and I think that's not going to be good for the economy," Mr. Dole said. "A lot of these people, the so-called rich people who are going to be taxed, are what we call small businessmen."
Having made that point, he allowed that he could accept some taxes to reduce the deficit and said Senate Republicans were debating whether they should offer a proposed budget with taxes or one without as an alternative to Mr. Clinton's package.
"I think we could accept some revenues if we had a lot of spending cuts," he said.
Among the taxes Mr. Dole said he could support was an increase in the personal income tax from the current 31 percent maximum.
Mr. Clinton proposes raising the top rate to 36 percent for most upper-income taxpayers, but surtaxes would increase the maximum to more than 40 percent, by some calculations.
"I think people could live with" a top rate of 36 percent, Mr. Dole said, referring to members of his party.
Mr. Dole also said he might favor a surtax on households with taxable incomes of more than $250,000 a year.
Only last week, several Republican Senators complained bitterly about the unfairness of that same surtax in the Clinton package.
Mr. Dole gave few details of the Republican budget alternative but said it would include a freeze on spending for so-called discretionary programs, for which Congress sets budgets each year. He also said the plan would place a cap on the growth of Federal benefit programs.
The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, speaking on the same CBS News program, acknowledged that Mr. Dole was right on at least one point. "It is a tax bill, huge tax bill," he said of Mr. Clinton's budget plan. "It can be argued, also, that it is the most progressive change in the tax code we've seen since World War II in terms of who pays what."

HEADLINE: Sniping Is Growing At The U.N. Over Weakness In Peacekeeping

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 18

 BODY:
The fighting between United Nations forces and a warlord in Somalia and the failure of international troops to be an effective buffer in Bosnia are forcing many to rethink the organization's vastly expanded role as a global peacekeeper.
Diplomats here have publicly complained of amateurism in the peacekeeping operations, with the United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, asserting recently that "ill-equipped and often unprepared troops" are often sent into the field. 
 Officials in the United Nations Secretariat grumble that member nations are piling on tasks without providing adequate forces or money to do the jobs.
Such recriminations by no means spell disaster for United Nations peacekeeping efforts, which have been revitalized over the last few years and credited for successes like the disarmament of rebels in El Salvador and the elections in Cambodia last month.
 
From Optimism to Realism
 Yet the view of global police work has shifted, from a mood of buoyant optimism at the United Nations just a few months ago to what some are calling a new realism about the difficulties.
"There's no question that for a while we hoped that simply by deploying forces a solution would magically emerge," a European diplomat said. "But it doesn't work that way."
Ms. Albright endorsed the concept of "multilateral action" in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations on June 11, saying, But she harshly criticized the way United Nations peacekeeping efforts were organized, saying many of the 13 operations mounted in the last five years had been hampered by a "near-total absence of contingency planning," hasty recruitment and a "byzantine and drawn-out budgetary decision making process."
 
A New Cooperation
 The criticism is a change for an organization that only a year or so ago was basking in its growing responsibilities.
For decades the Security Council had been paralyzed by cold-war competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, both of which had veto power in the Council's decisions. But the collapse of Communism and the fading of the superpowers' arms race opened the way for new cooperation, leading to internationally brokered accords in Cambodia and Angola.
Some analysts worry that the organization's involvement in so many conflicts could land it in quagmires reminiscent of the United States experience in Vietnam.
"The possibilities for going wrong are numerous and the costs potentially open-ended," Laurence Martin, the director of the Institute of International Affairs in London, writes in the latest issue of The National Interest, a quarterly journal.
 
'An Endless Agenda'
 He was speaking particularly of the Security Council's willingness to send peacekeepers into countries riven by domestic conflicts that the United Nations had previously tended to avoid, like the ethnic fighting in Bosnia or the anarchy in Somalia.
To try to protect national minorities and to build governments where there are none is "to accept an endless agenda and to assume the task of state and community-building on a vast scale," he said.
Of the last nine peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security Council, seven have involved internal wars. Most of the previous missions were aimed at preventing further conflict between two countries, like monitoring the border between Iraq and Kuwait.
As its missions expand, the troops under United Nations command have expanded from just 11,500 at the beginning of 1992 to roughly 80,000 now, according to the United Nations Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping, Kofi Annan of Ghana. That number is expected to grow to nearly 100,000 once forces have been recruited to protect the six Bosnian "safe areas" designated this month by the Security Council.
 
Donors Slow to Pay
 But officials at the United Nations say it has become increasingly difficult to persuade countries to contribute modern specialized forces.
In another obstacle, the main donor nations are behind by $1.2 billion in their peacekeeping payments, with the United States alone owing $312 million. United States officials, using different accounting procedures, say the figure owed is more like $40 million, but the Clinton Administration has vowed to pay the full United States assessment.
"With the United Nations engaged in so many operations around the world, the impression has been created that it is doing exactly what it was set up to do, but it is all very fragile," Mr. Annan said in an interview.
Complicating the task is what Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with a touch of irony, has called the "excessive credibility" that the organization has gained.
"There is a naivete that believes the United Nations is capable of just walking in and solving all problems," one official here said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And then, at the other end of the spectrum, there is cynicism, a tendency of countries to dump responsibility on the United Nations simply to show their publics that they are doing something."
 
Little Decisive Action
 The most frequently cited example is Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Western nations have refrained from direct military intervention to halt "ethnic cleansing" by Serbian nationalists. The United States and other countries have solemnly approved one resolution after another imposing economic sanctions and declaring safe havens, but little decisive action has been taken.
"It's not fair to accuse the United States of cynical manipulation of the Security Council," one American official said. "It's unrealistic to expect that a bureaucracy created 45 years ago and moribund for so long would suddenly be able to act decisively around the globe. We're doing all we can by committing forces in some places, air power in others, money in others."
Some analysts say that peacekeeping missions of recent years have been of two kinds, one far more difficult than the other. The easier ones were what Enid Schoettle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, calls "mopping up old regional conflicts at the end of the cold war" -- specifically, she says, in Namibia, Angola, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cambodia.
"The great powers and the parties to the conflicts decided to end these wars and then involved the United Nations," she said.
At the same time, Dr. Schoettle said, a genuinely multinational force was mobilized with the permission of the United Nations to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait, and with that, "there was a rising curve of expectation."
 
'The Only Policeman'
 A year ago, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali issued an "Agenda for Peace," in which he proclaimed that "a conviction has grown among nations large and small that an opportunity has been regained to achieve the great objectives of the Charter -- a United Nations capable of maintaining international peace and security."
Mr. Boutros-Ghali was in a sense recognizing that for the first time since the 1950's, the major powers were more eager in some cases to use the United Nations than to act unilaterally. "Willingly or not, the United Nations has become the only policeman in the world," an official here said.
Still, Dr. Schoettle said, at just about the time that Mr. Boutros-Ghali presented his "Agenda for Peace," "the disillusion started to set in."
In part that was because the United Nations was increasingly faced with conflicts in which the major cold-war powers had never played a role -- internal wars involving collapsing governments, in Somalia, for example, or ethnic hatred, in former Yugoslav republics.
 
Lessons for the Future
 One miscalculation has been recognized in Angola, where the United Nations was able to oversee elections last year but then was unable to react when rebels led by Jonas Savimbi resumed fighting.
It is widely acknowledged here that the 298-member peacekeeping force in Angola was hampered by its size. If the United Nations had deployed a larger force with a mandate to disarm the factions, those officials say, it might have been successful in preventing Mr. Savimbi's rebels from renewing their attacks.
The lessons learned there are now in a sense being applied in Somalia, where United Nations forces have attacked the arms depots of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid.
"We've had our down sides," one United States official said. "It doesn't mean that peacekeeping has failed. It can work if it's done the right way."

HEADLINE: Hispanic Santa Fe Loses Itself as It Lures Rich

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., June 18

 BODY:
Charmed by stunning mountain vistas and the romance of ancient cultures, tourists have been coming to Santa Fe since before Georgia O'Keefe captured the mystical New Mexico skies in her paintings in the 1920's.
But now many tourists to Santa Fe are deciding they do not want to go back home. Instead, these affluent newcomers have been buying old adobe houses and building sprawling haciendas in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo mountains. But the Hispanic culture they came to embrace has shrunk before the soaring property values and taxes they bring with them. 
 In the last census, people with Spanish surnames became a minority in this city for the first time since the 1600's, when the Conquistadors arrived here and built Santa Fe on the ruins of a Pueblo Indian village. And those who struggle to remain say they cannot afford the rising taxes that come with the influx of wealthy "Anglos."
In some neighborhoods, where fancy new homes sit down the road from modest adobes, and German cars cross paths with bumpy pickups, there have been tensions about the changes. The longtime residents say they fear the day when Santa Fe becomes another Aspen, Colo., where only the rich can afford to stay and workers are shuttled in from distant towns to make beds and wait tables.
 
Congestion of Tourists
 "The newcomers wanted to live in Santa Fe, and who can blame them," said Nora Chavez, a retired woman who saw the property taxes on her adobe house rise 143 percent last year. "But they're spoiling what they came here for."
Downtown Santa Fe, until the last decade a thriving marketplace of shops for working people, now caters almost exclusively to tourists. Big Joe's Lumberyard has become the Eldorado Hotel. The J. C. Penney store was cleared to make way for art galleries. The Sears, Roebuck store moved to a shopping mall on the edge of the city and was replaced with expensive boutiques.
Traffic around the green plaza, where a stone marks the end of the Santa Fe Trail, moves at the clip of a desert tortoise, with tour buses and out-of-state cars parading in a long line. Local officials say tourism now accounts for 50 percent of the local economy, outweighing the former leader, state government.
"There are native Santa Fe people who haven't been downtown for five or six years," said Orlando Romero, a researcher at the Palace of the Governors, the former seat of government built by the Spaniards in 1610. "There's nothing for them here anymore. Try to find a drug store -- you can't."
 
'These Are Conquerors'
 Debbie Jaramillo, a member of the City Council, said the change in Santa Fe amounted to an invasion.
"These are conquerors who did not need arms to take over the town," she said. "They have come instead with their big money and their higher education."
As the Santa Fe style of art, architecture and decor became popular in the 1980's, scores of celebrities moved to town, including recent arrivals like the actresses Shirley MacLaine and Carol Burnett. The city's population grew by 14 percent, to about 56,000. But virtually all of the growth has been among affluent whites. Since 1970, the number of Hispanic residents in Santa Fe has fallen from 65 percent to 49 percent. Indians account for only about 2 percent of the population, since most live in pueblos north of the city.
In some neighborhoods, property values have quadrupled in the last decade. While wealthy whites have moved into the old adobe houses in the foothills, Hispanic people have been settling in trailer parks on the outskirts of town, near the state penitentiary, or moving to towns like Las Vegas, N.M., an hour away.
"The whole thing makes me very sad," said Viola Lujan, a Santa Fe native who moved to a trailer 20 miles outside of town. "When I was a kid, I could walk to my grandparents' house. Families all lived close by. The way things are going, there won't be any room for the native people."
Jesse Wheeler's ancestors have lived in a modest adobe house for 100 years. Now it sits down the road from huge new houses covered with adobe-like stucco. He said that the neighborhood was once like a family, but that when he pulled into a newcomer's driveway recently to turn around, "this woman comes out shouting, 'Hey this is private property!' "
Even the Indian pueblos north of Santa Fe have been transformed by the influx of whites. In some pueblos where property can be leased, whites now outnumber Indians.
The rising land prices have also pinched owners of local art galleries. Ron and Arlene Siegel, who own a gallery downtown, now pay $2,300 a month in rent and utilities. "It's running the small businessman out of town," Mr. Siegel said.
City officials say the problem is not growth but a shortage of affordable housing. In the first quarter of 1993, the average sale price of a house in Santa Fe was $201,000, far beyond the reach of most longtime residents who typically earn $20,000 a year or less.
The city recently bought an 850-acre tract that has been reserved for affordable housing. The first of 900 units, many selling for less than $100,000, will be constructed next year. The city also imposes a tax on developers of new subdivisions that will be used to help first-time home buyers.
Adobe houses, often built by the residents, or their ancestors, have become especially coveted. "A prospective buyer comes in and offers a lot of cold cash," said Ike Pino, the city manager. "Sometimes, the enticement is too much to pass up. But these people are selling of their own free will. And some of them are picking up $250,000, even $500,000."
Not all of the longtime residents have been unhappy about the influx of wealthy newcomers. "It means a paycheck," said Frank Ortiz, a 56-year-old plasterer, who said the steady work has helped him support his family, including two deaf children who need expensive education.
As she rode through a neighborhood where expensive houses are being built alongside modest adobe ones, Gloria Mendoza said: "They say they want to come here because they love our culture.But they certainly don't live like us. They want to change it into whatever they're used to."
The buyers have lately been knocking at the front door of Jesus Rios, a 93-year-old former woodcutter who built his adobe house in 1938. He has answered with a shake of the head.
"This is my home," he said, as he sat at the kitchen table, while his wife, Theresa, cooked squash. "They could offer me $20 million -- we're not selling."

HEADLINE: A Tokyo Pol, Once Out, Is Back Leading a Revolt

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 20

 BODY:
Six months ago, Ichiro Ozawa's political fortunes had ebbed so low that when accused of seeking intervention by organized crime in a prime ministerial race, he was reduced to defending himself by saying he had been at a key meeting where the plan was discussed, but only to serve drinks and empty ashtrays.
A political cartoon subsequently depicted him as a waiter in a bar fetching drinks for a gangster, who said to a friend, "Did you see who that was?" 
 No one is making such jokes now. The politician many thought of as finished has just pulled off perhaps the most dramatic coup in postwar Japanese politics.
Mr. Ozawa has been conspicuously absent from the Japanese press coverage of the vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on Friday. But few political experts doubt that he was in the shadows engineering the defeat of his former colleagues in the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and that he just may have ended the 38-year-old reign of the party to which he once devoted his career.
 
Election Set for July 18
 Whether he and the nominal head of his breakaway faction, former Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata, will succeed in heading a coalition Government to replace the Liberal Democrats after the elections to be held on July 18 remains to be seen. But for the moment their ideas have suddenly taken on a new influence, and could have a large impact on other parties.
That could be very good news for the United States. Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata are, in a Japanese context, internationalists serious about instituting broad-based changes in the century-old system that has made Japanese bureaucrats more important than politicians in setting Government policies. Washington has long called for some of the same changes.
The most striking aspect of Mr. Ozawa's comeback may be that his rebel faction succeeded in part by depicting itself as the champion of reform of the corrupt ways and inflexibility of Japanese politics.
Since Mr. Ozawa, 51, rose as the protege of Shin Kanemaru, a former party kingmaker whose trial on tax evasion charges will begin four days after the election next month, his claims have understandably met some skepticism. It has not helped either that Mr. Hata, 56, is still remembered as the politician who, as Agriculture Minister several years ago, argued that Japan could not open its markets to American beef because it was not suited to unique Japanese intestines.
 
Sons of the Party
 They are both the sons of loyal governing party members of Parliament, and they were both high-fliers in the powerful party faction run by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, the man whom gangsters had helped to power in 1987, before he was toppled in an influence-peddling scandal. That will not be forgotten quickly.
"After all, who were they just a few months ago?" Mainichi Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper, said in an editorial. "Nothing but loyal henchmen and hatchet men working for Shin Kanemaru and Noboru Takeshita."
But by the standards of Japanese politics, they are now angry young men with a forward-looking policy agenda who have seized a measure of power few would have expected even a month ago. Last year, they lost a struggle for control of Mr. Takeshita's old party faction. But the 34 votes they delivered on Friday in favor of the motion of no confidence tipped the balance in favor of the opposition parties, threatening four decades of political stability.
"In order to make something new, we have to destroy the old system," Mr. Ozawa said in an interview several months ago.
 
Accountability Stressed
 He and Mr. Hata say they want politicians accountable to the electorate to set Japan's course. Some conservatives regard that as an open invitation to more corruption, but the two men describe it as a step toward greater democracy.
Their proposals for steps toward deregulation of the economy and for the return of some of the benefits of Japan's economic success to consumers, in the form of freer competition and less expensive goods, are precisely what American trade negotiators have been advocating.
Mr. Ozawa has a track record of producing agreements favorable to the United States, though he says he took those steps only when he felt they were ultimately good for the Japanese.
He was instrumental, for instance, in persuading the Government to contribute $13 billion to support the coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. He has helped to open various construction projects and Government procurement to foreign bidders. He pushed to have Japanese minesweepers sent to the Persian Gulf, and he was a strong supporter of a law permitting Japanese soldiers to take part in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
 
The Style Is Familiar
 However new their ideas, though, the style of these two politicians bears a great resemblance to that of the party they are now fighting. Often the Prime Minister in Japan has not been the most powerful politician among the Liberal Democrats. In this case, Mr. Hata, who is regarded as a likable man with a common touch because of the 10 years he spent working for a bus company, is the public face of the new faction.
Mr. Ozawa is regarded as brusque and impatient. He is more comfortable operating in the back rooms of Nagatacho, the Tokyo district where Parliament is situated. He is often pictured as a heavy-lidded, brooding presence who, though quite intelligent, often meets resistance with brute force rather than reason. He earned the enmity of some big corporations three years ago when he aggressively sought contributions for an election campaign, reportedly threatening to raise some taxes if the companies were not generous.
Mr. Ozawa had a heart attack two years ago that set back his ambitions to become prime minister, and some say he may always remain the power behind the throne.
There are some who say that while the two may have new policies to put forward, the maneuvering for the no-confidence vote reflected nothing more than brutal power politics.
 
'Power Struggle' Seen
 "This split was not over policy," said Yukio Okamoto, a former senior official in the Foreign Ministry and now head of Okamoto Associates, a business consulting company. "This was a power struggle."
"Don't get me wrong," Mr. Okamoto added. "Ozawa is a first-rate policy strategist, but this was a matter of the mechanics of power, not ideology."
Mr. Ozawa has made it clear that he is comfortable with both brinkmanship and statesmanship, that the rough and tumble of policy debates is something he wants to introduce to Japan. The reform he so strongly advocates means many different things.
"Electoral reform is simply a method to wake up a politics that has been asleep for 50 years," he said. "My aim is to make real party politics, real parliamentary politics."

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Rain Forest Falls to Relentless Exploiters

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARMEN DEL APERECITO, Bolivia

 BODY:
Almost daily here in Bolivia's dense Amazon jungle, above the sound of the rushing river, the squawking of macaws and the scolding of monkeys, the Mojeno Indians hear the buzz of chain saws slicing through six-foot-thick mahogany trees. Heavy machinery growls as it cuts 15-foot-wide paths through the forest and drags the majestic logs to collection sites where trucks take them to sawmills.
"We see the trails of the cutters all the time, almost wherever we go in the forest," said Esekiel Justiniano. He estimated that as many as 40 chain-saw gangs were cutting mahogany on the land given his tribe and three others by the Bolivian Government last year. The loggers are licensed to cut mahogany trees, but not on the Indians' territory. 
 "They come in, mark the trees, cut them down and then the companies bring in the skidders that make tracks throughout the forest," he said.
Much attention has been given to the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest, the ecological damage there and its social effects on indigenous groups. But that has overshadowed the lesser-known and little-studied cutting down of vast tracts of jungle in other Latin American countries, like Bolivia, where scientists say the rate of deforestation is nearly as alarming as in Brazil.
Indian leaders here say that over the last two years loggers have felled more than 3,000 trees, perhaps as many as 4,000, on land that belongs to the area's indigenous groups. If fair market value had been paid, they say, it would have meant more than $6 million of income for the roughly 7,000 Mojenos, Movimas, Chimanes and Yuracare who remain here.
But under pressure from Government officials working with big logging interests, the tribal leaders have agreed to compensation of only $200,000.
"They are taking the most valuable thing in our forest," Nicolas Guaji said. "They promise us to build schools and bring motors for our canoes in return, but they give us nothing."
In this primitive village, some two days' travel by dugout canoe along rivers and streams from the nearest road, many Mojenos still believe in an old legend.
Their 19th-century prophet, Noko Guahi, told of the Holy Hill, where the outside world would not intrude and where monkeys, wild boar, deer and the forest fruits would be abundant, supplying all their needs.
 
Weary of the Fight, Some Urge a Retreat
 Today, many of the 130 members of the village want to abandon their bamboo huts, the open-air chapel and the green soccer field and push deeper into the jungle in search of the Holy Hill, or Loma Santa. They say they are tired of fighting the carrallanos, or white men, over the the huge mahogany trees, trees they have used for generations to make dugout canoes, rudimentary wheels for oxcarts and large bins for grinding grain.
The plight of the Mojenos and Bolivia's Amazon jungle, called the Beni, is not an isolated problem. Other countries that hold the Amazon's headwaters -- Peru, Colombia and Venezuela -- have also suffered from deforestation and other environmental pressures.
Along many of the small and medium river systems that eventually flow into the vast Amazon, the people, the forest, the water and the wildlife are under increasing strain.
In Peru and Bolivia, growers of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine, are clear-cutting thousands of acres a year, planting coca plants in a way intended to strip the soil of nutrients through water erosion, since coca grows best in highly acidic soil.
Jungle laboratories where cocaine is made dump millions of gallons of acids, acetone, kerosene and other hazardous chemicals into the rivers each year.
In southern Peru, migrants panning for gold have stripped entire river systems of vegetation and sent untold amounts of silt downstream. Hundreds of tons of toxic mercury, used to extract bits of gold from the sand, are dumped into the waters.
But perhaps the most destructive element in Colombian, Venezuelan and Bolivian forests are the agribusinesses and armies of colonizers who clear-cut large jungle tracts every year in a rush to plant crops in the tropical soil. Within a few seasons, the soil, which is weak in nutrients, is often so depleted that the farmers are forced to move on to another tract.
 
500,000 Forest Acres Lost Every Year
 To be sure, the destruction here and in other countries is not yet on the scale seen in some parts of Brazil. This is mainly because the populations of these Amazon basin countries are dwarfed by that of Brazil. Moreover, the forests in the basin are far from major shipping points, making the building of huge plywood and pulp mills, which consume all kinds of jungle timber, unprofitable.
But the rates of deforestation are still striking and Bolivia, according to some calculations, is among the most exploited countries. Researchers for the Inter-American Development Bank have estimated that more than 11 percent of its forests have been either wiped out or damaged by logging and agribusinesses, compared with 5 percent in Brazil.
Forestry experts say that up to 500,000 acres of native forest are being cleared every year in Bolivia. For its size, that is only slightly below the rate of deforestation in Brazil.
Around Santa Cruz, the country's southern boom town, which is thriving on agricultural exports, giant tractors working in tandem drag huge chain links along the forest floor, pulling down swaths of tropical growth. The bulldozers then pass by again, pile the trees and other vegetation into endless rows and set them on fire. The cost is negligible for developers, who are able to buy land at less than 25 cents an acre.
"You drive the distant roads and suddenly find an area of two and five kilometers completely cleared from one week to another," said Christopher R. Carden, an agronomist in Santa Cruz. "We are at the headwaters of the Amazon and are destroying it."
Groups of Mennonites who have migrated here have established farms that look like the countryside of Pennsylvania or Ohio, with soybeans and other crops growing in meticulously kept fields for miles.
In a recent report, Mr. Carden wrote: "Much of the new damage is being done by Mennonite communities who are already responsible for large-scale forest clearance and soil destruction in Santa Cruz. Most of them, when interviewed, show little understanding of or concern for the environment."
Agronomists warn that in Bolivia winds and heavy rains quickly deplete the acidic soils, forcing communities like the Mennonites to abandon their lands and look for others every few years.
 
If Rules Are Set, They Are Ignored
 In the Beni, loggers, Indians, nongovernmental organizations and agronomists make one point abundantly clear: there is almost no governmental control over the exploitation of the rain forest.
In January 1990, the Bolivian Government called for a "historic ecological pause," a period in which it would not grant further logging concessions or permit vast expansion of agriculture. But businesses disregard the prohibition almost entirely. They log in areas they do not have title to and at rates far above levels set by the Government.
"All the commercially usable mahogany is going to be gone in Bolivia in five years," said Richard Rice, director of economic policy at Conservation International, an environmental group based in Washington. "In 1989 they started logging mahogany in earnest, and they are cutting at a rate that will run through the country's supply in 10 years time. What we're looking at is timber mining. They are not driving mahogany to physical extinction, but to commercial extinction."
Agronomists note that Bolivia has given logging concessions for more than half of its forests.
Much of the pressure to cut the forest comes from the almost limitless demand for the wood in the United States. Furniture companies there will buy almost as much as Bolivian logging companies can produce.
Environmentalists have tried to persuade American importers of mahogany to require the logging companies to certify that they are not violating Government laws or overexploiting the forests. But the efforts have so far failed.
Wilson Himjosa is assistant manager of the Hervel sawmill, which sits on the edge of the Indian territory. Fifteen-foot-high mountains of scrap mahogany, discarded to rot, testify to the once relentless pace of cutting in the forest. He said that this year the company had cut only one-quarter of the mahogany it cut last year.
"The wood is almost gone," Mr. Himjosa said while giving a tour of the sawmill, which was not operating for lack of lumber to cut. "We've sent all our teams back into areas of the forest we cut two years ago looking for mahogany. I think we'll have to shut down in two years."
 
White Man's World Presses In on Forest
 The ecological pressure on mahogany is felt deep in the jungle along the Aperecito River, where the Mojeno villagers, who have seldom seen white men, worry about their ability to defend their families and their land.
Last year, the Mojenos and three other Indian tribes were given two tracts of land in the Beni about the size of Delaware -- the Chimane forest and what is called the Multiethnic Indigenous Territory. But instead of being able to live peacefully without intrusion, the Indians see the white man's world moving in more and more.
On a recent morning, seven Mojenos assembled in Carmen del Aperecito, small men with dark complexions representing half of the Indigenous Forest Police authorized by the Government to perform the nearly impossible task of patrolling their land against the mahogany poachers.
Four carried old, rusted small-caliber rifles. Some had parts of police uniforms. Two had boots; others were barefoot. They were to show a visitor where wood cutters were systematically -- and illegally -- felling giant mahogany trees.
After a two-hour hike through mud, across swamps and over small streams, they came to a two-acre clearing, scarred with broad tractor marks. Almost 100 logs, four to six feet thick, lay on the ground, their once-dark bark bleached by the tropical sun, but their blood-red interior wood still rich in color.
In a second clearing a few hundred yards away, more logs lay on their sides, next to a makeshift camp with 10 bamboo beds for the cutting crew.
In theory, the lumber should have belonged to the Mojenos. The value of the fallen mahogany was more than $100,000. But the band of forest police lamented that last year, under pressure from the Government, a tribal leader signed away the right to several logging companies to cut 1,800 mahogany trees on their land. Instead of earning as much as $2,500 a tree, they got just $120.
"Based on the agreement, the loggers come in here, supposedly to collect and mark the trees they cut last year, and cut more, and then tag them and say they are trees that belong to them," said Edmundo Jhou, a Mojeno Indian and forestry expert at the Center for Study and Documentation for the Development of the Beni, a nongovernmental organization based in Trinidad.
 
Threats of Violence Worry the Indians
 In April, the small police force began to assert itself. It seized a $1,200 chain saw from one of the groups and a shotgun from another.
A few days later, a threatening band of seven men entered the village to claim the items back, but the Mojenos held a community meeting and voted against returning them.
Still, they are visibly nervous about growing threats of violence. Some suggest that the loggers be allowed take all the mahogany they want, believing they will then be left alone. They argue there are other species of wood they can use for their canoes.
But others are not so certain that the white men will go away once they take all the mahogany. Village leaders say they hear the buzz of small planes every few days, planes used by drug traffickers that are operating cocaine laboratories nearby.
And though the community tries to keep the rivers leading to the village overgrown to make then inaccessible to boats and difficult to follow by anyone but tribal members, the elders predict that inevitably the outside world will find them.
"There is a big division in the village," Daniel Bogado said. "The young people want to fight and not be pushed off by the lumber companies and outsiders. The older people are not sure. They think it may be better to go elsewhere, to look once again for the Loma Santa."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS CRITICIZED ON BURMESE POLICY

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is coming under growing criticism from human rights groups for its policy toward the military junta in Myanmar, formerly Burma, which they say is one of the most repressive governments in the world.
The groups say they are concerned that the Administration, out of deference to several of Myanmar's neighbors, mainly Thailand, is continuing restrictive policies toward Burmese refugees that were adopted in the Bush Administration. Some of the groups are also concerned over the Administration's support for an $18 million grant that was approved by a United Nations Development Program on Friday. 
 Last week, several human rights organizations and Burmese expatriate groups met with State Department representatives. Participants said they had expressed dissatisfaction with the current policy, likening it to the Administration's approach toward Haiti.
"As with Haiti, the Burmese military has been successfully defying the international community," said Michael Jendrzejczk, director of the Washington office of Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch in New York. "We would hope that the Clinton Administration would be much more effective in its policy toward Burma than they have been toward Haiti."
 
Fine Line Is Seen
 Administration officials say they must walk a fine line between applying pressure on Myanmar's leaders and providing sufficient incentives to induce changes in the Government's behavior. They must also balance their human rights efforts against the needs of Myanmar's neighbors like Thailand and Bangladesh, which have been inundated with refugees.
The State Department has told relief agencies to stop distributing aid to refugees living in camps on the Burmese side of the border with Thailand. The department has also continued tight requirements for dissident Burmese who have fled to Thailand and seek asylum in the United States.
Department officials say Administration support for the $18 million grant resulted from a compromise that reduced the grant from $40 million.
"We believe that was the best we could have done without forcing the matter for a vote, which we would have lost," said a State Department official involved in the discussions.

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Christopher St. Rebounds As Thriving 'Gay Mecca'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Three years ago, times were tough on what has been called America's Gay Main Street. Along with the rest of New York City, the six-block-long mecca for homosexuals struggled to cope with the recession, inflated rents and the drug trade, which increased crime.
But Christopher Street in Greenwich Village had special problems, too: AIDS, which took its toll on the area's business owners and their clientele, and an upsurge in violence against homosexuals. Its longtime free-wheeling image drew drunken late-night crowds. More shops were vacant than anyone could remember, nightclubs languished and a vibrant street scene turned almost somber. 
 But as Gay Pride Week begins today, the picture seems more upbeat. Merchants and residents say attacks on homosexuals are now rare. The police say robberies are down by a third over the last two years, and merchants say even shoplifting is off dramatically. Rents have descended from the stratosphere, and empty stores are hard to find, although turnover is high. Merchants have planted trees and gardens, lending the street a fresh, graceful vitality. Clubs are bustling again.
"We set out to turn the street around, and we did," said Bob Kohler, owner of The Loft at 89 Christopher Street, between Bleecker and Seventh Avenue, which specializes in whimsical outfits that patrons buy mainly to wear to gay clubs.
"I keep thinking it can't get any better and it does," said Yolanda Miller, who three years ago opened Stick, Stone & Bone, which sells moderately priced jewelry and New Age books at 111 Christopher Street, and has seen a continuing increase in sales. "When we opened, many store windows were boarded up, and it looked like a ghost town."
Store owners credit the street's greater safety to more officers on patrol, community patrols and a walkie-talkie network established by the merchants.
"We don't wait until it gets busy and noisy and rowdy," said Capt. Stephen Kennedy, commander of the Police Department's Sixth Precinct, whose station house is on West 10th Street, around the corner from Christopher. "But we try to be as sensitive as we can."
Captain Kennedy says the area is safer and has a better image because of cooperation between the police and neighborhood merchants and residents. For example, to control rowdy late-night crowds, officers can point to signs posted by merchants warning against beer-drinking.
"We wanted to control the problem without killing the mood," said Mike Mirisola, owner of Street-wise, a clothing store at 113 Christopher, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
Christopher Street resembles other small retail streets in Greenwich Village, but it became a magnet and a symbol for homosexuals after the police raided the Stonewall Inn, at 53 Christopher Street, on June 27, 1969. That led to the city's first gay-rights protests, and the emergence of a unified, forceful gay-rights movement.
"This is a gay mecca," said Mr. Mirisola. "Sooner or later, every gay man in America will pass in front of my store."
Marvin Howell, owner of World, a new clothing store at 75 Christopher, exults in the spending power many of his customers command, saying some will spend $175 for a designer T-shirt.
Much of the carnival that is Christopher Street has nothing to do with gay culture. On nice evenings, people savor ice cream and burgers in streetfront establishments. Shoppers line up at NcNulty's, a 98-year-old coffee store at 109 Christopher. Patrons fill the Lucille Lortel Theatre at 121 Christopher to see what is often first-rate off-Broadway fare. Attendees at "Tony and Tina's Wedding," a participatory play, can be seen traipsing between locales.
Paul Bellardo, owner of Bellardo, Ltd., at 100 Christopher Street, says he has been at that address since 1967 and has never particularly focused on homosexuals to sell his exquisite handblown glass vases and other handicrafts. Indeed, he closes during the weekend of Gay Pride Week. "Nothing sold," he said.
One of the oldest stores catering to homosexuals is The Loft, although a sign says straights are welcome. "Only if they behave," said Mr. Kohler, the owner, with a wry smile.
And among the newer stores that ignore sexual orientation, one sells drug paraphernalia, a rarity on Christopher, and one is a small grocery.
"Success on this street is merchandising, merchandising, merchandising," he said. He changes his window displays frequently.
 
Quirky but Affordable
 Mr. Mirisola said he has great admiration for the two women who opened Stick, Stone & Bone next door. "They've got gay women down pat, which I thought was impossible," he said, referring to the street's orientation toward men.
Ms. Miller gladly accepted the compliment, but quickly added that she and her partner, Linda Curti, also do brisk business with straight women and not a few men.
As with Street-wise, Ms. Miller said success has come through offering quirky merchandise dramatically displayed. And they are competitive. "We've always kept our prices really low," she said.
For Mr. Mirisola, who four years ago was madly searching the suburbs for a new location, a new era of success is arriving on Christopher Street. "Sales are up, and I'm really hopeful," he said.

HEADLINE: Land Claim By Indians Is a Tactic In Casino Bid

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRUMBULL, Conn., June 19

 BODY:
Last November, when a tribe of fewer than 100 Indians filed a lawsuit staking a claim to the land that downtown Bridgeport stands on, many people laughed. Given the city's financial problems, some people joked that the Indians should just take it, while others wondered in jest whether Indians hadn't suffered enough.
The laughter stopped this month when lawyers for the tribe, the Golden Hill Paugussetts, announced they were expanding their land claims to include four Bridgeport suburbs -- casting a cloud over $10 billion in Fairfield County real estate. "I think we've gone from joke to nightmare," said Bernard Wishnia, the tribe's main lawyer. 
 Whatever sympathy the Paugussetts might have had for the loss of their lands, their tactics and their goals have provoked fierce opposition. The tribe wants not just a reservation in Bridgeport, but a gambling casino. The object of the claims is not to recover ancestral lands, but to pressure officials to grant the Federal recognition the tribe needs to operate a casino. State and local officials call the suits extortion and say they will not negotiate.
 
'I Call It Judicial Terrorism'
 "They've stated that they really don't want the property, they want Federal recognition so they can get casino gambling," said David A. Wilson, the First Selectman of Trumbull, who has filed a countersuit against the Paugussetts. "To me that seems misuse of the judicial system. I call it judicial terrorism."
The land claims initially produced a wave of uncertainty among homeowners who feared that the ownership of their land would be jeopardized, and some real-estate closings fell through.
Title-insurance companies are continuing to issue policies for most properties -- but not all -- and so banks are lending money and refinancing mortgages. A legislative committee is studying how the state can help homeowners.
Still, some people remain worried about losing their homes. "They had some surveyors up at the manor, and they told us it was just for the diocese, but with all this Indian talk, it has us nervous," said Valerie Faulkner, a resident of St. Joseph's Manor, a retirement home in Trumbull.
More, though, have accepted the suits for what the Paugussetts say they are: pressure on state and Federal officials to negotiate an agreement that will give the tiny tribe Federal recognition, land and money.
"It's a nuisance suit," said David D'Ausilio, the owner of Vantage Realty Better Homes and Gardens here. "Their ultimate objective is to inconvenience everybody until they get what they want."
But the tribal council leader, a 48-year-old social worker, Aurelius H. Piper Jr., who uses the name Chief Quiet Hawk, said the state's opposition to the Paugussetts' claims were based on racism. The casino issue, he said, only intensified racist fears, because of the economic power that casinos could bring the state's smallest minority group.
Chief Quiet Hawk, contrasted the opposition the tribe has encountered with the reception that Stephen Wynn, the head of Mirage Resorts, received when he came to Connecticut to lobby for casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford.
"There were the same people who are opposing us, holding him up as a god who would bring life to the city of Bridgeport," Chief Quiet Hawk said. "But we are just a bunch of Indians. To them it is unrealistic and appalling that a minority group could have that much economic power."
Chief Quiet Hawk said he became chief in 1990 to carry on the work of his father, Chief Big Eagle, who obtained state recognition for the Paugussetts in the 1970's when he won a court battle for clear title to the tribe's one-quarter-acre reservation in Trumbull.
Illness and lack of money, however, caused Chief Big Eagle to drop his pursuit of nearly 20 more acres in Trumbull that he claimed as former reservation land; when Chief Quiet Hawk took up his work, that land was claimed in one of the first lawsuits filed by the tribe.
Despite the tribal leader's arguments local and state officials are following the lead of Connecticut's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, who has vowed to fight "tooth and nail" rather than negotiate.
"We will continue to fight relentlessly," said Mr. Blumenthal, who contends the Paugussetts have no basis to claim land until the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes them as a tribe. "As a courtesy, we certainly will hear them out, but we can't compromise the fates of thousands of innocent property owners.
"A good deal of the money funding these lawsuits," he added, "has come from out-of-state gaming interests."
At a meeting Saturday at a middle school in Trumbull, Mr. Blumenthal and other officials made clear that they consider having a casino the sole motivation of a small group of Indians who they believe have no valid claim to be a tribe.
According to a recent census submitted by the Paugussetts, the officials said, the "alleged tribe" had only 37 members.
Mr. Wishnia, the tribe's lawyer, said he was not surprised to see the Paugussetts cast as greedy villains. "Native Americans throughout the country were abused and murdered," he said. "When the survivors tried to fight back, it was the fault of the savage Indians. When tribes were forced to march across the country and resisted, it was the fault of the Indians."
Now, he said, the Paugussetts are only following the path of other tribes in applying for Federal recognition and filing land claims, with the goal of negotiating for the land, resources and Federal aid to preserve their way of life.
The tribe, he acknowledged, is supported by an investor, Impression Delivery Corporation of Minneapolis, interested in seeing a casino in Bridgeport, little more than an hour from New York City. But without their financial support, he said, the Paugussetts could not afford the detailed research needed for Federal recognition, such as documenting that they have functioned continuously as a tribe for the last 350 years, or the legal assistance to make the claims.
"We had no choice but to play the casino card in order to do this," Mr. Wishnia said. "The state of Connecticut and its landowners are apparently prepared to spend endless amounts of money to fight our claims. That's not a fight we could afford to get involved in alone."
The Paugussetts started the process of seeking Federal recognition in 1982, long before talk of casinos, Mr. Wishnia said, and their interests today are the same as then: self-preservation.
What changed, he said, was that Congress allowed Federally recognized tribes, as sovereign entities, to conduct gaming in 1988, and the Mashantucket Pequots then built a wildly successful casino in eastern Connecticut. That opened the state to the possibility of other casinos and drew investors to the struggling tribe in Bridgeport.
 
Old Law Is Cited
 Mr. Wishnia and other lawyers for the tribe say Mr. Blumenthal is simply wrong in contending that the tribe must have Federal recognition before its claims can be heard. Courts have long held that the Nonintercourse Act of 1790, on which Indian land claims are based, applies to tribes like the Paugussetts, who are recognized by Connecticut as a tribe.
They also note that states can speed the recognition process by having their Congressional delegations introduce special legislation to recognize a tribe, as happened in 1982, when Lowell P. Weicker Jr., then a senator, and Representative Sam Gejdenson sponsored such an act for the Pequots.
The lawyers also say that they are confident that their land claims are documented, showing that lands that the Paugussetts held title to were illegally bought, traded or taken from them under both the colonial government and the Federal Government that followed.
The expanded suits announced this month, covering the towns of Trumbull, Shelton, Monroe and Stratford, are based on the Paugussetts receiving title to 84 square miles here in 1637, two years before the founding of Stratford, from which the other towns later broke off.
Representative Christopher Shays, who represents the Bridgeport area, has met with members of the tribe. He insists that they must follow procedure to establish their legitimacy and their claims, rather than pressure elected officials, especially because of the money at stake in a casino.
"They wanted to tell me all the great things they wanted to do with their casino," Mr. Shays said. "That's what's motivating them. We're talking about millions of dollars, potentially billions of dollars in revenue. So this is not child's play. The real tragedy is the innocent homeowners who are being held hostage."
 
'Claims Are No Joke'
 Many lawyers experienced in defending Indian claims, however, advise their clients to explore negotiations, because claims that appear outlandish at first can turn out to be valid.
"Indian land claims are no joke," said Allan van Gestel, a Boston lawyer who is representing some property owners in the Bridgeport area. "There's been a lot of law made, and Indians have had some success."
The key issue, he said, is whether a tribe is functioning as a tribe not only when a claim is filed, but also when the contested land transaction took place. The Paugussetts' case appears weak to him, he said, because only three people could claim tribal ancestry at the time of a key sale, that of Golden Hill, the area of Bridgeport where City Hall now stands.
As for the Paugussetts today, Mr. van Gestel said, "You say they are a tribe. I say they are a group of people who by looking eastward to the Mashantucket Pequots see a way to better their lives."

The Newspaper Industry Is At A Crossroad: Does It Take the High-Tech Highway Or Go Back to Basics?

BYLINE: By William Glaberson

 BODY:
THE newspaper industry right now is like the kid who is asked what he wants to do when he grows up.
"Make money," he says.
The newspaper industry has been a grown-up for a long time. But as a mature business in a rough economy, it is finding it difficult to find paths to continued growth. And, as in any business, there is one thing newspaper companies know they have to do: Make money. 
 Because newspapers are a mature business, with the unusual problems of changing reader and advertiser habits, it has long been obvious that newspaper owners cannot sit back as they once did and wait for business to stream in the door. But the industry's strategic compass is erratic.
One minute, it seems to be pointing clearly toward the electronic newspaper, which will be read on a personalized monitor. The next instant, printed pages seem certain to remain the delivery system of choice.
One minute, newspapers seem mesmerized by the prospect of telephone-newspaper linkups, interactive classified advertising, CD-ROM's, cable television and on-line computer services. The next, specialty publications are the rage, and there is talk about attending to the core business that has produced healthy revenues for decades.
"What you have right now is a lot of confusion in the industry," said Tod A. Jacobs, a newspaper securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company of New York City. "Long term, no one really knows what to do."
Newspaper companies are especially uncertain now because the economy's prospects are so murky. This spring, there was optimism about advertising in many newspaper markets, with New York City and Los Angeles remaining notable exceptions.
But now publishers across the country are beginning to worry because advertising shows signs of stalling again. In this strange, uncertain time, newspaper companies are trying to position themselves for the future. That task is made especially difficult because of the confusion over which way the industry will move into the next century.
Despite the frustrating times, most newspaper companies are taking steps toward reshaping themselves. And many companies are striking out in several directions at once.
Some industry giants, including Gannett, Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror, last month proclaimed their commitment to the new electronic pathways for news. They formed a consortium to explore telecommunications and computer delivery systems for the news.
This month, with its executives noting publicly that few of the high-tech newspaper projects have yet brought major financial returns, The New York Times Company announced its $1.1 billion merger with The Boston Globe. The Times Company has said it is also committed to moving into new media and recently created a business group for electronic and other information services.
Scripps Howard and the Tribune Company, along with Capital Cities/ ABC, recently invested in one of the leading companies that are moving newspapers toward competing with the Postal Service, delivering magazines and product samples to doorsteps across the country. The company, Alternate Postal Delivery of Grand Rapids, Mich., works with newspapers to fight their increasingly strong competitors for advertising dollars: direct-mail companies.
But while newspapers move in what would have once been considered the improbable direction of becoming couriers for national magazines and deodorant manufacturers, they are also nurturing new publications that are logical offspring. This fall, The Chicago Tribune will begin publication of a new Spanish language weekly, Exito!, with its own 20-member staff. The weekly will be aimed at the one million Spanish-speaking residents of metropolitan Chicago.
The Wall Street Journal recently announced that it would add on Sept. 8 a weekly Texas Journal section of the newspaper in Texas with its own staff to provide coverage of the business scene in that big state.
Analysts say there is little question that other major new newspaper ventures are inevitable. In part, that is because newspapers generate so much cash in the normal course of business.
"What a newspaper is, is a cash cow. It is an annuity," said Kenneth T. Berents, an industry analyst at Wheat, First Securities Inc. of Richmond.
Mr. Jacobs of Sanford C. Bernstein estimated that over the next five years, Gannett could generate $1 billion in excess cash flow that it would need to invest. He estimated that Knight-Ridder could produce $800 million in extra cash and the Tribune Company could have $700 million available.
Still, most analysts now believe that newspapers may never get back to the very high returns on investment that they had as recently as the 80's. That means they must transform the way they manage themselves financially to try to satisfy investors. That also means they will move down new paths, even if it is not yet clear where all those paths lead.

NEW AGE OF FUND RAISING FOR CATHOLICS
Brother Anthony Iazzetti's latest excursion into the world of raising money for his school in the north Bronx is far removed from the candy sales and raffles that have long been a staple of Roman Catholic fund-raising drives. To be exact, it's 2,786 miles away in Los Angeles. As the president of Mount Saint Michael Academy, he recently traveled to the West Coast to meet with a select handful of alumni who he hoped would become major contributors to the school's $6 million capital campaign. Although such efforts are not unusual for private colleges or universities, a growing number of Catholic high schools, and some grammar schools, have had to turn to an array of aggressive and sophisticated fund-raising techniques.

MEETING SCHEDULED IN WALKOUT
In an effort to end a staff walkout over safety concerns, social service officials are to meet with a union representing workers at a center that places homeless people in shelters. The center, at 78 Catherine Street in lower Manhattan, has been closed since Friday when a caseworker was assaulted by a homeless woman. The center usually serves about 75 families a day and is supposed to be open 24 hours a day. B2.
 

BETTER TIMES ON CHRISTOPHER STREET
Three years ago, times were tough on what has been called America's Gay Main Street. Along with the rest of New York City, the six-block-long section of Christopher Street in Greenwich Village struggled to cope with the recession, inflated rents and the drug trade, which increased crime. But as Gay Pride Week begins, the picture seems more upbeat. Strictly Business. B3.
 
THE DEBATE OVER TERM LIMITS
If proposed eight-year term limits were in effect, the New York City Council President, most of the borough presidents and nearly half the Council members would probably be disqualified from seeking re-election this year. Which is why a putatively populist crusade that could limit the discretion of elected officials and voters alike is supported largely by people who have been unable to win even one term or who have already held their jobs longer than the proposed limits would allow. Metro Matters. B3.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Sluggish European Sales Affect the Big 3 in Different Ways

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
UNFORTUNATELY for investors in American auto stocks, the budding automotive recovery in the United States has been undercut somewhat by a prostrate European market.
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company depend heavily on earnings from Europe, while the Chrysler Corporation has little manufacturing there and minimal exports. Not surprisingly, the stocks of G.M. and Ford have been penalized by the European market, while the strongly performing Chrysler shares have not. 
 But are European car sales about to turn? And when they turn, will G.M. and Ford profit from the upswing? And is the lack of a European presence actually helping Chrysler shares? These questions arose last week on Wall Street -- a week when Ford shares fell, apparently because of the perception that its results in Europe may stay depressed longer than investors had expected.
European auto sales were down 17.9 percent in May, compared with the month a year earlier. An important factor was lower-than-normal sales in Germany, which seemed to compensate for the higher-than-normal sales immediately after reunification. Elsewhere, sales were improving in Britain, were not quite as bad as they had been in France and Spain, and were worse in Italy.
Ford has higher sales in Britain than anywhere else in Europe, and some investors had been thinking that an improved British market would lead Europe out of tough times. As a result, they bid up Ford shares in early June. That confidence evaporated last week, as analysts reiterated that a European recovery might be a year away. For the week, Ford shares fell to $50, from $53.75.
In 1991 and 1992, Ford lost more than $2 billion in Europe. It said it would lose money there again this year, perhaps more than $500 million.
G.M., which earned $1.7 billion in Europe in 1991 and $1.2 billion last year, may earn less than $550 million this year, said Jean-Claude Gruet of UBS Securities Inc. That result would still be an accomplishment, he said, because it was possible that no other auto maker would make money there. It would also be significant because G.M.'s highest European sales are in Germany, where the overall market is weakest and where Volkswagen A.G. is on a crusade to cut costs.
Mr. Gruet said some investors might be thinking of taking profits in Chrysler, which has more than doubled in price over the last year, and buying G.M. and Ford to take advantage of coming improvements in Europe. "Right now, Chrysler being a pure North American play is very favorable," he said. When Europe recovers, though, investors who want to hold an automotive stock may look for a way to tap into European profits, he said.
Analysts caution that the timing and magnitude of Europe's auto-market recovery will be crucial to investors. While the Bundesbank has been lowering interest rates, consumers may wait to respond; their fears of rising unemployment may outweigh the low rates. Moreover, Japanese auto makers are building more vehicles in Europe and are growing stronger by the month.
"Next year should be better, but I'm thinking that the improvement may be no better than 5 percent; it may not come until the second half of the year," said Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch & Company. He recently lowered his recommendation on Ford to hold.
Wendy Needham of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company said a more robust North American market should overshadow European developments for the next 18 months or so. On that basis, she is recommending G.M. and Chrysler.

HEADLINE: British Air Joins Chase In Card Deal

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
In a move to strengthen its growing presence in the United States, British Airways has joined with the Chase Manhattan Bank to issue a joint Visa credit card that will earn users frequent-flier miles on international and domestic United States flights.
Most major United States airlines have similar affinity cards with banks, for which card owners typically pay an annual fee of $50 and accrue one frequent-flier mile for every dollar charged. This is the first such arrangement between a big American bank and a large foreign airline. 
 It comes at a time when frequent-flier miles are increasingly being dangled as lures for everything from hotel stays to magazine subscriptions -- and at a time when frequent-flier programs are growing among carriers in Europe and Asia.
 
 
Becoming 'Americanized'
 Noting the recent $400 million investment by British Airways in the USAir Group, Randy Peterson, the publisher of Inside Flyer, a monthly guide to frequent-flier programs, said: "With USAir in the fold they've become more Americanized in the mind of travelers. Now the alliance with Chase will strengthen that feeling."
Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of Frequent Flyer magazine, said the arrangement might help British Airways' marketing but might do little for Chase. "The affinity card has generally been a mirage," he said. "The volume is there but not the profits, because the people who own them tend to pay their bills within 30 days, so the banks can't collect interest on the balance."
Banks pay the airlines about 1 cent for each frequent-flier mile they award to card holders, and hope to make money through the annual membership fees and in their percentage of merchants' receipts from customers' using the card. Citibank's Mastercard and Visa affinity cards with American Airlines are thought to have about a million members, who on average spend enough money to qualify for a free domestic flight every 18 months. Mr. Peterson said he expected to see affinity programs between airlines and brokerage houses or insurance companies.
Under most such programs, it requires $20,000 in card charges to qualify for a free domestic United States ticket, and $40,000 for an international flight.
Chase Manhattan exudes optimism about its new affinity partner. "We're looking in the area of hundreds of thousands of new members over time," said Thomas C. Lynch, executive vice president of Chase. Many will be leisure travelers, Mr. Lynch said, because they not only take more flights on vacations than in decades past, they tend to take more family members with them.
 
T.W.A. May Offer One
 Chase previously had an affinity card with Trans World Airlines, but it expired last year, when T.W.A. was in bankruptcy protection. Now out of bankruptcy, T.W.A. said it expected to offer an affinity card soon with another bank.
The only other leading airline without an affinity partner is Delta Air Lines, although it participates in American Express Membership Miles and Diners Club Rewards. Both those programs award frequent-flier miles for use with a variety of participating carriers, and American Express's two-year-old program already has 1.7 million members -- despite having lost Pan American and Midway when those airlines went out of business, and MGM Grand, which went into the cargo business.
Last week, American Express added USAir as a partner, although the Diners Club program still has more than twice as many airlines.
"We'll consider ourselves successful if we hit 60,000 to 75,000 cards by the end of the year," said Chris Vukelich, director of business programs for British Airways. He added that its existing frequent-flier program, begun in February 1992, has about 500,000 members in the United States, and the affinity card is intended primarily at enrolling even more frequent business travelers.
British Airways is the leader in flights between the United States and Britain, with about 40 percent of the traffic, and has as many as 29 daily flights.
Under the affinity card program and British Airways' existing frequent-flier program, the carrier will provide up to four additional credit cards without charge to the primary card holder's account, allowing households to combine the miles they earn. Card holders can also earn miles on British Airways, USAir, USAir Express and Alaska Airlines, and they can redeem miles on those four carriers as well as on American Airlines.
Many foreign airlines are creating or improving frequent-flier programs, and their target is often Americans, who represent about 40 percent of all airline passengers (compared with about 30 percent for Europeans).
Japan Airlines recently broadened the definition of family members eligible for miles in its program, and for the first time included economy fares in computing mileage. Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines are banding together to offer a frequent-flier program this summer, while Korean Air's frequent-flier program offers miles for passengers who stay not only at hotels in Korea but also at the Los Angeles Hilton.
Most European frequent-flier programs have been more restrictive than those of United States carriers, but they are becoming more liberal.

HEADLINE: Legislature Is Deadlocked On Banking Deregulation

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 20

 BODY:
With just over a week left before current banking laws expire, the State Legislature is deadlocked over legislation that consumer groups say will provide important protections to bank customers and that the banking industry says will determine whether thousands of banking jobs stay in the state.
At stake are laws dating from 1980 that have deregulated the financial industry, allowing banking companies almost complete freedom in setting interest rates on credit cards and most types of loans. 
 Before deregulation began in 1980, the state limited the interest that banks could charge on credit cards and most loans. Rates for most types of consumer loans, for example, could not go above 12 percent. The state also restricted the length and types of loans banks could offer.
 
Deadline for Decision
 The Legislature must decide by June 30, when the current laws expire, whether to make deregulation permanent, simply to extend it or to allow it to lapse.
Consumer-protection groups say deregulation allowed banks to charge excessive fees for services like writing checks and they have called for new laws requiring all banks to offer low-cost or free accounts. "Banks are gouging consumers," said Travis Plunkett of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
But banking companies, who want deregulation made permanent, have said deregulation has led to lower interest rates on loans and a wide variety of new products, including variable rate loans. They say many banks will restrict credit or move operations to other states if deregulation expires and the old system of caps on interest rates is reinstituted.
"Permanent deregulation provides an economic incentive for banks to stay in New York," said Michael P. Smith, executive vice president of the New York State Bankers Association, which represents most of the state's 292 commercial banks.
No matter what happens with the law, it is unlikely that banks would move jobs soon, but bank officials say their concern is long-term planning.
 
Strong Sentiment
 There is strong sentiment in both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate for allowing deregulation to continue. But the two houses remain far apart on how long it should be extended and on what strings can be attached.
To the dismay of bank companies and their Republican allies, the Assembly Democrats have turned deregulation into what a lobbyist called a "honey pot": a bill so important to the banking industry that legislators swarm around it with amendments providing goodies for constituents.
Urban legislators want banks to give more loans to women and minorities and new protections against what they consider racially discriminatory banking practices. Consumer advocates want banks to support a statewide advocacy group for bank customers by listing its toll-free telephone number on bills. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo wants a multimillion-dollar loan fund for small businesses.
The amendments have caused angry rumblings from Republicans who say banks want only limited concessions and then only if deregulation is made permanent.
"If they hang too many Christmas tree bulbs on this, the Senate will not approve it," said Senator Hugh T. Farley, a Schenectady Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
With just over a week to go, many legislators feel they may have only one option: extending current laws for another limited period, without adding new consumer protections. "It would be the worst of all worlds because it will mean we're stuck with a law that doesn't work for consumers and that banks don't want," said Mr. Plunkett.
Banking deregulation came about after banks complained in the late 1970's, when interest rates skyrocketed, that regulation was squeezing profits and forcing them to constrict credit. Several companies, including Citibank and Chase Manhattan, moved credit-card operations to states with less restrictive laws, taking thousands of jobs with them.
But the Legislature, fearing sharply higher interest rates and fees, refused to make deregulation permanent, allowing it to expire periodically, first in 1983, again in 1987 and now this year. The fears interest rates remain even though rates on credit cards and loans have been dropping in recent years, for that decline is largely due to changes in the economy not related to deregulation.
 
Campaign Contributions
 For their part, banks and their lobbyists have been able to exert considerable power in the Legislature by spending heavily on campaign contributions. Last year, a political action committee controlled by the New York Bankers Association spent $111,000 on Legislative campaigns. The largest chunk of that, more than $18,000, went to the Senate Republican campaign committee.
But the industry has failed to persuade Legislators to make deregulation permanent, largely because many Democrats fear losing powerful leverage with a powerful industry.
"I'd like to see them come back every six years," said Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve, a Buffalo Democrat. "If you give away your options on that, you give away everything."
Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Banking Committee, has negotiated a compromise with banking lobbyists and Mr. Farley, the Senate Banking Committee chairman. The plan would make deregulation permanent and would require all banks to offer low-cost checking accounts. It would also require banks to open accounts for anyone living in the surrounding county, a safeguard against racial discrimination, Mr. Farrell said.
But many Democrats say the proposal does not go far enough toward protecting consumers.

HEADLINE: Circuit Rider Trying to Save That Old-Time Main Street

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARGARETVILLE, N.Y., June 16

 BODY:
Richard Hersey is a modern-day circuit rider, going from village to village in the Catskill Mountains in an experimental program to revive the economic health of the Main Streets.
His official title is "Main Street Coordinator/Circuit Rider," but he describes himself as a catalyst, cheerleader, consultant and go-between for five communities trying to overcome the neglect and deterioration of their basic shopping streets. 
 "I am trying first and foremost to encourage people to use their own resources to sustain their local economies," he said. "The objective is to rebuild the spirit of their Main Streets."
From his base at the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, based in Arkville, Mr. Hersey drives 5,000 to 6,000 miles a month to meetings with merchants, public officials, Chambers of Commerce and Main Street committees in three counties.
 
Competition From Malls
 The longest trip he makes in his 1986 Saab is 50 miles to Jeffersonville (population 484) in Sullivan County. It's about 45 miles to Cairo (population 1,273) in Greene County, 35 miles to Walton (population 3,326) and 25 miles to Delhi (population 3,084), both in Delaware County, but only about a mile to Margaretville (population 639), also in Delaware County.
Like cities everywhere in the United States, the small villages of the Catskill Mountains have seen their downtowns falter largely because of the competition of large shopping malls and discount houses. Some have empty storefronts, others have ugly signs, many have inadequate parking spaces. All complain about too few shoppers.
Despite problems elsewhere with attempts to reinvigorate downtowns, particularly in nearby Hudson River cities like Newburgh, Hudson, Poughkeepsie and Troy, Mr. Hersey is optimistic that the smaller Catskill villages have a better chance.
Among their advantages, he says, are the scenic beauty around them, relatively low crime rates, the growth of second-home residences and a neighborly atmosphere.
 
Part-Time Residents
 "The obvious future economy of the Catskills is tied to tourism and second homes," Mr. Hersey said. "Even if it has a smaller population, it can have a stronger economy because of the part-time residents and visitors."
An urban planner by profession, Mr. Hersey, 44, worked in large and small cities before coming to the Catskill Mountains in February. A native of Beverly, Mass., he graduated from Columbia University and received a master's degree in urban planning from the University of Southern California.
His job is a cooperative venture of the Catskill Center and the New York Main Street Alliance, based in New York City. The alliance, which was formed in 1990, also operates Main Street aid programs in Jackson Heights, Bay Ridge, Staten Island and Harlem.
The Catskill circuit rider program is financed by local contributions and money from the O'Connor Foundation and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation. Its budget for the current year is about $45,000, said Peter Mosbacher, of the Main Street Alliance.
 
A Visit to Main Street
 Sitting in the sun on a bench, one of the amenities of an uncrowded and pleasant-looking Main Street here in Margaretville, a resident, Helen Kern, said she liked to come downtown every day to buy a newspaper and pick up her mail.
"I do most of my shopping here but I have to go to Oneonta or Kingston every once in a while," she said. "I had to go to Delhi recently to buy an ironing board because it wasn't available here. We need more things available on Main Street."
To her left, Main Street stretched south to a supermarket. To her right, it ended three-quarters of a mile away in a farm. In between, it had a mix of locally owned establishments: a pharmacy, a liquor store, a hardware store, a bank, a small department store, several restaurants, a J. C. Penney catalog store, a lawyer's office and the Galli-Curci Theater, now converted into an antique center. Only two stores were vacant, one being remodeled.
 
Traffic Flow and Parking
 Sitting on the same bench, Brian Millen, owner of the local department store and co-chairman of the Main Street Subcommittee of the Greater Margaretville Chamber of Commerce, said, "The major problem in town is traffic flow and parking."
Walking down Main Street, Mr. Hersey said the five communities now have opportunities to cooperate and develop special market niches.
He said he saw Margaretville as a regional retail center, Jeffersonville as an arts center, Cairo as a multipurpose downtown, Delhi as a connection between its branch of the State University and local government, and Walton as a center for both youth and retired people.
"Remaking a downtown is never complete," he said. "It's like weeding a garden."

HEADLINE: Paris Air Show Ends on Optimism

BYLINE: International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, June 20

 BODY:
The 40th Paris Air Show -- one of the world's most prestigious showcases for aircraft -- wound up today with the aerospace industry in its deepest trough since World War II but with its optimism still largely intact that the good times will roll round again.
Both Jean Pierson, managing director and chief executive of Airbus Industrie, and Philip M. Condit, president of the Boeing Company, predicted that the industry's business cycle would be swinging upward when the next Paris show took place in 1995. 
 Their prediction appeared to be based more on the certainty that aircraft wear out and need to be replaced, and on the likelihood of rapid growth in the Asian market, than on any confidence that American and European airlines will have emerged from their catastrophic losses by then.
The Paris show underscores a trend that has become increasingly apparent in the last few years: The cost, size and complexity of major aerospace projects will lead to increasing international and, indeed, intercontinental cooperation.
 
Pooling of Resources
 Even Boeing and Airbus have pooled resources to study the feasibility of jointly building an airliner capable of carrying more than 600 passengers. With a market for no more than 500 such aircraft, analysts say it would be economically impossible for either company to build one alone.
Despite the possibility of such cooperation, Boeing says Airbus is unfairly subsidized by European governments, while Airbus asserts that its American rivals are propped up with handouts from the United States military budget.
As Boeing lays off 28,000 workers to cope with a sharp fall in orders, Airbus rejects the claim that European competition is to blame. It says it provides jobs for thousands of American workers. It also makes the point that Boeing laid off 64,000 workers between 1968 and 1971, before a single Airbus had been delivered.
Airbus has successfully penetrated the United States market, with sales of more than 400 aircraft. But Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are even more dependent on the European market, with more than 2,100 aircraft in service with, or on order from, airlines here.
 
Airbus Parts Made in U.S.
 And the rivalry obscures the fact that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are not as all-American nor Airbus as all-European as politicians make them out to be. Companies in 35 American states provide 20 to 40 percent of the content of Airbus aircraft, including key elements in their computer systems. More than 30 percent of the Boeing 767 airframe and more than 65 percent of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airliner are built outside the United States.
If a superjumbo ever goes into production, it will probably be powered by the mammoth GE-90 jet engine, being jointly developed by General Electric of the United States and Snecma of France.
To survive, aerospace component manufacturers have to build and trade on a world scale. For instance, Dowty Aerospace, which makes landing gear, propellers, hydraulic systems and engine rings, is British but does much of its manufacturing in Canada, Pennsylvania and North Carolina and is in more than 30 other countries.
On the military front, the cost and complexity of developing warplanes and related projects is forcing European countries toward more extensive cooperation. France's Rafale and Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen are probably the last big fighter projects that any country, outside the United States and Russia, will embark upon alone.
 
Cooperation on Missiles
 Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace are likely to team up soon to develop and build missiles. Eight European countries have been discussing building a military transport to replace the Lockheed C-130, which will be 50 years old next year. Lockheed, meanwhile is developing new engines and avionics to take its workhorse well into the next century.
Discussions are also under way to build a joint European maritime aircraft.
Because most countries see their defense needs differently, cooperation on military projects, while necessary in the present economic climate, is complicated.
The four-nation European jet fighter has had to be redefined because Germany found the original concept too expensive. Italy is wavering on the project because it needs to replace its aging F-104 jets quickly as a result of security threats stemming from the war raging across the Adriatic in Yugoslavia.
