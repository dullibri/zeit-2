HEADLINE: At Last, The South Loses Well

BYLINE: By Allan Gurganus; Allan Gurganus is the author of "Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All," "White People" and the forthcoming "Plays Well With Others."

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
The novelist Walker Percy was often asked why so many darkly comic writers of genius arose from the American South. He answered, "Because we lost." Then he laughed, with a shaman's economy and a cracker's certainty.
In three elegant words, Percy named the region's greatest shame and its uncanny secret power: our habit of anticipating defeat while never accepting it. 
 Trust me. The South is no place for beginners. Its power of denial can turn a lost war into a vibrant, necessary form of national chic. That same knack has also given us a dreadful reputation.
The virulent Rebel spirit still flies -- unsubtle as a flag run up a pole -- over South Carolina's Statehouse. Literally. This Confederate battle flag was first raised to commemorate the Civil War's centennial 34 years back. Until now, nobody has found the nerve or the vision to simply yank it down.
And why? The answer is aptly perverse: "Because we lost," the flag must remain. That is, until now.
Sigmund Freud might have been practicing in Atlanta -- practicing on Atlanta -- when he announced:
"We overcame the transference by pointing out to the patient that his feelings do not arise from the present situation . . . but they are repeating something that happened to him earlier. In this way, we oblige him to transform his repetition into memory."
These days, those memories are saleable, exportable. Shiloh is picturesque, touristic. The President and Vice President? An Arkansan and a Tennessean. Burned Atlanta now plays host to the Fortune 500.
Having once fought hard for a divorce from the United States, having been outgunned, outlawyered, burned flat, then alimonied near to death, we Southerners were left with little more than our lore. To that, at least, we held on tight. For a century, memory was all we had to sell.
Picture Charleston's Magnolia Cemetery on Confederate Memorial Day, 1871. Pretty dresses, gray uniforms, all the crutches. To a crowd of 6,000, the Rev. John L. Giradeau gave a speech. He might have been speaking about the worries of present-day African-Americans or Israelis or Palestinians.
"Let us cling to our identity as a people! The danger is upon us of losing it -- of its being absorbed and swallowed up in that of a people which, having despoiled us of the rights of freemen, assumes to do our thinking, our legislating, and our ruling for us. Influences are operating on us with every breath we draw which, if we be not vigilant, will sooner or later wipe out every distinctive characteristic which has hitherto marked us. Are we prepared for it? . . . Nothing of the past will be left to the South but a history which will read like an elegiac poem, nothing for the present but a place on the maps which our children study . . . a single existence, a geographical one. But can we preserve our identity in the face of the difficulties which oppose it?"
The Reverend need not have worried so. Though South Carolina might look somewhat like Ohio, it is still confoundedly South Carolina. For better and for worse. Fifteen years ago, we were told the Southern accent would disappear. Tain't so!
The North sent us carpetbaggers; we sent them chef Paul Prudhomme on a golf cart. Guess who made the bigger dent? Today black professionals are returning en masse to the South. These days country music is not just played at Nashville barn dances. The region that gave birth to both jazz and the blues is at last -- thanks to Junior Chambers of Commerce -- considered jazzy, bluesy, sexy. Rather than blandify our food to match the occupying force's, we've lent our spice to the Yankee blahs. And at a pretty good markup.
But certain rankling emblems remain, symbols of the Bad Old South and not the Good New Gourmet One.
In 1962, South Carolina rehoisted the Confederate battle flag over its Statehouse. The thing is still snapping there. The trouble with raising such a pennant: Once it's up there, you can't exactly pull it down unnoticed. If you raise a war flag in a time of peace, the rules of war will always govern it -- even 131 years after you lost the bloody war. And there's the bind.
Enter Gov. David Beasley. He is a young Republican just two years into his first term. When elected, he favored the battle flag's presence. Three-fourths of all registered Republicans wanted the colors to fly forever. But South Carolina is now reeling from a series of especially ugly racist crimes, including church torchings and a drive-by shooting at a black nightclub. Daily Statehouse protesters claim that the flag sanctions such racial violence, a tacit "yes" to the Klan and deranged militia groups.
After hard grappling with the issue, Governor Beasley called a news conference televised statewide. He announced that the last government-flown Confederate flag should finally come down. Though the forces of tradition still claim the symbol as theirs, Governor Beasley admits the forces of hatred have co-opted it. The Governor has done a real service to the South. He has given it a final chance to rise -- and this time, from a Reconstruction of its own making.
The resulting furor now reads like Southern fiction at its ethics-based, glandular and atmospheric best. Business interests fear canceled conventions if the flag waves on. Senator Strom Thurmond, born just 34 years after the War ended, favors purging this symbol. The Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy ride clouds of 19th-century rhetoric -- "blood" its operative metaphor. The African- American community opposes any display of the flag. For narrative suspense, the State Legislature has still not voted on the proposal.
There are intelligent people who believe the flag should stay in place. Their credibility is undercut by two leading Republican gubernatorial hopefuls who insist: The flag is a symbol of honor. It never burned a church. The battle flag has nothing to do with slavery.
Such citizens' homework for tonight should be the reading of a little item called the "Declaration of the Immediate Causes which induce and justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union." The words "slave" and "slavery" slather through it.
One sentence condemning the North reads: "They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection."
The condescension dripping from "books and pictures" is enough to freeze any heart. As usual, those Republicans quickest to use History as their battle cry seem to have read very little of it lately.
Governor Beasley, in striking the colors "because we lost," offers a clean gesture, brave and, not incidentally, career-making.
I phoned my most knowing friends in Charleston (very knowing, indeed). They tell me that, for Governor Beasley, symbolic shifts with prevailing winds are nothing new.
He blew into office as a (literally) flag-waving Republican governor. Yet he is a former Democrat. A boy from Society Hill, he converted to evangelical Christianity, then to the Christian Coalition, just in time to ride the botched Gingrich Revolution. (Newt Gingrich, for the record, is a Pennsylvanian who moved clear to Georgia to get elected, which explains a lot.)
Whatever Governor Beasley's motives, his battle-flag conversion offers our region a belated crack at doing something right. The South has a chance at last to lose the war correctly.
To finally admit: We've noticed that we lost! Everybody loses something. A ball game, a wristwatch, a spouse, a child -- eventually, a life. The healthiest among us are those folks able -- through some mythic algebra that can never be explained -- to upgrade defeat into an acceptance that itself becomes a form of honor. Shakespeare speaks of turning defect into perfection. But, flying the flag of the losing side blocks just such healthy personal present-tense mythologizing. Where are the new emblems of a New South?
Our region has finally offered itself a chance at visible dignity. Not just economic comeuppance, but a lunge at self-criticism -- the first step toward affectionate self-acceptance, and a unity postponed.
The Governor suggests the flag now be flown only over a Civil War museum on the Statehouse grounds. This would give a context to the martial emblem of a lost cause. But African-Americans protest its display there. They would forbid the colors' presence, even as a reminder of an emancipating war.
"Lest we forget" becomes "lest we remember." Amnesia is no cure for the pain of Southern history -- white or black amnesia.
Confucius claims that one purpose of poetry is to teach the names of birds and plants to a nation's children. Monuments and flags serve as aids to train our young about their past. The battle flag enthusiasts need reminding: Only the winning side gets to fly its symbol over seats of legislation financed by taxpayers of all races. Conversely, is it not risky for black Southerners to erase from view the very emblem of crimes that cannot be addressed too often?
Absolutist thinking -- balkanizing both sides -- is the New Secessionism. Been there, folks. Done that.
The New Secessionism places ethnic identification above national purpose, group grievance over human commonality. Correct me, but isn't that why the Civil War was fought? Isn't that why all thinking people understand: The right side won?
Brothers, sisters? The Civil War belongs, at last, not on our streets, but, please, in museums.
Six months after the South lost, Gen. Robert E. Lee wrote Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, commending him for not fleeing the Union as many others had. Lee, I am told, is still discredited north of, say, Maryland. But in this letter he embodies all that I love about an enlightened, forthright, humble, morally imaginative, self-correcting and therefore eternally necessary South:
"After the surrender of the Southern armies . . . it became in my opinion the duty of every citizen to cease opposition and place himself in a position to serve the country.
" . . . I need not tell you that true patriotism sometimes requires of men to act contrary at one period to that which it does at another, and the motive that impels them -- the desire to do right -- is precisely the same."
Shall we run that up our only flagpole? May I see a show of hands? State by state, race by race, we cannot succeed by seceding. Done that. Lost out. Started over.
Maybe our feelings do not arise from the present situation but keep repeating something that happened to us earlier. And happened, and happened.
So, South Carolina? Make the repetition a memory. Heed the orders of General Lee. On retiring from the field of battle, brave enough to weep in plain view of his men, admitting defeat while somehow maintaining his own indelible sense of human honor, he called back, "Furl the flag, boys."
It is time.
One hundred and thirty-one years late, my beloved South, it is time to say and mean this.
Let us all hold hands and, in unison, shout it very loud at last, "Appomattox. Appomattox, and amen!"

HEADLINE: New Software Speeds Multimedia Distribution

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Could this be goodbye to the World Wide Wait? The Narrative Communications Corporation, a start-up company based in Waltham, Mass., is set to begin shipping its Enliven suite of software programs today. The software permits the distribution and viewing of feature-length interactive multimedia over the Internet using ordinary phone lines.
While most existing programs for distributing multimedia require downloading the entire file, which can take 8 to 16 minutes over an ordinary phone line, Enliven downloads only a crucial set of instructions, which takes about 40 seconds, and then "streams" the file in real time. Companies currently deploying sites using Enliven technology include Sony, Broderbund, Life magazine and Ben & Jerry's. 
 "Enliven is a client-server-based solution that lets you deliver fully interactive feature-length files over ordinary networks," Hilmi Ozguc, Narrative's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. "The result is a CD-ROM-like experience over the World Wide Web with an ordinary phone line."
Enliven consists of three components, including a viewer, which can be downloaded free from the Narrative Web site (www.narrative.com) and which the Microsoft Corporation is now bundling with its Windows 95 operating system and Internet Explorer Web browser. The other components include the server, which costs $5,600 to $10,900, depending on configuration, and Producer, a programming tool for software developers, at $249.
"It works," said William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. Enliven is "breakthrough technology because it really solves one of the fundamental problems entertainment companies face with the Internet, which is the painfully slow download times," he said. CD-ROM companies "can leverage what they've done by putting it out over the Web, where they will have much broader distribution," he said.
Currently, the Enliven viewer is available only for the Windows 95 operating system, but Mr. Ozguc said a version for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system will ship early next year. In addition to programs developed with its own software, Enliven can translate any files created in the Macromedia Corporation's Director program, which is the dominant multimedia content development tool.
Narrative will also offer a multimedia hosting service for companies that will not do their own programming. Also scheduled to begin today, the service will cost $1,500 a month.
"The prices seem a little high to me, but they've got technology that works really really well," Mr. Bluestein said. "The whole Internet market is one where stuff is either expensive or free."
Founded in September 1995 by Mr. Ozguc, Scott Kliger and Allison Parker, all former software engineers with the Lotus Development Corporation, Narrative got its first round of $3 million in venture financing from Greylock Management. Enliven said it had completed its second round of financing, totaling $5.25 million, led by Accel Partners of San Francisco, with Greylock.
John Landry, formerly Lotus's senior vice president for development, is the chairman. Narrative's executive team includes Bobby Yarlagadda and Mark Schlichting, both senior executives with Living Books, the joint venture between Broderbund and Random House, and Lori Dustin, a former executive of the Data Translation Corporation.

HEADLINE: Republican Opposition to Party's Candidate Could Elect Democrat in a Texas District

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Now that the elections are almost over and Republicans have a diminished majority in the United States House of Representatives, Texas Republicans have managed to create a fracas out of what sounds like a political no-brainer: would they like to send one more Republican to Congress?
If the Republican is Dolly Madison McKenna, who favors abortion rights and who made it into a runoff election by campaigning as the candidate of the "sensible center," some conservative Republicans here say the answer is no. 
 "The last thing the Republican Party needs is this high-profile woman parading around Congress saying: 'Look! I won on a pro-choice platform," snapped Al Clements, who was chairman of the committee that wrote the state Republican Party's vigorously anti-abortion platform earlier this year.
Mr. Clements and several other anti-abortion Republicans are urging the party's voters to cast blank ballots on Tuesday when Ms. McKenna faces a freshman Democrat, Representative Ken Bentsen, for a redistricted seat in a special election that many analysts say had presented a golden opportunity for Republicans to swipe a seat from the Democrats.
For the Republicans, the intraparty feud over whether to support Ms. McKenna is a potential embarrassment that has dragged both Gov. George W. Bush and his father into the fray. Both men appeared at Ms. McKenna's side last week, urging all Republicans, whatever their feelings about abortion, to turn out for her.
"It's ridiculous, absolutely absurd," former President George Bush, now a Houston resident, said of the anti-abortion leaders' call for a boycott. "You agree on 99 percent," he said of Ms. McKenna's conservative economic message. "If that's not good enough, then too darn bad."
More than just a local squabble that represents a footnote to the November elections, the battle over Ms. McKenna casts a spotlight on the something that has troubled the Republican Party for years and could continue to do so as the party fights to keep control of Congress in 1998 and win back the White House in 2000. Should it be a "big tent," open to divergent views on social issues like abortion and gay rights, or should it solidify its conservative core by emphasizing unyielding positions on these issues?
The election on Tuesday is one of three Congressional runoffs in Texas, all in the Houston area and all forced by a sweeping redistricting ruling this summer that redrew more than a dozen Texas districts and set open elections with runoffs necessary if no candidate captured more than 50 percent of the vote.
A low voter turnout -- something that has often tended to help Republicans in special elections here -- is expected. Furthermore, the redrawing of the 25th District, where Representative Bentsen and Ms. McKenna are facing off, added some conservative neighborhoods in west Houston that could normally represent trouble for Mr. Bentsen, a moderate Democrat who emphasizes his opposition to Republican proposals for cuts in education, Medicare and environmental protection. But by abstaining on Tuesday, conservative voters could effectively re-elect him.
"My guess is that the nonparticipation and even occasional crossover from religious conservatives will probably prevent McKenna from winning," said Richard Murray, a political scientist at the University of Houston. "In that district, she needs all the Republican base, but she's going to lose some of it, and that's probably fatal."
One of the many twists attending redistricting issues, none of the three runoffs involve any of the representatives whose seats were technically at issue in the judges' ruling.
In all, three districts that the judges found to be racially gerrymandered and 10 adjacent districts were redrawn. All three representatives in the gerrymandered districts, including two black Democrats, comfortably won election in their new districts: the runoffs all involve districts with only white candidates, including one in which two Republicans are now facing each other.
In the Ninth Congressional District, which stretches from the eastern fringes of Houston south to Galveston and east to the Louisiana line, Representative Steve Stockman, one of the most outspokenly conservative freshman Republicans, is facing a vigorous challenge in his bid to keep a seat that had been held by a Democrat for 42 years. Mr. Stockman's Democratic opponent, Nick Lampson, a former county tax assessor-collector in East Texas, finished just two points behind Mr. Stockman in the November election.
And in the Eighth District, north and west of Houston, a Republican -- either State Representative Kevin Brady or Gene Fontenot, a hospital investor -- will replace a retiring Republican, Jack Fields.
Democrats hold an 18-12 edge in the Texas Congressional delegation: if they lose both of the elections in which they are fielding candidates on Tuesday, the new split will be 15-15, and they will lose control of the delegation for the first time this century.
That is just one reason why a Republican victory in the 25th District would seem to be so important for the party. But for many conservative Republicans, the venom directed at Ms. McKenna, a Houston businesswoman, is intense, and it has a history. She enraged conservatives and became something of a Joan of Arc among moderates in 1994 when she mounted a futile bid for the chairmanship of the state party.
"The Republican Party is not a church," she said at the time, drawing a loud chorus of boos from delegates to the state convention who identified themselves as religious conservatives.
She also enraged the party's right wing after her loss in the 1994 primary (to Mr. Fontenot, who then lost to Mr. Bentsen in the general election) by sending her supporters a letter that described some religious conservatives as having a "hate-filled agenda of gay bashing and intolerance that is much like the fundamentalism that has recently swept the Middle East, the neo-Nazis in Germany and now the neo-fascists in Italy."
Ms. McKenna has since said she regretted making the comments. After she got 17 percent of the vote in November and squeaked into second place, past one Democrat, a socialist and seven generally more conservative fellow Republicans, she managed to secure endorsements of varying degrees of enthusiasm from the Republicans. In doing so, Mr. Bentsen argues, she has made people question what she really stands for.
"She tried to run to the center in the first election," Mr. Bentsen, a nephew of former Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, said the other day as he campaigned at a barbecue for elderly voters in Pasadena, east of Houston. "She said she represented the so-called sensible center. You don't hear her talk about that anymore. The day after the election she went to the right and said, 'Let's make up and be friends,' and she alienated the moderates in her party by doing so."
Ms. McKenna insists she has always had the same message, but simply changed her emphasis once she made the runoff.
"My message to start with was that I was economically conservative and socially moderate," she said. "The first race was effectively to run against the other seven Republicans as being somewhat more socially moderate than they. The second half of the campaign, which I am now running, is against Bentsen, that I'm more economically conservative. So my initial message hasn't changed at all; it's just the part of it I'm using."
Ms. McKenna described differences between her and religious conservatives as "a stream" compared with the "gulf" that she says separates them from Mr. Bentsen.
But Mr. Clements, who is projects director of the Texas Right to Life Committee, said that with Republicans in control the House for the next two years, he would rather wait and run "a true Republican" against Mr. Bentsen in 1998.
"It's the old saying," he said, explaining why he and other conservative, Christian Republicans would go into the booth Tuesday and emerge with unmarked ballots. "If you vote for the lesser of two evils, you're still voting for evil."

HEADLINE: Detroit Journal;
Carolers Dent a City-Suburb Wall

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Kathy J. Tasich, a 51-year-old suburban schoolteacher in a beige overcoat, paused next to an 11th-century basalt column in Detroit's vast art museum and expressed delight with the cultural treasures she has recently discovered in the city, after years of seldom venturing downtown.
"Lately I've been coming in and it's really interesting," she said, after discussing with a friend how to find a nearby ballet performance. "You get addicted to it." 
 But Mrs. Tasich added sadly that many of the seventh and ninth graders she teaches in suburban Warren, Mich., did not understand her visits to the city. "I've heard them say, 'You don't want to go down there and get murdered,' " she said.
While many cities in the United States have acrimonious relations with their surrounding suburbs, few have histories as full of mutual mistrust as Detroit's. Bitter racial and economic disputes have long divided the city, which is three-quarters black and the nation's poorest big city, from its suburbs, which are overwhelmingly white and mostly affluent. Some suburban residents boast at cocktail parties about how many years it has been since they last entered the city.
The latest initiative to unite the city and the suburbs came on Saturday, when the city's cultural district held Noel Night. It was an evening of caroling downtown and free visits to 19 sites, including several magnificent museums and an ornate library built early in this century, when a young auto industry made this one of the nation's wealthiest cities.
After 23 years of holding Noel Night on Wednesday evenings, when few suburban residents had the time to bring their families downtown, sponsors moved the event to Saturday this year in a bid to attract more visitors from the suburbs. The result was a qualified success.
The entertainment -- choral singing at the Detroit Institute of Arts, for example, and a Russian puppet show at the Detroit Historical Museum -- was superb. But attendance was light. More suburban families showed up than in previous years but fewer office workers bothered to go downtown on a day off.
Susan T. Mosey, the executive director of the University Cultural Center Association, which sponsored the evening, said today that no attendance figures would be available for several days. She expressed satisfaction, though, that more people had brought their children. "We accomplished our goal," she said.
Roy and Diane Midgley of suburban Clarkston, Mich., were enthusiastic about the city's potential for recovery after listening to a dozen schoolgirls ring hand bells in front of two coats of medieval armor in the art museum's vaulted lobby.
"Some of the buildings that were boarded up are no longer there or have been replaced," Mrs. Midgley said. "It is coming back."
More families were across the street at the 75-year-old Detroit Public Library. Dave and Mickie Zisler of outlying Richmond, Mich., waited with their 7-year-old daughter, Emily, to hear the lines that begin, "'Twas the Night Before Christmas." Emily, sitting near a 20-foot Christmas tree under an elaborately carved, coffered wood ceiling, was awed by the classical beauty of the library's room for children.
Minutes later she listened with rapt attention to a series of stories told by Florence (Dinghy) Sharp, an area resident and great-great-granddaughter of Clement Clarke Moore, who in 1822 composed the famous tale of a visit from St. Nicholas.
While events like Noel Night may entice some suburban residents to visit the city, much still needs to be done, said Mario L. Morrow, a political consultant in the city. "Suburban folks still come into the city to work and drive home without spending much money," he said. "It's just the reverse for citizens of Detroit -- they work in the city but they find the need to shop in the suburbs" because there are no big malls in the city.
Several events in recent days have shown that some racial and political tensions have lessened but that difficulties remain. The suburban Bloomfield Hills Country Club, a bastion of auto barons, decided on Tuesday to admit its second and third black members, including Roy Roberts, a senior General Motors executive whose rejection by the club three years ago outraged city residents.
The city and the suburbs nonetheless remain suspicious of each other. Last Monday, the Detroit City Council decided to defer plans to turn the management of the city-owned art museum over to the museum's private donors. Some city residents had objected that many donors lived in the suburbs, and that the transfer of management might have allowed some museum employees to get around a requirement that municipal workers live in the city.
Yet suburban investors have gradually begun putting money back into the city since the election in 1993 of Mayor Dennis Archer, a moderate Democrat. Even Detroit's crime rate, while still high among American cities, has begun to inch down.
"I really feel secure," Mrs. Tasich said. "More than I ever did."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Light In the Darkness

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Dr. Ma Thida, a 29-year-old Burmese surgeon, is confined alone in a Rangoon cell, forbidden reading material. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1993 for "endangering public tranquillity, having contact with unlawful organizations and distributing unlawful literature." That means she supported democracy in Burma.
She is a symbol of the cruelty of Burma's military rulers, and of other oppressive regimes. Physicians for Human Rights and other groups have brought her name out of the darkness. This week Ma Thida will be among the winners of the Reebok Human Rights Award for courage in the face of tyranny. 
 Her case raises painful questions for us. Around the world now there is concern for human rights, but does it actually help the victims? How do we explain the fact that after decades of protest, inhumanity still flourishes from Burma to the Serbian sector of Bosnia?
A comprehensive world report just published by the organization Human Rights Watch underlines those doubts. Major governments talk about human rights, the report says, but they mostly put other things first -- notably what they perceive as their economic interests. But in the end the report and reflection tell us that the struggle for human rights does make a difference.
China is a heavyweight on the down side of the balance of decency. In the last year its persecution of dissenters has intensified. The great advocate of democracy Wei Jingsheng, the Sakharov of China, is serving a 14-year prison term under reportedly harsh conditions. The repression of Tibetan culture and religion has become even more vicious.
The response of most Western governments to Chinese brutality has been to change the subject. The Clinton Administration made trade and investment the prime target of its relations with Beijing. Its argument that "strategic dialogue" with China would be helpful on human rights has been mocked by growing repression.
The other signal American failure has been in the former Yugoslavia. Despite the promises of Dayton, the U.S. and its partners have allowed Croatia and the Serbian entity in Bosnia to harbor men indicted as war criminals. That failure threatens the first effort since Nuremberg to call the authors of a genocide to account.
"President Clinton would not hesitate to ask a big-city cop to risk his or her life to apprehend a murder suspect," the Human Rights Watch report said, "since that is the price to be paid for upholding the rule of law at home. But when it came to deploying law enforcement officials abroad -- in this case IFOR -- to arrest suspects in genocide and mass murder and uphold the most basic international law, he balked."
European governments failed an easier test of will in the Balkans. The Council of Europe admitted Croatia as a member last year even though President Franjo Tudjman had not carried out the Council's demand that he first cooperate in arresting war criminals, allow an opposition leader elected mayor of Zagreb to take his post and let Serbian refugees return.
Against those somber facts of the last year there are encouraging ones. South Africa is an important example. Its Truth and Reconciliation Commission has begun to expose the official murders and other horrors of the apartheid years.
But the particulars are less important than a general reality. For all the setbacks, growing awareness of the need to protect human rights has violators on the defensive. And public protest often works.
During the last year, for example, Americans became aware that some of the clothes they bought were made by children working under sorry conditions in Asia and Latin America. The outrage that resulted forced U.S. importing companies to change their sources of supply or make those sources follow decent labor practices.
Even a place as remote as Burma can feel pressure. At the end of this year the Disney Company will not have Mickey Mouse clothes made in Burma; its licensed supplier will stop manufacturing there for "strictly business reasons" -- evidently meaning the pain of a boycott. Attention may now shift to Unocal, a U.S. corporation that has invested in a huge pipeline project in Burma.
But if we want to make gains for human rights, we cannot pay mere lip service to principle as the Dayton enforcers and Council of Europe have done. We have to be serious. If we are, a world more aware of what should be can slowly turn governments toward decency and humanity.

HEADLINE: New York as Welfare Model

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki's welfare plan contains a callous proposal to cut cash benefits nearly in half for long-term recipients. But the plan also includes worthwhile features that go beyond what other states are likely to propose to soften the blow of the new Federal welfare law. The encouraging fact is that the cruel features of the Pataki plan can be removed without wrecking New York's budget, leaving a welfare system that would serve as an enviable model for other states.
The Federal law provides states fixed blocks of money to help poor families. The law will knock many legal immigrants, childless adults and disabled children off welfare, food stamps and Medicaid. It will also prohibit use of Federal money to provide a welfare family cash support for more than five years. Mr. Pataki would cut cash benefits below current levels by up to 45 percent even before the Federal five-year limit kicked in, plunging single mothers and their children into squalor. 
 But the Pataki plan also includes generous non-cash provisions, beyond what most other states are likely to offer. They would apply without a time limit to every needy family, including those cut off from Federal aid -- families that hit the five-year Federal welfare limit, childless adults and legal immigrants. The non-cash assistance, possibly in the form of vouchers, would cover food, clothing and housing. The vouchers are to be worth as much as the cash aid the state currently pays.
To encourage work, the Pataki plan would guarantee recipients who find jobs a year of Medicaid coverage and child-care assistance. It would also allow them to keep up to $13,000 a year in wages before giving up any welfare benefits. That is a startlingly high threshold, equal to the Federal poverty line. For recipients who cannot find jobs, counties would be required to create workfare or community service slots.
These are admirable promises. But they are also unrealistic, as presently written. Voucher plans are untested on a large scale. They would require an expensive assessment of each recipient's needs for individual goods, like clothing. Workfare programs for adults who have no record of steady work are notoriously difficult to implement, and might require far more money than the Pataki administration has allocated.
Fortunately, most of the problems are fixable. A quirk in the Federal welfare law will produce a $450 million-a-year windfall for New York State, at least until the next recession. Mr. Pataki would grab almost half of the windfall for general budget relief. A better idea would be to grab $80 million less, which is all that would be needed to fully reinstate the proposed benefit cuts for welfare parents. That would remove the plan's cruelty.
A second fix would eliminate the voucher program. Mr. Pataki fears that if New York pays cash to its poor, the poor in other states will flock to collect a check. This fear is understandable but overdrawn.
If, as Mr. Pataki promises, the able-bodied poor will be required to find work or take workfare and community service slots, there will be no giveaway and no huge incentive to migrate to New York. Replacing vouchers with cash will create no budget problem because, under Mr. Pataki's budget, they cost about the same amount.
Assembly Democrats need to revise other features of the Pataki plan. For example, the proposal gives local governments excessive leeway to decide what necessities to grant each poor family.
No state can afford to create a satisfactory welfare system, because no state can afford to tax itself to create a public-sector jobs program that would allow able-bodied parents to earn their way out of poverty. President Clinton proposed, then abandoned, such a plan in 1994, and the truth is that only Washington can make such a plan work. But if Mr. Pataki is willing to use just a bit more of the Federal Government's windfall funds for welfare, instead of for tax cuts, he can eliminate all of the plan's unfairness and most of its impracticality.

HEADLINE: America's Shortchanged Diplomacy

 BODY:
President Clinton, now preparing next year's budget requests, will have to fight hard to provide Madeleine Albright with adequate resources to represent America's international interests as Secretary of State. Diplomacy is America's first and least costly line of defense against international conflict. Yet for years Congress has been letting that line erode dangerously.
Expanding American business and security interests require a wider American diplomatic presence abroad than ever before. Yet, allowing for inflation, the State Department's operating budget has declined by almost 20 percent over the past five years. If shrinking foreign aid levels and America's spotty record on paying its assessments to international organizations are also taken into account, real diplomatic spending is now down to less than half what it was in 1984. 
 State's operating budget, set at $2.6 billion this year, pays for all diplomatic personnel and premises worldwide. It also covers the costs of training foreign service officers, protecting embassies and consulates and running the information systems used to screen visa applicants, verify treaty compliance and help American businesses and tourists navigate foreign legal systems and cultures.
This country's diplomatic outposts abroad play a crucial role in tracking down international terrorists and drug traffickers and negotiating for their extradition. They contribute to the monitoring of arms control, trade and environmental treaties. They also handle some two million assistance requests a year from American citizens.
With both political parties committed to balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002, all spending requests are sure to come under heavy pressure. Congress should be demanding a lean and efficient State Department operation. But it should not be compromising America's international presence or diplomatic strength. The difference between adequate and inadequate funding of the operating budget is less than $300 million a year. Congress casually added $11 billion to last year's defense budget.
It is always a great deal less expensive, in lives as well as dollars, to head off potential threats by timely diplomatic action than to move in belatedly with military force. Maintaining that capacity to preserve the peace ought to be one of Mr. Clinton's top budgetary priorities.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Safety Net Works

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Again and again during the fight over welfare we heard self-righteous, sanctimonious and often very rich politicians proclaim that anti-poverty programs hadn't worked. The programs were actually harming the poor, they said. Echoing Dickens's most unforgiving villains, they reasoned that the best approach would be to cut the poor's already meager benefits. That would build character, they said. So they cut the benefits and called it reform.
On Saturday, in his radio address, President Clinton reaffirmed his solidarity with those who believe that removing a plate of spaghetti or a bowl of rice and beans from the dinner table of a hungry child is somehow beneficial. 
 From his wobbly perch atop the tower of national virtue, the President spoke of his "moral obligation" to help the poor help themselves.
"The door has now been opened to a new era of freedom and independence," Mr. Clinton said, an apparent reference to the sense of liberation that the well-off have always associated with bare cupboards and eviction notices. He might also have mentioned the unparalleled exhilaration that comes from an empty stomach.
In any event, the message of the President and others is quite clear: It is time to take the scissors to the safety net.
From another quarter -- less cynical, more compassionate, more in touch with the real world -- comes a study that shows how important government programs continue to be in helping Americans, young and old, escape the dangerous and demoralizing grasp of poverty.
The study was done by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and its findings are not ambiguous: "Based on analysis of recently released Census Bureau data, this paper shows that Federal and state antipoverty programs have lifted millions of children and disabled and elderly people out of poverty. Many of those who remained poor were significantly less poor than they would have been without government assistance."
The study found that without such assistance, 57.6 million people would have been poor in 1995. "But when government benefits are counted, including food stamps, housing assistance, school lunch support and benefits provided through the earned-income tax credit, the number of poor people drops to 30.3 million."
Safety net programs, especially Social Security, held the poverty rate among the elderly in 1995 to 9 percent. Without them, according to the study, the poverty rate among the elderly would have been 50 percent.
Among children, means-tested programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, have the biggest effect. The study said: "The safety net programs reduced the child poverty rate from 24 percent before benefits are counted to 16 percent."
You would think such substantial bulwarks against poverty would be widely applauded. Instead, anti-poverty efforts in general are derided and the mere mention of welfare makes many Americans apoplectic.
The lead author of the study, entitled "The Safety Net Delivers," was Wendell Primus, a former Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services who left the Clinton Administration in protest last summer when the President signed a welfare bill that will result in an estimated one million children being thrown into poverty.
Mr. Primus and his co-authors took a close look at two periods of recent history: the early 1980's, when government anti-poverty benefits were substantially reduced, and the mid-80's to mid-90's, when bipartisan efforts to increase government assistance and expand the earned-income tax credit strengthened the safety net.
Recessions occurred during both periods. The study found that when government benefits are taken into account, "The number of people who were poor grew by 11 million during the recession of the early 1980's and by only 5.5 million -- just half as much -- during the recession of the early 1990's. Poverty grew far less during the most recent recession because the safety net was considerably stronger in the early 1990's."
In other words, the programs worked.
But we now have, for the poor, the toxic combination of Bill Clinton in the White House and the Republican Party in control of both houses of Congress. The next recession will provide tremendous opportunities for character-building.

HEADLINE: Nobody Reads a Good Movie These Days

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
Three French films opening this month -- Patrice Leconte's "Ridicule," Claude Chabrol's "Ceremonie,"and Andre Techine's "Voleurs" ("Thieves") -- bring to 55 the total of foreign-language films released in 1996 in New York.
Few Americans can name any of them. Fewer have gone to see them. 
 Among the most successful of this year's releases were the Dominican film "Nueba Yol" and the French films "Horseman on the Roof" and "Nellie and Monsieur Arnaud." The most successful, "Antonia's Line," took in $4.6 million. The next biggest gross belonged to "Horseman on the Roof," at $1.4 million.
But about 90 percent of the foreign-language films released the past year in New York, where most open, made less than $1 million at the box office nationally -- a cutoff point below which few distributors make money.
Foreign-language film has hit hard times since its heyday 30 years ago. In 1966, approximately 60 foreign-language films were released, and many of the titles still reverberate: "La Guerre Est Finie," by Alain Resnais; Jean-Luc Godard's "Masculine-Feminine;" Milos Forman's "Loves of a Blonde;" Claude Lelouch's "Man and a Woman;" Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Gospel According to St. Matthew," and the Czech film "The Shop on Main Street," directed by Jan Kadar and Elmar Klos.
So, did the movies get smaller? Or did the audience? Michael Barker, a co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, believes that "there are fewer European masters now."
In fact, most American distributors see a growing crisis in releasing foreign-language films. Eight years ago, Sony Pictures Classics made foreign films 60 percent of its release slate; this year, they are 40 percent.
"The art house business is really ruthless now," said Jonathan Weisgal, executive vice president at Fine Line Features. "You've got to think a thousand times before you take on a subtitled movie."
Many of this year's subtitled films never had a serious national release, which costs big distributors about $500,000 for prints and ads. Add to that approximately $200,000 to acquire a film for American distribution, and that "gives you more than three-quarters of a million into it," said Bingham Ray, a co-managing executive of another distributor, October Films. Distributors keep only half the receipts, so for them, the break-even point is usually a box office of $1.5 million
Why are foreign-language films such an albatross? Industry watchers cite three primary reasons:
*Most have little life beyond the theatrical release because there is low demand for the videos or TV rights.
*American independent movies have taken over not only the subject matter and style of foreign films, but also their audiences.
*More particularly, the explicit sexual content once uniquely associated with foreign films is not unique any more. It's no longer necessary for anyone looking for titillation in a movie theater to turn to Brigitte Bardot in " . . . And God Created Woman," a 1956 French film condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency.
The economic pull of the video market is perhaps the most pervasive force. Since foreign titles usually have minimal ad budgets, they are remembered less often when customers go to the video store.
Most foreign films never get beyond 10,000 to 15,000 copies on video, distributors say. Judith McCourt, director of research for Video Store Magazine, says the average video store dedicates 1.2 percent of its space to foreign titles.
The exceptions are movies that win the Academy Award (this year's winner, the Dutch film "Antonia's Line," has shipped 30,000 video copies), and movies like Miramax's 1995 Italian film "Il Postino" ("The Postman")," which got five Oscar nominations and has become the most successful foreign-language film ever, with $21 million at the box office. The film is expected to do very well on video. The Mexican film "Like Water for Chocolate," the second most-successful, has sold 70,000 copies to video stores.
Those numbers offer some hope. Ms. McCourt calculates that foreign video rentals made a 156 percent return on investment in 1996. By comparison all rental films produced a 143.9 percent return on investment.
Foreign films are also no longer the only source of intimate and idiosyncratic art. The sensibility that informed the French films held up as models to a generation of American film students was absorbed by those students, who are now making their own films. And the home-grown product has more appeal.
"Now Americans themselves make talky films like 'Before Sunrise,' " said Piers Handling, the director of programming for the Toronto International Film Festival, referring to a 1995 movie starring Ethan Hawke.
"Now," Mr. Baker said, "the people that went to see 'La Guerre Est Finie' are the first to see 'Lone Star,' " an American film by John Sayles.
"And it's not just the rise of the independent American cinema," said Annette Insdorf, a professor of film at Columbia. "It is also the rise of films from Australia or New Zealand." She cites "Shine," now in theaters, or the 1994 film "Once Were Warriors." "Such films provide exoticism," she said, "and we don't have to read."
Among other factors working against foreign-language films is that "college students don't have any more cinematic culture," said Serge Losique, director of the Montreal World Film Festival. "Now, it's action films and Clint Eastwood."
Peter Brunette, a professor of English and film studies at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., said: "Most people would feel funny teaching a course on Ingmar Bergman today. It seems old-fashioned -- you know, the great white European artist. Now the academic world looks at film as a function of culture."
Ellen Little, the president of First Look, which released "Antonia's Line," said: "For me it was the Brattle, off of Harvard Square. That was where every other day there was a new foreign film to see. I was there in the '60's and saw 'Woman in the Dunes.' "
But now, Alex Fitzsimmons, who works at the Brattle, said: "We don't really get students. If we show a French film, we get French people."
Less noted, but also present, is the argument that Americans are too lazy to read subtitles, and that the American media aggressively ignore foreign offerings.
Finally, whether it's a matter of choice or necessity, more and more foreign directors are making films in English -- a trend that dates back 30 years, when Francois Truffaut made "Fahrenheit 451."
In the last year, the Russian director Sergei Bodrov has talked to Hollywood producers about shooting a film in English, as well as Jan Sverak, the Czech director of "Kolya," Miramax's hope for a foreign-film smash next year. Lars von Trier made "Breaking the Waves," a recent film, in English; his last, "The Kingdom," was a four-and-a-half-hour epic about a hospital in Danish.
Are those directors abandoning their audience? Or did their audience already abandon them?

GRAPHIC: Table: "Foreign Films Profiting in the Home"
In 1995, foreign films represented only 0.75 percent of the box office take. But at the video store 5 of the top 50 films, or 10 percent, with the best return on investment between 1992 and July 1996 were foreign films. Table shows return on investment and rental income of top-grossing foreign titles. (Source: Video Store magazine)

HEADLINE: Donations to Universities Sometimes Carry a Price

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., Dec. 8

 BODY:
To the needy scholars of East Asia at the University of California campus here, the unexpected offer of a few million dollars for a new center to study ancient Chinese cultures sounded at first like a godsend.
Then they paused at the fine print: The Taiwan foundation proposing to finance the center insisted that it commemorate the foundation and its namesake, Chiang Ching-kuo, the late President of Taiwan who, long before he helped lead the island toward democracy in the 1980's, was among the Chinese Nationalist leaders who have been blamed for the repression of thousands of political dissidents. 
 The university's initial bid for the money has set off an uproar among some scholars and students who fear damage to the school's reputation, undue influence from the government-financed foundation, even a loss of access to the People's Republic of China for research and exchange programs.
The dispute, however, is of a sort that is growing painfully familiar as many of the nation's best colleges and universities turn to new sources of support in the developing world to replace the dwindling money for foreign area-studies programs that were a greater priority of the Federal government and big American foundations during the cold war.
"There's a scramble now to find new means of support for these programs," said Daniel I. Okimoto, the director of the Asia/Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, which, along with Columbia University, is also considering the Taiwan foundation's offer. "You can't raise it through tuition, so it's either private like a windfall foundation or business. In that context, the availability of funds from something like the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation looks like a windfall."
At Princeton University, the controversy this year was over the endowment of a chair in Turkish studies that some scholars feared could be used by the Government of Turkey to whitewash its role in the massacre of a million Armenians in World War I. At the University of Michigan, the furor followed another Taiwan institute's sudden withdrawal of a $450,000 grant after one of the university's scholars endorsed a document calling on the United States to give priority to Beijing in its policies in the region.
For scholars of Latin America, the problem is not so much one of taking money from government agencies or politically minded foundations, but of finding appropriate donors in a business elite that has become increasingly involved in that region's turbulent politics.
Some associates of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University have squirmed in private as a few of the powerful Latin American personages on the center's advisory committee have become enmeshed in controversy in their native countries. At some other institutes for Latin American research, professors said they have had to conduct informal background checks before even approaching foreign alumni and other potential donors abroad.
"Everybody feels their programs at risk," said Gilbert W. Merkx, who directs the Latin American Research Institute at the University of New Mexico.
"The gods are no longer smiling on us in Washington and New York, and along comes some foreign businessman who says he'll drop $1 million on a center or an endowed chair," Dr. Merkx added. "The money doesn't have to come with strings, but there is always a natural inclination to be grateful to the donor."
Polemics over the sources of foreign support for American higher education are by no means new. After World War II, the perceived villains were powerful patrons of European-studies programs who had been on or associated with the Axis side. In 1978, a furor erupted at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government over a $1 million gift in the name of an American businessman who made a fortune in mining in South Africa under the country's apartheid regime. And over the last two decades, governmental and private agencies in Japan have been especially aggressive about using grants to American colleges and universities to improve the perceptions and understanding of their country in the United States.
Part of what has shifted of late has been the areas of the world that are the hottest subjects of international studies in the United States; Asia and Latin America, in particular, are riding a new boom in popularity fueled by both their importance in the global economy and the rising number of American students who trace their roots to those regions.
As the economic ties of those areas to the United States have deepened, academic experts said, businessmen and others from countries like South Korea, Singapore and Mexico have also had a greater ability and incentive to turn to American educational institutions in order to extend their influence here.
The universities, for their part, have looked to the same sort of upwardly mobile alumni, government agencies and influential foundations that have dotted their campuses with shiny new buildings and plush endowed professorships in the past. But now, university officials said, a growing number of those alumni might be prominent business and political figures abroad. And they, like the governments and foundations, have often found themselves coming under greater political scrutiny in the United States.
Programs in Korean studies have been a notable case in point.
After struggling for years in relative penury, such programs found an important new source of help in the early 1990's. The Korea Foundation, a creation of the South Korean government, began spending millions of dollars to expand academic programs, endow professorships and sponsor conferences in the United States. But what the Koreans who dole out the grants might be seeking in return has become a question of growing controversy.
"These are not academic organizations," said Chalmers Johnson, an emeritus professor of political science at Berkeley who formerly headed the university's Center for Chinese Studies. "They are out to get over a point of view. They are paying to win support for their government."
The Korea Foundation has drawn American criticism, among other reasons, because of its steadfast refusal to follow the Japan Foundation's lead and establish a process by which grant requests are reviewed by a panel of scholars in the United States.
Instead, decisions are made by a board controlled by South Korean businessmen tied to the government, and the new head of the foundation, Joung won Kim, is a former senior official of the government's intelligence agency.
Academic experts trace the struggle to finance area-studies programs and centers to cuts and changes that both the government and private foundations have made over the last decade or so. While the overall contribution of major foundations to international studies may not have fallen, foundation officials said much of that money has been channeled away from traditional area-studies programs to research that is more thematically oriented, examines problems in a comparative perspective, or emphasizes issues of American policy.
"We are still concerned with the study of foreign cultures, but we are doing it in a different way than we did before," said Richard Ekman, secretary of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York. "We made a judgment in the late 1980's that it was no longer possible to fund every area-studies program. Relative to other areas, there are more foreign sources available to East Asian studies programs, and our funding can be more effective elsewhere."
Although the Mellon Foundation and some others have placed a greater emphasis on Latin America since the 1980's, administrators of some of the most prestigious academic programs on the region said their competition for resources has grown steadily more intense. And even Harvard's Rockefeller Center, with its relatively spectacular success in trying to build a $30 million endowment, has highlighted the delicacy of looking abroad for help.
One of the 34 members of the center's advisory committee, a powerful industrialist from Colombia, has been in the news lately as a pillar of support for that country's embattled President, Ernesto Samper, following accusations by Colombian and American officials that Mr. Samper took millions of dollars from the Cali cocaine cartel. Other committee members are politically connected Mexican businessmen who have been criticized at home for their ties to that country's widely attacked former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Just as Harvard and Yale and other American universities have for the most part relished their ties to the political and business elite in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the University of California at Berkeley has cherished the strength of ties to Taiwan's ruling class.
The island's first elected Governor, James Soong, who is on the board of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange, won the university's highest award for foreign alumni last year. But as the commotion continued this week over the foundation's offer, the university's Taiwan-educated chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, was back in Taipei on what several faculty members described as something of a damage-control mission. Through an assistant, Chancellor Tien declined to comment.
The director of the foundation's North American office in McLean, Va., Hsingwei Lee, said that while it was founded in 1989 with government as well as private money, it has never applied political criteria in dispensing the roughly $23 million it has spent on American scholarship.
The head of the University of California's Center for Chinese Studies, Wen-hsin Yeh, said faculty members had put aside their draft proposal for the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation's money while they discussed the question more fully. But like her counterparts at Columbia and Stanford, she also argued that the uproar over the offer had little to do with how the foundation had spent its money, and seemed to have been stoked as much as anything by the controversy over Asian fund raising for the Democratic Party.
The director of the East Asian Institute at Columbia, Madeline Zelin, said the university would in principle have no problem naming a center or program after the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation.
But that issue may be more sensitive in the San Francisco Bay area, where a Chinese-American journalist, Henry Yi Liu, was murdered in 1984 on orders from Mr. Chiang's military intelligence chief after writing critically of the Taiwan leader.
"It seems to me that it's very simple and very straightforward," Professor Yeh said. "We have our own ideas about the kind of research we want to do. We write up the proposal in ways that make us happy and we submit it."

Unusual Criticism of Fed From Senate G.O.P. Leader
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said that he was "a little bit nervous about the degree of independence" enjoyed by the Federal Reserve, and that the central bank should push interest rates lower to stimulate growth.
Mr. Lott's statements were an unusually direct criticism of the Fed from a senior party leader. [Page D2.]
 
Mixed Signs on Airline Safety
As Death Toll Sets a Record
With three weeks to go in 1996, more passengers have died in airline crashes this year than in any other, even though statistics show that air travel is becoming safer over time. But the high death toll is in part a result of the rapid increase in the number of flights worldwide. Still, perceptions of increased risk have officials moving along a number of fronts to improve aviation safety. [A1.]
 
A lack of proficiency in English among air traffic controllers and pilots has been cited in several recent crashes. [A1.]

Quo Vadis, Foreign Film?
Foreign-language film has hit hard times in the United States since its heyday 30 years ago. About 90 percent of the foreign-language films released in New York in the last year made less than $1 million at the American box office, the point below which it is hard for a distributor to make money. [D9.]
 
'Happy Days' Are Here Again

HEADLINE: A Chip Maker With Hungry Eyes For Your Toaster;
SGS-Thomson Carves Niche Outside the Computer World

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: CROLLES, France

 BODY:
From the standpoint of aeronautical design, seagulls should not be able to fly, Pasquale Pistorio likes to say, when urging his workers to greater achievement. Fortunately, he adds with a characteristic chuckle, the seagulls don't know it.
Yes, the French make good wines and cheese, and the Italians may be among the leading arbiters of the world's fashion tastes. But Franco-Italian semiconductors? Leave chips to real industrialists, like the Japanese or Americans. 
 Mr. Pistorio, the portly, mustachioed president and chief executive of SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, begs to disagree. In recent years, the 60-year-old executive has forged SGS-Thomson, a company of French and Italian pedigree, into one of the world's most diversified and innovative makers of semiconductors.
Although not even in the top 10 of the world's semiconductor companies as ranked by revenue, SGS-Thomson has carved out a lucrative niche as the leading producer of analog chips, with a big research center here on the edge of this French Alpine city.
Unlike digital chips, which process information that can be expressed only as the 1's and O's of computer code, analog chips can monitor real-world conditions like movement, temperature and sound and convert them into analogous electronic or mechanical patterns. And these patterns can instruct devices or machines to take action.
If you drive a Chrysler, you're surrounded by four or five of Mr. Pistorio's chips, which help the engine purr and soften the sway of steep curves. If you use a hand-held phone from Northern Telecom, you're holding one or two as well, helping transform voice into electrical signals or back again.
"Some of the things we do are banalities, but the difference is in execution," Mr. Pistorio said in a recent conversation over pasta and fish at an SGS-Thomson plant outside Milan.
Formed from the 1987 merger of Italy's SGS Microelettronica and Thomson Semiconducteurs of France, SGS now has 17 factories in 8 countries, including the United States (in Carrollton, Tex., Phoenix, and Rancho Bernardo, Calif.). Investing roughly $1 billion a year in new products and factories, the company maintains a balance between sales of commodity chips -- simple low-cost circuits that enter unaltered into a vast array of products -- and costlier customized chips. The custom chips are produced in close alliance with the companies that use them to make things like mobile phones, satellite television receivers and cars.
This balanced product line has enabled SGS largely to insulate itself against the cyclical swings of the semiconductor market. While more narrowly focused competitors were battered by the recent sales slump in semiconductors, SGS increased earnings in the first nine months of this year by 35 percent, to $483.5 million.
To accelerate the momentum, SGS raised $1.3 billion of fresh capital through two additional offerings of stock in the last two years, and has become the darling of Wall Street, where investment advisers search frantically for slump-resistant high technology stocks. [The shares closed Friday at $67.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, just off the 52-week high reached three days earlier -- and more than double their value this time last year.]
"This company outperformed by a tremendous margin," said William J. Milton Jr., who follows SGS for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York, which ranks SGS outperform/buy. While global sales of semiconductors are expected to drop 10.5 percent this year to $129 billion, he noted, the outlook is for SGS to increase revenues by almost 19 percent.
Yet the going is risky for SGS, whose forecasted $4.1 billion of revenues this year will rank it only 12th among global chip makers. For a relatively small company like SGS, the danger in trying to be strong in a variety of microchip types is that it will spread itself too thin, and fail to keep pace with specialist companies that rely on one or a few types of semiconductors for their growth.
Take mixed-signal technology, for instance -- semiconductors capable of such tasks as storing speech or images on chips. In this field, SGS runs up against not only specialists like Symbios Logic, a unit of Hyundai Electronics Industry, in the United States and Alcatel Mietec of France, a unit of Alcatel Alsthom, but also big, broad-based manufacturers like Texas Instruments and AT&T.
"With so many products spread so thin," Mr. Milton said, "maybe you don't spot and develop growth markets."
So far, though, that has not been a problem, thanks to a strategy Mr. Pistorio has consistently followed since 1987. It was then, as chief executive of Microelettronica, that he engineered the merger of his company with Thomson after recognizing how well the two organizations and product lines might fit together.
Microelettronica was strong in smart power chips used for, say, running several electrical motors at once, while Thomson was a leader in mixed-signal technology. Microelettronica, moreover, was strong in telecommunications chips, while Thomson's semiconductors were well known in consumer products like televisions and video recorders. And Microelettronica had a toehold in Asia through a factory in Singapore, while Thomson was active in the United States, thanks to its acquisition in 1985 of Mostek, an American company specializing in memory chips.
But each company was also saddled with an array of small, inefficient factories and bloated purchasing and logistics divisions. So within a year of the merger, Mr. Pistorio closed five plants -- three in France and two in East Asia -- integrated all sales offices worldwide, and shed 2,000 jobs, to less than 21,000. (Profitable growth has allowed the work force to expand to 25,500 today.)
Mr. Pistorio's best-placed strategic bet was to develop SGS-Thomson's expertise in analog chips. Rather than losing ground in recent years against digital circuitry, analog is actually gaining, as the applications for chips multiply in industrial and consumer products from trucks to toasters.
Traditionally, analog and digital functions were handled by separate chips, but as applications for chips blossomed, an immense market has emerged for mixed-signal integrated circuits that combine both functions: thinking like a computer, but also performing analog functions like controlling the speed of electrical motors or producing sound. Crucial for such applications are so-called smart-power circuits, which can perform several such functions at once.
SGS's forerunner companies both pioneered these technologies. But Mr. Pistorio recalls that both organizations tended to be "satisfied when a prototype came out," but seemed to consider it "undignified" to actually manufacture and sell chips.
He quickly recalibrated the priorities. And while the newly merged venture lost $68 million in 1988, the following year it managed a $3 million profit and has seen profits grow steadily since.
Raised in Sicily, the son of a government employee, Mr. Pistorio was trained as an electrical engineer. Yet his real skill always seemed to lay in persuasion. As a student at Turin's Technical University, he spent many hours working as a substitute high school teacher, honing a gift for motivating people. Then, after getting his degree in electrical engineering, he joined the Italian distributor for Motorola Semiconductors, before moving into sales at Motorola itself, eventually making his way to the United States.
In 1980, at the age of 44, Mr. Pistorio was general manager of Motorola Semiconductors' Phoenix-based international operations when he was tapped by Stet, the Italian telecommunications group, to bail out its unprofitable semiconductor subsidiary, Microelettronica.
To this day, executives involved in hiring Mr. Pistorio puzzle at how he succeeded in applying tough American management rules in what was essentially a flabby and protected government-run business.
"He threw himself against the windmills, went with his head against the wall," said Umberto Silvestri, the president of Telecom Italia, Italy's national telecommunications group, who at the time was running Stet.
Mr. Pistorio also brought with him a keen analysis of the semiconductor business that many say has not altered over the years. Jean-Philippe Dauvin, SGS's chief economist, sums up his boss's strategy as, "low-cost development and global distribution."
To achieve the first, Mr. Dauvin says, Mr. Pistorio assiduously sought long-term alliances with companies that were potential consumers of chips -- makers of computer peripherals, like the Silicon Valley disk drive manufacturer Seagate Technologies, telecommunications giants like Northern Telecom of Canada and Nokia of Finland, and makers and users of auto parts like Bosch of Germany or the Chrysler Corporation.
The alliance with Northern Telecom is typical.
In 1993, as part of a plan to move away from cumbersome vertical integration, Northern Telecom sought a partner to take some of its semiconductor operations off its hands, at the same time sharing the cost of new microchip development for its products. In a subsequent agreement, Northern Telecom agreed to sell to SGS a semiconductor factory in San Diego, thereby affording the chip maker a chance to increase its presence in the United States, while both companies would share the cost of developing new silicon technology for the chips Northern Telecom required.
Peter Scovell, the vice president of Northern Telecom's advanced components division, said the alliance produced live card circuits for digital phone switching systems and is now focused on developing bipolar technology used in very high frequency mobile phone systems.
But can a company the modest size of SGS keep up against the giants of the industry, big manufacturers like Intel and NEC, which are many times its size?
Among the world's semiconductor manufacturers, SGS is now lodged in a second tier of companies whose global market shares average about 2 percent each. To succeed, SGS sees itself needing the revenue growth that will move the company into the top 10 club with giants like Motorola and Texas Instruments, with market shares averaging about 5.5 percent.
Mr. Pistorio said that SGS must continue to specialize in a broad range of semiconductor technologies, based on strategic alliances.
But, he added, with a logic that even a seagull might understand, "If you want to be a specialist, you must be big."

Chart: "A Big Business From Tiny Transistors"
SGS-Thomson's diversified semiconductor business includes being the world's largest producer of analog chips, which are used in a variety of automotive, industrial and consumer products. Unlike digital chips, which process information that can be expressed only as the 1's and 0's of computer code, analog chips can translate real-world conditions -- like motion, sound, temperature, pressure and light -- into analogous electronic or mechanical patterns. These patterns can instruct devices to perform tasks like the following:
 
MOTION -- Anitlock brakes
INPUT Driver presses on the brake pedal.
WHAT THE CHIP DOES The chip monitors the wheels and prevents the brakes from locking.
RESULT The car stops without skidding.
 
SOUND -- Telephones
INPUT Someone speaks into the phone.
WHAT THE CHIP DOES The chip converts sound from an analog signal to a digital one -- then back again on the other end.
RESULT Electronic signal mimics sound waves in phone receiver.
 
TEMPERATURE -- Coffee maker
INPUT Coffee is brewed.
WHAT THE CHIP DOES The chip measures the temperature of the coffee as water evaporates and the remaining coffee heats up.
RESULT Coffee maker turns off before the pot burns.
 
PRESSURE -- Computer joystick
INPUT A joystick directs a character to move.
WHAT THE CHIP DOES The analog chip measures the pressure against the joystick, which is converted to a digital command in the game.
RESULT On-screen character makes a hard or soft turn, depending on the pressure.
 
LIGHT -- Robot on an assembly line
INPUT An assembly-line robot examines the products.
WHAT THE CHIP DOES Sensors detect a flaw, a bad weave in textile for example, and translate this to an analog signal light.
RESULT A warning light alerts human operators. (Source: SGS-Thomson)

HEADLINE: Republican Senate Chief Questions the Fed

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said today that he was "a little bit nervous about the degree of independence" enjoyed by the Federal Reserve, and that the central bank should push interest rates lower to stimulate more economic growth.
Mr. Lott's statements were an unusually direct criticism of the Fed from a senior political leader of either party, and a sharp departure from usual Republican support for the tough anti-inflation policies followed by the central bank under its chairman for the last nine years, Alan Greenspan. 
 The Senator's comments could stimulate further debate about the Federal Reserve's role, coming a few days after Mr. Greenspan raised questions in a speech here about whether stock levels had gotten too high. Reports of the speech sent international markets down sharply.
It is doubtful that Mr. Lott's comments reflect a changed consensus among Republicans about Mr. Greenspan's conduct of monetary policy. But they suggested that the Fed might not be able to take for granted the broad-based political support it has had in recent years, especially if signs of incipient inflation force it to raise rates at a time growth is less than robust.
Mr. Lott, though known as a pragmatist, has been closely identified with his party's tax-cutting camp, which argues that the economy is capable of faster growth without inflation if taxes and regulation are reduced. Yet Republican tax cutters have steered clear of openly criticizing the Federal Reserve, and one of Mr. Lott's closest Republican colleagues, Senator Connie Mack of Florida, has introduced a bill to grant the Fed additional protection from political interference by requiring that the central bank's only mandate be to pursue price stability.
Mr. Lott's remarks were made on the television interview program "Fox News Sunday."
He was first asked about Mr. Greenspan's suggestion in a speech on Thursday night that financial markets sometimes succumb to "irrational exuberance," a phrase that sent stocks falling sharply on Friday in markets in Asia, Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States.
"Yeah, that rattles people," Senator Lott replied. He was then asked if it scared him that one man had so much power.
"You know, I've always been a little nervous about the Fed, quite frankly," he said. "I try not to be a Fed-basher, but I sometimes think they focus too much on one side of the equation rather than the broader basket of things," he continued, apparently referring to the Fed's policy of concentrating on low inflation rather than on using interest rates to spur growth and employment.
"And I'm a little nervous about the degree of independence they have," Mr. Lott said. "But at the same time, I realize that's very important. Now I guess I'm, you know, tiptoeing around here."
Asked if he was saying that he was scared but did not know what to do about it, he replied: "Well, yeah. I don't want to bash them, and I think that over all they've done a pretty good job. I mean, you can't complain too much about the last few years in terms of interest rates. I think that interest rates should be lower even than what they are, certainly."
Mr. Lott went on to say that the Fed makes mistakes "like we do," and that Mr. Greenspan probably wished that he had "chosen some other words" when he talked about market valuations last week.
Earlier in the program, the Senator called the economy's growth, which has been running at 2 percent to 2.5 percent in recent years, "anemic," and warned there were signs that it could slip lower.
In addition to calling for lower interest rates, Mr. Lott reiterated his support for cutting the capital gains tax.
The economy has substantially slowed in the last five months, and there are few signals that inflation is building. Economists are divided whether growth might accelerate, leaving the Federal Reserve to consider if a rate increase is needed, or the economy is in danger of stalling, requiring a rate cut to energize it.
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, said today that he interpreted Mr. Greenspan's remarks "as simply raising a question -- not suggesting an answer" about whether stock prices had become too high.
Mr. Rubin, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," would not say if he thought the market was overvalued, urging investors to make decisions based on economic fundamentals.
He also reiterated the Administration's position that it would consider changing the way the Government adjusts Social Security and other benefit programs for inflation if there were a broad consensus on the matter.
A panel of economists appointed by Congress reported last week that the Consumer Price Index overstates increases in the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points, resulting in billions of dollars a year in excessive benefit payments.
Mr. Rubin said there was general agreement that the index was an imperfect gauge of inflation, but he declined to endorse the 1.1-point figure, saying that the matter needed more study.

HEADLINE: U.S. Negotiating Information Technology Pact

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 8

 BODY:
United States officials pushed to negotiate final language for a global pact today that would eliminate tariffs on information technology, an accord that they hoped would be the crowning achievement of the World Trade Organization's first high-level meeting this week.
American and European Union officials met on the eve of the five-day trade meeting to thrash out differences that remain on the Information Technology Agreement, which would eliminate tariffs on a wide range of computer and telecommunications technology by the year 2000. 
 "We are making some very important progress," the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said. But she declined to say whether a deal is near.
Officials on both sides said that a series of discussions would be held this week in hopes of reaching a deal. Trade officials from 128 nations are to meet here beginning Monday.
 [In Singapore Monday, officials of the European Union accused American companies including Corning Inc. and the Xerox Corporation of hampering the information technology trade agreement by seeking exemptions for their products, Bloomberg Business News reported.]
Ms. Barshefsky expressed concern about Europe's commitment to the agreement. She said that there were indications the Europeans felt completion of the agreement hinged upon an acceptable final declaration by the W.T.O. ministers at the end of this week's meeting. She said she saw no linkage between the agreement and the W.T.O. declaration.
United States negotiators say that they want a broad agreement covering a wide range of products, estimated to be worth up to $1 trillion a year in world trade.
But they want to exclude fiber optics, graphic display tubes, photocopiers and capacitors -- components used in electronic goods. The Europeans have balked at those exclusions, but feel a deal can be done.
"We both hope this is going to be a really concrete thing, a nugget, if not finally agreed, then laid out to be agreed later," said a European Union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
A Rematch in New Orleans; An Alliance Snub for B.Y.U.

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
His team had won a conference championship game on Saturday, Brigham Young University's 13th victory in a season that was soon to become a bitter disappointment. Yesterday, LaVell Edwards sat in a control room at CBS, listening to other coaches talking about the major bowl bids. When the official announcements were complete and the six spots in the bowl alliance had been filled without B.Y.U., Edwards removed the microphone he had worn just in case, flipped it on a console and leaned back in a chair.
And as representatives from other schools accepted congratulations, Edwards listened to condolences for a 13-1 season. 
 "It's just obvious that rankings don't mean anything," Edwards said after 10-2 Penn State and 10-2 Nebraska, teams ranked beneath B.Y.U. in the two polls used by alliance officials, had received the two available at-large bids and B.Y.U. was left with a berth in the less prestigious Cotton Bowl against 9-2 Kansas State.
"What criteria they set up, obviously they can still go ahead and do what they think is right, which is fine," Edwards said. "But obviously you're very disappointed. It's very tough when you're in the Western Athletic Conference, I guess. We're not part of the alliance. It's pretty tough to crash the party."
Actually, there were no surprises yesterday when the Sugar, Fiesta and Orange Bowls formalized their picks, just an increasing frustration that extended beyond Edwards.
The Sugar Bowl, the game that alliance officials had hoped would match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams, produced a rematch between Florida State and Florida that did not reach the stated goal.
The Seminoles and the Gators were the two top-ranked teams when they met on Nov. 30. Florida State moved into the No. 1 position after narrowly defeating Florida, while the Gators are currently in the No. 3 position behind undefeated Arizona State, which will play Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.
As a result, for the second time in three years the two major undefeated teams in the country will not meet on the field to decide the national championship. In 1994, Penn State went unbeaten right through the Rose Bowl but lost out to Nebraska in the polls. Now the same fate almost certainly awaits Arizona State if it wins the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 only to see Florida State beat Florida, again, the next night in New Orleans.
Two seasons from now, when the Big Ten, Pacific-10 and Rose Bowl join the alliance, a Florida State-Arizona State game would become a possibility. But that's then. The Cornhuskers, the two-time defending national champions, would have been Florida State's intriguing opponent in this year's Sugar Bowl had they not suffered a shocking loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 championship on Saturday. Still, the process was kinder to Nebraska than it was to B.Y.U. yesterday.
The Sugar, Orange and Fiesta Bowls, the three games currently included in the alliance, fill the six berths with champions of the Big East, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, and two at-large teams. The Sugar Bowl, picking first and second, took Florida and Florida State.
The Fiesta Bowl, choosing third, picked Penn State. The Orange Bowl used the fourth pick to take Nebraska. The Fiesta then chose 8-4 Texas, leaving Virginia Tech of the Big East to face the Cornhuskers in Miami.
In the New York Times computer ranking, Nebraska's loss to Texas dropped the Cornhuskers from first to fourth, still ahead of B.Y.U. (7) as well as Penn State (10). But in the Associated Press media poll and the CNN/USA Today poll of coaches, B.Y.U. was ranked fifth, ahead of Nebraska (6) and Penn State (7).
Texas, which earned the Big 12 bid with its victory, was 16th in the Times's ranking and 20th in the two polls. The complexity, and questionable credibility, of the bowl selection process can also be found in the fact that Notre Dame, which is not even going to a bowl in an 8-3 season with two overtime defeats, is ahead of Texas by all three measures -- 13th in the Times's ranking and 18th in each of the two polls -- and defeated the Longhorns at Austin on Sept. 21.
Roy Kramer, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference and the coordinator of the alliance, said that rankings are the major determination only in the attempt to create a championship game. "The rest of it," Kramer said, "is a continuation of the bowl process as we know it."
John Junker, the executive director of the Fiesta Bowl, said its choice of Penn State was based on the need to have what he called an anchor team to build a marketing effort around.
"The anchor team is the team that simply does the most for you all up and down the board," Junker said. "TV ratings. Fans. Tradition. Attention. Marquee value of players or coaches. It's whoever addresses the most needs that you have. And we looked and looked and looked, and worked very hard on it.
"We seriously considered Brigham Young. They have a fine program, fine team, tremendous coach.
"We made that pick of Penn State not knowing what other bowls would do. We didn't have discussions as to would they take this or that. We made that pick based on our anchor to fill our most needs. When the Orange Bowl selected Nebraska they closed the door to other at-large teams."
The snubbing of B.Y.U. had been anticipated by the presidents of the W.A.C. schools. Rondo Fehlberg, B.Y.U.'s athletic director, said last night that the presidents held a conference call last week in which they decided they would not initiate legal action against the alliance during the current bowl season but might consider it as an option at a future date. As it stands, B.Y.U. will be going to its first-ever Jan. 1 bowl.
Edwards, meanwhile, said he was not involved in any discussions with alliance officials. But when asked for a possible explanation for his team's absence from an $8.486 million game (the Cotton Bowl has a projected payout of $2 million), the coach brought up the perception that B.Y.U.'s Mormon fans would spend less than other fans.
"I don't know," Edwards said quietly. "I guess the image thing. I don't know."
Keith Tribble, the executive director of the Orange Bowl, laughed quietly when the issue was raised in a conference call. "That was not something that was on our priority list," he said when asked about the economic issue.
"We've got a great following," Edwards said. "We'd bring a great crowd. But . . ."
He did not finish the sentence. Arrangements were being made, and someone else's trips to an alliance bowl were taking shape.

SEATTLE, Dec. 8 (AP) -- Spurned by the Cotton Bowl, the Washington Huskies (9-2) today accepted an invitation to play Colorado (9-2) in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 30 in San Diego.
It will be the first appearance of a Pacific-10 team in the Holiday Bowl since 1985, when Arizona State lost to Arkansas, 18-17.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Plans 300% Increase in Spending for Basic Research in 1997

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Defying a trend away from unfettered corporate scientific research, the Microsoft Corporation plans to increase spending for basic research by 300 percent in 1997.
The increase, which will create the world's largest computer science laboratory within the next two years, comes at a time when other computer research giants notably Bell Laboratories, are generally cutting back on fundamental research and focusing more on practical, product-oriented projects. 
 Microsoft is making the basic research investment, which could run as high as $330 million during the next five years, at least in part to make a symbolic statement about its executives' concern about changing national scientific research priorities.
The executives view as short-sighted moves to shrink corporate research budgets and to aim Government financing at projects that offer an immediate payoff.
"I think this is a disastrous mistake," Nathan Myhrvold, the company's chief technology officer, said in an interview over the weekend. "We disagree with many of these national trends and we're putting our money where our mouth is."
Microsoft, which is based here, is a relative latecomer to basic scientific research. Although it is the world's largest software company and it now spends $1.4 billion annually on research and development activities, the company set up Microsoft Research only five years ago to pursue general computer science problems.
But the organization, which now has 170 scientists, has been rapidly gaining credibility within the industry as Microsoft has hired some leading researchers. Well-known scientists who have joined Microsoft recently include two leading computer designers, Gordon Bell and Butler Lampson, as well as some of the nation's best-known computer graphics researchers, Jim Blinn, Jim Kajiya and Alvy Ray Smith.
Microsoft Research now has a dozen research groups focusing on areas ranging from speech technology to computer vision and decision theory.
Mr. Myhrvold said he planned to increase rapidly the number of scientists working at the laboratory to 450 or 500 and to broaden the group's research focus.
"It makes sense for us to do stuff that is quite far out," he said. Microsoft will now begin financing work in which there are few obvious immediate paybacks, a decision that runs counter to the national trend.
At Bell Labs, for example, scientists say that a fundamental shift has occurred toward more applied research and away from fundamental research. Bell Labs is part of Lucent Technologies, the spinoff from the AT&T Corporation.
On the Federal level, financing for basic research has grown only marginally through the 1995 fiscal year, and, after accounting for inflation, it has essentially stagnated, according to figures from the National Science Foundation. And Mr. Myhrvold said the Government and corporate researchers faced rising restrictions on their work in an era of tighter budgets and stiffer competition.
Arguing against this trend, he pointed to the benefits that flowed from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which, beginning in the 1960's, permitted researchers wide latitude to pursue their interests.
In particular, he said that Microsoft would now begin research efforts aimed at fundamentally reinventing entire components of the computer industry.
He cited work that was begun at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970's as a model of the kind of risk that corporations should be willing to take and criticized those who have said that the Xerox effort was a failure because the copier maker stumbled in its effort to break into the computer industry.
Xerox spent a decade developing technologies like desktop personal computers, advanced computer interfaces and office networks in an era when computers were large devices shared by entire organizations.
"People forget that Xerox also invented the laser printer" at the Palo Alto center, he said.
By extending the research vision of the company outward on projects that might not have an impact for a decade or even longer, Mr. Myhrvold acknowledged, the payoff might actually go to other companies besides Microsoft.
"Some of our good ideas will be stolen, but we will learn in the process," he said.
Mr. Myhrvold said that he was opposed to the view that only incremental changes could occur as a result of working in areas that were not directly linked to products. "I believe in revolutionary research," he said.
The decision to increase basic research spending, which has actually lagged behind Microsoft's overall growth in recent years, was made over the last several months in discussions between Mr. Myhrvold and William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and founder.
A number of the software giant's competitors said they applauded the decision to increase spending and said it would have a positive impact both inside and outside the computer industry. The real challenge Microsoft will face, they said, is getting its divisions to accept innovations that might threaten vested interests and established product lines.
"The real trouble with doing radical research is to get it accepted in your organization," John Seeley Brown, director of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, said. "If you have to wait for the chairman to support something, it's a fundamental restraint."
Mr. Myhrvold, however, insists that the increase in spending will be beneficial. A 37-year-old physicist who once studied with the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, Mr. Myhrvold is a good representative of the more wide open research style he said he wanted Microsoft to foster. He said he had recently developed an interest in paleontology and had written a research paper focusing on the mating rituals of sauropods, giant dinosuars.
By examining fossil evidence and creating a computer simulation, he said, he was able to discover that male sauropods used their tails as whips, accelerating the tip of the tail to speeds exceeding the speed of sound. The resulting sonic boom would have been several hundred decibels, he said, and would have been heard for miles.
How this fact would be related to the giant dinosaurs' mating habits -- or to the future of computing -- is not clear. Which, basically, is the point. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 12, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about plans by the Microsoft Corporation to increase spending for basic research misstated the extent of the planned expansion. It will not create the world's largest computer science laboratory; I.B.M., with 1,100 people working on basic research, has the largest one.

HEADLINE: Are the French Determined to Oppose U.S.?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Price of Dumping Boutros-Ghali" (Op-Ed, Dec. 3), William Shawcross expressed the view that the manner in which the United States opposed the reappointment of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations made it "inevitable" that the world would react against it. But, he said, it was "less predictable" that "the French would so gleefully and irresponsibly use the issue to embarrass the United States."
French attempts to embarrass the United States are not that unpredictable. For France, opposing the United States seems to be an almost knee-jerk reaction. 
 When I headed the United States delegation to negotiations on a treaty on terrorism on the high seas, proposed by Austria, Egypt and Italy after the seizure of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, I suggested adding the state of nationality of the victim to the two bases of jurisdiction already in the draft (the state of nationality of the offender and the flag state).
I explained that even though nationality of the victim was not widely accepted as a basis of jurisdiction, insofar as terrorist offenses were concerned, the state of nationality of the offender often encouraged or at least condoned the act, and the flag state, given the wide use of flags of convenience, might be a small state, unable or unwilling to prosecute for economic or political reasons. But the state of nationality of the victim had a strong interest in prosecuting because the victim in terrorist acts was often picked because he was a national of that state. I argued that since United States nationals had been killed in terrorist attacks precisely because they were Americans, the United States considered it important to include nationality of the victim as a basis of jurisdiction.
My suggestion was rejected by the French delegate with the sarcastic comment: "You Americans want to control the world. Just because an American is killed, you want the right to try the offender."
Fortunately, I remembered that I had seen in the casebook I used to teach international law a note that France had adopted a law several years earlier giving French courts jurisdiction to try anyone who killed a Frenchman anywhere, far broader than the jurisdiction limited to terrorism that I was suggesting.
After I handed him a copy of that law the following day, he withdrew his objection to the inclusion of jurisdiction based on the victim's nationality.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Registers a Recovery, Along With the Stock Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the Japanese yen and the German mark, recovering along with American stocks as traders concluded that the selloff on Friday was overdone.
The climb by the dollar put it ahead of levels reached before Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made remarks on Thursday night questioning whether central bankers should be concerned about the dizzying height that stock prices have reached. 
 The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, on Sunday played down Mr. Greenspan's statements, which some had taken as a sign that the central bank might raise interest rates to squeeze out speculation from stock markets. Yesterday, traders were nudged further away from Friday's frantic selling by comments from British and German central bankers, who suggested that the markets had overreacted.
"It was a one-day knee jerk," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange in the New York office of the Bank of Montreal. "There's not a chance the Fed will raise rates to take the air out of the stock market."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 113.51 Japanese yen, up from 112.89 late on Friday. The dollar was changing hands at 1.5575 German marks, up from 1.5463.
Both Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank, said in Basel, Switzerland, that markets had gone down too far Friday in response to Mr. Greenspan's speech. The two spoke before a meeting yesterday of central bankers.
In his speech, Mr. Greenspan questioned whether stock prices had run up too high, creating a speculative bubble.
"It took a couple days to digest his remarks; once digested, the market has reverted back to its bullish mode," Mr. Benfer said.
Analysts said the foreign exchange market was also moving back to its assumptions that European governments want the Continent's currencies to trade weaker against the dollar. Traders are coming to believe that European governments want a higher dollar to protect their exports as they near a monetary union.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Cheering predictions of increased and sustained growth.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TWO forecasters are presenting holiday gifts to Madison Avenue: twin predictions of sustained -- as well as sustainable -- growth in advertising spending for 1997 and the rest of the decade.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A. in New York, and John Perriss, chairman of Zenith Media Worldwide in London, offered their tidings of comfort and joy at the opening session of the 24th annual Paine Webber Media Conference. The conference began yesterday morning in midtown Manhattan and continues through Friday. 
 "I don't think the recovery is going to end in just three years," said Mr. Coen of McCann, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, referring to the rebound in ad spending that began in 1993. "We've got some more to go."
And Mr. Perriss of Zenith, owned by Cordiant P.L.C., said: "Our outlook is a pretty positive one as well, I'm pleased to say. No one is signaling to us that there is any sudden, horrid slowdown, as we saw in the early 90's."
The optimistic attitudes of Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss are significant because their forecasts, which they issue every June and December, are closely followed. Although Mr. Coen's predictions tend to be a tad rosier than Mr. Perriss's, both executives agreed yesterday that marketers were preparing to increase their ad budgets, in part because of what Mr. Perriss described as growing consumer confidence.
The predictions are also notable because they assert that ad spending will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, after the special stimuli from spending connected with the Summer Olympics in Atlanta and the Presidential and Congressional elections. Mr. Coen estimated those one-time gains were at least $1.5 billion.
Mr. Coen predicted that advertisers would spend a record $182.9 billion in the United States next year. That would mean an increase of 5.6 percent from the $173.2 billion that he now sees for 1996. The 1996 figure is a 7.6 percent gain from the $160.9 billion that was spent in 1995.
Fueling those increases, Mr. Coen said, are double-digit percentage gains in ad spending categories like drugs, brokerage firms and mutual funds, computers, banks and other financial institutions, and cigarettes.
Among the national media that are in line for strong gains in 1997 ad revenue, Mr. Coen said, are cable and syndicated television, Yellow Pages directories and magazines.
Mr. Coen's 1996 figure of $173.2 billion has been adjusted slightly upward from a forecast of $172.8 billion he made in June. Mr. Coen, who has been tracking media and marketing trends since 1948, often revises his figures from one presentation to the next, based on additional economic or spending data.
Mr. Coen's prediction that domestic ad spending in 1997 will total $182.9 billion has also been adjusted, dropping slightly from an initial estimate of $183 billion in June.
On the overseas ad-spending front, Mr. Coen forecast $230.9 billion for 1997, up 6.1 percent from a revised figure of $217.6 billion for 1996. He cited robust ad-spending plans in countries like China, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Poland and Thailand. (That overseas figure is also revised; in June he predicted a total of $229 billion for 1997.)
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for 1997, then, is $413.8 billion. That would represent a gain of 5.9 percent from a revised worldwide total for 1996 of $390.8 billion. If his forecast holds, it will be the first time that worldwide ad spending tops $400 billion.
Mr. Perriss, who was fighting the flu, focused his presentation on ad spending in major media like television, print, radio and outdoor. Thus, his spending totals are different from Mr. Coen's.
For 1997, ad spending in North American major media will total $110.3 billion, Mr. Perriss said, an increase of 4.6 percent from the $105.4 billion that he expects for 1996. For 1998, he projected a total of $115.2 billion, up 4.5 percent from his 1997 forecast. And for 1999, he projected a total of $120 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent from 1998.
While 1996 is likely to mark the high point of growth in percentage terms, Mr. Perriss said, the annual growth-rate forecasts for the rest of the decade have been raised about five-tenths of 1 percent above previous estimates "in the light of steady economic fundamentals and rising consumption," particularly in the United States.
As for overseas ad spending, Mr. Perriss projected that $201.4 billion would be spent in major media in 1997, an increase of 8.2 percent from the $186.1 billion that he expects for 1996. The booming ad-spending markets next year, he said, will include China, Indonesia and the Philippines.
For 1998, his forecast was for $218.2 billion, up 8.3 percent from 1997. And for 1999, his figures call for spending of $237.9 billion, a gain of 9 percent from 1998.
Mr. Perriss's worldwide total for 1997, then, is $311.7 billion, an increase of 6.9 percent from $291.5 billion for 1996. His 1998 worldwide total is $333.4 billion, up 7 percent from 1997. And his worldwide total for 1999 is $357.9 billion, a gain of 7.4 percent from 1998.
A third prediction for ad spending in the United States next year -- from the Myers Report advertising newsletter, published by Myers Group L.L.C. in Parsippany, N.J. -- projects an increase of 7.8 percent.
That forecast was tempered, however, by a prediction that ad spending would begin to fall in the fourth quarter of 1997, which may be the beginning "of a pronounced and potentially long-term downturn."

HEADLINE: Casual Remarks? Hardly, Mr. Greenspan

BYLINE: By Gary Krist; Gary Krist is the author of two collections of short stories, "The Garden State" and "Bone by Bone."

DATELINE: CHEVY CHASE, Md.

 BODY:
World markets roiled last week after a few offhand remarks by Alan Greenspan, reminding us of a simple but undeniable fact: namely, that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board speaks, the markets listen. Major institutional investors have learned to read the subtext behind his most innocuous-seeming comments and to respond accordingly. But until now the small investor has just had to endure the resulting market turmoil without a clue.
Here, then, as a public service, is a listener's guide to Mr. Greenspan's next speech. Listen carefully, because the chairman always means a lot more than he actually says.
 "Good evening." 
 A clear sell signal. By characterizing the evening as "good," the chairman is immediately indicating his belief that because the economy is doing well (perhaps too well), rising consumer demand and its resulting upward pressure on prices will probably force the Fed to nudge interest rates higher in the near future.
"Thank for you that most flattering introduction, which I will certainly try to live up to."
Ambiguous, but probably a buy signal. By trying "to live up to" a "flattering" characterization of himself, the chairman is hinting that he plans to act in a way that will endear him to the markets -- that is, refrain from any immediate tightening of credit, allowing businesses to borrow more easily and cheaply.
"I'd like to thank the hard-working people who planned this event and made it run so smoothly."
Bearish for stocks. Indicative of a pro-labor shift in stance on the Fed's part. The resulting upward pressure on labor costs (larger raises, increased benefits, etc.) could cut into corporate earnings and decrease stock dividends.
"There are too many people to thank individually, but you know who you are."
Definitely bullish for stocks and bonds. A sign that the labor market has grown to its upper limit ("too many people to thank"). Multi-industry downsizing and higher unemployment lie ahead, producing a downward pressure on prices and wages, allowing the Fed to lower interest rates without fear of igniting inflation.
"I promise not to go on too long, since everyone is eager to sit back and enjoy this wonderful-looking dessert."
Buy bonds, sell stocks. This comment indicates an awareness that the public's priorities may be changing. Small investors and institutions alike may be tired of Fed-watching and the bull market's roller-coaster ride, and may soon turn to more conservative investments like bonds.
"These are interesting times for the U.S. economy."
Sell domestic equities, buy foreign equities and bonds. By drawing attention to the "interesting" character of our economy (vis-a-vis, by implication, other economies), Mr. Greenspan is hinting that the domestic economy is in danger of overheating in the near future, forcing the Fed to tighten credit. Higher interest rates would strengthen the dollar, making foreign goods cheaper for Americans to buy and providing a boon to foreign manufacturers -- and, by extension, to foreign equity prices.
"But I've learned that it is best for the Fed chairman to say as little as possible on this or any other topic."
A strong bearish indication for all types of investment. Mr. Greenspan is telegraphing an acute dissatisfaction with the volatility of world markets. Begin a gradual but systematic selling of stocks and bonds.
"So let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to you for being here tonight."
Translation: All good things must come to an end. Convert all holdings to gold and other precious metals. Consider early liquidation of all I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s.
"Thank you, good night and happy new year to you all."
Sell! Sell! Sell! Hoard gasoline and canned goods. Head to the storm cellar and lock the door behind you.

HEADLINE: The Split on Social Security

 BODY:
A Federal advisory panel on Social Security ended its deliberations without coming to agreement on a plan to shore up the system's financial future. Instead it will present three different plans, none with majority support. Fortunately, a good plan can be stitched together from the best parts of two of the three plans. But the lack of consensus probably will delay the date that Congress solves the entire Social Security problem.
The members did agree to invest Social Security taxes in stocks and other private securities, as well as the low-yield government bonds that are the only existing investment option. That change will make Social Security a better deal for workers. But the impact on the overall economy will be minor. The Social Security Trust Fund would substitute stocks for some of the bonds it used to buy from the Treasury. But the Treasury will then have to sell more of its bonds to private investors. The change is unlikely to affect how quickly the economy grows. 
 The commission faced two distinct Social Security problems. The system will be depleted by around 2030, which has scared millions of Americans into believing they will never collect their scheduled benefits. This problem is real, but relatively easy to fix. Congress needs to trim benefits, bring government workers into the system, gradually postpone retirement age or modestly raise taxes -- or combine all of these ideas. No radical reform is needed.
The second problem is subtle and not easily solved. By providing workers "ironclad" retirement benefits, Social Security relieves the need for them to save for themselves. Many economists argue that Social Security has thereby driven down national savings. Over decades, smaller savings leads to less investment and lower living standards. When the baby boomers retire early next century, they will continue to buy food, clothing and shelter, but the money will come from taxpayers. If living standards are high, taxpayers will not mind. But if living standards are low, the tax transfer will hurt.
The panel split three ways on how to fix these problems. One group proposes a needlessly radical privatization. Workers would in effect deposit a substantial part of their payroll tax into a private investment account and buy securities of their own choosing. This would expose individuals to considerable risk of bad investment decisions and be hugely expensive to administer, because millions of workers would be making investment decisions. Worse, it would probably eviscerate over time the system's capacity to disproportionately benefit low-wage workers, a feature that has been America's best anti-poverty weapon since the 1930's.
The panel's two other plans provide better guidance. One group anticipates investing payroll taxes in stocks, but the investment decisions would be made by a government agency completely insulated from politics. The third group would impose a small additional payroll tax, which would boost national savings and the future health of the economy.
Passive investment of Social Security revenues in stocks would make the system look much better to the workers, and taxpayers, whose political support is crucial for the system's survival. Boosting payroll taxes as a way to boost savings also makes sense, as long as precautions are taken to make sure the overall system protects low-wage workers.
The commission's inability to reach consensus makes it likely that Congress will tinker and solve the bankruptcy threat, but not address the more subtle economic threat.

HEADLINE: Monsanto Chooses a Spinoff Of Its Chemical Operations

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Monsanto Company, which announced in October that it was considering shedding its $3 billion chemicals business, said today that it would spin the unit off to Monsanto's shareholders and in the process cut up to 2,500 jobs, 9 percent of the company's work force.
Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, said it also expected to take a one-time after-tax charge of $400 million to $600 million to cover severance payments, write-offs of equipment and other assets and the shutdown of some offices or manufacturing operations. Although Monsanto is not counting on receiving all necessary Government approvals quickly enough to complete the spinoff before the end of next year, it is moving immediately to operate as two separate companies, and it plans to notify employees of their job status by the end of March. 
 Monsanto said that Robert G. Potter, the executive vice president who runs the chemical business, would be the chemical unit's chairman and chief executive after the spinoff.
"We haven't made any decision on which company will keep the Monsanto name," Robert B. Shapiro, Monsanto's chairman and chief executive, said.
The spinoff, which is expected to be tax-free, had been seen by Wall Street as a likely strategic move for Monsanto even before the company confirmed two months ago that it planned to concentrate on its faster-growing agricultural, nutrition and health businesses.
The more mature chemicals business makes products like plastics used in auto windshields, flame retardants and synthetic fibers for carpet. It is solidly profitable, having produced operating income of $242 million on sales of $2.28 billion in the first nine months of this year. But strong growth is unlikely without heavy capital investments, and the sector is far more subject to swings in the economy than Monsanto's other businesses. Thus, the chemical business tends to attract a different type of investor than other parts of the company.
"The spinoff makes perfect sense," said William R. Young, who follows Monsanto for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York.
Monsanto's agriculture portfolio includes Roundup, the world's best-selling herbicide, as well as pioneering biotechnology products that include crops genetically altered to produce their own pesticides and manufactured hormones that raise a cow's milk production. The food ingredients business includes Nutrasweet, the world's leading artificial sweetener, and G. D. Searle, Monsanto's drug subsidiary, is strong in several niches, including insomnia and arthritis drugs.
The three "life sciences" businesses together had operating earnings of just over $1 billion on sales of $4.78 billion in the first nine months of the year. But Monsanto's decision to concentrate on them is not attributable entirely to the better record in recent years of these businesses. Monsanto sees the science and technology underlying all three converging in areas like genetic engineering, which could open up tremendous opportunities to redesign crops to produce more nutritious foods and drugs.
"Integrating these areas provides several trillion dollars worth of market opportunity," Mr. Shapiro said.
Wall Street has been enamored of Monsanto's progress toward that vision for some time. Monsanto's stock jumped 74 percent last year and has risen nearly as much this year. "Monsanto is moving into a class all its own in terms of business focus," said Sano Shimoda of Bioscience Securities Inc., a San Francisco brokerage firm. "They could be the monster on the block in agricultural biotechnology."
But other big competitors are moving the same direction, including Novartis, the Swiss giant being formed by the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz; Agrevo, which is a joint venture of Hoechst and Schering A.G., ; Dow-Elanco, which is a joint venture of Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly, and E.I. duPont de Nemours & Company.
Monsanto also faces a challenge in expanding the food ingredient business. Nutrasweet has maintained its leadership of the artificial sweetener market since coming off patent, but its profit margins have tumbled, and several new products are beginning to compete for parts of its market. And while Searle is no longer regarded as an underperformer in the pharmaceutical world, its $600 million research budget is still "second tier," Mr. Shapiro conceded.
"There will be a continued drive toward consolidation in that business," Mr. Shapiro said. "Everyone is in more or less in a permanent state of negotiations."
Monsanto's announcement today of its specific plan did not excite Wall Street as much as its original disclosure of its intentions in October. Monsanto's shares drifted down 75 cents in heavy trading on the Big Board today, ending at $40.50. After the October announcement, they gained 50 cents, to $41.125.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices End Higher In Calm Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday, bolstered by buying overseas and by expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady.
Yesterday's calm gains stood in stark contrast to trading on Friday, when comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sent bond and stock markets around the world into a tailspin. Mr. Greenspan's comments were taken to mean that he thought American stock prices were overvalued, which would build a case for an increase in short-term interest rates. But the bond market on Friday was reassured by a weak November employment report, and continued its recovery yesterday. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended up 20/32, to 100 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.46 percent, from 6.51 percent on Friday.
The volatility of last week faded yesterday. Some traders said an article in The Washington Post on Sunday furthered the market's sense of Mr. Greenspan's comments. The article interpreted Mr. Greenspan's comments as a warning of excesses in the stock market, and said that they were not a signal that he was prepared to raise interest rates.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said, "The question that seemed to ripple throughout all financial markets on Friday and the debate that will ensue this week is, just what was Mr. Greenspan saying or trying to do, anyway?"
The most logical reason, he said, seems to be that Mr. Greenspan is "essentially trying to keep all his options open as the U.S. economy moves forward into 1997."
Although the market faces some key numbers this week, the volume of trading is expected to remain light into the inflation data this week. Trading will be cautious and many market participants are merely content to take the profits made over the last couple of weeks, especially with so much uncertainty swirling.
Tomorrow brings the November producer price report, and estimates are currently running at a two-tenths of 1 percent rise for the overall and core rates. This report will be followed by Thursday's twin barrage of November consumer prices and retail sales.
Interest rates at yesterday's weekly Treasury bill auction were down, and while the results were decent, traders said they were not as strong as last week's. The average discount rate at auction for a three-month bill was 4.83 percent, down from 4.98 percent at the last auction, with the average rate for a six-month bill at 4.97 percent, down from 5.04 percent. Following are the results of the auction:

HEADLINE: Hospitals Looking Abroad To Keep Their Beds Filled

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Not long ago, most foreign patients at the New England Medical Center were wealthy Europeans and Latin Americans. But now a patient from overseas is more likely to be someone like Gladys Soto Pilone, a 62-year-old retired schoolteacher, whose health plan in Argentina agreed to pay for breast cancer surgery in Boston last summer.
Reaching beyond their longstanding international clientele of royal potentates, celebrities and wealthy people, top-drawer medical centers including the Mayo Clinic, the Texas Heart Institute, the Cleveland Clinic and New England Medical are helping to fill their beds and pay their bills by wooing groups of less affluent foreign patients. 
 In a breakthrough deal this fall, an Argentine labor union with 1.5 million members agreed to send patients with complicated problems to New England Medical. The first beneficiary, a 58-year-old shop clerk from Buenos Aires, is now scheduled for a kidney transplant at the Boston hospital.
Famous medical centers still welcome heads of state from time to time, of course. Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, president of the United Arab Emirates, checked into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for neck surgery in September. He brought an entourage of 140 people and stayed five weeks.
Still, a push for more foreign patients has led hundreds of research and teaching institutions to create package deals and offer other inducements to attract private and government health plans in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as a small but growing number of patients from the Pacific Rim.
The hospitals are looking abroad because of changes sweeping through the medical establishment at home. Already squeezed by managed care and reduced government payments, many are also having difficulty recruiting enough patients to support elaborate high-technology programs like harvesting stem cells for bone marrow transplants to strengthen cancer patients, said Dr. Jeffrey A. Gelfand, the physician in chief at New England Medical.
"We have a huge investment in people and facilities, while the rest of the world is hungry for American expertise," said Dr. James Thrall, a radiologist and chairman of the international committee at Massachusetts General Hospital, which has video "telemedicine" links with several Middle Eastern cities.
The competition to find foreign patients has become so heated that some Middle Eastern health officials have begun to bargain for better deals, playing one American hospital against another. European hospitals and a handful of new Asian medical centers also compete for international patients.
The economics of bringing foreigners to American doctors is attractive to both sides.
For hard-pressed hospital budgets, the rewards, measured in tens of millions of dollars, can be crucial. The average fee for an American patient at New England Medical is $8,000, Dr. Gelfand said. "The average for foreign patients, who usually come for much more serious problems, is $20,000 to $30,000," he said.
What is more, payments from foreign patients are still free, for the most part, from limitations imposed on many American patients by managed care organizations. There is no insurance company nurse, for example, telling the hospital how soon a patient must be discharged. But the hospitals say the quality of care given the foreign patients is no better or worse than that given American patients.
Profit margins on foreign patients average 25 percent to 30 percent in Houston hospitals, much higher than overall margins of about 8 percent, said Gui Leite-Ferraz, a hospital management consultant with Genesis Health Care International, a consulting firm based in Houston.
The trip can be a good value for the patients, too, even with the added expense of travel, which often involves a spouse.
"Many high-risk or very complex conditions can be treated even more cheaply in the United States than here," said Dr. Ruben A. Zito, a Buenos Aires cardiologist and former faculty member at Yale Medical School.
There are no official or even trade group statistics that monitor the flow of foreign patients, and until recently many hospitals were secretive about their international clientele, to avoid attracting notice from competitors.
But Mr. Leite-Ferraz, a former international relations executive at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, estimated that 60,000 foreign patients would be admitted to American hospitals this year, a 50 percent increase from five years ago. He said 350,000 more would come for outpatient treatments and consultations in doctors' offices.
Indeed, every important teaching hospital now has "some sort of international initiative," although the number of foreign patients varies widely, said David Rey, a managing partner at Andersen Consulting. Some hospitals promote programs for particular diseases, while others stress amenities like hotel accommodations, transportation, even tourism and shopping opportunities for patients and families.
Miami and New Orleans hospitals treat many South Americans, Houston is popular with Mexicans and Stanford University Hospital in California is a magnet for Asian patients.
As for promoting specialties, Johns Hopkins, for example, talks up ophthalmology, orthopedics and pediatric brain surgery, said John Hutchins, director of international services at the hospital in Baltimore. Hopkins increased its foreign patients twelvefold in two years, to 7,200, including a group of wounded soldiers from Ecuador airlifted from this year's border war with Peru.
The Cleveland Clinic expects more than 5,000 foreign patients this year, compared with 3,000 five years ago. Hoping to catch up, the University Hospitals of Cleveland recently invited medical attaches from embassies in Washington who often influence the health care choices of their compatriots, to a lecture on bone marrow transplantation.
Mayo expects 10,000 foreign patients this year, an 11 percent jump, at its centers in Rochester, Minn., Scottsdale, Ariz., and Jacksonville, Fla. The Mayo Foundation is negotiating with private insurance companies in Chile on a supplementary health plan that would provide sophisticated care at the three Mayo sites.
At New England Medical, 250 patients and $6 million to $8 million in revenues are expected to flow next year from the new arrangement with the Argentine labor union, which covers workers in retail businesses and was negotiated by Dr. Zito, the Buenos Aires cardiologist. The patients will go to Boston for such complicated procedures as bone marrow, heart, liver and lung transplants and the treatment of certain spinal cord conditions.
Under the agreement, the health plan books the flight to Boston. The hospital meets the patient at the airport and provides lodging for the patient and a spouse or companion.
St. Luke's Episcopal, one of nine Houston hospitals seeking foreign patients, has contracts with insurance companies throughout Latin America and a deal with the Caribbean island of Aruba to provide certain types of specialized care, Mr. Leite-Ferraz said. Foreign patients at St. Luke's generate "close to 20 percent of the total profit of the hospital," he added.
Also in Houston, Jose Nunez, executive director of international affairs at the Methodist Health Care System, said a number of Mexican insurance companies offer coverage for major medical expenses in the United States. "A male nonsmoker, 35 or 40 years old, probably could get one of these policies, with a high deductible -- as much as $5,000 -- for $2,000 to $2,500 a year," he said.
Miami Medical Centers USA, a health care company that deals with these and other internationally oriented insurance companies, channels patients to American hospitals that have agreed to accept discounted fees. Francisco Recio, director of international programs, said the company's business had quadrupled in the last three years, to 200 patients a month.
A growing number of American hospitals are using telemedicine consultations to diagnose the problems of overseas patients, who may decide to come to the United States for treatment. Massachusetts General, for example, has telemedicine links with Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon and plans to add Egypt, Kuwait and Russia. Dr. Thrall, the head of the international committee, said 1,500 international consultations over the last two years generated about 100 admissions for the hospital.
The Internet is another channel being mined for foreign patients. "Sophisticated patients are logging on and accessing the latest medical information," Dr. Thrall said. "Then they contact the doctor who is linked to that work."
For example, the World Wide Web site of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was visited by 11,950 computer users in October, including about 1,200 people in foreign countries, many from Canada.
Indeed, Canadians may be the biggest foreign consumers of American medicine. According to a recent estimate in the Toronto-based Financial Post, they spend more than $1 billion a year on health care in the United States for services that are not available at home or that require long waiting periods. Health care companies in Florida and Arizona offer specially tailored coverage to Canadian "snow birds" who migrate south in cold weather.
Wherever they come from, though, the foreign patients are drawn here by the promise of America's high-tech medicine, experts say.
When Mrs. Soto Pilone in Buenos Aires learned that she had breast cancer, she took advantage of a telemedicine circuit to consult with two oncologists at New England Medical.
And when it became clear that she needed surgery, she quickly started packing for Boston. "Even though we have excellent doctors here in Buenos Aires," she said, "many hospitals lack the technological advances and resources that American hospitals have."
Mrs. Soto Pilone had her surgery on Aug. 26 and still keeps in touch with Boston, via the video link, to report on her progress.

HEADLINE: Computer Chip Sales Ratio Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 9

 BODY:
The computer chip industry's book-to-bill ratio rose more than expected in November, to 1.15, from October's revised 1.11, the Semiconductor Industry Association said today.
October's ratio was revised up from a preliminary number of 1.10. The ratio measures demand in the North American market by comparing the value of chips ordered to the value of chips shipped. 
 A ratio of 1.15 means that for every $100 worth of chips shipped, manufacturers took in $115 in new orders. A ratio higher than 1.00 indicates that the market is growing. The ratio had been below 1.00 this year until October.
In April, the book-to-bill ratio fell to a 10-year low of 0.81.
Orders for November, based on a three-month rolling average, rose 6.2 percent, to $3.96 billion, from $3.73 billion in October. Shipments rose 3 percent, to $3.44 billion, from $3.34 billion in October.
The Semiconductor Industry Association has said it will discontinue reporting the book-to-bill ratio after the report for December is released in January. The ratio will be replaced with a global one.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Surge, Led by Technology Issues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks continued a recovery yesterday from Friday's selloff in a rally led by technology issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 82 points yesterday, to 6,463.94, and the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index jumped to a record high with its second-biggest point gain ever. 
 The day's gains more than made up for the damage remaining from Friday's plunge on fears that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was threatening to raise interest rates to temper the market's enthusiasm.
"What a difference a weekend makes," said Russ Labrasca, senior vice president at Principal Financial Securities of Dallas. "Everyone has had time to digest Greenspan's comments and realize that it was a word of caution, but not of an impending apocalypse."
Foreign stock markets sold off early Friday and bond prices slid, sending interest rates higher, after Mr. Greenspan gave a speech Thursday night that alluded to the inflationary potential of an "irrational exuberance" in the markets. The remarks were initially construed as hinting at a Fed rate increase.
Stocks in the United States slid at Friday morning's open, but quickly began a recovery as the latest employment data allayed fears the economy may accelerate at an inflationary pace. The Dow tumbled 145 points in the first half hour, but closed with a loss of 55.16 points. Rapid inflation would make fixed-income investments like bonds less attractive, and higher interest rates can hurt stocks by slowing consumer spending and raising corporate borrowing costs.
The strong finish Friday set a positive tone for yesterday's open, and traders quickly scoured the market for any remaining bargains.
Computer-related shares led the day's advance amid optimism the holiday selling season has been going well for the sector.
"One of the great toys of this Christmas will be computers," Mr. Labrasca said, noting that most of the latest software requires more powerful machines to operate effectively.
I.B.M. rose 4 3/8, to 160 as the Dow's second-strongest issue after Philip Morris, which jumped 5 1/8 to 115 1/2 after Goldman Sachs reportedly raised its assessment of the consumer products giant. Together, the two companies accounted for a gain of more than 27 Dow points.
Allied Signal rose 7/8, to 69 7/8, after the company announced plans to buy back up to 50 million more of its shares in addition to the 150 million shares approved for repurchase since 1985.
American depository receipts of British Airways rose 3 7/8, to 99 1/4 trading on signs that Britain would approve an alliance with American Airlines. AMR, the parent of American Airlines added 2 1/4, to 91 3/4.
 Centennial Technologies rallied 5, to 46 1/4 on news that it acquired a 12 percent stake in Via Inc. for undisclosed terms. Via is a privately held technology company that makes miniature communication and computing products.
 Among the Nasdaq's technology bellwethers, Microsoft rose 5 1/4, to 81 3/4 in its first session after a 2-for-1 stock split; Intel rose 4 7/16, to 130 1/8; and Dell Computer rose 3 3/4, to 60 1/2, also after a 2-for-1 split.
Smaller-company shares also resumed their recent resurgence. The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies jumped 4.99, to 360.49, finally creeping back within reach of its May 22 high of 364.61. Smaller stocks have lagged a blue-chip rebound from a sharp summer selloff.

HEADLINE: Serb Leader's Foes Persist, Hoping He Will Blink First

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Serbian opposition, smarting from the latest refusal by Government courts to overturn the annulment of local elections, came out today 100,000 strong to begin the third week of protests.
But the opposition, which has called on factory workers to join the movement, has been unable to organize strikes that would increase the pressure on the Government of President Slobodan Milosevic. And the protests, while continuing to draw large crowds in Belgrade and other cities, appears stuck at a plateau. Opposition leaders from the coalition called Zajedno said they would boycott the first session of the newly elected lower house of Parliament on Tuesday. 
 "We have shown the world that we will persist," the opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, told the crowd gathered in Republic Square today.
"The reasons Serbs in their history have lost battles, from Kosovo until Nov. 17 of this year, is because our opponents waited until they could crush us while we slept," Mr. Djindjic declared, referring to the date of the disputed elections. "Can we play this last game until the end? Milosevic is waiting for us to lose patience, to give up. He is waiting for us to begin breaking windows so he can send the police and the military into the streets. Each day we persist is one more day for us and one less day for him."
While the United States and its Western allies have expressed disapproval of Mr. Milosevic's actions, saying they will retain the option to reimpose economic sanctions, most diplomats said that, barring a violent Government crackdown, such an action was unlikely.
Sanctions against Yugoslavia were imposed during the war, but most were suspended after Mr. Milosevic signed the Dayton peace accord on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs. Some sanctions, barring international bank loans to Serbia and freezing assets from the old Yugoslavia, remain in place.
The Serbian Supreme Court this weekend ruled against opposition parties, which have accused the authorities of vote-rigging, closing an opportunity for compromise.
Mr. Djindjic called on his followers to telephone friends and family outside the capital, where Government-run news outlets have blocked information about the anti-Government protests. A protest meeting by workers at a factory here today failed to muster more than a couple of dozen dispirited employees who did not, as planned, march outside the plant. The leaders of the protest said they were not allied with the political opposition and were demanding back pay and better working conditions.

 BODY:
It is sure to be a bittersweet moment for C. LOWELL HARRISS, 88, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University, when he accepts the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science today. He is to receive the award in the name of his friend of 61 years, WILLIAM VICKREY, who died of a heart attack in October at 82, three days after learning that he had won the prize.
"We met when we were graduate students at Columbia in 1935," Professor Harriss said from Stockholm yesterday. 
 "We worked together in the United States Treasury during World War II, doing tax research, and then were both on the faculty of Columbia for many years," he said. "We saw each other every week or so."
Professor Harriss last saw his friend at a party given by the Columbia economics department on the day of the announcement. "I have never seen anyone more exuberant," he said. "He was at the top of the world and justifiably so."

HEADLINE: New Mastercard Is Aimed At Middle-Class Borrowers

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Responding to American Express's moves to lure middle-income credit card borrowers, Mastercard is introducing a travel-oriented card today aimed squarely at American Express's traditional base of people who pay their monthly bills in full.
The new World Mastercard will offer no pre-set spending limit, and lots of travel benefits. Unlike an American Express charge card, the World card will offer a credit line for those who want to pay their balances over time. The interest rate and fee are set by each bank that offers it. 
 Separately, both Mastercard and Visa have developed platinum credit cards, meant to be offered with no fee to customers who borrow large sums on their cards. These cards offer nothing more than a higher credit limit and an air of exclusivity to existing gold cards.
Mastercard said that its World card would be available from leading credit card issuers including Household International and Mellon Bank. General Motors will offer a version of the World Mastercard in conjunction with Household, which issues its very successful regular and gold credit cards.
The World Mastercard is meant to undercut moves by American Express's chairman, Harvey Golub, to have banks to offer its cards.
"This is going to make Harvey's suspenders pop," said Robert Wesley, a longtime American Express employee hired by Mastercard five months ago as senior vice president for product management and development. "Banks will have no reason to issue any other card." Mr. Wesley predicted that the World card would attract five million customers in the United States and two or three million in other countries.
American Express dismissed Mastercard's announcement as bluster. "During the past several years Visa and Mastercard have launched marketing programs that copy us only to have those services debut and disintegrate," Gail Wasserman of American Express said.
American Express has been sparring with Mastercard and Visa on several fronts. Most recently the two card associations sued to block the Advanta Corporation from issuing a credit card linked to American Express's frequent-flier program.
So far, Mastercard and Visa rules have prevented banks in the United States from offering American Express cards, but banks in several other countries have signed on. They see American Express cards as attractive for convenience users -- people who pay their bills in full and thus do not incur interest charges -- because they can charge higher fees to both card holders and merchants.
Mastercard has planned the World card so banks can profit from convenience users. The card will offer benefits like access to airline airport lounges and a telephone concierge service for making special travel and shopping arrangements, as well as a reward program that will allow users to earn trips on any airline with no blackout period. (Some cards with rewards tied to specific merchants, such as G.M., will not have the travel reward feature.)
Similarly, the card is meant to appeal to frequent travelers by allowing customers to spend more than their normal credit limits, provided they pay the overage at the end of the month.
"We want the kind of customer who takes the Concorde to London, stays in the best hotel, dines in the best restaurant and when he goes to Harrods to buy a gift for his wife doesn't worry that he has maxed his credit line," Mr. Wesley said.
Most important for the banks that issue the product, Mr. Wesley said that Mastercard was hoping to raise the fees charged merchants that are passed back to the card issuers, known as interchange, at least for travel and entertainment charges.
Industry experts said that Mastercard would have a difficult time raising the fees to merchants.
"I don't think this will work," Seamus McMahon, a consultant with First Manhattan Consulting Group, said. "The merchants will say to Mastercard, 'Prove to me that your card holders charge more, and then talk about raising the interchange. And without Amex's full interchange and annual fees, this is a harebrained thing for banks to do."
Mr. McMahon added that credit card companies underestimated the costs of serving convenience users. "People say there is no credit risk, but some of the biggest convenience users who have paid you back every month for 10 years are declaring bankruptcy with no notice," he said.
Platinum cards are also an attempt to appeal to heavy borrowers, who already have a wallet full of cards. MBNA and First USA offer a no-fee card that is in effect a cosmetic upgrade to their existing gold cards. Brittain Associates of Atlanta found in September that First USA and MBNA had already won nearly two million platinum customers.
Mastercard will introduce what it calls a platinum class card today. It offers a minimum credit line of $7,500, 24-hour customer service, and an optional travel reward program. The cards do not have to use the name platinum.
Visa recently adopted similar standards for platinum-type cards.

HEADLINE: Back in the Statehouse After 4 Decades Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, W.Va., Dec. 6

 BODY:
In a campaign stressing clean government and mine safety, Cecil H. Underwood toted a stepladder around the state, using it as a metaphor for "reaching a higher level." He won almost 54 percent of the vote and, at 34, became the youngest person ever elected Governor of West Virginia.
That was in 1956. 
 Forty years later, Mr. Underwood was back on the stump this fall, but with a new prop: several feet of fiber-optic cable, a symbol, he said, of a solid economic future for West Virginia based on job opportunities from new technology.
This time he won 52 percent of the vote and, at 74, became the oldest person ever elected Governor of the state.
"I'm told that may be some kind of a record," Mr. Underwood said proudly of the four-decade interval between his first and second terms, talking with an interviewer as aides continued dismantling his campaign headquarters here in preparation for his return next month to Charleston, the state capital.
More than a political oddity, though, Mr. Underwood's victory last month stands as a vivid example of how voters leaped toward the safe center this year, embracing candidates who pledged progress along a moderate path regardless of party affiliation.
A lifelong Republican, Mr. Underwood defeated his 47-year-old Democratic opponent, Charlotte Pritt, in a year when registered Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans by more than 2 to 1, when the state's entire Congressional delegation remained Democratic, and when the departing Governor, Gaston Caperton, a two-term Democrat barred by law from running again, was hailed by leaders of both parties for improving both the state's economy and its image.
In that political environment, it was Mr. Underwood, the Republican, rather than Ms. Pritt, the Democrat, who campaigned on themes of staying the Caperton course.
A businessman with no political experience when he took office in 1989, Mr. Caperton was widely viewed as a pragmatist who recognized that West Virginia could grow only through innovative education programs and the creation of new business.
During his administration, the state's unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent, from 9.8, and 78,000 jobs were created, many in new technology businesses. As a result of that growth, the state's population, having fallen steadily for years, to under 1.8 million in 1990, has recently begun to increase. And by the end of next year, all public schools in the state will be equipped with computers linked to the Internet.
While Ms. Pritt, a coal miner's daughter and former public-school teacher, took advantage of her strong support from union members, especially teachers and coal miners, she was widely perceived as "the labor candidate," and as lacking the skills and the experience needed to keep West Virginia's economy viable in a period of fierce competition for new businesses among the Middle Atlantic States.
Neither Mr. Caperton nor Senator Robert C. Byrd, who has served in Congress as a Democrat for 44 years, became active campaigners for her, although she was strongly supported by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, who easily won a third term last month.
"Cecil Underwood was elected because he is a moderate Republican who ran against a person perceived by many people as being somewhat of an extremist," said Mr. Caperton, who sailed to a second term over a Republican challenger in 1992 despite a write-in campaign by Ms. Pritt. "Everything we saw in the polls indicated that people thought the state was going in the right direction, with job development and education, and it was not his interest in changing that direction."
Mr. Underwood, who had served in the State Legislature for 10 years before winning the governorship in 1956, finds echoes of that victory in his triumph last month.
Forty years ago coal mining was still the state's economic lifeline, with 150,000 miners and three-shift-a-day operations, and his Democratic opponent, Robert H. Mollohan, had the backing of the United Mine Workers and other large unions.
"But I had done my own political analysis and found a straight line from 1936 to 1952 showing the steady growth of Republicans in West Virginia," said Mr. Underwood, whose 1956 victory was the first by a Republican nominee for West Virginia governor in 28 years.
In those days, the governor could serve only one term. So Mr. Underwood ran for the United States Senate in 1960. He lost, as he did in two later campaigns for governor, in 1964 and 1976.
Yet the losses led him to positions that became assets this year, including the presidency of Bethany College and the chairmanship of a management company in Morgantown that works with new businesses. He also co-founded Software Valley, a nonprofit project near Morgantown that he developed with Mr. Byrd and others to attract high-technology research companies to West Virginia.
As late as the waning months of last year, Mr. Underwood says, he was not contemplating another campaign for public office.
"But then I began to get calls, people saying they were not happy with the options of the two parties," he said. "They were looking for someone with experience."
Mr. Underwood, the last candidate to announce, packaged his business experience and still bankable name recognition as the logical extension of Mr. Caperton's policies. Stressing continued improvement of public schools and aggressive policies to attract more businesses to the state, he defeated two opponents in the Republican primary before taking on Ms. Pritt and a Libertarian Party candidate, Wallace Johnson, in the general election. Ms. Pritt won 46 percent of the vote, Mr. Johnson 2 percent.
Now a month from inauguration, Mr. Underwood says he recognizes that governing the state will be a substantially different job from the one he undertook the first time around, when corruption was common, poverty touched most areas of the state, West Virginia had no major highways and the state budget for his last term in office was $115 million (compared with $2.5 billion in Mr. Caperton's final budget).
In addition, coal is no longer the king it once was here. The state's economy has diversified into tourism and forestry products as well as high-technology industries.
"We've got more nurses now than coal miners," said Robert Dilger, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
To Mr. Underwood, a man of gentle voice who looks 10 years younger than his age, all this is reason for more of the policies of the Caperton years.
"I believe they did the things that needed to be done," he said. "We just have to keep going and accelerate."

HEADLINE: Bank Robber Flees by Train, Takes Hostage And Is Seized

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: WYANDANCH, L.I., Dec. 9

 BODY:
For three years, commuters on the Long Island Rail Road have lived with the legacy of fear left by Colin Ferguson, the Brooklyn man who opened fire with an assault rifle on a commuter train, killing 6 people and injuring 19.
Today, that fear was renewed when a bank robbery suspect boarded a train here, took a passenger hostage and threatened to start shooting others. Before surrendering, witnesses said, the suspect shouted to police officers, "You are going to have to kill me today." 
 No one was injured in the incident, but passengers were clearly shaken.
"All I could think of was Colin Ferguson," said Christine Hammer, who fled the train with her 4-year-old daughter, Carla. Eddie Melendez, a Nynex employee, said he too was reminded of Mr. Ferguson's shooting spree, adding, "I was thinking that it was going to happen again."
The suspect was identified as Anthony Norman, 34, of Brentwood, L.I. Detective Sgt. Peter Burker of the Suffolk County robbery squad said Mr. Norman was unemployed and divorced and had eight children.
He said police records showed that Mr. Norman had been arrested once in Suffolk County on drug charges and several times in New York City on charges ranging from petty larcy to possession of stolen property. It had yet to be determined whether Mr. Norman had been convicted on any of the charges or whether he had spent any time in prison.
"He told us this was his first bank robbery," Detective Burker said.
The police said today's drama began when Mr. Norman, wearing a red shirt, camouflage-fatigue pants and combat boots, entered the European American Bank on Suffolk Avenue in Brentwood at 10:18 A.M., told the teller that he had a gun, placed a package he said was a bomb on the counter, and demanded money.
After the teller gave him $2,000 in cash, he fled on foot and headed toward the nearby railroad station, where, witnesses said, he boarded the 10:08 from Ronkonkoma, L.I., a 12-car train headed to Manhattan with 450 people on board.
The police jumped into patrol cars and raced down Suffolk Avenue to the train's next stop here at the Brentwood station, where they halted and boarded the train and began searching for the suspect.
When two officers found him in the fourth car from the rear of the train, the suspect grabbed an elderly man around the neck with his arm and threatened to shoot him. "I'll blow his head off if you don't let me go," a witness, Ernest Solomon, recalled the suspect as yelling at the police.
More than a dozen other officers entered the car and, within 20 minutes, the police had talked the suspect into letting the hostage go and giving himself up. The suspect was found to be unarmed and the supposed bomb he had used to rob the bank was a fake, according to Officer Randy Jaret, a spokesman for the Suffolk County police.
Sam Zambuto, a spokesman for the Long Island Rail Road, said service in both directions on the Ronkonkoma line was halted for nearly an hour and a half while the police investigated the incident. The 10:08 resumed its trip to Manhattan shortly before noon and arrived at Pennsylvania Station shortly after 1 P.M.
Among those who remained on the train was William Helton, 26, of Central Islip, L.I., who said he made the trip to Manhattan to buy wholesale clothing for his retail shop in Glen Cove, L.I.
Mr. Helton said he rode in the same car as the suspect and noticed that he was acting strangely.
"He was talking and moving from seat to seat," Mr. Helton said. "When we came into Wyandanch and the cops were walking down the platform, he saw them and he jumped from one side of the train to the other."
Mr. Helton said the suspect left a coat and a package on one of the seats, and when the police asked if it belonged to him, he became nervous and grabbed a passenger sitting near him from behind.
"I saw him grabbing for something, and the cops starting backing up," Mr. Helton said. "First, there were only two cops, but then, 50 or more were coming into the car."
He said that despite the tension and fear, the officers remained calm and evacuated everyone. "Passengers crawled on the floor through the aisle and into the next car," he said.
One of the passengers was a woman who said she was among the commuters on the train that Mr Ferguson rode three years ago.
"She had some kind of a panic attack," said Tom Kletecka of Ronkonkoma, a passenger who sat near her. "She was shouting like crazy, 'I just only started riding the train again.' " Mr. Kletecka said the woman refused to reboard the train after she and others left it in Wyandanch.

HEADLINE: AGENCY TO PURSUE 2 PLANS TO SHRINK PLUTONIUM SUPPLY

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Confronting one of the most intractable problems of the post-cold-war era, the Energy Department said today that it would try to dispose of plutonium from old nuclear weapons both by using it as fuel in utilities' reactors and by mixing it with nuclear waste created when the plutonium was made and solidifying the mixture in glass.
Officials said they were pursuing both options because they did not know which method could be put in operation sooner and for less cost, or even whether either was feasible. 
 The department wants to dispose of 52.5 tons of plutonium, more than half the national stockpile. Its goals are to encourage the Russians to reduce their stockpile, to prevent plutonium from falling into unauthorized hands and to reduce the available stocks of the bomb fuel should the cold war return.
But some arms control experts complained immediately that using the plutonium in civilian reactors could, because of the security problems, increase the amount of potential weapons fuel in circulation around the world. And department officials conceded that there were technical questions about the feasibility of the plan to solidify the plutonium for storage.
Department officials said it would take at least two years for them to determine whether either, both or neither method would work. The initial cost estimate was $2.3 billion no matter how the processing is divided between the two methods.
In remarks at a news conference today at which she announced the new effort, Hazel R. O'Leary, the Energy Secretary, acknowledged the extent of the problem.
"The arms race is over," she said. "Our struggle now is to get rid of this sea of plutonium."
Mrs. O'Leary, who is leaving office next month after four years, said that she considered today's announcement the capstone of her tenure and that it was a big step toward reducing the risk of nuclear war.
The department and the White House had previously declared the plutonium surplus.
Originally, dozens of options for plutonium disposal were being considered, including some that involved disposal in space. "We started out with more than 35 options for plutonium disposition," Mrs. O'Leary said. "I think I was a child when we started."
 The plutonium was created over four decades in military reactors atom by atom by extracting neutrons from one form of uranium and adding them to another. Then the plutonium was painstakingly separated from highly radioactive wastes, for use in bombs.
One of the two disposal methods the department plans to pursue -- using the plutonium in reactors -- would destroy the bomb fuel almost completely. A reactor would split each atom, in the process releasing heat that can be used to make electricity.
Under the other plan, the plutonium would be mixed back in with the wastes created when it was made, making it difficult to repurify for military use. The plutonium and wastes would be solidified in glass, which the department began doing with wastes alone earlier this year. Or it could be solidified in a ceramic.
One problem with solidification is that the solid would have to last for thousands of years because plutonium decays slowly. If the glass broke down, the plutonium could reconcentrate, form a critical mass and carry on a nuclear chain reaction. In addition, where the material would be buried is still unclear because the Energy Department has not chosen a repository.
As for the other method, it is not clear that utilities would accept the plutonium as fuel, or that people who live near nuclear power plants will stand for it.
All 109 nuclear reactors now operating in the United States produce plutonium in the course of their normal operations and then consume some of it. Arizona Public Service's three Palo Verde reactors were designed to be loaded with plutonium fuel. In the New York area, the Niagara Mohawk Power Company has expressed interest in using plutonium at its two Nine Mile Point units, near Syracuse.
But no reactors are currently licensed to be loaded with plutonium fuel, and obtaining the necessary permits would almost certainly be politically troublesome.
Another problem with the reactor method is that most utility reactors are on shaky economic ground because of cheap natural gas and deregulation of the power industry. Nine Mile Point 1, for example, is a candidate for retirement. Many others may also be retired before they could begin burning plutonium.
In addition, a full-sized power plant could handle a ton to a ton and a half of plutonium per year, so finishing off 52 tons would take several reactors many years.
The Energy Department says it would pay the utilities for these "irradiation services." It might buy an existing reactor to do the job itself, if necessary, Mrs. O'Leary said.
Energy officials say that the idea of consuming plutonium in reactors appeals to the Russians, who still believe that plutonium is an asset, not a liability. But anti-proliferation experts say it will be hard to have the Russians turn the weapons material into reactor fuel without also encouraging them to recover even more plutonium from nuclear reactor fuel.
The Russians have been doing that for years, for themselves and for Hungary and Finland, in an industry called reprocessing. The United States had a similar industry, but President Jimmy Carter banned it as a proliferation danger 20 years ago.
Russia has no plant to turn this reprocessed plutonium back into reactor fuel, and partly as a result, its reprocessing business is small and probably not profitable, experts say. But the Energy Department wants to help the Russians build a fuel fabrication plant, to turn the weapons plutonium into the physical and chemical form needed for fueling a reactor. That could stimulate the reprocessing business, some nongovernment experts say.
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the civilian industry's trade association, likes the idea of using the plutonium in its reactors. It estimates that the plutonium could make enough reactor fuel, called mixed-oxide fuel and known as MOx, to run 10 large plants for 10 to 20 years.
But some analysts also think the "irradiation services fees" to American utilities would amount to a subsidy for uneconomic reactors.
"Plutonium is one of the most serious security threats facing the world," said Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, which has been scrutinizing the Government weapons program for more than a decade. "What D.O.E. is proposing will increase nuclear dangers by entrenching pork-barrel interests in plutonium in Russia and creating them anew in the U.S."
A coalition of eight other groups, including Greenpeace, Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Nuclear Control Institute, said using military plutonium in civilian plants would "undermine a 20-year United States policy to avoid the civilian use of plutonium." Department officials said, though, that the Federal Government taboo, dating from the "atoms for peace" era, was to avoid creating military plutonium in civilian plants, not consuming it.
John D. Holum, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, appearing with Mrs. O'Leary this afternoon, said, "There is a dramatic difference in my mind between using the MOx fuel option, if that should be chosen, to dispose of plutonium that we wish we didn't have, and producing more plutonium."
Some of the wastes, though, are residues, scraps and other forms that are unsuitable for reactors. That material could be disposed of with the other option, mixing the plutonium back in with the wastes that were its byproduct. Those wastes are now festering in million-gallon steel tanks, some of them rusting.
Early this year, the Energy Department opened a factory at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., that mixes these wastes with molten glass in a Pyrex-like recipe, filling a stainless steel canister, which is then sealed. Engineers are studying whether they could insert small packages of plutonium pellets, encased in aluminum, into the canisters as they are filled. The aluminum would melt and the plutonium would be mixed with the glass, making retrieval very difficult, probably as difficult as separating plutonium from spent fuel, which is where it came from in the first place.

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Power Broker;
Bankers Are Changing the Shape of the Utility Industry

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
It was minutes before midnight on Friday, Nov. 22, and John W. Barr and Jeffrey R. Holzschuh had just helped rescue the biggest deal in the hottest year for mergers in the history of the American energy utility industry -- a $7.7 billion combination of the Duke Power Company of Charlotte, N.C., and the Panenergy Corporation of Houston.
Negotiations in New York had broken down 31 hours earlier in a dispute over the exchange ratio for Panenergy stock, and the Texas company had canceled a meeting at which its board had been expected to approve the agreement. In desperation, the investment bankers for both sides had flown to their clients' headquarters for talks aimed at bridging a $4-a-share gap, finally coaxing them to settle on $50 a share at 9:20 P.M. 
 The deal done, Mr. Barr of Barr Devlin Associates and Mr. Holzschuh of Morgan Stanley & Company stopped at a store on the way to the Charlotte airport to buy a case of beer and the entire stock of cheddar-cheese popcorn.
So what happened when the bankers boarded their chartered Lear jet back to New York? "Exhaustion set in," Mr. Barr said. "People sort of passed out. It's like you're so tired on your honeymoon that nothing happens. When we landed in New York, I think everybody was still gripping their first can of beer."
Never mind; there should be more occasions for Mr. Barr and Mr. Holzschuh to celebrate. As the staid, cash-rich utility business suddenly opens up to competition in states from Massachusetts to California, a small group of merger specialists sees hundreds of millions of dollars in fees ahead as they help pull apart the wires, pipes and power plants of the industry like some kind of giant Tinker Toys castle and put the pieces together in once unimaginable combinations.
The Duke-Panenergy merger alone will generate $40 million in fees for more than two dozen investment bankers at four firms who toiled on the project day and night for three weeks. And that deal is just one of dozens negotiated in the last two years. In some cases, utilities are selling off generating plants and becoming basically marketers, buying energy from the lowest bidder. In others, power companies are acquiring adjacent utilities or moving into new businesses. In still others, they are setting up operations abroad. And some of the most ambitious utilities are marrying into the natural gas industry.
With deregulation spreading to other states, and free-market legislation under discussion in Congress, the merger activity promises to become even livelier. And in pursuit of a $270 billion retail market, every power company seems to be making plans to offer new services to customers, ranging from home-security systems to writing mortgages.
And with their direct access to nearly every address in America, some are even thinking of competing with telephone and cable companies to supply communications to homes and businesses. "It's phenomenal, and it's not over," Mr. Barr exulted. "I call it a slice and dice industry."
Stephen L. Baum, chief executive of the Enova Corporation in San Diego, which formed the largest energy-service utility in the country with its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pacific Enterprises, a natural gas company, said the industry was in a revolution. "You can either circle the wagons or, like Duke and us, decide to be a player on the national scene and go after new markets," he said.
So far this year, 52 mergers or acquisitions valued at more than $35.5 billion have been struck in the natural gas and electric utility industries, nearly double the activity last year, according to Houlihan Lokey's Mergerstat. That translates, investment bankers say, into more than $350 million in fees for 1996.
The once sleepy utility area accounted for nearly 9 percent of all merger transactions this year. second only to communications and well ahead of banking and insurance.
Of course, it can take up to four years for the deals to gain regulatory approval and close. But what is most astounding is just how suddenly the industry has been deluged in deals. In 1991, there were only 13, worth $806.5 million. But in the last two years, one-quarter of the 100 largest electric utilities in the country were party to deals of one kind or another.
"It's reinventing time," Philip Giudice, a utility consultant at Mercer Management Consulting in Boston, said. "Nobody has a crystal ball that shows the winning strategy, so people will be trying different kinds of combinations."
Six years ago, just as the first tremors of change began shaking the industry, Mr. Barr and Hugh Devlin, who had headed Morgan Stanley's utility group for more than a decade, formed their own firm to focus exclusively on gas and electric companies. Barr Devlin played an advisory role in four of the top 10 United States deals this year and as much as 40 percent of the dollar volume of deals since 1990. "We had a vision of the company," Mr. Barr said, "as opposed to a vision of the industry."
But it can be a long time between paychecks. Barr Devlin is still waiting for seven of its biggest deals in 1995 and 1996 to close.
Industry infighting can also take its toll. This spring, Western Resources Inc. of Topeka, Kan., knocked out Utilicorp United Inc.'s planned friendly merger with the Kansas City Power and Light Company by initiating a $1.9 billion hostile bid. Kansas City Power repeatedly rebuffed Western until last month, when the two companies announced they were holding talks.
Five or six years ago, few in the utility industry foresaw the seismic changes to come. One who did was Edward Tirello, a utility analyst, who created a stir at a conference by passing out T-shirts emblazoned with a cryptic message "50 & 5" and then decoding it. Within five years, he predicted, the number of utilities in America would shrink to 50 from 150. It did not happen quite that fast, but no one today disagrees about the industry's direction. "They used to call me crazy," said Mr. Tirello, now an analyst at NatWest Securities. "Now I'm a visionary."
All the activity is creating two classes of investment bankers in the utility field -- the haves and have-nots. While merger specialists enjoy a windfall, their colleagues in the bond markets are watching enviously from the side. It was not always so; in the 1970's and early 1980's, financing new gas and electric plants accounted for an estimated 10 percent of all underwriting on Wall Street, and tens of millions of dollars in fees for each investment bank.
But with a surplus of generating capacity by the mid-1980's, utilities stopped coming around so much. Construction spending by investor-owned electrical utilities fell almost 65 percent, to $8.9 billion, in 1994, from a high of $25 billion in 1982, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
"It was almost an annuity for many of these investment bankers," Mr. Giudice said. But "the amount of new capital required by this industry has gone down dramatically over the past five years."
Many investment banks allowed their utility ties to wither. As a result, much of the merger work goes to the few firms that kept cultivating relationships with chief executives: Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch & Company, Goldman, Sachs & Company and Barr Devlin, the only boutique in the bunch.
Despite the elegiac descriptions of the new utility architecture, some analysts question how long it will take the various combinations to deliver substantive new profits. Others wonder whether a competitive system provides a strong enough incentive for utilities to develop the costly extra generating capacity needed for peak power periods; widespread brownouts might trigger a move to reregulate the industry.
"The M.& A. people have plenty of tunes to sing here," said Lowell Miller, president of Miller/Howard Investments, a fund specializing in gas and utility stocks. "They're singing to people who aren't accustomed to takeovers and buyouts. They should have a relatively easy time until people see whether these deals work out or not."
Whatever Mr. Miller's misgivings, no one is likely to short circuit a myriad of new connections in the utility industry. "At this point," Rick Gordon, vice chairman of investment banking for Merrill Lynch, said. "I can't see an end to it."
The strategies behind the deals vary. Baltimore Gas and Electric was presumably seeking economies of scale and a bulwark against a hostile takeover when it recently agreed to pay $2.5 billion for Potomac Electric Power, which serves the Washington area. The Southern Company, the nation's largest producer of electricity and the parent of five electric utilities in the Southeast, is seeking to be a global player. It bought a regional electric distributor in Britain last year for $1.8 billion and agreed in October to pay $2.7 billion for Consolidated Electric Power Asia, a company in Hong Kong that builds, owns and operates generating plants in the Philippines, China, Pakistan and Indonesia.
The New England Electric System, a holding company with four electric utilities and 1.3 million customers, is shedding its power plants to become a pure marketer -- of natural gas and energy-related products and electricity. "In five years, the local utility will be a wires and pipes management and billing company," John Rowe, New England Electric's chairman, said. "The big actors will be the largest utilities like Duke, Enron and the new companies formed to broker energy."
Duke is betting that neither state nor Federal regulators will force it to sell off power plants as it sets about creating a giant network to market power nationally to the local "pipe and wire" utilities. Duke and Panenergy, which had been on the prowl for a cross-industry partner, started informal talks last summer. Their negotiations picked up speed in October, two months after the Enron Corporation, a gas pipeline company, gave instant credence to the energy "convergence" approach by agreeing to pay $2.1 billion for the Portland General Corporation, an electric utility based in Oregon.
But on Nov. 21, Duke and Panenergy were about $600 million apart when Panenergy canceled its board meeting and the deal tumbled into a pothole. After a day of negotiations by telephone, William H. Grigg, chairman of Duke, asked Mr. Barr, Mr. Holzschuh and his others advisers whether he should raise his bid. He stepped out of the room at about 9 P.M. to call Paul M. Anderson, chief executive at Panenergy, and returned 20 minutes later with a deal.
In merging with Panenergy, Duke acquired 37,000 miles of pipeline crisscrossing the Midwest and Northeast that carry about 15 percent of the gas consumed in the United States. The combined company can provide customers with one-stop shopping for all their energy needs.
"This industry is on fire," Mr. Holzschuh said, "and it's going to stay that way."

Graphs: "A Surge in Mergers"
 Deregulation is changing the face of the utility industry: Many power companies are preoccupied with finding merger partners rather than adding to existing overcapacity by building power plants. This shift has had a fallout on Wall Street, where utilities are generating far less underwriting business, but firms that specialize in utility mergers and acquisitions are busier than ever.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Test Run of Pipeline by Iraqis Sends Oil Prices Tumbling

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as a test of a pipeline to Turkey removed doubts that Iraq would soon begin exporting oil for the first time since 1990.
On other markets, wheat surged on expectations that Iraq would buy grain with proceeds from the oil it exports under a United Nations-governed aid plan. 
 Iraq began to pump oil yesterday into a pipeline that will deliver its oil to terminals on the Turkish coast as a test for the oil it will ship under the plan, which the United Nations approved on Monday.
The plan allows Iraq to sell as much as $2 billion of oil the next six months to pay for food and medicine. The United Nations imposed an oil embargo against Iraq after that country invaded Kuwait in 1990.
While full volumes of about 500,000 barrels a day are not expected to begin for at least a few days, the test signaled that Iraqi oil is close at hand after months of delays.
"As we move further and further along," said William Brown, president of W. H. Brown & Company, a consulting firm in New York, "this oil is going to put more and more pressure on prices."
Crude oil for January delivery sank 88 cents, to $24.42 a barrel, the lowest price since Nov. 27.
The United Nations yesterday received the first two company contracts to buy the Iraqi crude, and many more are expected.
"Iraqi crude is going to be on the market soon and obviously the market is reacting to it," Michael Busby, trading manager at Northville Industries in Melville, L.I., said.
From the $2 billion of revenue Iraq generates from the oil exports, it is expected to have enough cash to buy 1.5 million metric tons of wheat, or 55.1 million bushels, traders said.
The United Nations will place the oil proceeds in an escrow account.
While any grain Iraq buys is expected to come from Australia or Argentina, the increase in overall global demand should filter through to American grain prices.
March wheat rose 5 cents, to $3.7925 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.

Dollar Slips in Slow Trading Ahead of European Meeting

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most European currencies in slow trading yesterday as nervousness over the direction of German interest rates set in ahead of a meeting of European leaders this week.
Currency traders speculated yesterday that Italy might not become a full-fledged member of Europe's proposed monetary union. Such speculation aided the German mark against the dollar because it reduces the pressure on Germany to lower its interest rates. 
 Such speculation came as leaders of European Union member-nations prepare for a summit meeting in Dublin this weekend.
"I think people became less convinced this morning that the Bundesbank is going to ease rates to help form one European currency going into 1997," said Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank.
"I think the market going into the summit is trading on rumors and expectations."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5524 marks, from 1.5575 marks on Monday. The dollar was quoted at 113.41 Japanese yen, down from 113.51 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6537 from $1.6469.
Slow trading activity and little movement in exchange rates frustrated currency traders, especially in comparison with the dollar's tumble and recovery on Friday on comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and lackluster United States employment data.
"We've been in a real narrow dollar range today with not a lot of interest outside of the parameters of 1.5520 and 1.5560 marks," said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.
The dollar briefly jumped yesterday after the midmorning release of the National Association of Purchasing Management's latest semiannual survey, which indicated that most of its members see better United States economic growth in the first half of 1997 versus the second half of 1996.
In trading in Asia, the dollar eased off session highs against the yen amid speculation that Kampo, the giant Japanese postal fund, would start hedging its foreign bond risk. Such a move would likely entail the selling of dollars and European currencies for yen, traders said.

101 Evitas

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
At the Sony Lincoln Square on Sunday, the packed house that had come to see Woody Allen's glorious new movie musical, "Everyone Says I Love You," was laughing even before it began. The source of the titters was a trailer for another movie musical, "Evita" -- "the story of the love between a girl and her dream," intoned the narrator -- in which Madonna, dripping in Dior, declared to the adoring multitudes, "I'm only a simple woman!"
But across town at Bloomingdale's on Monday no one was laughing. Business was brisk at the Evita boutique on three. "In 20 years I've never seen such a huge response," said Kal Ruttenstein, the store's fashion director, as we examined a beaded coronation dress (at $660 the most expensive item) and workmen behind us busily pumped up the volume of the inevitable background music, "Don't Cry for Me Argentina." Not even the sales at the still-hot "Rent" boutique on two -- fashions inspired by the transvestites, junkies and AIDS patients of the Broadway hit -- could match this Bloomingdale's exclusive. 
 Mr. Ruttenstein points out that the Evita collection is "bridge, not top of the line." Earlier in the day a woman had nonetheless managed to run up a nearly $1,000 tab on a complete look, with red hat, earrings, necklace and Nicole Miller tango dress. A store makeup artist had applied the Estee Lauder "Face of Evita" cosmetics, which include the new "Evita Red Hot Nail Lacquer," not to mention "Evita Flame Lips" lipstick.
Don't cry for me Estee Lauder! So what if the real Eva Peron "was an admirer of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco," as Michael Owen wrote in The Times when the stage version of "Evita" first sanitized its heroine for popular consumption? Who cares if jail cells in Buenos Aires were filled with her opponents, or if she shut down any newspaper or radio station that dared criticize the Peron regime, or if she may have helped the Nazis spirit away their loot?
I asked Mr. Ruttenstein, who has seen only 20 minutes of the film version, exactly what the appeal of Evita fashions is to Americans. No one, he included, knows if the movie is any good, and Madonna has yet to carry any movie to the box-office stratosphere. Coronation and tango dresses are unlikely to play well at the office or on the sidelines of the kids' soccer field. Do Americans even know who Evita is? Could Eva Braun ready-to-wear be far behind? What's it all about?
"You tell me," he said with a bemused shrug. "Evita was a woman of great power and beauty who wore expensive clothes and who had an international fashion reputation," he continued, then added sotto voce, "Some say she was mean."
Across the country -- in Superior, Ariz., where he's shooting a new film -- Oliver Stone spoke by phone about the incipient Evita rage. Mr. Stone took a lot of heat from historians last year for his movie "Nixon" -- which presented the former President occasionally slurring his words when drinking, a view since vindicated by recently released Nixon tapes. Mr. Stone also wrote an early draft of "Evita," enough of which survives in the finished movie for him to have been awarded co-credit for its screenplay by the Writers Guild.
But no historians are hounding him about Eva Peron; unlike the sartorially challenged Nixon, she gets a free pass.
Though not unsympathetic to Evita, Mr. Stone points out that she was "a whore -- a high-class whore." She "despoiled the country and ruined it economically," he added. "She was pretty much a Socialist. She hated the rich." Is this a fashion idol for affluent America in the 90's?
"What do Americans care about substance?" the director asked rhetorically. "The look is more important. Fashion becomes the idea, and that's what is sold."
Perhaps if "Evita" does as well as another Disney holiday release, "101 Dalmatians" (which itself is prompting a fashion craze for black-and-white spotted prints, USA Today reports), there will be "Evita" fashions for the whole family: Barbie-like Evita dolls laid out in little clear-plastic caskets, or, for that special man, a Fascist-chic line inspired by Eva's strongarm husband, Juan. A sash and jackboots, I've often felt, might be just the thing for New Year's Eve.

Big Mac II

SERIES: Sunday's column explored why no two countries that both have a McDonald's have ever fought a war against each other. This examines why McDonald's became a "glocal" company -- both global and local.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill.

 BODY:
The folks at McDonald's like to tell the story about the young Japanese girl who arrived in Los Angeles, looked around and said to her mother: "Look, mom, they have McDonald's here too."
You could excuse her for being surprised that McDonald's was an American company. With 2,000 restaurants in Japan, McDonald's Japan, a.k.a. "Makadonaldo," is the biggest McDonald's franchise outside the U.S. The McDonald's folks even renamed Ronald McDonald in Japan "Donald McDonald" because there's no "R" sound in Japanese. 
 "You don't have 2,000 stores in Japan by being seen as an American company," said James Cantalupo, head of McDonald's International. "Look, McDonald's serves meat, bread and potatoes. They eat meat, bread and potatoes in most of the world. It's how you package it and the experience you offer that counts."
The way McDonald's has packaged itself is to be a "multi-local" company. That is, by insisting on a high degree of local ownership, and by tailoring its products just enough for local cultures, McDonald's has avoided the worst cultural backlashes that some other U.S. companies have encountered. Not only do localities now feel a stake in McDonald's success, but more important, countries do. Poland for instance has emerged as one of the largest regional suppliers of meat, potatoes and bread for McDonald's in Central Europe. That is real power. Because McDonald's is gradually moving from local sourcing of its raw materials to regional sourcing to global sourcing. One day soon, all McDonald's meat in Asia might come from Australia, all its potatoes from China. Already, every sesame seed on every McDonald's bun in the world comes from Mexico. That's as good as a country discovering oil.
This balance between local and global that McDonald's has found is worth reflecting upon. Because this phenomenon we call "globalization" -- the integration of markets, trade, finance, information and corporate ownership around the globe -- is actually a very American phenomenon: it wears Mickey Mouse ears, eats Big Mac's, drinks Coke, speaks on a Motorola phone and tracks its investments with Merrill Lynch using Windows 95. In other words, countries that plug into globalization are really plugging into a high degree of Americanization.
People will only take so much of that. Therefore, to the extent that U.S.-origin companies are able to become multi-local, able to integrate around the globe economically without people feeling that they are being culturally assaulted, they will be successful. To the extent they don't, they will trigger a real backlash that will slam not only them but all symbols of U.S. power. Iran now calls the U.S. "the capital of global arrogance."
People in other cultures cannot always distinguish between American power, American exports, American cultural assaults and globalization. That's why you already see terrorists lashing out at U.S. targets not for any instrumental reason, but simply to reject this steamroller of globalization/Americanization, which has become so inescapable. (The McDonald's people have a saying: Sooner or later McDonald's is in every story. Where did O. J. eat just before the murder of Nicole? McDonald's. What did Commerce Secretary Ron Brown serve U.S. troops just before he died? McDonald's . . .)
"You try to shut the door and it comes in through the window," says the historian Ronald Steel about globalization. "You try to shut the window and it comes in on the cable. You cut the cable, it comes in on the Internet. And it's not only in the room with you. You eat it. It gets inside you."
The only answer is multi-localism -- democratizing globalization so that people everywhere feel some stake in how it impacts their lives. "McDonald's stands for a lot more than just hamburgers and American fast food," argued Mr. Cantalupo. "Cultural sensitivity is part of it too. There is no 'Euroburger.' . . . We have a different chicken sandwich in England than we do in Germany. We are trying not to think as a cookie cutter."

HEADLINE: Ford Returning to Suburb, Souring Detroit Real Estate Shift

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Dealing a blow to this city's hopes of an economic revival, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it was moving 2,500 office workers out of the downtown area and back to its base in suburban Dearborn.
Ford plans to transfer all of its workers out of the Renaissance Center, a complex of five skyscrapers that the General Motors Corporation bought this autumn, by the end of 1998. G.M. is moving its headquarters from a 74-year-old midtown office building to the downtown center. 
 Ford had a lease through 2005 on one 39-story tower and part of another at the Renaissance Center. The company will sell the lease to G.M., along with 26 acres of adjacent riverfront land that Ford has used for employee parking, Ford officials said.
The deal is a setback for Detroit because the city does not want to lose to the suburbs the 6,600 workers, including Ford employees, who now work in the Renaissance Center. Detroit, the nation's poorest big city, according to average household income, needs high-paying office jobs, partly because it levies a 1.5 percent income tax on commuters and a 3 percent income tax on residents.
Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit has already announced plans to move the city government out of the downtown City Hall and into G.M.'s old headquarters in midtown Detroit. The hope is to make space available downtown for Renaissance Center tenants.
But Wayne S. Doran, the chairman of Ford's real estate subsidiary, said the City Hall building did not have enough room for the 2,500 employees. And he said Ford already had a lot of space becoming available at a building it owns in Dearborn across the street from its headquarters. The company's sales, marketing and customer-assistance operations will move there.
Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for sales and marketing, said that the company was encouraging its advertising agencies to stay in Detroit.
Mr. Rewey said that while no modern office buildings available in the city had the space to hold Ford's huge staff, there was plenty of space for smaller businesses.
Mayor Archer said in a telephone interview this afternoon that he understood Ford's reasons for moving but hoped that the company would build its next assembly plant in the city. In a separate shift, the Ford family is moving the Detroit Lions football team downtown from suburban Pontiac, and Ford Motor has bought the right to name the new stadium.
G.M.'s decision to buy the Renaissance Center was hailed at the time as a sign that Detroit was showing signs of revitalization. By transferring workers from all over Michigan, G.M. will eventually have nearly 9,000 workers in the complex, compared with only 5,400 at the current midtown headquarters.
But if all of the 6,600 people now in the partly full center end up working in the suburbs, the city would wind up with fewer high-paying office jobs than it had before the real estate shuffle began.
G.M. plans to build parking decks on part of the 26 acres of land where Ford has had huge swaths of pavement next to the Detroit River. The parking decks will allow G.M. to open up the riverfront to the public, perhaps by building a promenade along the water, said Peter C. Rowe, a G.M. spokesman.
G.M.'s purchase of the Renaissance Center has been a financial coup as well as a public relations bonanza for the company, the nation's biggest.
Using an intermediary to disguise its intentions, G.M. paid just $73 million for the steel and glass complex, which cost Ford and its other investors $350 million to build in the late 1970's.
Mr. Rowe said that in buying the Ford lease and the 26 acres, G.M. had paid "a fraction of what we paid for the building."

HEADLINE: Administration Renews Efforts on Prevention of Repetitive Motion Injuries

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
With Congressional restrictions removed in the new budget year, the Clinton Administration said today that it planned to renew its efforts to set mandatory rules to prevent repetitive motion injuries at work.
 Ailments caused by repeated motions are the fastest-growing category of workplace injury. Hundreds of thousands of American workers, from meatpackers to computer programmers, are afflicted each year. 
 The economic cost of repetitive motion injuries is estimated at $20 billion annually in payments of compensation claims, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Related costs, like absenteeism, could lift the total to $100 billion, the agency says.
The Administration's plan, outlined in a session with reporters attended by Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, and Joseph A. Dear, the Assistant Secretary of Labor who heads OSHA, is another sign of revived activism by the Government and the courts to deal with repetitive motion injuries.
Last month, California regulators approved the nation's first law intended to ease the growing problem of repetitive motion injuries. And it was announced on Monday that a Federal jury in Brooklyn had awarded nearly $6 million to three women who suffered arm, wrist and hand injuries while working on computer keyboards made by the Digital Equipment Corporation.
Most business groups agree that repetitive motion injuries are costly, but they have opposed Federal standards. Since 1990, OSHA has been working on an ergonomic standard to protect workers. But until now, the effort was bogged down by the heated politics surrounding the field of ergonomics, a discipline that tries to design jobs and tools to fit the physical limits of workers.
Supporting business groups, conservative Republicans last summer attached an amendment to the budget bill that would have eliminated money for OSHA's ergonomic effort and barred collection of information on the problem. The amendment was defeated after some Republicans, who had supported earlier cuts, joined Democrats in opposing it. In the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the safety agency no longer faces Congressional prohibitions on setting ergonomic standards.
"We can now proceed," Mr. Reich said, "and the Administration is 100 percent behind moving forward."
Yet the Administration appears to be taking a more conciliatory approach toward the rule-writing process than it had a few years ago. Mr. Reich would not predict when OSHA might issue ergonomic rules.
The new plan, Mr. Reich said, emphasizes building a consensus among business groups, workers and medical experts. An earlier draft proposal covered much of industry, but now, he said, OSHA is considering different standards for different activities, like computer keyboard typing, lifting and assembly-line work.
"Certainly, one of the things we are looking at is moving step by step," Mr. Reich said.
An early move in the consensus-building effort will be a two-day conference in Chicago early next year, sponsored by OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a research agency. The conference, Jan. 8 and 9, will include companies and ergonomic experts, who will discuss programs for preventing repetitive motion injuries.
Soon after the conference, the Government will compile, publish and distribute a "technical assistance manual of best practices by companies," said Mr. Dear of OSHA. "We want to make the successes of companies that have made real progress available to other companies."
This time, Mr. Dear said, the rule-writing process will be focused on workplace environments "where the problems are most severe and where the solutions are well-known."
A new research effort will guide the rule-writing. OSHA's research arm is doing a scientific review on injuries from repetitive activity. That review is seeking cause-and-effect links between certain kinds of work and injuries, and it is expected to be completed early next year.
The Administration's new emphasis on seeking common ground with business on the ergonomic issue is a political necessity, given the power of business lobbyists in Washington.
"If we don't have the cooperation of the American business community," Mr. Reich said, "it is anybody's guess when we would have a standard. It could be years."
Some experts say that enlisting the support of business is worthwhile, but that OSHA will have to take the lead in setting ergonomic standards.
"If you wait around for the business community to give its blessing, it's not going to happen," said Dr. David Rempel, a professor of occupational medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.
Business groups support the education and research side of OSHA's plan, but say mandatory Government rules have yet to be justified.
"We don't have the kind of certainty from the medical community yet that would justify imposing a costly regulation on business," said Albert Lundeen, a spokesman for the National Coalition on Ergonomics, a group, supported by business, that opposes Federal standards.

Bond Prices Fall as Data Are Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities slumped yesterday in light, choppy trading as investors waited for reports on inflation and retail sales that are to be released in the next few days.
The 30-year bond dropped 12/32 in price, to a 1005/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.49 percent, from 6.46 percent on Monday. 
 Analysts said that there was a modest negative reaction in the morning to a weekly report on sales at chain stores, issued by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Schroder Wertheim, which showed a 1 percent jump in the week ended Dec. 7. Signs of strong sales alarm bond traders because they hint at possible inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
In the afternoon, though, the LJR Redbook Research report, which tracks national retail sales, drew only a negligible response despite showing a rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in December's first week.
The market also largely ignored comments suggesting a healthy economy by Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, which meets again next Tuesday. Mr. Hoenig said that he expected growth of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent and that a low unemployment rate could be maintained.
Several other indicators were also somewhat bearish for the market. A regional business survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond indicated somewhat higher inflation. Prices of retail goods rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, the survey showed, compared with a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.
The dollar was down yesterday, making bonds less attractive to foreign investors. The price of oil, which traders watch closely for signs of inflation, did not fall as much as expected.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said trading was quiet in what he called a "nonevent day."
Mr. Regan said traders were waiting to see the Producer Price Index, to be issued today, and the Consumer Price Index tomorrow along with the monthly report on retail sales for November. Wall Street is looking for an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent to four-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index and an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent to four-tenths of 1 percent in the core index, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, he said.
Mr. Regan said that despite the relative calm of the bond market yesterday, undercurrents of concern remained from comments last week by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who questioned the high valuation of the stock market.
"The Fed chairman's remarks last week are still in the back of traders' minds," Mr. Regan said. "They know he doesn't shoot from the hip, he doesn't make off-the-cuff remarks, and he doesn't have to answer to anybody for the next four years."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Worsened in Third Quarter

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit surged to $48 billion from July through September, the highest quarterly total in history, the Commerce Department reported today.
The imbalance in the current account, the broadest measure of trade, increased by 19.3 percent from a second-quarter deficit of $40.2 billion, as American exports fell for the first time in three years. 
 The results reflected an increase of seven-tenths of a percent in merchandise imports, which rose to $201.5 billion in the third quarter.
At the same time, merchandise exports fell 2.1 percent, to $149.9 billion, the first quarterly setback since the summer quarter of 1993. The current account measures not only sales of goods but also services, investment flows and foreign aid.
The rise in imports and drop in exports translated into a 9.8 percent increase, to $51.6 billion, in the deficit in goods.
America also suffered a 7.8 percent rise in the deficit in investment earnings, to $4.7 billion, and a six-tenths of a percent increase in the category that tracks foreign aid payments, which rose to $9.42 billion.
Offsetting these deficits, America as usual had a surplus in services, items like airline tickets and royalty payments. But the $17.8 billion services surplus was down 3.5 percent from the second quarter even though royalty payments, reflecting fees foreigners paid to broadcast the Olympic Games in Atlanta, were up.
The $48 billion overall deficit surpassed the old record of $43.2 billion set in the fourth quarter of 1987. So far this year, the current account deficit is running at an annual rate of $164 billion, far ahead of last year's $148.1 billion deficit.
American trade deficits have risen every year of President Clinton's term despite the fact that he has made reducing trade imbalances a key foreign policy priority.
The Administration has said that the deficit reflects the fact that the United States economy is growing much faster than that of other countries, lifting import demand.
Administration officials had pointed out that despite the sluggishness overseas, American export sales were rising to new records.
American exports of goods had turned in a string of gains, but the $3.2 billion dip in the third quarter was certain to raise concerns that continued sluggishness overseas and the rising value of the dollar were starting to cut into export gains.
A higher foreign exchange value for the dollar makes United States goods more expensive abroad.

Japan's Deficit Narrows
 TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 11 (Bloomberg Business News) -- Japan's current account surplus shrank 19.6 percent in October from a year earlier as Japanese investors sought higher returns overseas, the Ministry of Finance said today.
The narrowing, which was slightly more than expected, was the 22d decline in the last 23 months, as Japan's deficit in services continued to grow. Japan spent 657.9 billion yen more on services than it sold.
The merchandise trade portion of the current account contracted 11.7 percent from a year earlier as imports increased for the 27th consecutive month. The decline was within expectations.

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek to Shrink Size of Albany's Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Democratic state legislators began laying the groundwork today for a campaign to scale back the final phase of the state's three-year income tax cut, releasing a study showing that increases in property taxes and other local fees in 1995 far outpaced savings from the tax cut.
Using statistics collected from a variety of state and local government agencies, the report shows that local fees and taxes took an additional $1.54 billion from taxpayers in 1995, while the first phase of the income tax cut that year gave them back $515 million. The study took into consideration increases in property taxes, tuition for state and city colleges, bus and subway fares and fees for things like sewer permits and fire inspections. 
 The report's author, State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Democrat of Manhattan, said the study bolstered the contention of many urban Democrats and labor unions that the income tax cut had increased pressure on local governments to raise taxes and fees to compensate for reductions in state aid.
Though Mr. Leichter acknowledged that many local governments were increasing taxes and fees before 1995, he contended that the state had fallen into a worse position to bail out distressed towns, cities and school districts because of the tax cut.
"It is really a great-load shifting," he said in an interview. "The Feds are shifting cost onto the state, and the state is shifting that onto localities, who have no way to pay for it other than by raising taxes and fees."
With the state facing as much as a $3 billion budget shortfall next year and the prospect of having to reduce services, Senator Leichter and a group of Democratic legislators, mostly from New York City, said they would resume their effort to push the Legislature to roll back the income tax cut. The final phase of that cut, which is scheduled to take affect on Jan. 1, is expected to reduce state revenues by $1.8 billion.
Mr. Leichter said he would introduce legislation in January that would repeal the final phase of the tax cut for families with incomes over $100,000 and end a variety of tax shelters for corporations. He said the two measures would save the state $1.1 billion that could be used to close the projected budget shortfall.
The bill would also increase taxes on people making over $150,000 a year and use the revenues, estimated at $1 billion a year, for school repairs and construction.
Senator Leichter's group faces a steep uphill battle, since even Democratic legislative leaders, including the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, have said they will oppose any changes to the tax cut. The Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Gov. George E. Pataki, who pushed the tax cut through the Legislature, have also vowed to block any attempts to scale it back.
Aides to Mr. Pataki called Mr. Leichter's report misleading. They said that increases in local taxes and fees in 1995 resulted from the policies of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and not the 1995 tax cut.
"Governor Pataki has reversed these damaging polices," said Patricia A. Woodworth, the budget director, "by implementing job-creating tax cuts, cutting red tape and dramatically reforming the workers' compensation system."
According to Senator Leichter's report, revenues from local fees and fines increased by $930 million in 1995. Tuition increases for the state and city university systems of New York cost students an additional $211 million. Increases in transit fares around the state cost bus and subway riders an additional $311 million.
The report found that New York City and many counties did not raise local taxes in 1995. But towns, villages and upstate cities collected $132 million in additional revenue from property taxes in 1995, which represented a sharp increase over previous years.
The third phase of the tax cut will give back $367 a year, or $30 a month, to a family of four with an annual income of $50,000.
Aides to Mr. Pataki said that the fact that many local governments were collecting more money from local taxes and fees might simply be an indication of an improving economy -- and not higher tax rates. But officials with groups representing local governments said that many cities, towns, counties and villages had been raising taxes and fees in recent years -- and some of them blamed the trend in part on the income tax cut.
"Cutting state income taxes has limited the state's ability to fund revenue sharing," said Peter Baynes, deputy director of the New York State Conference of Mayors, referring to a type of unrestricted state aid to local governments. "The property tax is the only place to turn to offset it."
But Peter D. Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a politically conservative policy group, said there was little evidence that state tax cuts caused local governments and school districts to raise taxes and fees.
"That doesn't mean local taxes can't go up for other reasons," said Professor Salins, who has studied the impact of state tax cuts on local property taxes in New Jersey. "But our model showed there is no link to changes in state taxes."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Chief Economist Accepts Post at World Bank

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Joseph E. Stiglitz, who served for the last year and a half as chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said today that he would leave the Clinton Administration early next year to become chief economist at the World Bank.
Mr. Stiglitz's departure, which had been expected, leaves President Clinton with another post to fill as he continues to consider possible choices to lead the Commerce, Labor, Energy, Transportation and Housing Departments as well as the National Economic Council. 
 White House officials said it was possible that Mr. Clinton would be ready to name most of his second-term economic team at a news conference scheduled for Friday, although it is unclear whether the White House has a replacement in mind already for Mr. Stiglitz, who formally told the President on Monday of his decision to leave.
Administration officials said there would probably be a number of candidates. One possibility, they said, is Alicia H. Munnell, a former top Treasury official who because of a vacancy is currently the only other member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Clinton had considered naming her to the Federal Reserve several years ago but backed down after a fierce protest from the banking industry over her co-authorship of a study that found widespread discrimination in mortgage lending. But because she has already been confirmed by the Senate as a member of the council, she would not have to undergo confirmation to become its chairwoman.
Two Administration officials said tonight, however, that the job was not likely to go to Ms. Munnell. It was unclear whether Ms. Munnell wanted the job and she did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Another possibility, officials said, is Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University who was previously vice chairman of the Fed and before that a member of the council under Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Stiglitz's job made him the President's chief economist, providing both an overview of the economy's performance as well as analysis of the economic implications of policy options.
But although he had a hand in shaping Administration policy on a wide range of issues, from simplifying pensions to deregulating the telecommunications industry, he was never part of the Administration's inner circle. Moreover, he chose to keep a relatively low public profile, never taking on a big role as a spokesman for the Administration's economic policies.
Mr. Stiglitz, 53, holds a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was a professor at Stanford University before coming to Washington in 1993 as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under his predecessor, Laura D'Andrea Tyson. He replaced Ms. Tyson as chairman in mid-1995 when she was named to head the National Economic Council, a job she is now leaving.
In leaving for the World Bank, Mr. Stiglitz will be joining an institution undergoing a sweeping re-examination of its role in promoting development in the world's poor nations at a time when private investment is overshadowing the more limited public aid traditionally supplied by multilateral lending institutions.
Mr. Stiglitz, who has long studied development issues and who worked in Africa years early in his career, said he hoped to combine his practical experience in government with his scholarly interest in how to promote economic growth to help make the World Bank a more effective resource for developing nations.
"My job here was one of the most interesting you could imagine," Mr. Stiglitz said in an interview, adding that he at first was not interested when he was approached about the World Bank job over the summer.
"Then I thought about it some more and decided that on the issues I'm most concerned with -- problems of poverty, problems of growth -- the challenges in less developed countries were much greater," he said.

Iraq Reopens Pipeline To Send Oil Abroad
Iraq began to pump oil abroad for the first time in six years as President Saddam Hussein reopened a 616-mile pipeline that will deliver Iraqi crude to terminals on the Turkish coast.
But experts said that the first oil to emerge from the pipeline would be suitable only for asphalt. They said it could be weeks before the limited quantity of oil Iraq will be permitted to sell under a United Nations plan reaches the world market. [Page A3.]
 
Crude oil prices fell sharply on news that Iraqi oil was likely to return to the market. [D9.]
 
Rebound in Stocks Slows
Investors took profits after Monday's big stock market rally. The Dow industrials eked out a gain of 9.31 points, to 6,473.25, but broader indexes were mostly lower. [D10.]
 
Hardware Co-ops Plan to Merge
Seeking to compete with giants like Home Depot, two of the largest hardware co-ops -- Cotter & Company, which is owned by Truevalue hardware dealers, and Servistar -- announced plans to merge. [D2.]
 
Trade Deficit Hits Record
The United States trade deficit surged 19.3 percent in the third quarter, to the highest quarterly total in history. The current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade, increased to $48 billion from $40.2 billion in the second quarter, as American exports fell for the first time in three years. [D10.]
 
Sun Announces Backing for Java
Sun Microsystems said that more than 100 companies -- with the conspicuous exception of Microsoft, which apparently was not invited to join in -- agreed to adhere to rules meant to make Sun's Java programming language the lingua franca of network applications. [D2.]
 
High-Technology Trade Deal Near
The United States and the European Union appeared to come within striking distance on an accord that would pave the way for a global pact to liberalize trade in information technology. [D4.]
 
New Push on Workplace Ailment
One day after it was announced that a jury had awarded nearly $6 million to three women who suffered arm, wrist and hand injuries while working on computer keyboards made by Digital Equipment, the Clinton Administration said that it planned to renew its efforts to set rules to prevent such injuries at work. [A24.]
 
Clinton Adviser
To World Bank
Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for the last year and a half, said that he would leave the Clinton Administration early next year to become chief economist at the World Bank. [D2.]
 
TV Ratings Plan Is Criticized
As a television industry group puts the finishing touches on its proposed ratings system, opposition is growing among educational and parents' organizations that say the system will not provide the information parents need. [A1.]
 
Enron Promotes Energy Trader
Enron named as its No. 2 executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, who built up a huge business trading natural gas and electricity. The move shows how quickly the trading and marketing of gas and electricity are growing in importance because of utility deregulation and how hard companies are scrambling to keep up. [D6.]

Ford Moving Workers to Suburbs
Ford Motor said it was moving 2,500 office workers from downtown Detroit to its base in suburban Dearborn, Mich., a blow to the city's hopes of an economic revival. [B14.]

HEADLINE: New York City Hears of Surplus, But Big Budget Gaps Lie Ahead

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Heady profits on Wall Street are generating so much extra revenue from income and business taxes that New York City may end its fiscal year with a surplus of nearly $350 million, city officials said yesterday. But even with this unanticipated boon, the city still faces huge projected gaps in its budgets for the next several years because its spending continues to grow faster than its revenues.
That jarring juxtaposition presents Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani with a weighty series of choices as he begins his re-election campaign, forcing him to balance his political needs and his fiscal ones. 
 Should he spend the surplus to try to bolster his standing with voters who may be weary from years of steep budget cuts? Or should he save it to close future shortfalls?
The projected surplus of nearly $350 million comes on top of another $450 million in unexpected revenue that Mayor Giuliani last month said the city would reap because its economy, which had been anemic, has been rebounding.
Yet even as the Mayor was mulling over how to use these windfalls, his aides disclosed yesterday that he had ordered $400 million in new spending reductions for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
The contrast underscores a sobering truth about the city's financial condition: its current good fortune has done little to cure its long-term ills. So if and when the stock market boom wanes, the city will be left with the same longstanding financial difficulties.
"We have not solved the deficit problem," said the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. "We are getting a good boost from the tremendous Wall Street growth, but I don't know how long that can be sustained."
Next year, in fact, the city must patch a projected gap of $1.2 billion to $2 billion in its $34 billion budget, all but insuring that Mr. Giuliani will have to cut money for a range of services, anything from street cleaning to free concerts to community centers for the elderly.
The projected shortfall for the year 2000 could be as big as $5 billion, the largest in the city's history.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, acknowledged that the projected shortfalls for the next few years were large, but he said the Mayor had made "sensible reductions" to close them.
"You cannot address a structural budget deficit problem that occurred over many, many years overnight," Mr. Mastro said. "You have to do it in a responsible, phased-in way over time."
Mr. Mastro said Mr. Giuliani would not take politics into consideration when allocating the extra revenue. "You can't made decisions on that basis," Mr. Mastro said. "This Mayor makes decisions based on what is in the city's best interests."
The Mayor's aides said it was too early to discuss what the administration would do with the nearly $350 million that Mr. Hevesi said the city would probably have when the 1997 fiscal year ends on June 30.
The aides noted that in the last two years the administration has recorded smaller year-end surpluses after undertaking heavy cuts, largely because of accounting methods. It then essentially rolled that money into the next fiscal year. But this year, with the election looming, Mr. Giuliani might feel more pressure to spend now.
In his plans for the $450 million in additional tax revenues that he announced last month, Mr. Giuliani appeared to balance political and fiscal imperatives.
He allocated $70 million for textbooks for the public schools, seeking to improve his record on education, which his Democratic opponents have contended was one of his weaknesses. But he said he would use the rest of the $450 million for closing budget gaps.
The city's projected budget gaps in the coming years stem from its inability to tame expenditures, which are rising faster than revenues, people who study municipal finances say. The increased taxes from Wall Street earnings helped the city cover those rising costs this year, but officials concede that they cannot always count on a soaring stock market to balance their books.
"The gods of Wall Street smiled on us this year, but we don't know if they will do so next year," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.'
While the Mayor and his aides discount the role of politics in shaping the budget, one of the major reasons for the large projected gaps is the labor contract that Mr. Giuliani negotiated with the city's municipal unions in 1995. Under that agreement, the unions accepted the first two years without wage increases, with the raises put off until the end of next year.
So the Mayor does not have to grapple with billions of dollars in costs to the budget from the contract until the 1999 and 2000 fiscal years -- after his re-election campaign.
In calculating the projected budget shortfalls in future years, the Giuliani administration assumes that Wall Street will have an average year. If the financial sector continues its strong earnings next year, the gap could be reduced for the 1998 fiscal year, but not nearly enough to close it, administration officials said.
The administration has emphasized in recent weeks to both city workers and the public that the recent good news from Wall Street should not bring complacency.
Giuliani aides said they feared that if people thought that the city's hard times were behind it, they would have trouble pushing through cuts that they said were necessary to balance the budget next year. The Mayor has ruled out raising taxes to bring in more revenue.
The Mayor's budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, recently sent a memo to agency heads asking them to come up with $400 million in new cuts for the next fiscal year. That amount is in addition to another $300 million in cuts the Mayor ordered last month for the next fiscal year.
"Although the changes for 1997 included a one-time infusion of revenue from increased economic activity," Mr. Lhota wrote, "we should not be misled into believing that the budget gap for fiscal year 1998 has been solved. Serious work needs to be done to balance fiscal year 1998."

HEADLINE: Acrimony at Hearing on Revising Rules for Liver Transplants

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 10

 BODY:
A Government hearing on proposed changes in the way livers are allocated for lifesaving transplants offered a rare glimpse today of acrimony among transplant centers.
The three-day hearing was called by the Department of Health and Human Services to discuss the changes proposed by the group that sets national rules for the allocation of organs, the United Network for Organ Sharing. The department oversees the group and could alter or scuttle the proposal. 
 The organ group set off a storm of protest last month when it proposed giving preference to patients whose livers suddenly failed and who would die within days without a transplant. In doing so, the group would put chronically ill patients, who are also on the verge of death, second in line behind those who suddenly face liver failure.
It would thus impose rationing, giving livers to those among the most needy who are most likely to survive rather than those who are sickest. In addition, the group proposed adjusting the criteria for determining how urgently patients need livers, and it encouraged regions to share organs among themselves.
The organ group's board argued that its new policies would help insure that livers were distributed more equitably. But several large transplant centers, like the University of Pittsburgh and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, were outraged, saying patients would suffer and die.
For medical centers, a successful transplant program is a mark of prestige and often an economic lifeline. Changes in the liver allocation rules can influence which program flourishes and which withers.
Two things are driving the disputes: a shortage of livers for transplants, and what some view as an unfair system in which how long a patient waits for a liver can depend on where the patient's liver transplant center is and how the patient's doctors decide to describe his or her illness. In 1995, the organ group reported, 44,101 people were on regional waiting lists for livers. But just 3,923 transplants were performed.
Dr. Goram Klintmalm, who is at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and who was the liver surgeon for the baseball star Mickey Mantle, noted that patients at his center who were not literally within weeks of death waited 300 days on average for a liver. In Houston, Dr. Klintmalm said, the average wait was 132 days, and in San Antonio it was 123 days.
Liver transplant surgeons contended today at the first day of the hearing that some centers purposely stretched the truth when they reported on how sick a patient was, pushing their patients up the waiting list. And that, said Dr. Mitchell Shiffman, a liver specialist at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, has made some centers reluctant to want to share organs on a national basis, which is the reason waiting times can vary so much by region. Surgeons, Dr. Shiffman said, do not always trust doctors they do not know well to be honest about their patients' needs.
Dr. John Fung, a liver surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh, said other medical centers, which he did not name, transplanted livers into patients whose chances of survival were not improved by the operation. Dr. Fung said such patients might have a 90 percent chance of surviving a year without a new liver and the same chance of surviving a year with one.
Underlying many of the debates is a rapidly changing medical arena, liver experts said. Liver transplants began to emerge as a strikingly successful procedure in the late 1980's, when the field was dominated by the University of Pittsburgh, the pioneer in liver transplantation. Eight years ago, Dr. Shiffman said, 10 medical centers did 80 percent of the transplants. Now, he said, 50 centers do 80 percent of the transplants.
And the largest centers are losing business fast, said Dr. Roger Evans, an economist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. In Pittsburgh, he said, the number of transplants fell to 298 in 1995 from 569 in 1990. Not only are there many more centers, he said, but also some centers like Pittsburgh are not part of managed care networks. They are losing business because managed-care companies have struck deals elsewhere.
One speaker at today's hearing, Dr. Anthony D'Alessandro, a transplant surgeon at the University of Wisconsin, said, "We are here because of a very vocal minority of transplant centers who are well connected." They hope, he said, that the rules can be made to "allow them to flourish as they once did."
Dr. Evans said part of the argument over the proposed new allocation rules was simply an effort by some large centers to advance their own interests. For example, Dr. Evans said, large and well-known centers tend to have large waiting lists consisting of very sick people. Under the old policies, those patients had the same priority for livers as patients who suddenly became ill and were rushed to the nearest center.
But Dr. Fung said he opposed the new rules because his patients would be cheated.
"Patients feel they can't win the Lotto game if they can't get a Lotto ticket," he said. And, he said, it makes sense to direct livers to Pittsburgh because his center gets better results.
Some patients, family members and others also said they were upset by the proposed changes. One patient, Nathaniel Semple, who had three liver transplants at the University of Pittsburgh in 1989, said the new policies would be "horrendous." He said the organ group "has to give doctors some sense of an opportunity to decide who would do well."
Yet, said many who support the proposed new policies, since the total number of livers is the same, there will always be some who win and some who lose in the scramble for the precious organs.
What the organ group is trying to do, Dr. Evans said, is shift the emphasis so that the livers will go to those who are most likely to survive.
Addressing his colleagues, Dr. D'Alessandro, the Wisconsin transplant surgeon, said: "Over the next three days, you will hear from patients. Their stories will certainly touch you. These are people facing certain death without transplants. We all care deeply for our patients, but changes in allocations at this time only change the address where a patient dies."
Within three months, Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will submit final rules for allocating livers.

HEADLINE: Bank Robbery Suspect Says He Got Inspiration From TV

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP, L.I., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Anthony Norman has served time for several petty crimes, but when he decided to rob a bank on Monday, he says in a statement to the police, he drew his inspiration from a television program.
The police said Mr. Norman, who was arrested after trying to get away on a commuter train, where he took a passenger hostage, said in his six-page confession that he was watching "Renegade" on television last week on the USA cable channel. 
 "It was about a guy who was robbing banks and getting away with it," Mr. Norman said. "He was putting an empty suitcase on the bank teller's counter and telling the tellers that there was a bomb in it."
And that, the police said, is exactly what Mr. Norman did on Monday morning at the European American Bank in Brentwood, L.I. Except he used a grocery bag from his kitchen and filled it with books.
Dan Martinsen, vice president of media relations for USA Networks, confirmed that an episode of "Renegade" on Friday night involved a series of bank robberies and commented on "the irony of life imitating art." But he added: "Obviously, this guy didn't pay very close attention to the end of the episode, because he does get caught."
Mr. Martinsen has more than an academic interest in the case. He was on the same train, in the same car, when the police say Mr. Norman took a hostage. Mr. Norman later surrendered to a hostage negotiator and proved to be unarmed.
Mr. Martinsen, who sat several rows behind Mr. Norman, said he immediately thought of Colin Ferguson, who opened fire on a Long Island Rail Road train three years ago, killing 6 people and injuring 19. "That all flashed through my mind in a second," he said. "Anyone who rides the railroad and starts seeing guns has to think of that. When the guns came out, I was among those who got out of there fast. Luckily, this time, only the good guys had guns."
Mr. Anthony, 34, is unemployed, with a long record of arrests on Long Island and in New York City. He was arraigned today on one count of bank robbery and held on $75,000 bail.
"I was broke," he said in his statement. "I wanted some money for my girlfriend who lives in Wyandanch, and my eight children. I wanted to buy Christmas presents."
Mr. Norman said he entered the bank at 10:10 A.M. "I scanned the tellers quickly and decided to rob the one closest to the door," he said. "I gave her the note and I put the bag on the counter. She got all panicky and froze. I said to her, 'No floor buzzers, no silent alarms and we'll all be O.K.' "
He fled with $1,949, which he stuffed into his pockets. Witnesses saw him board the 10:18 train and told the police, who met it at Wyandanch, where they cornered him in the eighth car of the 12-car train.
"I got panicky and stuck my hand behind my jacket and backed up," he said in his statement. "The next thing I realized I was sitting on this guy's lap. I put my arm around the guy's shoulder and I told the police that I wasn't going anywhere.
"The cops had their guns drawn. I told them I had a gun. The officers told everybody to get off the train. The officers kept asking me to let the guy go and give myself up. I kept telling them: 'No, I'm not going back to jail. If you want me, you're going to have to take men.' "
The hostage, Jerry Maldanado, 32, a computer analyst, later told the police he thought Mr. Norman was about to shoot him.
Mr. Norman eventually let Mr. Maldanado go, and after long talks with police officers, he surrendered.
Detective Sgt. Peter Burker of the Suffolk robbery squad said it was not unusual for a suspect to say he was inspired to commit a crime by a movie or television program.
"Once or twice every five or six years it happens," Detective Burker said. "But they've been making movies about bank robberies for years. I don't blame the TV show for this robbery."
Dr. Naftali G. Berrill, a professor of forensic psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said studies over the last 20 years have shown that violence on television and in movies can amplify impressions in the minds of children, but, he said, it is rare when it causes an adult to act out something he sees on television.
"There would have to be a defect in an adult's judgment or character to act out a fictional fantasy," he said. "The vast population of adults has the ability and intelligence to differentiate between fantasy and reality."

HEADLINE: Council Vows Defeat of Giuliani's Superstore Plan

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
City Council leaders declared yesterday that they would defeat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to make it easier for superstores to open in the city, dealing a bitter blow to his most ambitious effort to eliminate regulations that he said discouraged investment in New York.
On the eve of the Council's vote on the plan, the Mayor, who has repeatedly said that his proposed zoning changes were vital for the city's continued economic revitalization, harshly criticized the Council's position, saying it was tantamount to a vote against the poor. Those people, he said, stand to benefit the most from the broader selection and lower prices that superstores offer. 
 The superstore plan, which would have allowed an estimated 57 of the giant warehouse-style stores to open in industrial areas, has been an extremely contentious issue in many neighborhoods where local merchants feared that the stores would put them out of business.
But the biggest issue in the failed negotiations with the City Council was a provision in the plan that would have eliminated neighborhood review of the store proposals and removed the Council from the approval process.
The expected defeat does not mean that superstores will not be built in New York; in fact, several have opened in Brooklyn and Queens in the last few years. But without the Mayor's proposed zoning changes, the stores could not open nearly so fast nor in the numbers that the Mayor had wanted.
"The vote against it would be a vote for maintaining the high prices that exist in the city of New York," Mr. Giuliani said. "The City Council is seeking to preserve the status quo, which is harm and injury to people of moderate and low incomes."
Despite the Council's expected vote, Peter F. Vallone, its Speaker, said it was prepared to discuss another plan for attracting more superstores to the city.
"The only thing dead on the issue of megastores is the Mayor's proposal to keep the public's voice completely out of the process," he said.
Responding to the Mayor's accusations that the Council's rejection would hurt the poor, Mr. Vallone said: "His gutter-level rhetoric does not deserve a response. They are simply a smokescreen used to obscure the real issues over public review and treating all superstores equally."
Council leaders have suggested that the administration and the Council jointly propose a scaled-down version of the Mayor's plan next year. But the Mayor said that chances for such a plan were slim.
Mr. Giuliani said he had already agreed to substantial compromises and refused to whittle down his plan any more, adding that the Council's proposals ultimately would not create so many jobs or lower prices so much as he had predicted.
"To allow this debate to continue for another five or six months would have this proposal virtually disappear as anything that really helps someone," he said. "There are times in which it is better not to create the illusion of reform than to go along with being asked for too much."
Mr. Giuliani said he never considered withdrawing his proposal, as the Council repeatedly urged him to do. "This is the time to make your decision on this," he said, "and I'd like it clear as to where and how this plan was rejected."
But even though this plan, which the city's Planning Department started working on when David N. Dinkins was Mayor, will probably not be revived soon, planning officials said they would consider other ways to help encourage retail development in the city.
"This administration will continue to fight for opportunities to bring retail stores into the city of New York," said Joseph B. Rose, director of City Planning. "We're not going to give up on the effort to do that."
Mr. Rose would not elaborate on what other methods could be used, but many megastores have opened across the city by finding large sites in commercial zones, where they are not prohibited, or by taking advantage of loopholes in the existing zoning law. Home Depot, for example, has opened stores in manufacturing areas by calling them hardware stores, a kind of store that is permitted in industrial zones.
Proponents for the Mayor's plan said they were disappointed by the Council's intended vote.
"Had the Mayor's bill gone through, I think it's obvious you would have seen economic activity as a result of it," said Jesse Masyr, a lawyer who has represented megastores like Kmart, Home Depot and Price-Costco.
Kathy Goldman, executive director of the Community Food Resource Center, said that while the Mayor's plan would have encouraged discount retailers and other superstores to open in the city, its biggest benefit would have been an increase in large-scale supermarkets.
Chains like Pathmark and Waldbaum's tend to open stores as large as 60,000 square feet, much larger than the typical New York supermarket's 10,000 square feet.
"Rejecting the Mayor's proposal is a disaster for the city," she said. "There's no question that modern supermarkets would have made a major difference for poor people and for most people who don't have access to these stores."
But Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for small-business owners and supermarket operators, disputed her arguments and those of the Mayor that existing supermarkets were overpriced and served New Yorkers poorly. "Food stores in low-income neighborhoods are as competitive as national chains in the same markets," he said.
Even with the Council's vote, superstores will probably continue to be a controversial topic throughout next year's mayoral campaign. As the Council debated the issue last month, Ruth W. Messinger, Manhattan's Borough President and a likely mayoral candidate, ran radio commercials condemning the plan, and Mr. Giuliani immediately responded with his own ads.
Ms. Messinger yesterday attributed the defeat of the Mayor's plan to what she described as his bad-faith negotiations with the Council.
"The Mayor lost a great opportunity to advance the interests of New Yorkers as consumers, without denying them their rights as citizens," she said. "But then, neither negotiation nor compromise has ever been his strong suit."
Officials estimated that the Mayor's proposal would have brought in 57 new superstores in the next 10 years. Stores of up to 200,000 square feet -- roughly the size of four football fields -- would have been allowed to open in certain industrial areas "as of right," which means without public review or Council approval.
The Council, in turn, had proposed a plan that would have reduced the estimated number of stores to about 25 and would have limited stores to no more than 125,000 square feet.
The Mayor had agreed to lower the size limit to 140,000 square feet, but Mr. Rose said that the administration could not agree to other Council recommendations.
Mr. Rose said that the Council's plan would have eliminated about 70 percent of the land area the Mayor had proposed.
He also said it included unreasonable restrictions that would have made it "virtually impossible to build in Brooklyn" and would have prohibited sites near elevated subways, thus making the stores inaccessible to mass transit.

HEADLINE: Controlling the Risks of Plutonium

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is taking a reasonable if controversial approach toward solving a worrisome problem caused by the dismantling of nuclear weapons in Russia and the United States -- how to get rid of thousands of plutonium "pits" from the warheads that are rapidly accumulating in each country. America will need to dispose of more than 50 tons of excess plutonium. Russia has an even greater stockpile. Until these softball-shaped nuclear cores, now under guard at selected sites in each country, are somehow neutralized, they pose a double threat. Either nation could reverse the course of disarmament and stick the plutonium right back into new weapons. Or thieves, especially in economically distressed Russia, might steal some pits for use in bombs by terrorists or renegade nations.
The Administration has been reviewing dozens of possible solutions, ranging from firing the plutonium into space to burying it in holes so deep as to make the material virtually irretrievable. This week the Energy Department announced two preferred alternatives that will be explored more thoroughly in a "dual-track" approach over the next two years. One approach is to mix the plutonium with highly radioactive nuclear wastes and vitrify the material into glass or ceramic logs, making it difficult, costly and dangerous to extract the plutonium. The other approach is to convert the plutonium into a mixed-oxide fuel that can be burned in nuclear power reactors, a process that leaves a form of spent fuel that is also difficult, costly and dangerous to reprocess. 
 The department's announcement ignited fierce opposition from some private anti-nuclear groups that see an unwarranted retreat from a two-decade-old American policy against the use of plutonium in civilian reactors. That policy was designed to discourage widespread trafficking in plutonium lest it fall into the hands of rogue bomb makers. The critical groups believe that the United States should pursue only a single approach, mixing the plutonium with wastes in molten glass for ultimate burial. They oppose the creation of any fuel-fabrication plants in Russia or America that would create long-term momentum toward a plutonium fuel cycle. They urge Washington to send a strong signal to the rest of the world that plutonium should be treated as a dangerous waste, not a valuable fuel.
But this is a complex and difficult issue for which there is no perfect answer. Indeed, many arms-control experts and groups that were architects of the longstanding American policy against plutonium as a reactor fuel now favor the Energy Department's dual approach. They argue, persuasively, that the risks can be controlled and that the goal of getting rid of surplus warhead material in Russia, which refuses to bury its own plutonium in the form of waste, is of overriding importance.
The rationale for pursuing the dual-track approach is partly technical, to provide insurance in case one approach or the other fails to pan out. But it is also based on diplomatic considerations of how best to influence the Russians. Leaders of the Russian nuclear establishment regard their plutonium as a national energy resource and are adamantly opposed to burying it as waste. There is a real danger that they will either sit on the plutonium indefinitely, leaving it vulnerable to theft or reconstitution into weapons, or will turn it into reactor fuel with the help of European nations that are dedicated to spreading plutonium technology and not much worried about the bomb-making implications. The best way to insure that the Russians handle their plutonium responsibly may be to pursue a parallel and cooperative approach with them.
But before venturing too far down this path, the Administration needs to build in adequate protections. The United States must make it clear that using reactors to rid the world of loose military warheads does not signal an end to American opposition to a plutonium fuel cycle for power reactors. That historic opposition is aimed at preventing the creation of separated plutonium that could be used in weapons. But in this case, the warhead plutonium is already separated and could easily be made into weapons. The urgent task is to neutralize it.
The United States should insist that the Russians burn off their separated warhead material before pursuing their quixotic dream of creating even more separated plutonium for reactor fuel. America should also encourage, and perhaps help to finance, a demonstration plant for vitrification in Russia and explore the feasibility of buying some of the Russian plutonium for disposal as waste. It will take a good two decades or more to get rid of the surplus military plutonium in each country. There is time to fine-tune the approaches.

Korea Fund's Goals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Dec. 9 front-page article: As chairman of the Korea Society, a nonprofit organization that has received support from the Korea Foundation for the past four years, I wish to report that we have been under no pressure whatsoever from that organization with regard to the programs we have conducted or the views we have expressed.
From the outset, the aim of the Korea Foundation appears to have been to increase American awareness and understanding of modern Korea, its culture and traditions. 
 Similar motives have been behind the Korea Foundation's support of Korean studies at several of America's leading universities where little or nothing about Korea had been taught previously. The effect of the Korean Foundation's efforts has been healthy. More about Korea is now being taught, and more young American scholars are entering that field. Results will include better scholarship and better American understanding of a dynamic new economic power in Asia.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Worries on Securities Prices Send Dollar Falling vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against most leading currencies yesterday, hurt by a selloff on Wall Street that reflected anxieties about a possible pullback by foreign investors from American securities. Further hurting the dollar was a suggestion that German interest rates would remain steady and a little more uncertainty about the planned European single currency.
But traders said the main force at work in the currency market was the direction of United States stock and bond prices, which fell when trading opened. The Dow Jones average ended with a 70-point loss, and bond declines pushed long-term yields to the highest level in a month. 
 "I think the dollar's decline is directly related to our asset markets, and foreign capital leaving," said Talbott Young, vice president for foreign exchange at the Signet Banking Corporation in Richmond.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5376 German marks from 1.5505 marks on Tuesday and to 112.97 Japanese yen from 113.41. The British pound traded at $1.6515, down from $1.6537.
Currency dealers have been largely focused on the American securities markets since Friday, when they plunged after comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, asking if Wall Street's run-up reflected "irrational exuberance."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks have continued to haunt a sharply up-and-down market since then. Traders said the anxieties were compounded by an article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal raising the possibility of a drop in Treasury bond prices in the event of a selloff by Japanese investors, the main foreign purchasers. Falling bond prices would diminish the demand for dollars.
The mark derived further strength yesterday after Ernst Welteke, a member of the policy council of the Bundesbank, said in a German on-line business weekly that he saw no immediate reason for a cut in German interest rates.
Also helping the mark was Peter Schmidhuber, another member of the council, who said the European single currency should be delayed if a "critical mass" of countries failed to meet the strict fiscal criteria. Any suggestion of a delay in the currency tends to help the mark, Europe's currency of choice.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
To Concentrate Milosevic's Mind

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Two snapshots of the crisis over Slobodan Milosevic's tyranny:
In Belgrade, one of the thousands of peaceful demonstrators, Dejan Bulatovic, held up an effigy of President Milosevic as a convict. Police arrested him, beat him with clubs, jammed a baton up his rectum, put a rifle in his mouth and threatened to shoot, then put him in an unheated cell with the window fixed open to serve a 25-day sentence for disorderly conduct. 
 In Brussels, the North Atlantic Council said it was "dismayed that the Serbian authorities have ignored the calls of the international community to respect . . . democratic principles." Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he hoped Mr. Milosevic would be as "pragmatic and flexible" as he was at the Dayton peace conference last year.
Those two scenes tell us that the United States and its allies still do not understand the menace of Mr. Milosevic -- or do not want to understand. He makes clear that he has no intention of giving up a gram of his illegitimate power and we go harrumph.
Mr. Milosevic has been playing games, with his own people and the world, over his brazen annulling of opposition victories in Serbian municipal elections. He hinted that he would restore the real results. He told a foreign visitor that he would respect what the Serbian supreme court decided about the issue. Then his stooges on the court upheld his cooking of the elections.
The British Ambassador in Belgrade, Ivor Roberts, allowed himself to be diddled by Mr. Milosevic. He tried to be an intermediary between the Serbian President and the opposition. Mr. Milosevic signaled that he would play, then spurned the Ambassador's efforts at compromise.
By now anyone should see that Mr. Milosevic is not interested in compromise when it comes to his power. He is a classic dictator, reluctant to yield even a little to democracy and the rule of law because he fears his whole network of corruption and intimidation would unravel.
Rigidity has its dangers. Nicolae Ceausescu rejected any change in his Communist dictatorship of Romania until a popular revolution ended in his execution.
Like Ceausescu, too, it appears, Mr. Milosevic is out of touch with reality. Reports from Serbia say that he has no sense of the resentment against him in a country where there is 50 percent unemployment and per capita income has fallen by more than half in the years of his rule.
The U.S. State Department, to its credit, has lately taken a tougher line on Mr. Milosevic. When he shut down the independent radio station B-92, the Voice of America took the bold step of broadcasting B-92's reports. Faced with an effective counter-measure, Mr. Milosevic let B-92 go back on the air.
Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said: "We don't share the conventional wisdom that somehow we need Milosevic more than he needs us." But those strong words do not seem to be reflected in policy: ours or our allies'.
We still treat Mr. Milosevic as a guarantor of peace in Bosnia. He was crucial at Dayton. But we have to understand that his motive there, after the failure of the genocidal war he instigated, was simply to stay in power. He is not at all a key to maintaining the peace now.
What, then, can we do to end a tyranny that could destabilize the Balkans? The first thing is to make clear that we are not going back to Milosevic as usual. That means ending the pretense that he is to be valued as a peacemaker. It means making fundamental political change in Serbia our public, committed objective.
Even more important is getting serious, at last, about war crimes. The North Atlantic Council has just ended another meeting without changing the cynical mandate of international forces in Bosnia: to arrest suspects only if our soldiers happen upon them.
Mr. Milosevic was named as a possible war criminal himself in 1992 by Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who said we had information on the chain of military and political responsibility for the savageries committed in Bosnia. The arrest of some indicted war criminals could concentrate Mr. Milosevic's mind wonderfully.

HEADLINE: Tainted by Corruption, Colombian President Is Ceding Power

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Six months after the Colombian Congress absolved President Ernesto Samper of charges that drug dealers pumped $6 million into his election campaign, the travails of the President and this country of 36 million have grown only more desperate.
Still stigmatized by the corruption charges and with little power or credibility, Mr. Samper appears to have surrendered much of his mandate to the sectors and politicians whose support he has had to rely on to stay in office. As a result, his presidency seems paralyzed. 
 Business leaders fret that the State Department, in its annual review in March of global anti-narcotics efforts, will again find that Colombia has not done enough to fight drugs, and that this time Washington will impose economic sanctions rather than giving Colombia a waiver.
Exporters, most notably in the flower industry, which provides one-fifth of the cut flowers sold in the United States, complain of shipments being held up at entry points in what they suspect is one of Washington's ways of showing its disapproval of Mr. Samper's rule.
An economic recession has increased unemployment by 50 percent over the past year, to figures ranging from 12.4 percent to 18.6 percent. And the arrest of 12 union leaders accused of terrorism threatens to trigger a strike that could shut down pipelines carrying the oil that has become this country's biggest legal source of income.
"The important thing is to apply the law," Luis Carlos Villegas, the president of the National Association of Industrialists, said in an interview Sunday in El Tiempo, a Bogota daily. "Here there is a law of the guerrilla, a law of the drug trafficker, a law of some sectors of government, a law of the delinquent and a law of the jungle. And this has to stop."
The alarm among business leaders is matched by bitterness in the armed forces -- a potentially explosive combination given the vacuum in political authority. Though the military has traditionally not sought to usurp political power, thriving instead as a parallel authority, military leaders have grown increasingly impatient with allegations of human rights violations, and complain of an "attorney general syndrome," a fear that soldiers will be called to account for actions in the field.
The military is particularly irritated by the arrest of a general, Faruk Yanine, on charges that he formed paramilitary groups and took part in the execution of 19 shopkeepers in the central Magdalena region. Though the case against General Yanine is backed by incriminating videotapes, he enjoys the support of Gen. Harold Bedoya, chief of the armed forces.
Paramilitary death squads have assassinated nearly 100 people whom they accused of being leftist guerrillas or sympathizers. Last weekend alone, 17 people, many found with their hands tied behind their backs, were killed this way.
The military has also been upset with the President's decision to order the armed forces to withdraw from 5,600 square miles in southern Colombia, ostensibly to allow leftist guerrillas to surrender 60 soldiers held as prisoners of war.
Landowners are no happier. Several weeks ago, at the annual meeting of the Colombian Society of Farmers, its president lectured a symbolic empty seat to dramatize Mr. Samper's lack of leadership in agricultural policy. In a debate later that day, the governor of Antioquia state, Alvaro Uribe Velez, argued for arming the rural equivalent of the auxiliary police, who ostensibly are to rather intelligence, with long-range weapons and machine guns.
The landowners applauded the proposal.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ex-General Lavish in Praising Mexican Allies in Drug War

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In his nine months as director of national drug control policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey has used broad praise to try to improve the diplomatic cooperation between the United States and Mexico in the war against drugs.
But at the close today of the third meeting this year between narcotics officials of both countries, it remained unclear whether any substantive gains have accompanied the retired Army general's approach. 
 General McCaffrey's determination to improve relations has made him many friends among Mexico's senior officials, partly because he has been unsparing and sometimes even extravagant in his praise. After a meeting in March with Antonio Lozano, then Mexico's Attorney General, General McCaffrey said Mr. Lozano was "a man of tremendous courage and integrity."
In the same speech, he extolled President Ernesto Zedillo, as "a brilliant, patriotic, dedicated man," and then offered a pledge unusual for an American: "I would like to publicly announce that I view myself not only as a public servant of President Clinton, but place myself in that same responsiblity to President Zedillo."
If General McCaffrey sounded enthusiastic, several working-level American narcotics agents have been less so. In recent interviews, many have said they have seen little or no improvement in practical cooperation between the two countries on drug matters.
Among an array of other problems, corruption among low-paid Mexican police officers, and the Mexican Government's unwillingness to support antidrug operations with more resources, continue as major irritants. A recent study by the United States General Accounting Office also drew dismal conclusions about bilateral anti-narcotics efforts in Mexico.
But General McCaffrey today defended the two countries' progress, and he said the meetings held here since Sunday amounted to more than self-congratulations.
"It wasn't just love-ins," General McCaffrey said. "We're trying to build stuff that's real. We're going to do training, evidence, intelligence, equipment. We're going to do real stuff. In nine months, have we moved the ball forward? Absolutely!"
He cited as examples Mexico's recent approval of legislation aimed at combatting organized crime, cracking down on money laundering and controlling chemicals used to make methamphetamines. But his assessment contrasted with the findings of a General Accounting Office study released in June.
"U.S. and Mexican interdiction efforts have had little, if any, impact on the overall flow of drugs through Mexico to the United States," it said. "The amount of cocaine seized and the number of drug-related arrests in Mexico have declined. The current Government of Mexico appears committed to fighting drug trafficking, but, according to United States officials, its efforts are hampered by pervasive corruption of key institutions, economic and political problems, and limited counternarcotics and law enforcement capabilities."
There were problems with continuity at this meeting, since President Zedillo earlier this month summarily dismissed Mr. Lozano and most of his top aides for incompetence, including most of the antidrug officials with whom General McCaffrey had previously worked.
After his first encounters with the new Mexican Attorney General, Jorge Madrazo, and the new Mexican anti-drug coordinator, Gen. Jose Gutierrez Rebollo, General McCaffrey offered his initial assessment:
"My own view, categorically, is that the first factor affecting both of them is integrity. These are patriotic, honest, dedicated men."

HEADLINE: Another Sign Fed May Not Raise Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Except for a surge in energy prices, inflation at the producer level remained benign in November, more reassurance that Federal Reserve policy makers will likely find no need to raise interest rates at their final 1996 meeting next week.
The Labor Department's report on the Producer Price Index showed today that prices of finished goods climbed four-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month, but the bulk of the increase reflected higher energy prices that have already begun to subside and could fall further with the resumption of limited oil exports from Iraq. 
 Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. Economists focused on the performance of the so-called core of the index -- which excludes the energy and food components because of their volatility -- and saw little cause for concern about accelerating inflation. They said that the report contributed only slightly, if at all, to today's swoon in stocks and bonds.
"The underlying story on producer price inflation remains quite favorable," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities.
The core Producer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in November and a remarkably low six-tenths of 1 percent for the latest 12 months, the department reported.
And prices were contained not only at the finished level -- goods ready for sale to the ultimate consumer or business user -- but at the intermediate and crude stages as well.
"When you strip out the crude, intermediate and finished-level energy increases, you find prices behaving themselves quite nicely at all three stages of processing," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group.
A 2.3 percent jump in the price of energy dominated today's report, with residential gas rising 3.8 percent after showing no change in October and gasoline up 2.8 percent, a significant advance though only half its increase in October.
But food, which has shown hefty increases of late, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month, the first decline since April. Prices for dairy products tumbled 4.5 percent and fresh fruits and melons also fell; analysts pointed to good harvests that should keep food prices contained following run-ups earlier in the year. Prices for fresh and dry vegetables, though, soared 16.6 percent in November.
Among intermediate goods, such as sacks of cement, prices inched up two-tenths of 1 percent last month -- one-tenth of 1 percent for goods other than food and energy.
Durable items used in manufacturing advanced four-tenths of 1 percent, reversing an October decline of that size, as the rise in the closely watched prices for copper accelerated to 7.1 percent and various kinds of steel turned higher.
Nondurable goods used in factories edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, with paperboard up 1 percent after falling that much in October and basic organic chemicals also turning up.

HEADLINE: Learning to Love Superstores

BYLINE: By Susan Shapiro; Susan Shapiro, a book critic, is the author of "The Male-to-Female Dictionary."

 BODY:
Growing up as a mall rat in suburban Michigan, I spent long afternoons at the Tel-12 mall, shopping at the cool clothes boutiques and music emporiums. But I always ignored the Kmart. What good was anything so cheap and generic? My beloved Aunt Ettie shopped there, but only because she'd get great discounts on huge Hershey bars and cartons of Chesterfields.
After college I moved to downtown Manhattan. My first day I sat on a bench in Washington Square Park, mesmerized by all the black-clad artists and long-haired guitarists playing Bob Dylan songs. I thought, "Why had my New York-born and bred parents cursed me by moving, before my birth, to the big and bland Middle West?" 
 I swore I'd die in Manhattan, preferably below 14th Street. So imagine my dismay this fall, when I looked out of my fifth-floor apartment on Eighth Street and saw two big red K's for the first time. The new Kmart store took up a whole block. I hated it, and complained as if it was the country's most pressing political issue: Artistic culture marred by crass mass-market materialism. Was Mayor Giuliani trying to turn this beautiful mosaic of a city into a vulgar mall of superstores? A Kmart in Greenwich Village was like McDonald's on the Champs-Elysees.
For weeks, I avoided the store, hoping it would go away. Then, over a quiet Thanksgiving weekend, I ran out to get a caffeine-free Diet Coke. Both delis that usually carried it were out. I walked by Kmart's glass windows, and decided to confront my past along the way. I entered the store slowly, like a tourist who didn't speak the language.
It was huge, clean and virtually empty. On the first floor, I saw inexpensive makeup and clothes in primary colors. Aha! Just what I'd expected: Middle America was invading! I went downstairs. Aisles of brand-name products. But no crowds, no lines. Several rows of uniformed employees, smiling and saying, "How are you today?"
A six-pack of my diet soda, which cost more than $5 at the tiny, charming Indian-owned deli, cost $2.89 at Kmart. Cookies, napkins, a six-pack of toilet paper, everything was in the 89-cent range. For my $10 bill, I got six items, a free bottle of mouthwash and even change. Maybe this was what the Mayor meant when he defended superstores as vital for the city's economic revitalization.
This Kmart was different from the one from my childhood. It was three floors, not one low-rise box. No huge parking lot. I was different, too. Now I was the one paying. After 15 years of watching my money being eaten up by overpriced little stores at every corner, it was refreshing to find so many millions of things I could easily afford. Exciting even.
For a second I saw the store though my parents' eyes. Forty years earlier they couldn't wait to leave Delancey Street, a dozen blocks from where I'd settled in the East Village. ("It's the Lower East Side," My father screamed when I told him where I lived. "The realtors are lying.") The Midwest in the 1950's must have seemed spacious to them. Inviting, affordable. Easy to raise a family. With nothing of their old New York in sight.

HEADLINE: In Jockeying to Lead U.N., Ghanaian Is Moving Ahead

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Kofi Annan, the Ghanaian in charge of United Nations peacekeeping operations, emerged the clear leader today in the race for a new Secretary General. But even as his support was solidifying, there were indications that France, which has veto power, would deny him the job.
With barely three weeks to go until Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's term expires on Dec. 31, the contest has begun to turn almost entirely on big-power politics, with the qualifications and personalities of candidates for the high-profile job relegated to virtual irrelevance. 
 Diplomats familiar with the negotiations among the 15 members of the Security Council say the French, still annoyed at the United States for its veto on a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, do not want the Americans replace him with an English-speaking candidate.
The French are also distressed by informal American and British votes against three other candidates, all from French-speaking countries. No formal vote has been scheduled since Nov. 19, when the United States vetoed Mr. Boutros-Ghali.
The Security Council conducted straw polls today for the second day. After three rounds, in which each member was asked to "encourage" or "discourage" a candidacy, Mr. Annan had settled into a comfortable lead, with 11 positive votes and 4 negative. But one negative vote was from France, which as a permanent member has veto power. A candidate needs nine votes (with no vetoes) to win Security Council approval; the General Assembly formally elects the Secretary General.
Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of the Ivory Coast, remained in second place, but his yes votes had dropped to six, with four countries opposed (including the United States and Britain, both holding vetoes) and four abstaining. Two other candidates, Hamid Algabid of Niger and Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, lost more ground, diplomats said. But they are still in the race, along with Mr. Boutros-Ghali.
Security Council members have promised to consider African candidates first because Africa, following an informal tradition, wants to keep the position of Secretary General in its region for two terms.
Suggestions that some council members, including the United States and Britain, will soon be ready to start looking outside Africa are dismissed by other diplomats, who say China, which portrays itself as a champion of third-world countries, may be prepared to use its veto to block any non-African candidate.
China has so far stayed largely on the sidelines, although it effectively ended the candidacy of Senegal's Foreign Minister, Moustapha Niasse, because Senegal has ties with Taiwan.
France has indicated that it would prevent any serious consideration of a Tanzanian, Salim A. Salim, who was about to be nominated by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa. Mr. Salim, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, does not speak French. He has been vetoed repeatedly by the United States in the past, primarily because he led the campaign to have Taiwan evicted from China's United Nations seat in the early 1970's.
Several other Africans are assumed to be viable candidates if needed. First among them is Olara A. Otunnu, a Ugandan-born citizen of the Ivory Coast who is president of the International Peace Academy, an independent conflict-resolution organization in New York, and has many supporters. He has not been nominated, but diplomats are beginning to say he could become a compromise candidate. Lakhdar Brahimi, an Algerian, and James Jonah of Sierra Leone -- both with diplomatic and United Nations experience -- are mentioned as long shots.
A few delegations, including Russia, according to some diplomats, continue to nurture hopes that a deadlock will reopen the possibility of keeping Mr. Boutros-Ghali in office for another year or two. The United States dismisses such hopes at every opportunity.
There is some urgency to the selection process: the General Assembly is to adjourn its current session on Tuesday.

KOFI ANNAN, 58, of Ghana, has been a career United Nations official since 1962, when he became an administrative officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva. He took a break in 1974-1976 to return to Ghana to take charge of its tourism development, but his long absence from Africa has made him a stranger to many from his home continent. But Mr. Annan, who is now Under Secretary General for peacekeeping operations, enjoys considerable popularity in the United Nations. The perception that he is an American or Western candidate has hurt him somewhat, particularly in French-speaking nations, although he speaks French well. He has a B.A. in economics from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., and a masters degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also studied at the Institute Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva.
 
AMARA ESSY, 51, is Foreign Minister of the Ivory Coast, and the candidate most actively being promoted by France, which has close ties to his country. Now Foreign Minister, Mr. Essy has been a diplomat since 1971, serving in Europe, Latin America and New York. He recently began to undertake diplomatic efforts in Africa, helping to bring about a cease-fire in Sierre Leone and perhaps burnishing his image as a pan-African figure at a time when Africans are having difficulty uniting around one candidate for Secretary General. A lawyer with degrees from Abidjan University in the Ivory Coast and Poitiers University in France, Mr. Essy served as president of the United Nations General Assembly two years ago.
 
AHMEDOU OULD ABDALLAH, 55, was a government minister in Mauritania, a diplomat and for two years, from 1993 to 1995, the representative of the United Nations Secretary General in Burundi, where he won praise from diplomats for his handling of a volatile political situation. A critic of Mr. Boutros-Ghali's administration, he left the United Nations last year to become executive secretary of the Coalition for Africa, an economic and political development forum in Washington, D.C., where he was once Mauritania's ambassador. He got his undergraduate degree from Grenoble University in France and a masters from the University of Paris.
 
HAMID ALGABID, 55, was Prime Minister of Niger from 1983 to 1988 and is now secretary general of the Islamic Conference, a position that has given him high visibility in the Muslim world. But he is perhaps least well known in New York of all the candidates. His government background is in commerce and finance. He holds a doctorate in law from the University of Paris.
 
OLARA A. OTUNNU, 46, was born in Uganda and was a diplomat and government minister there, but renounced his citizenship a decade ago and became a citizen of the Ivory Coast. He is president of the International Peace Academy in New York, a study center devoted to conflict resolution and peacemaking. Mr. Otunnu has a wide circle of unofficial supporters and is thought of as a potential compromise candidate, with one foot in the Francophone world and the other in English-speaking circles, if the stalemate between France and the United States continues. A lawyer who has practiced with the New York firm of Chadbourne and Park and taught at Albany University, Mr. Otunnu was educated at Makerere University in Kampala, before going to Oxford University as an Overseas Scholar to study jurisprudence. He later studied law at Harvard, where he was a Fulbright Scholar.

HEADLINE: Tinkering With Europe

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is barreling toward an eastward expansion of NATO by the end of the decade without adequate discussion with the American people and Congress. Though the issue seems remote and abstract to many citizens, and tends to come larded with the highfalutin terminology of the foreign-policy priesthood, it is exceedingly important. NATO expansion would involve a crucial political and military realignment of Europe, the continent still most directly linked to the national security of the United States. The consequences are likely to be great and unpredictable.
Propelled by American leadership, NATO this week essentially committed itself to expansion. President Clinton and leaders of the other NATO members will meet next July in Madrid to issue an invitation to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plus possibly one or two other Central European countries, but that is now a formality. The White House hopes enlargement can be consummated by 1999, the 50th anniversary of the alliance. 
 NATO expansion, among other things, would commit American conventional and nuclear forces to the defense of newly independent European nations and require the costly modernization of their armed services. It would also move the alliance's boundaries considerably closer to Russia, a step sure to strengthen nationalists and Communists in an insecure country still traumatized by two German invasions this century.
Fortunately, as part of an international treaty, none of this can happen without the approval of a two-thirds majority in the Senate, as well as the endorsement of the parliaments of the alliance's 15 European members. There is still time for Americans and their representatives in Congress to consider the implications of NATO expansion and to slow the stampede until the potential consequences can be more carefully considered and the need for enlargement more clearly demonstrated.
The Administration has dressed up its plans with rhetoric about consolidating democracy and free markets in the lands of the former Soviet empire, but it has yet to make a good case why a cold-war military alliance, rather than the European Union, is the best way to secure those aims.
The more credible case for expansion rests on more practical principles, namely maintaining a strong American leadership role in Europe and preserving an alliance that could defend against an aggressive and militarily resurgent Russia in the future. The Russian threat, still painfully familiar in Eastern Europe, is the visceral and understandable reason countries like Poland and Hungary seek sanctuary in NATO.
But planning the future of Europe with the blueprints from the cold war is a mistake. With a shattered, impoverished military and faltering economy, Russia presents no military threat to its neighbors now and will not for years to come. The prospect of NATO expansion, if anything, is likely to push Moscow toward precisely the kind of rearmament the West fears. Diverting money and resources back to defense is just what the Russian economy does not need as it struggles to shake off decades of deadening Communist management.
By anchoring NATO expansion on the needs of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as important as those countries are, the Administration has obscured the most important issue for European peace and prosperity. That issue is the consolidation of reform in Russia. The timing, shape and even need for NATO expansion should be determined by how much it helps or hinders Russia's reform. Washington has not given nearly enough attention to that question.
Responsible Russian leaders, anxious to avoid the potentially destructive domestic consequences of NATO expansion, are now talking less about trying to block enlargement than modifying it in ways that do not upset the political and economic balance in Russia. Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, told his NATO counterparts this week that Moscow, for starters, wants guarantees that NATO nuclear forces will not be stationed in Eastern Europe and assurance that Russia will have a working partnership with the alliance.
These overtures, which the Administration welcomed, will require careful study and hard negotiation. They are just the kinds of issues Americans should be weighing in the months ahead. The debate should not be driven by artificial deadlines and a manufactured sense of urgency. Tinkering with the balance of power on a continent that has been the site of so much conflict and violence should be done with great caution and a strong sense of humility.

HEADLINE: From Dayton to Sarajevo: Spirit of Giving and Eye for Deals

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 11

 BODY:
On one of the dreariest days so far of this Balkan winter, when only half the city at a time has natural gas for heating, and drinking water comes intermittently, the people from Dayton, Ohio, hit Sarajevo bearing stuffed animals and offers of help and, in some cases, keeping an eye out for commercial opportunities.
There are 35 of them, from a Midwestern city that did not know much about Bosnia, and was itself unknown here until a year ago when it made history as the place where the peace treaty that stopped the war here was negotiated. The delegation from Dayton came to see how the peace was faring, and whether they could be of help. "We can show people here we care about them," said Pat Carter, a retired accountant. "Maybe that will help them care for each other again." 
 Just before they arrived on Monday on a four-day visit, a European diplomat said that the peace agreement was holding only because NATO troops will not let local armies fight.
That might be the big picture, but the visitors from Dayton are focused on other things. Speaking of sponsoring cultural and educational exchanges, Dayton's Mayor, Michael Turner, said, "We want to be a friend."
It would an unusual friendship. Sarajevo, though now smashed by war, has been a center where the strains of various civilizations have competed or merged for more than eight centuries. But there are mutual interests nonetheless. Residents of Sarajevo believe the future of their country depends on economic and technical assistance from the West. And so does Dayton. The visitors decided it was time to see the place first hand. They brought toys and warm clothes for school children, plans to arrange for student pen pals as well as for contacts between community and professional groups. Mayor Turner said he believed Dayton businesses could win some of the contracts for reconstruction.
"Somebody has got to rebuild Bosnia," he said, "Why not Dayton?"
The Mayor carried with him through the cold a chipper attitude and a 54-page "Dayton-Balkans Business Directory" listing all the companies that could sell products or services to Bosnia.
But Bosnian officials aren't looking for things to buy from America. They want Americans who will invest in businesses here.
After the Mayor explained what goods Dayton could sell, Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic offered details of Bosnian industries seeking investors. "We are willing to sell parts of these businesses at reasonable prices," said Mr. Muratovic.
Undaunted, the Mayor later said his visit was part of a larger effort that he expects will bring six or eight substantial contracts. He said the good will generated by this trip will be important. But good will is not a concept normally found in Balkan business circles.
Even so, other visitors have said they experienced remarkable goodwill. Mrs. Carter, who is in her 60's, slipped on the thick ice that covers most of the city's sidewalks and broke her arm in three places.
Like the 40 other people who slipped and suffered fractures yesterday, Mrs. Carter was taken to a Government hospital, where the staff is partly on strike because they have not been paid since October. Her arm was set without anesthesia, in keeping with current medical standards here.
Still, she was so impressed by the people of Sarajevo that this morning in one of the private houses where the visitors have been staying, she said, "I've never been treated better anywhere."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Drop Sharply; Yield Up to 6.62%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday amid concern that the economy was not slowing fast enough and that interest rates could rise if foreign investors slow their buying. And traders kept in the backs of their minds comments last week by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in which he questioned the high valuation of the stock market.
The 30-year bond fell 1 15/32, to 98 13/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.62 percent from 6.49 on Tuesday. 
 For bond investors, the day's losses amounted to about $14.70 for $1,000 invested.
Traders said the market's weakness nearly matched that of last Thursday, when the dollar tumbled, eroding the attractiveness of bonds to foreign investors. One day later, Mr. Greenspan warned that the stock market might be showing "irrational exuberance," further alarming bond traders, who feared that his comments might have been a signal of an increase in interest rates.
The volume of issues traded yesterday nearly matched that of Thursday and Friday. Yesterday was the fifth day in this quarter that volume has exceeded $100 billion, considered a benchmark of heavy trading.
Treasuries extended overseas losses in bond trading, even after a report showing that the November Producer Price Index was tame, up only four-tenths of a percent, with the core rate, excluding the volatile food and energy prices, up one-tenth of a percent. Economists had expected gains of three-tenths of a percent and two-tenths of a percent, respectively.
Traders said that after the bond market's decline on Tuesday, United States Treasury securities fell in London and Tokyo on fears that the recent increase in purchases by large Japanese investors could slow. The fear may have been generated by an article in The Wall Street Journal that quoted Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, as saying that Japanese buying would slow.
Also pressuring bonds was the continued heavy issuance of corporate debt, as investors sold Treasury securities in favor of corporate paper.
Chase Manhattan yesterday priced $997 million of asset-backed securities. These securities, rated triple-A and backed by autoloans, were offered in various classes and various average lives. A security with an average life of 0.35 of a year was priced to yield 5.489 percent, or seven-hundredths of a percentage point under the London interbank offered rate, while a security with an average life of 3.52 years was priced to yield 6.270 percent, or about 30-hundredths more than than the 5 7/8 percent Treasury note of 2000.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management in Washington, said he thought that beyond any new information learned by the market yesterday, the primary reason for the drop was continued unease about Mr. Greenspan's comments. He said traders felt "fear of more Federal Reserve officials talking out loud, and the thought that Greenspan & Company may be talking to the Japanese, German, and French central banks suggesting that they also talk tough to their markets in order to cool off investors."
Nonetheless, some important data favor the bond market, Mr. Carpenter said. Iraqi oil is close to reaching the market again, which has had the effect of dropping oil prices about $2 a barrel, he said, implying significantly lower inflation in early 1997.
The Treasury announced the size of next week's auction of notes, which will take place after the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making panel of the Federal Reserve, meets on Tuesday. The Government plans to sell $18.25 billion of two-year notes on Wednesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Thursday.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.81 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.15 percent.

HEADLINE: Seeking Contract, N.Y.U. Workers Walk Out

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
New York University's clerical and technical workers staged a half-day walkout yesterday that drew several hundred workers and a few of students and other supporters to a rally across from Washington Square Park that later moved to Washington Square Church.
The workers, members of the United Staff Association of N.Y.U., a unit of the American Federation of Teachers, are in the midst of negotiations with the university. Their three-year contract expired on Oct. 31, but talks broke off in mid-October when the union refused the university's request that it drop certain demands to upgrade the status of the union. 
 Trudy Rudnick, an N.Y.U. secretary and president of the union, said that yesterday's walkout was aimed at bringing university officials back to negotiations. "Otherwise we will increase the pressure," she said.
Unlike Barnard's five-month clerical union strike earlier this year, which was over wages and health benefits, the N.Y.U. dispute centers on the union itself.
Ms. Rudnick said that unlike other unions at N.Y.U., the clerical workers do not have a union shop, so workers covered by their contract are not required to join the union or pay union dues. About 1,550 workers are covered by the contract, but only about 900 are union members.
Ms. Rudnick said the union would also like a chance to talk to new workers during their orientation, not two or three months later; the opportunity for union officials to deal with union business during their workday, and some preference given to members in hiring and promotion.
The university has offered an annual raise of 3.5 percent or $18.50 a week, whichever is greater, and 3 percent a year for the next two years. Union members now earn a minimum of $445.50 a week, or $23,166 a year, with the average salary $27,200. Richard Semeraro, director of labor relations at N.Y.U., said the increase is comparable to that given the faculty and other unions.
The union and university say there is general agreement on the economic issues, but that the university has been unwilling to accept the union's noneconomic demands.

HEADLINE: Closing the 'Doorway to Fame';
Longtime Guide to Broadway Actors Ends Publication

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
Terese Hayden threw open the doors to a dusty office in an old brownstone in Times Square in the 1940's and soon the city's actors were crowding in, clutching their black-and-white portraits and their dreams of making it big.
There was that young Kirk Douglas, fresh from the Navy and with only a few Broadway credits under his belt in 1944. There was that velvet-voiced James Earl Jones (skinny then) and that funny guy Walter Matthau (in a bow tie and tweeds) in the 1950's. There were employed actors and unemployed ones, haughty actors and jittery ones, but they all shared the same goal: getting their photographs into Ms. Hayden's Players' Guide, New York City's annual listing of the pictures and credits of the city's theater performers. 
 The slender volume, which originally appeared in 1944, offered theater and film directors their first one-stop shopping list of local talent. And as the years passed, the guide became a hefty and venerable New York institution, cherished by directors on Broadway and in Hollywood for capturing some of the acting world's most famous faces, its newest faces and the older faces that had slipped from public memory.
"It was the doorway to fame," said Heywood Hale Broun, the 78-year-old retired Broadway actor and sports broadcaster who was plucked from obscurity when a casting director saw him in the guide and cast him in a bit part in the 1993 film "House Sitter," along with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.
"If you were in the Players' Guide," he said, "you knew you would always be remembered."
After chronicling the careers of two generations of actors for 52 years, the Players' Guide published its final edition this year. And all across the city, actors, agents and directors are mourning its passing.
"I can't believe it's gone!" said Ellen Chenoweth, a casting director who recruited an actor from the guide for the 1993 film "Six Degrees of Separation." "It was such an institution. I'm so sorry to see one of New York's traditions go by the boards."
In its heyday, the guide introduced newcomers and re-introduced forgotten faces to directors hoping to fill bit parts or minor roles, offering actors the kind of break that might launch a career or jump-start a waning one.
But in recent years, as actors began to create their own videotapes and web sites and as similar directories began to provide photographs and resumes on computerized databases, the guide began to fall from favor. Run by an aging husband and wife team in a tiny office in Times Square, it simply could not compete.
But what it did offer was priceless: a vivid documentary of New York's topsy-turvy acting world.
There, in the volumes of black-and-white snapshots and the lists of credits and agents, is a portrait of the careers that rose and fell, the theaters that opened and closed, the pompadours that gave way to crew cuts and the great migration that swept so many actors from Broadway to Hollywood as New York ceded its role as America's entertainment center to California.
Latin dancers, their shoulders frozen in mid-shimmy, appeared in the 1940's along with the names of those actors who fought in World War II. Mr. Douglas, for instance, proudly noted his "recent honorable discharge from U.S. Navy" right alongside his Broadway credits in 1944.
And in the 1950's, the guide carried the plea of black actors who longed for serious roles on Broadway, not just bit parts as singers, servants or cooks. "Just as in American life, the Negro citizen's role now extends from the kitchen to the United Nations," the Coordinating Council of Negro Performers reminded the city's theater directors in 1954.
John Lyons, the casting director who discovered Mr. Broun in the directory, said: "The guide was a window into what the theater community had been. It was a real link to that kind of old-time Broadway community that is disappearing."
It was born in the 1940's, when soldiers were crawling through World War II trenches abroad and the Government was rationing beef at home. "Oklahoma!" was on its way to becoming the longest-running musical on Broadway, and Times Square was filled with neon and glamour and performers dreaming of that big break.
In London, actors could put their photographs in the The Spotlight, the acting directory that was created in 1927. In Hollywood, performers had the Academy Players Directory, which was first published in 1937.
"In New York, we had nothing," said Ms. Hayden, who was a struggling actress herself in the 1940's.
And so it began.
Ms. Hayden borrowed space on the top floor of a brownstone occupied by the Actors Equity Association, hung fliers announcing her project in the local theaters and collected hundreds of photographs from her fellow performers. She called the final product The Players' Guide: A Pictorial Directory for the Legitimate Theater.
It divided the city's actors into categories: leading men and women, character actors, ingenues and children. Most important, it listed their phone numbers.
Soon, anybody who was anybody was in the book. Butterfly McQueen, of "Gone With the Wind," appeared in 1947. Paul Newman and Vincent Price showed up in 1957. And for young actors particularly, the guide became a rite of passage, proof that one had truly joined the acting community.
"I was so excited and worried at the same time," said Eleanor Reissa, an Off Broadway producer who appeared as an actress in the guide in the 1970's. "I kept asking myself: 'Am I a comedian? Am I an ingenue? Should I be smiling? Should I be serious?' "
Every February, the actors crowded into the Times Square office to renew their entries, and Paul L. Ross, who inherited the guide from Ms. Hayden, offered advice from behind a wooden counter, suggesting this photo or that one, these credits or none at all.
"It was sort of charming," said David Margulies, an actor who still appears in the guide. "You would join a small line on 46th Street in the Equity office building and you would see that man Ross growing older as you grew older and still looking much the same."
But did the guide actually help actors find jobs?
More and more actors began to ask that question as fewer casting directors relied on the guide. Redman Maxfield got a bit part in "Six Degrees of Separation" after Ms. Chenoweth saw his photo. ("I needed some Waspy guys," she explained. "He looked very Waspy. And he could act.")
"A chance in a million," Mr. Maxfield said.
But other actors, doubtful that the guide did any good, decided not to enter their photographs.
And when Mr. Ross learned that the acting directories in Hollywood and London were moving their services on line, he decided it was time to retire.
Mr. Ross will keep his office open for about six months. And Ms. Hayden, who is 75 now, says she cannot help but pray that someone will lead the guide into the next century before the office closes for good.
"It was flesh of my flesh," she said. "I will always be heartsick that it's gone."

HEADLINE: Markets Get Jitters, and Dow Falls 70.73

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Markets showed what they could do yesterday when investors get nervous.
A case of the jitters is the best explanation from traders and analysts for why stock prices around the world plunged, interest rates surged higher and the dollar fell even though the economic fundamentals that underlie market performance in the United States and Europe still seem generally positive. 
 Such behavior is not unusual near the end of a year, when investors and money managers are worried about protecting their profits after a good year. Anxiety could also be expected after markets moved so high after the elections.
"I think the market is beginning to show that it can be spooked at these levels," Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said of the American stock market. "This kind of volatility shows that there is as much risk as reward at these levels."
And jitters are not surprising because investors are probably still wondering about the implications of last week's comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who asked if the stock market was rising because of "irrational exuberance." Because Mr. Greenspan's question indicated that he was worried about the possibility of a speculatively driven market, world stock markets fell sharply Friday, although major stocks indexes in the United States regained on Monday what they had lost.
By the end of a volatile session yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as much as 129 points, was down 70.73 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6,402.52, and off 1.8 percent in the last week and a half. All but four of the 30 Dow stocks fell, led by Du Pont, which lost 2 1/2, to 92 5/8; Union Carbide, down 2 5/8, to 42 1/4, and I.B.M., off 1 5/8, to 156 1/8.
And 447 of the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index, including General Electric and Hewlett-Packard, declined, pulling that index down 6.81 points, to 740.73. In Europe and Asia, major stock markets were off more than 1 percent. G.E. lost 1 1/8, to 97, and Hewlett-Packard fell 3/4, to 53 5/8.
Intel, Microsoft and Philip Morris led a rally at the end of the day that helped pull the major stock indexes from their lows. The Nasdaq composite index, which the two computer stocks dominate, ended down just 3.43 points at 1,309.12, only a quarter of what the Dow fell. Intel leaped 7 3/4, to 136 7/8, while Microsoft gained 1 1/2, to 88 3/8, and Philip Morris added 2 3/8, to 118 3/4.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond plunged more than a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.62 percent, its highest since the post-election rally sent it down to 6.35 percent at the end of last month. The dollar fell against the German mark and tumbled nearly half a percent against the Japanese yen.
"It was a big move with no obvious trigger," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, of yesterday's market declines. "The rallies of the last year have left people apprehensive rather than optimistic about the future. Because markets have moved so far so fast investors fear something could trigger a downdraft."
Traders and analysts were able to point to several events that they thought set off the nervous selling. But it was the fact that investors were already anxious that allowed the reports to have any impact.
"The market is still skittish from last week," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Noting that the year-end is near and portfolio managers want to keep their profits, he said that investors "are probably more disposed to precipitous action than at other times."
"Even if bond yields go up for the wrong reason, stocks will respond because the linkage between stocks and bonds is very tight," he said.
Melissa R. Brown, the director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities, said another factor worrying investors was the outlook for earnings. She said that the market had tended to slump ahead of earnings reports in several of the recent quarters, only to see the reports come out better than expected.
Some traders said the selling was prompted by an article in The Wall Street Journal that said Japanese investors might slow their purchases of American bonds, a move that could send interest rates higher. Others analysts argued that a slowdown in Japanese purchases would not have a major impact.
The declines continued despite some benign news on inflation as the Government reported that the Producer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, was up just one-tenth of 1 percent in November. And, at the same time, oil prices in the futures market fell $1.04, to $23.38 a barrel, their third consecutive decline.
"This is the time of year when it is often sound advice to ignore the rampant noise in the financial markets," Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, wrote in a recent market analysis. "Portfolio adjustments related to tax considerations, futures positions established for asset reallocations, and old-fashioned window dressing can drive up daily volatility and make a (temporary) mockery of fundamental analysis."
But if yesterday's rise in interest rates continues, then the fundamentals would change. Higher rates would quickly change the outlook for the valuations of stocks, making them look more expensive. And that could discourage investors at a time when the outlook for profits is mixed.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
From the ivory tower, a tough economist for the World Bank.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ON first impression, Joseph E. Stiglitz seems to fit the part of distracted ivory tower genius better than Washington mover and shaker.
But the scraggly beard, disarming grin and slept-in-his-clothes look camouflage a tough, practical thinker. Mr. Stiglitz -- who resigned yesterday as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers to become chief economist of the World Bank -- picked his battles and won most of them. More important, he helped to fashion a coherent, centrist economic policy as backbone to the President's aimless New Democrat rhetoric. 
 Mr. Stiglitz, by the way, was indeed a distracted ivory tower genius. With three decades of acclaimed research to his credit and professorships at Oxford, Princeton and Stanford, he is viewed by many as the economic theorist of his generation and a shoo-in for a Nobel Prize.
The surprise is that Mr. Stiglitz made the transition to the corridors of power with such grace. Originally hired in 1993 to add some academic patina to the council, he became chairman at an inauspicious moment when the future of his office itself was at stake. "I took over in the spring of 1995, just when the House Republicans were threatening to zero out our budget," he recalled.
His defense alone was not what saved the day. After all, the Republicans' attempt to micromanage the White House's own budget was an early sign of the hubris that played into the President's strengths as a politician. But that does not undermine the case that Mr. Stiglitz made: that the council provides a valuable perspective because it draws on "citizen bureaucrats" who do not plan to make a career in Government. Council economists serve for only a few years, he reminded the Republicans, and academics were hardly inclined to partisan stands that would embarrass them after they returned to the faculty club.
The council does not have the influence it did in the 1960's, when economists were hailed as scientists hot on the trail of a cure for unemployment. The profession has never recovered from the stagflation of the late 1970's, not to mention the barely concealed contempt of the assorted supply-siders who roamed the Reagan White House.
But under Michael J. Boskin in the Bush Administration, the council did establish itself as a reality check on the flakier initiatives of the executive line agencies, a role that also suited his successor, Laura D'Andrea Tyson. And though he doesn't take credit, Mr. Stiglitz continued the tradition. For example, he fought a lonely (and thus far successful) battle to stop the privatization of the Government's two nuclear fuel plants under terms that would undermine efforts to safely liquidate Russia's bomb-grade uranium.
Mr. Stiglitz, though, is happy to share the credit for the application of economic incentives to Government regulation. Take the case of rent vouchers, now Washington's only serious effort to improve housing. Mr. Stiglitz pointed out that waiting lists confined to single cities undermined incentives of the poor to look for work elsewhere. Allowing someone to move without losing his place in line for subsidized housing may seem a small, even obvious, reform. But from such acorns does better government grow.
Other council initiatives have been more substantial. Thanks in part to Mr. Stiglitz, Washington is now pressing for a cost-effective attack on global warming. The approach, a nation-to-nation market in "tradable emission permits," would create incentives to do the job as cheaply as possible -- say, by paying the Chinese to convert their coal-fired power plants to natural gas rather than spending even more money building mass transit in America no one wants to use.
By the same token, the Administration has come down on the side of the economist-angels on a variety of other issues. These include incentives to avoid expensive construction in hurricane- and earthquake-prone areas, incentives to rotate crops to avoid erosion and reforms that apply cost-benefit tests to toxic waste cleanups.
The World Bank, which is only a couple of blocks away from the Executive Office Building, where he occupied a large corner office, may seem an odd fit for Mr. Stiglitz, whose self-appointed task at the White House was fine-tuning regulation. In fact, the 53-year-old economist asserts that his passion for efficient government makes him the right man for the job at the right time.
The World Bank is in a deep funk, no longer able to justify its half-century-old role as a source of capital for poor countries now that private markets are providing substantial resources for growth. But unlike more conservative economists, Mr. Stiglitz argues that the bank should be redirected, not consigned to the scrap heap of history.
What might this new mission be? As a clearing house for research on what works in developing countries and what doesn't, he suggests, with the specialized lending functions aimed at transforming the losers into winners. Stay tuned for details.

HEADLINE: In Retailing, Biggest Gains Come From Big Spenders

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Hermes has a waiting list for its $4,000 Kelly bags. Neiman Marcus sold all 50 of the $75,000 Jaguars featured in its Christmas catalogue in eight days. Patek Philippe has back orders for a $44,500 watch.
Luxury is selling, and at a growth rate faster than that for goods and services as a whole. 
 Luxury goods from Gucci handbags to Montblanc pens saw sales grow about 18 percent last year, to $30 billion, according to Tactical Retail Monitor, a newsletter that tracks retail spending and consumer trends for retailers, manufacturers and shopping centers nationwide. By contrast, overall sales of merchandise from tennis shoes to compact disks increased just 5 percent, to $630 billion.
And the gap is widening. Sales of luxury goods, defined as the most expensive items in a category, will increase 30 percent this quarter from a year earlier because of brisk holiday spending, while sales of mass merchandise will increase just 5 percent, Tactical Retail Monitor says. For the year, the luxury segment is projected to grow more than 21 percent, while the overall sales should equal last year's growth.
The luxury business has been fueled by sharply rising incomes among the wealthiest American families, a surge in the stock market last year and much of this year and an increase in the numbers of people in their peak earning years.
The faster growth in luxury spending can be seen in the sales numbers for many products and services, from expensive cruises and jewelry to cars, apparel and televisions. And from Rodeo Drive to Madison Avenue, upscale retailers and brokers have stories about how the market for luxury goods and services has grown. After sales were relatively flat in the first part of the 1990's, luxury products are now selling at a rate reminiscent of the late 1980's.
"In the 80's there was a progressive buildup of wealth and the need to flaunt it, whether it be a wine collection or your cuff links," Isaac Lagnado, publisher of Tactical Retail Monitor, said. But white-collar downsizing, the savings and loan debacle and fortunes lost in real estate put spending on hold for a lot of people. "There was sort of an austerity and almost embarrassment at flaunting prosperity."
But memories are short, and consumer confidence has rebounded. "People are in the mood to spend," Mr. Lagnado said.
Travcoa World Tours of Newport Beach, Calif., for instance, this year sold all 84 seats on a $38,000-a-person world tour six months in advance. In fact, some 160 travel agencies that specialize in luxury travel -- defined as trips in which per diem spending is at least $350 -- booked more than $300 million in such trips for American travelers last year, according to their marketing organization, API Travel Consultants. The amount, which does not include air fare, is a 35 percent increase from 1994 and a 130 percent increase in the last five years.
"Top of the line anything seems to be selling out fast," said John Morris, who retired in 1990 as vice president of corporate development for the Campbell Soup Company and took his wife, Virginia, on the 25-day Travcoa tour as a birthday present this year. "I think people are rewarding themselves."
At Tiffany & Company, the Atlas line of high-end jewelry introduced last year, which includes items costing up to $19,000, has become the company's most successful product introduction at a time when sales of expensive jewelry in general are on the increase. According to a survey conducted by Jewelers of America Inc, 55 percent of consumers who bought premium jewelry last year, items costing at least $1,500, spent more than they did in 1994; only 24 percent of bargain shoppers, those who bought items costing less than $300, reported a gain in spending.
And there is a waiting list of up to three months for Prada designer-label $400 gray flannel pants. That is indicative of the recent uptick in overall apparel sales, with designer labels driven in part by recent interest in accessories like Gucci belts and Hermes scarves. Consumers with household incomes of $60,000 and up increased spending on apparel 11.1 percent last year -- more than double the increase in spending the year before -- while those with household incomes of $40,000 to $59,999 decreased spending 4.7 percent, the NPD Group, a research firm in Port Washington, L.I., said. Meanwhile, shoppers in the $25,000 to $39,999 category decreased spending 2.4 percent, while those with household incomes of $15,000 to $24,999 reported virtually no change in spending. Those with household incomes below $15,000 increased spending on apparel 1.7 percent.
The Silversteins of Glencoe, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, are an example of the kind of shoppers contributing to the upsurge in spending among the affluent.
"I would say we are spending more than we have in the past," said Gerry Silverstein, a stay-at-home mother whose husband, Michael, is a consultant with Boston Consulting Group. "We've been fortunate that if you look over the time span of the 80's, our income increased. My husband and I are in our early 40's, and we've reached a level where we have more discretionary income to spend."
This year, the Silversteins bought a house nearly double the size of their former home, took a vacation to Hawaii and bought new wardrobes from Neiman Marcus, part of Harcourt General Inc., where they are members of the Incircle club, Neiman's equivalent of a frequent-flier program.
"This has been a banner year," Mrs. Silverstein said, adding, "The stock market has been very good to people this year."
Luxury cars -- starting at about $30,000 -- are hot, including European brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi, all of whose American sales peaked in the mid-1980's then plunged before recovering in recent years. Over all, in the first 11 months of 1996, consumers have bought 945,125 luxury cars -- about 11.9 percent of all cars sold in the United States and up from 7 percent a decade earlier, according to data compiled by Ford Motor.
People are also buying many household appliances like high-priced toasters and TV's. Williams-Sonoma Inc., the retailer based in San Francisco, has repeatedly sold out this year of a $250 stainless steel commercial-grade toasters that only hold two pieces of bread. Sales of projection televisions, with screens 50 inches and larger, have grown 127 percent in the last five years to 4 percent of all sets sold in this country, NPD Group says. The projection sets cost around $2,000.
Wall Street is rewarding public companies that are cashing in on all of this spending. The Furman Selz luxury goods index, which measures the stock performance of luxury retailers, including Tiffany and Neiman Marcus, is outperforming the Standard & Poor's general merchandise retail index, which includes Dayton Hudson, and Wal-Mart. While the Furman Selz index has risen 26 percent so far this year, the S.& P. general merchandise index has risen only 18.9 percent.
The persistent bull market, of course, is helping. The stock market rose nearly 35 percent last year and continued the surge this year, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 27 percent in the first 11 months.
"The people who have large investment earnings are doing extremely well right now," said Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management and a co-author of "The Winner Take All Society." He added, "There is a lot of paper wealth out there, and that has got to be driving at least some of the new spending."
Moreover, the rich are simply getting richer and rewarding themselves with those gains. According to the Census Bureau, the average household income of the top 20 percent of households grew 17 percent the last 10 years to $109,411 last year, when adjusted for inflation. In contrast, the bottom 20 percent of households had just a 2 percent income gain in that time to $8,350.
"The amount of income in the hands of people at the top went up, so they spend more on the kinds of goods that wealthy people usually spend money on," Mr. Frank said. "That shifted the standards of acceptable consumption levels for the people just below them, which made them start spending more."
To be sure, affluent customers can afford to buy in good times and bad. Nonetheless, the current spending frenzy is typical of spending in years of an upbeat economy after recessions and downturns in the stock market, according to Dan Phillips, associate publisher of the Robb Report, a magazine that focuses on luxury life styles.
But the social climate, too, has changed, some experts said, with it now being all right to spend money on one's self and one's family.
"It's acceptable to be well off again," Mr. Phillips said.
The aging of the big baby-boomer generation is a factor, too. The bulk of the baby boomers are in their peak earning years.
"This is the time when people have the most discretionary income and spend the most on luxury," said Harry Dent Jr., an economic forecaster and author of "The Great Boom Ahead."
Retailers also see a shift in spending among some consumers.
While designer-label goods, particularly accessories, are indeed selling, many retailers notice that some of their more affluent customers these days, particularly aging baby boomers, are seeking function instead of flash. Or at least the form of function.
Una Baker, the wife of the president of Tommy Hilfiger's women's clothing division, said she fitted the mold. "I did have some excesses, I must say," said Ms. Baker, who now would rather shop for furniture for her Upper East Side home in Manhattan than search for designer- label outfits.
"Flash is out," she said emphatically. "People do not want other people to know what they have, who they are or how much they have. I think subtlety is much more elegant today."
She is not alone. A trendy Soho furniture boutique called C.I.T.E has had a run on stainless steel furniture, like a $10,000 steel picnic table that came from a convent in France and sold in a week.
The Blocktons of Mamaroneck, N.Y., were in the market for a wet bar when they paid $5,000 for a recycled steel medicine chest there that was originally used in a field hospital in France during World War II. "It has these pullout trays that we'll use to mix drinks, and these are trays that were used to put medicine and syringes on," noted Kathy Blockton, a fashion designer who liked the cabinet's durability.
For William Blockton, a 52-year-old chief executive officer of a Madison Avenue fabric company, the cabinet is perfect for who he is today but just the sort of thing he might have turned his nose up at a decade ago. "We choose to live our lives a little more conservatively than we did before," he said, noting that a decade ago his idea of indulgent spending was on things like original art.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND EUROPE AGREE ON FREEING TECHNOLOGY TRADE

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
The United States and the European Union reached agreement early today on a deal to liberalize trade in information technology, paving the way for a broader pact incorporating most of the world's big trading nations.
After several days of intense negotiations at a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore, the United States and Europe resolved a host of differences about a proposal to eliminate tariffs within three years on computers, software, telecommunications equipment and other technology products. 
 The agreement between the United States and the Europeans removed the last hurdle to extending the pact to the fast-growing nations of Asia, where some governments still maintain objections, and to other countries around the world.
Japan and Canada had already thrown their support behind the deal, which was expected to spur trade in information technology, one of the biggest international industries, and to provide new opportunities to American companies.
"I believe that the basis of what we have agreed with the U.S. provides for an agreement that will be a huge advance for the world economy," Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European negotiator, said at a news conference in Singapore.
The breakthrough came only after both sides gave in on a number of issues. The Europeans agreed, for example, to include digital photocopiers in the agreement, a victory for the American negotiators, who had been strongly pressed by the Eastman Kodak Company not to let those products be excluded. Electric components known as capacitors, which the United States wanted excluded, will be covered by the pact, American officials said.
As many as 35 more countries are expected to join the technology agreement, though some, like Malaysia and Indonesia, have continued to press for delays in tariff reductions to allow their industries time to prepare for open competition.
Other countries will have until March 15 to join the agreement, which will take effect only if nations representing 90 percent of the world's production of technological goods sign up, a target that American officials said was now likely, though not certain, to be met.
The 15 European Union nations, the United States, Japan and Canada, along with Singapore and Hong Kong, which have also agreed to join, together account for about 75 percent of world production.
"It is very encouraging," said an American official, who declined to be identified. "We are heading toward a real critical mass, but we do need some more Asians."
The agreement would cover hundreds of products that have worldwide sales estimated at $500 billion to $600 billion. American companies have strongly supported a deal, which would presumably help them gain easier access to markets worldwide.
"What we're hearing is certainly giving us cause for cautious optimism," Greg Garcia, who monitors trade issues for the American Electronics Association, a lobbying organization, said yesterday, as negotiators made progress toward a deal. "What we're expecting is that we're going to see enough countries joining in that, in total, they will represent 90 percent of the trade in information technology."
Mr. Garcia said the United States last year exported $80 billion worth of computers and related equipment, semiconductors, software, telephone switches and other products that would be covered by the agreement. Tariffs on those exports amounted to $5 billion, he said, and eliminating them would help not just American companies, which in many cases are dominant competitors in the industry, but foreign customers as well.
Moreover, after failed or postponed international efforts to reduce trade barriers in telecommunications, financial services and shipping, analysts said a technology accord could lend impetus to other free-trade negotiations.
"With all those companies loving it and benefiting from it, it gives you significant renewed support in the U.S. and in other countries for the trade liberalization process," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Still, there would be limits to the benefits of a pact. Because it deals with tariff reduction, it would not address other less obvious barriers that make it difficult for competitors to break into foreign markets. In Japan, for example, American technology companies still face difficulties finding distributors for their products to retailers and in convincing big companies to purchase goods from non-Japanese producers.
And while a deal on technology would enhance the credibility of the World Trade Organization, the organization's members remain deeply divided on other issues, such as whether workers' rights should be linked to trade agreements. Poorer nations are resisting calls from the United States, among others, for agreements to restrict child labor and to insure the right of workers to unionize.
There were also disputes among the organization's diverse membership about government procurement practices, environmental regulations and other potentially sensitive issues. Members continued to haggle over the wording of a broad communique that the organization is to release on Friday.
The deal on technology trade would be the main accomplishment of the first meeting of the World Trade Organization, which was established to encourage and police free trade agreements among its now 127 members.
At a meeting of heads of Asian and Pacific Rim governments in the Philippines last month, President Clinton won support for the effort to "substantially eliminate" tariffs on technology products, providing some momentum for long-running negotiations on the issue.
Japan has generally been in agreement with the United States over how to proceed, and reports from Singapore today said that India was dropping its opposition. While the inclusion of other big Asian economies is critical to any long-term success, the immediate roadblock to a deal had been the differences between the United States and Europe.
After several sets of talks over the last several days involving the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and her European counterpart, Sir Leon, the two sides had compromised on almost all the issues dividing them. Among the last ones still on the table was how quickly tariffs on semiconductors should be eliminated, with the United States seeking an accelerated schedule and the Europeans wanting a slower process.
France had also sought to have CD-ROM's containing music or movies classified as entertainment, not technology, keeping them out of the pact. American officials in Singapore said they had agreed to drop all audio-visual products, except interactive ones, from the agreement.
France has long sought to limit competition to its arts industries from American movies, television shows and music, though it has not usually used tariffs to do so, relying instead on quotas and on subsidies for domestic producers.
It was unclear if the French had made any headway toward winning agreement on delaying beyond next year separate talks on liberalizing agricultural tradee, a very sensitive domestic issue in France.

At Shea, Cost of Cheering Rises

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Has anyone here seen the Mets? Do they still reside in New York City? Are they still in the National League? If they are, are they relieved that the Philadelphia Phillies are still in their division?
There were a couple of reported sightings last month when they engaged in bullpen renovation, but the Mets seem to have conceded the city to the Yankees and the role of division challenger to the Florida Marlins. The Mets of great promise and little delivery aren't even going through the pretense of creating promise this winter. 
 That's what makes their decision to increase ticket prices so ludicrous.
"Our commitment to the goal of developing a championship-caliber team in the economics of our industry require that we take steps to price our tickets more competitively," the co-owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, said this week in a letter to season ticket-holders.
The commitment they talk about, though, is phantasmic. It's also too bad the Mets' owners act to be competitive with their ticket prices but not with their team. Is someone giving out trophies and rings for having the highest ticket prices?
That's right: the Mets' highest ticket price has surpassed the Yankees' highest. At least when customers spend $23 for a box seat at Yankee Stadium they get a competitive, if not championship, team as well as the adventure known as the Bronx. For $25, Shea Stadium customers get to see another disappointing team.
Several years ago, when the Mets added Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray and Bret Saberhagen to their roster, they raised the fans' hopes, then dashed them against the shores of Flushing Bay. A year ago they touted their young pitchers and other young players and had the audacity to whisper wild card. Their fans took it in the solar plexus again.
As they sleep their way through this winter, the Mets aren't touting anyone or suggesting anything. They don't even know if the three neophytes who were going to be the second coming of Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Jon Matlack will be ready for the start of next season. They don't know if they can get major league production at the infield corners out of Butch Huskey and Edgardo Alfonzo. They don't know if they can get a major league right fielder out of Carl Everett, Alex Ochoa and Jay Payton.
But they know they don't need Moises Alou, an outfielder of proven production and the object of desire of many other teams.
"Everybody could be interested in Alou," General Manager Joe McIlvaine said last week when asked about the Mets' interest in him. "It's a question of money and terms. I think our bigger urgency has been the bullpen and maybe a hitter at first or third rather than right field."
But surely the Mets have money to spend. They spent only $25 million on their payroll last season (the Yankees spent $61 million). If fans have to pay more to see the Mets play, they certainly are entitled to see the Mets pay more for better players.
McIlvaine has long disdained signing ranking free agents because he doesn't want to relinquish precious draft choices as compensation.
But the Marlins have signed five free agents in the past three weeks and won't lose a draft choice for any of them.
As repeat free agents, Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich and John Cangelosi don't require compensation. Neither does Alex Fernandez, a service-time free agent. If the Marlins sign Alou, they won't lose a draft choice there either because he is in Fernandez's category. Dennis Cook was a Type B relief pitcher, but Texas didn't offer him salary arbitration so he won't cost the Marlins a draft choice.
The Marlins finished nine games ahead of the Mets last season. They appear to have significantly improved their team. They have spent money with the stated purpose of becoming a contender and luring more fans to their park. The Mets have made no statement other than the one about a commitment to higher ticket prices.
Oh yes, the Mets did inquire about a free-agent closer, Mel Rojas, Alou's teammate and cousin. Why they inquired wasn't clear because they already had re-enlisted John Franco for two more years at a price that had general managers of other clubs wondering, considering Franco has become an inconsistent closer, last season failing in more than a fifth of his save opportunities.
But after McIlvaine's initial inquiry about Rojas, the pitcher's agent never heard from him again. Rojas is now the Cubs' closer.
The Mets have supposedly shored up their relief corps with Greg McMichael, Toby Borland, Ricardo Jordan and maybe Armando Reynoso, if they don't need him as a starter. Fans will surely find it worthwhile to pay extra to watch them pitch.
Efforts to find Wilpon, Doubleday and McIlvaine by telephone yesterday, while the Yankees were creating more attention with another free-agent signing and their heated pursuit of Roger Clemens, were unsuccessful. They did not return the calls.
Maybe they are hibernating for the winter.

HEADLINE: DESIGN REVIEW;
Dior's Look, 50 Years Ago And Now

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER 

 BODY:
AS famous as the placid Irving Penn photos of Christian Dior's revolutionary New Look are the New Look photos from the dark side: women in postwar Paris angrily ripping the extravagant clothes off one of the first women presumptive enough to wear it amid poverty.
A woman wearing a real New Look dress today might be tempted to make those violent gestures on herself. Descriptions of Dior's early constructions -- scaffolding, tulle, silk, padding, pleats, bodice, bones and corsets -- make it sound as comfortable as wearing an ant farm. 
 Yet Christian Dior, the subject of an exhibition now at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is arguably not only the template for current French fashion, but also the template for the designer as a celebrity. He was on the cover of Time magazine, invented the notion of licensing a designer name for fees, catered to publicity-generating clients like Marlene Dietrich and Lauren Bacall and was the first designer to insist on changes in fashion with an eye on generating front-page articles and forcing women to buy more clothes.
His career, which began in 1947 when he was 42 and ended when he died at 52, is uniquely suited to the sort of exhibition the Costume Institute does well. As concise as it is captivating, the show comes on the 50th anniversary of the House of Dior and the New Look, and at a moment when new blood in the form of the British designer John Galliano promises to revitalize the name.
Dior is also in the spotlight because one of his best customers, Eva Peron, is, too, in the musical "Evita," which stars Madonna and opens on Christmas Day. In an uncharacteristic nod to pop culture's pressures, the Costume Institute exhibition features four Peron outfits: a green tulle tiered evening gown, a pink satin gold-embroidered cape, a flamenco-influenced strapless gown and a midnight-blue velvet ensemble. Three were lent by her family and sent from Argentina.
It is a sign of the unimpeachable style conferred by the Dior label that when Eva Peron wanted to be admired by Europe, she gave herself over to his atelier.
Eva Peron may not have given it a thought, but what the marauding women tearing apart the New Look in 1947 were doing is questioning the morality of decadent clothes in a time of poverty. It was hardly a new concept -- the French Revolution was partly about that -- and it hasn't gone away yet. Giving up furs during the recession had something to do with distaste at stepping over the homeless on the way to the gala, a la "Barbarians at the Gate." The fact that so many people today believe that those New Look "news" photos were set up only shows that Dior discovered early on something American designers have never forgotten: there is nothing like a controversy to sell clothes.
And he provided many of them. He was accused of being a dictator by critics around the world, particularly when he changed hem lengths and silhouettes. But what the Met show, which is not chronological, demonstrates is that his style never shifted too much. Certainly, changes are glacial through his decade compared with those in recent years, where the look of the moment can go from dirty grunge to glossy glamour to vacant minimalism before clothes have even endured the dry cleaner.
In 1956, when Dior lowered skirt lengths to make them Edwardian, Vogue magazine asked, "Is it a stunt or a serious development?"
The answer to the question was that it was both. Dior visited the United States just after the New Look was introduced and met with Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus, who tutored him in the concept of marketing and hype. Fashion has never been the same.
But within the work of the inventor of fashion's system of outdating and innovating are some of the most intelligent, thought-provoking, cleverly constructed clothes ever made. It is doubtful that most designers working today could deconstruct even the patterns of many of the pieces in the show. For instance, there is a series dedicated to adapting the men's tuxedo for women. One dress has a sort of cummerbund that becomes a draping, dramatic sash. Another borrows the crumb-catching pleating of a cummerbund, using it as decoration.
These tuxedo ideas of Dior's became the base of the most important 1960's and 70's fashion, after Yves Saint Laurent, who trained with Dior, had gone out on his own. What would modern fashion be without those smoky Helmut Newton photos of "le smoking" by Saint Laurent? Saint Laurent also took from Dior the idea of A-line dresses, and of what was called the H-line, a flat-chested silhouette that would be deemed "waiflike" today.
What is interesting about all the problem solving and cleverness in Dior's clothes is that the problems were all created by the designer himself. He denied the body's form, and the natural drape of fabric, and instead built women into the body he wanted and wrangled fabrics into unlikely positions. So for all the genius of his invention, there is also a perversity. Had he been less a taskmaster, forcing fabrics and bodies to his will, his clothes would have demanded less of him.
Which is why it is somewhat amusing that Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Met, said in the catalogue that the exhibition sought to show Dior as "a genial creator."
The work attests to just the opposite.
"His idealized conceptualization of woman must be understood as a campaign of hope and optimism in which, in fact, most women of his time participated willingly," Mr. de Montebello said.
That pretty much takes the pressure off the museum to make sense out of why women willingly subjected themselves to some of Dior's more tortured creations. History has proved that women tend to be complicit in designers' desires to put them on the rack of fashion and tug them every which way. Dior was more demanding than most, and the show offers dozens of examples of his nature-defying garments.
Famously, Dior's contribution to fashion was a revival of an Edwardian romance just after Paris had emerged from World War II. All the "petites mains" of the couture studios, still during the war, were put back to work to pleat 25 yards of fabric for a skirt and weave details like tiny curlicues of wire into lace to make it stand pertly. As striking as the so-called grand-entrance gowns that close the Met show -- a plum velvet dress with gunmetal beads flowering across it, from 1955, or a pink satin dress covered in tulle, beaded scallops and pendant crystals, from 1953 -- are the most sober pieces that open it.
Considering that Dior's collection was hailed as the return of the joy of fashion, there is much sobriety here, in the use of men's-wear fabrics for suits, in the Hildegarde-esque silhouettes and in the dark colors throughout.
In fact, even the touchstones of the New Look sound oppressive, as described by Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute. "Narrow corseted waist, padded hips, full voluminous skirt that comes well below the knee and a structured torso that gives a prominent bust," he recently ticked off.
Once in a while a sexual element is tossed in, often weirdly, like the bust of one dress with windows of tiny pleats in the front, described by Mr. Martin as "more primitive art rather than dressmaking." But what sexual elements there are in the show are pure fetishism. Dior's work is largely a fleshless feast, with nothing to do with the body's natural shape. In fact, the institute's associate curator, Harold Koda, calls it "not modern, but post-modern," since it is so much about refiguring identity, and the body.
Every fashion historian has a guess about where Dior would have taken his silhouette had he not died. Evidence suggests it ended near where he wanted it; he had already singled out Saint Laurent and Marc Bohan as possible successors, and chosen his retirement home.
What the Met show refutes more than anything is the notion that Dior was a man with one look -- a new one. Every piece in the show is a testament to his stronger inclination: that of making women look beautiful in an archetypal way. As his latest successor, Mr. Galliano said, "the waist, the bust, the hips -- he knew how to do it."
"Christian Dior" remains at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82d Street, through March 23. The exhibition was financed by Christian Dior and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Selling the First Nuggets Of a Nation's Collection

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
One of the best customers of Knoedler & Company, whose current show celebrates its 150th anniversary, was the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. Between 1894 and 1919, he bought more than 225 paintings from the celebrated gallery, paying for at least some of them in Pennsylvania Railroad stock that at the time amounted to less than the value of the works.
"If you hold this stock it seems to me you are bound to realize ere long the full value of your pictures," the canny Frick wrote to the gallery in 1914. It is not recorded who got the better of the deal. (By way of salute, the Frick Collection, up the block from Knoedler's, has put rosettes on all its Knoedler-purchased paintings.) But not to worry. There was no shortage of other deep-pocket clients, among them Frick's picture-buying pal Andrew Mellon. In the early 1930's, Knoedler sold Mellon $6.5 million worth of Old Masters acquired in a coup from the Hermitage in Leningrad; the paintings helped found Mellon's National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
 On the barren American art scene of the mid-19th to early-20th century, Knoedler & Company was a transforming presence. In fact, it helped bring the American art world into being.
The oldest living art dealership in New York although not in the country (that distinction goes to Vose Galleries in Boston), it was founded in 1846 by the Bavarian-born Michel Knoedler, representing Goupil, a firm of engravers in Paris. From a tiny space at Broadway and Duane Street, the gallery expanded, moving uptown as the nation's economy boomed. As nouveau millionaires emerged with a yen to acquire Art, Knoedler played a key role in shaping their collections as well as those of burgeoning museums.
The gallery placed more than 150 works by Cezanne, for instance, and no fewer than 7 of the dozen Vermeers now in this country's art institutions. What's more, it was a leading supporter of American artists, promoting such stellar talents as Frederick E. Church, Winslow Homer, George Inness, George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, George Bellows and John Singer Sargent. And in 1916 it mounted the only solo show of work by the inimitable Florine Stettheimer during her lifetime, allowing the artist to recreate her home environment in the gallery.
Knoedler had its detractors. "A bazaar," wrote Rene Gimpel, a rival French dealer, in his diary for 1918, "an old name, a long reputation for honesty, but no real intelligence." Grudgingly crediting Knoedler's staff with a feeling for "modern" art, he added: "An Old Master? They're less well provided there; they know less, they are a bit lacking in taste, but don't worry, they'll get you what you think you want."
The first part of this two-part anniversary show, organized by Sam Hunter, professor emeritus of art history at Princeton, presents a selection of 18 paintings -- by artists as well known as Copley, Corot and Renoir and as forgettable as the salon painter Hughes Merle -- that were sold to American museums, from the mighty Metropolitan to Tennessee's finest, the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art. Although it's a little late for critical judgments, it can be said that not all of the works are masterpieces.
Among the more illustrious, however, are a version of John Singleton Copley's "Watson and the Shark" (1782), a grisly scene of a man attacked by a shark in the water as his boat mates try to save him, bought in 1946 by the Detroit Institute of Arts. A fine Degas portrait of his younger brother, "Rene de Gas" (1855), was sold directly to the Smith College Museum of Art in 1935. Manet's haunting "Plum," from around 1877, depicting a sad-eyed waif of a woman at a cafe table, was acquired by Paul Mellon in 1961 and later donated to the National Gallery. A superb Braque still life, "Le Gueridon" (1921-22), was bought by Louise Reinhardt Smith in 1961 and given to the Metropolitan in 1979.
Much more fun is the second part of the show, in a downstairs gallery. Assembled by Melissa De Medeiros, the gallery's librarian, from Knoedler's voluminous archives, it includes letters, photographs, sale records, stock books, catalogues, news clippings and so on, dating back to 1863. A captivating miscellany, they trace not only the history of the gallery but also the rise of the art market, the way dealers buy, the building of collections and the crotchets of artists and acquisitors.
An early accounting from Knoedler to Frederick Church, for instance, reveals that he traded artworks for art supplies. Two handwritten ledger pages from February 1909 record the sale of 83 watercolors by John Singer Sargent to the Brooklyn Museum in one swoop, for prices as low as $170. News clippings from 1910 detail the successful efforts of Benjamin Altman, a client, to dislodge Knoedler from its premises at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue so he could build a department store there. (The Altman-Knoedler relationship did not survive the battle.)
A letter from Sarah Bernhardt in 1919 offers a portrait of herself in the role of Gismonda, to help pay her debts. Writing to Knoedler in 1929, the well-known collector Stephen C. Clark tries to knock down the price of a Cezanne to $50,000. And Winslow Homer, complaining about a request for photographs in 1908, lambastes "women working for the press," who "expect and want everything they can get."
Of course, there are things not mentioned, like the time in the mid-1950's when an official of Wildenstein & Company was caught tapping Knoedler's telephones to learn what its arch-rival was up to. And the show's title is something of a misnomer. Although it supposedly covers 150 years, what it really celebrates is the dynastic Knoedler's, the gallery that existed before it began to pass out of family ownership with the death of Charles Henschel, Michel's grandson, in 1956. (In 1971, on the verge of bankruptcy, the gallery was acquired by the financier Armand Hammer, whose foundation still holds a controlling interest.)
But, as a richly detailed sketch of how Knoedler's and its big-time cast of players helped to shape the American art world, the show is something to see. Come to think of it, it's nothing less than mini-series material.
"The Rise of the Art World in America: Knoedler at 150" remains at Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, Manhattan, through Jan. 12.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Mostly Higher, Seeming to Avoid Stock Jitters

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Helped by weakness in the mark, the dollar was mostly higher yesterday, overcoming sharp declines in stock markets in the United States.
Still, the dollar remained somewhat vulnerable to the action on Wall Street, tending to follow the Dow Jones industrial average as it rallied in the morning and dropped in the afternoon. 
 The markets have been nervous since last Friday after comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, expressing concern that stocks might be overvalued.
"Whatever has been happening in the stocks and bonds, the dollar is reacting to that," said Augie Floro, assistant vice president for foreign exchange at Bank Austria's New York branch. "It really doesn't follow logic. When people see the stock market falling, they get a little nervous."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5423 German marks from 1.5376 marks on Wednesday and to 113.27 Japanese yen from 112.97 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6576 from $1.6515.
The dollar initially fell in Asian dealings, partly in reaction to a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, that some Japanese central bank officials were considering a rise in interest rates as early as the spring.
The dollar rebounded as traders discounted the report. In addition, the central bank's governor, Yasuo Matsushita, defended Japanese monetary policy, saying it had lowered the cost of lending and helped provide the basis for a recovery.
Traders said the mark's weakness stemmed from a conference of European Union finance ministers in Dublin over a proposed deal to insure the stability of the planned single currency, which is to be introduced in 1999.
"It appears they're going to put through some compromise agreement," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign-exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "The mark could continue to weaken if we get some positive news from Dublin."
Any news of progress in the single-currency plan has tended to hurt the mark, which would lose its position as Europe's dominant currency once the Euro was in use.

HEADLINE: On the Ropes, Chirac Fights Back in French Television Interview

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
His popularity plummeting, his Prime Minister under attack even from within his own party, and his compatriots fed up with high unemployment, President Jacques Chirac of France went on television tonight in an effort to regain voter confidence.
Choosing an interview format with four journalists approved by his staff, Mr. Chirac tried to counter the impression that France was falling apart under his presidency. 
 Asked why he had apparently failed so far to make good on his campaign promises to bring "fundamental change" to a country whose people often seem mired in the past, Mr. Chirac said, "The reality is that we are in a very profoundly conservative country, and it's very difficult to change things."
Almost nothing has gone right lately for Mr. Chirac, who turned 64 at the end of last month, or his 51-year-old Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, who is under instructions to carry out austerity budget policies in the face of an unemployment rate that stands at 12.6 percent and has been inching upward for a year.
Mr. Chirac's popularity has plunged since his election in May 1995 with 52 percent of the vote, and is now hovering between 27 and 37 percent, according to various public opinion polls. Mr. Juppe, dismissed in public recently as nothing more than "a good chief of staff for Chirac" by a fellow-Gaullist, is even more unpopular.
"Alain Juppe is conducting a difficult and courageous policy," Mr. Chirac said tonight, putting an end to weeks of rumors that he was about to dump his Prime Minister to give his Rally for the Republic party a better chance of winning the 1998 parliamentary elections.
"I have great admiration for a man who, despite the criticism, carries on without fear and without losing his morale," Mr. Chirac said of his Prime Minister. "Running a country at a time when you have to change things, and ways of thinking, takes a great deal of courage."
Mr. Juppe is trying to slash the deficit because the President has ordered him to make the French economy fit to join the German-designed common European currency that is planned for the end of the decade.
Only a European currency, Mr. Chirac said tonight, could put France and the rest of Europe on a level playing field with the United States and the Asian economies in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.
"We need a means to struggle against American hegemony," he said. "There is a problem of the dollar. The only way is to be strong, to have a common currency. There is no other way."
As for the strikes that have disrupted the Government's attempts to reduce the budget deficit to qualify France under the rules for the common currency, Mr. Chirac said: "We are a country that is not responsible, from this point of view. I'm not against the right to strike. I am appealing to people's responsibility."
Aside from the reference to "American hegemony" there was no mention of growing tensions between France and the United States in more than two hours of discussion and debate. Domestic concerns dominated the discussion, including the recent resurgence of terrorism in Paris with an explosion on a commuter train last week that killed four people.
Mr. Chirac told his audience that there were still no clear leads in the case, though it appeared to bear the hallmarks of an Algerian terrorist group dedicated to forcing France to cut its economic ties with the military-backed Government in Algeria.

HEADLINE: $148 Million Renewal Plan Announced for New Rochelle

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced today a $148 million revitalization plan for the troubled downtown here, including the construction of up to 1,000 apartments, stores, skating rinks and a 20-screen movie theater.
Mr. Pataki described the plan, which relies primarily on private developers, as a model for the revival of small cities throughout the state that "like New Rochelle, have seen their downtowns erode over the last two decades" He said the project would generate 1,500 construction jobs and more than 600 permanent jobs. 
 Under the plan, the state would provide a $4 million low-interest loan for a $48 million retail complex called the New Rochelle Center. It is to be developed by New Roc Associates of White Plains on the site of Macy's, which closed in 1992.
A $100 million apartment development, Avalon on the Sound, would be privately financed and built by Avalon Properties of Wilton, Conn. The apartments, in walking distance of the Metro-North station, would rent at market rates and would be aimed at high-income people.
A vice president of Avalon Properties, Alexander Twining, estimated that a one-bedroom unit would rent for $1,200 a month.
New Rochelle officials said they were thrilled. "It's a big Christmas present," Deputy Mayor Rhoda Quash said. "We've been working on this for a long time."
Mayor Timothy C. Idoni had praise for the stores. "It's more of an antimall," he said. "The emphasis is on entertainment. We're looking to draw from White Plains south to the north Bronx."
Downtown had seemed on a downhill. Traditional stores were replaced by less fancy retailers, and some stores closed entirely, leaving Main Street lifeless at times. Plans for an extensive housing complex on nearby Davids Island that Donald J. Trump was to have built fell through, as did an invitation for Unicef to move its headquarters here. Hope for a resurgence in this city of 67,265, with large Italian, black, Hispanic and Jewish representation, has been pegged to the arrival of big discounters like the Price Club and Home Depot, both close to downtown.
New Roc bought the Macy's site two years ago for $10 million. The company said it had commitments for a Stop & Shop supermarket, a 20-screen theater and a two-rink ice center. The rest would be leased to restaurants and stores. Construction would begin early next year.
"These three tenants will attract five million people who have no reason to come to the downtown today," Robert Greene, a co-managing general partner of New Roc, said. "We expect that they will spend well in excess of $100 million annually."
Mr. Twining said, "We hope that some of those five million people who are coming to shop downtown will want to live there."
He added that the company was buying the site from the city and would enjoy abatements on its city property taxes.
Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which helped put the projects together, said they are examples of "what government can do in partnership with the private sector."
Doyle G. Hyett, chairman of Hyett Palma, an urban renewal consulting business in Alexandria, Va., said there was a national trend to revitalize downtowns.
"Downtowns are really hot right now," Mr. Hyett said. "One of the reasons is that the American buying public is speaking pretty loudly about how tired it is with the sameness of malls. Every downtown can be unique. Another reason is value. Downtowns are a good buy. The idea sounds very progressive. The retail is fine. The housing is the really exciting step."

HEADLINE: Vance Packard, 82, Challenger of Consumerism, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO 

 BODY:
Vance Packard, a journalist turned social critic whose best-selling books -- "The Hidden Persuaders," "The Status Seekers" and "The Waste Makers" -- warned Americans in the late 1950's about the excesses of advertising, social climbing and planned obsolescence, died yesterday at Martha's Vineyard Hospital. He was 82 and had homes in New Canaan, Conn., and Martha's Vineyard.,
Mr. Packard was a highly successful popularizer of serious ideas raised by America's postwar prosperity and the explosion of consumerism. He was skilled as well in coining titles for his books that endured in the national vocabulary. His vision of an America beset by manipulative forces and dominated by vast bureaucratic organizations struck a responsive chord with the public and regularly put him atop the best-seller lists. 
 His work also helped lay the ground for the muckraking works of the more turbulent 1960's, like Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" in 1962 and Ralph Nader's "Unsafe at Any Speed" in 1965.
Mr. Packard first gained national attention with the publication in 1957 of "The Hidden Persuaders," which exposed what he saw as the growing and not entirely benign influence of the nation's advertising industry. Alarmed by new techniques that convinced people to run out and buy things, he detailed advertising's fascination with the school of consumer analysis known as motivational research.
"Many of us are being influenced and manipulated, far more than we realize, in the patterns of our everyday lives," he wrote. He compared motivational research to "the chilling world of George Orwell and his Big Brother."
Mr. Packard emphasized the dangers of "subliminal projection," in which, he said, messages were flashed so quickly on television or movie screens that consumers could not recall seeing or hearing them though they responded to them. In "Hidden Persuaders" he reports that a New Jersey drive-in flashed the words "eat popcorn" on the movie screen for a split second to boost sales at its food stand. Marketing executives disputed his account.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review, A. C. Spectorsky called the book "frightening, entertaining and thought-stimulating." The work remained on The New York Times best-seller list for a year. "Hidden Persuaders" became all the rage; many readers claimed they were being subjected to subliminal advertising every time they noticed a glitch in their television reception.
The advertising business hit back; its representatives took to public forums everywhere to declare that motivational research helped advertisers better serve the American people. To this day, leaders in the industry deny that subliminal devices have been used to sell products in the marketplace. They denounced Mr. Packard's book as "malicious" because in their view, it made them seem needlessly sinister.
Mr. Packard did not anticipate the industry reaction, and he was stung by the attack on his work. But he became even more determined to take on other subjects about the nature of life in postwar America. He was of a generation of journalistic generalists, writers who were willing to address any number of topics, as long as they did the hard reporting that was needed.
In his next book, "The Status Seekers"(1959), Mr. Packard argued that "under its gloss of prosperity," the nation was becoming more socially divided as Americans tried desperately "to find new ways to draw lines that will separate the elect from the non-elect."
According to Daniel Horowitz, author of "Vance Packard and American Social Criticism" (1994), Mr. Packard blamed the consumer culture developed by capitalists for intensifying a striving for status and set out to debunk the notion that prosperity was helping to achieve the dream of a classless, egalitarian society.
Mr. Horowitz said that although Mr. Packard borrowed many ideas from others, he "went farther in asking his readers to question basic assumptions about the beneficence of the American society and economy."
In his third successive best seller, "The Waste Makers" (1960), Mr. Packard asserted that American business was so determined to sell at full tilt that it was encouraging consumers to use up or prematurely discard whatever they purchased. He outlined the ways manufacturers and advertisers persuaded consumers to buy expensive goods they did not really need.
The book set off a storm of criticism. Printers' Ink, a trade publication, declared that Mr. Packard's work reviled "an economic system which, for all its shortcomings," had given the United States "the world's highest standard of living."
Ernest Dichter, viewed as a leading force in motivational research and a target of "Hidden Persuaders," denounced Mr. Packard and other critics as "morality hucksters," writers who collected their royalties and retreated "to their Connecticut homes to cool off with a drink iced from a 1961 refrigerator engineered by the waste makers."
Over the next four decades Mr. Packard seemed to mellow a bit, writing books that were relatively hopeful in tone as well as some more in keeping with his past work. Mr. Horowitz said Mr. Packard's "optimism tempered his outrage" and that by the mid-1960's he "found himself outflanked on the left by the college students he helped bring to political awareness." Still, Mr. Packard continued to command a substantial audience for his work.
"The Pyramid Climbers" (1962) examined corporations and their executives. Mr. Packard saw success in corporate life being attained by those who were loyal, adaptable, deferential and nonantagonizing. This was followed in 1964 by "The Naked Society," which discussed how new technologies and new attitudes allowed a growing invasion of the privacy of the average American.
Other books included "The Sexual Wilderness" (1968), which chronicled changes in relationships between men and women, especially the increase in premarital sex; "A Nation of Strangers" (1972), which argued that corporate transfers had created a rootless, lonely nation; "Our Endangered Children" (1983), which maintained that a national preoccupation with money, status, sex and power was reinforcing an inherent bias against children, and "Ultra Rich: How Much Is Too Much" (1989), which explored the lives of 30 Americans whose average net worth was $330 million.
Among those influenced by his ideas was Betty Friedan, who after hearing one of his lectures decided to turn some magazine articles she was planning into a book that eventually became "The Feminine Mystique."
Vance Oakley Packard was born on May 22, 1914, in Granville Summit, Pa., one of three children of Philip J. and Mabel Case Packard. He was reared in State College, Pa., where his father worked for Penn State as a superintendent of the college farm.
After his graduation from high school in 1932, he attended Penn State, majoring in English and working for the literary magazine. He graduated in 1936 and got a $15-a-week job as a cub reporter for the Center Daily Times in State College. He won a scholarship to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, where he earned a master's degree in 1937.
Before writing his books, he worked for The Boston Daily Record and The Associated Press. In 1942 he left The Associated Press and joined American magazine. When it folded in 1956, Mr. Packard moved over to Collier's and wrote articles until 1956, when it, too, ceased publication.
He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Matthews; a daughter, Cynthia Richmond of Annandale, Va.; two sons, Randall, a professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta, and Vance Philip of Thornhurst, Pa., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Can't get data on securities fraud suits? Try the Internet.

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
IT is the investing world's version of "Godzilla vs. Megalon," a titanic struggle over the fate of the planet, watched from afar by hand-wringing government officials and hordes of small investors.
The battle between some class-action lawyers and the corporations they sue for securities fraud pits one side, which says that greedy corporations are defrauding small investors whose only recourse is to take them to court, against the other, which argues that evil litigators are stifling the American economy. The two sides disagree about everything, even such basic facts as how many suits get filed and how many get settled. 
 This ideological argument, filled with enough hot air to float all the balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, is not about to end. But perhaps the debate can be brought more down to earth by a proposal of a group of judges and law professors in and around San Francisco.
Their plan is simply to post all the major documents from all securities class-action lawsuits in at least one site on the Internet. That way they can be read and counted and studied by lawyers and reporters, regulators and legislators, academics and -- most importantly -- investors.
"Our Federal securities markets have always had a philosophy of open disclosure," said Joseph A. Grundfest, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now a professor at Stanford Law School. "Shouldn't it be the same way when it comes to allegations of fraud at public companies?"
With the encouragement of the S.E.C., Stanford has set up an Internet site to serve as a clearinghouse (http://securities.stanford.edu) and has been collecting legal documents.
And in a move that other courts may copy, the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California -- where many of these lawsuits are filed -- has proposed requiring lawyers on all sides in such suits to send many legal documents to a site like Stanford's. The new rule may be adopted as early as next month, after the public has a chance to comment on it, Federal District Judge Vaughn R. Walker said.
"We have had some lack of enthusiasm from some lawyers, who as a general rule tend to be pretty conservative and tend not to react terribly favorably to new ideas," the judge said, adding that the cost should be minimal because lawyers have to file only documents that are already prepared on word processors.
One criticism of class-action securities lawsuits has been that their intended beneficiaries -- investors who feel they have been defrauded -- cannot monitor the progress of legal proceedings.
In fact, they may well be unaware that a lawsuit has been filed at all. "Notification to class members traditionally involves a combination of mailings and newspaper advertisements that are expensive, employ small type, convey little substantive information and may be difficult for members of the class to locate," the California court said in its commentary on its proposed rule.
But now, unhappy investors in Solv-Ex or Presstek or even the Fidelity Magellan Fund, a unit of the FMR Corporation, can go on line and read the complaints filed by lawyers on their behalf. They will also be able to keep an eye on settlements, and decide whether these deals are likely to benefit them or simply to line their lawyers' pockets (as the corporate targets often contend).
Meanwhile, interested individuals, as well as policy makers and the professors who advise them, can get a better handle on the reality, rather than the rhetoric, of securities class-action suits. How many are frivolous? How often are companies winning or losing? And how much? And how are the lawsuits being changed by last year's act, which set new hurdles for charging fraud?
Professor Grundfest has already calculated that of the 96 companies sued in Federal court, 61 percent of the cases involved charges of accounting fraud and 49 percent involved insider sales. Only 5 percent included neither claim, he said.
Investors can do some interesting research on their own. For example, a quick examination of Stanford's site shows that the vast majority of suits there are against companies that trade on Nasdaq and its outer reaches.
And in close to half the roughly 60 cases in which documents are already available on line, lawyers for the plaintiffs included one firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach of San Diego. A partner of that firm, William S. Lerach, was the main supporter of the failed California referendum that would have made it easier for investors to sue companies; Mr. Lerach did not return telephone calls this week.
None of this will put an end to the bigger debate over class actions and the subsidiary issue of whether these statistics simply reflect the firm's skill or are proof that it, above all others, is exploiting the legal system. But Professor Grundfest hopes the Internet project will at least help ground the arguments in fact.
The two sides "will still be on separate planets," he said. "But at least they will all be in the same solar system."

HEADLINE: Retail Spending Off a Bit; Price Index Up 0.3%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Shoppers kept a wary eye on spending in November as this year's late holiday shopping season got under way, the Government indicated today in a report that seemed to confirm indications of only modest improvement from last year's poor sales.
Dragged down by weak automotive business, retail spending slumped four-tenths of 1 percent last month, as spending on goods other than cars and trucks rose only enough to keep pace with inflation, which remained mild. 
 "Consumers continue to pause," James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said. He predicted a "moderate Christmas" in which retailers would pull in about 6 percent more money, without allowing for inflation.
Inflation clearly is not to blame for the sluggish spending. The Labor Department reported today that the Consumer Price Index rose only three-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month and that core inflation -- which excludes the volatile energy and food categories -- rose only two-tenths of 1 percent.
Neither set of figures was expected to have much effect on the Federal Reserve policy meeting next Tuesday, which is widely expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.
A third Government report released today showed that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell by 13,000, to 317,000, in the week ended last Saturday, suggesting that the labor market remained tight despite a recent moderation in job growth.
Sluggish income growth has kept a damper on spending, most analysts agree, even as unemployment flirts with quarter-century lows and investors enjoy a second straight year of hefty stock market gains.
The sales report, compiled by the Commerce Department, showed that consumers thrust $206.1 billion across retail counters last month, $700 million less, seasonally adjusted, than in October.
Excluding automobiles, a volatile category in which sales dropped 2.6 percent, retail sales climbed three-tenths of 1 percent, just enough to keep pace with the Consumer Price Index.
Analysts warned, however, that the report, an estimate compiled from a small number of retailers, might not have been entirely accurate because Thanksgiving was so late this year, skewing the usual seasonal adjustments.
October's sales, however, were revised only slightly, to an advance of three-tenths of 1 percent instead of two-tenths of 1 percent.
In other categories of durable goods besides autos, merchants selling furniture and other equipment for the home saw a 1.2 percent increase last month while those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes showed no change.
For nondurables -- items expected to last less than three years -- sales inched ahead a disappointing one-tenth of 1 percent; revenues slumped six-tenths of 1 percent at department stores and other stores selling general merchandise, and nine-tenths of 1 percent at apparel and accessory stores.
Sales also fell four-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and two-tenths of 1 percent at food stores, the report showed.
Sales jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent at drugstores and 1.2 percent at gasoline service stations, but the latter gain merely reflected higher oil prices.
"This kind of rise in retail sales we don't need," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist for Keycorp, the Cleveland-based banking group. "It accrues mostly to foreigners and diverts spending from malls, restaurants and a variety of local merchants."
A Congressional committee said Dec. 4 that the Consumer Price Index might overstate inflation by 1.1 percentage points.
The index reflected the higher costs of energy last month. Gasoline climbed 1.8 percent and heating oil and natural gas jumped even more as the energy index advanced for the second straight month to offset moderation in other prices, including dairy products and fruits and vegetables.
Excluding food and energy, the index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in November, the same as in October.
In the New York metropolitan area, prices edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in November, and four-tenths of 1 percent in Chicago. San Francisco showed no change, and Los Angeles and Philadelphia had moderate declines.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Said to Have Asked Attorney General to Stay On

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
As he wrestles to fill top domestic posts for a second term, President Clinton met with Attorney General Janet Reno this evening intending to ask her to stay on for a second term in his Cabinet, and he might announce other decisions on Friday, senior Administration officials said tonight.
Ms. Reno's aides said she would stay on if asked. 
 But after the meeting tonight senior White House aides said the President would only tell them that he had had a "wonderful meeting with Ms. Reno," and they insisted that they did not know its outcome.
For days, White House aides have said Mr. Clinton hoped to announce his economic team, or other Cabinet choices, at a news conference scheduled for Friday at 2 P.M. But if posts remain unfilled, the encounter could devolve into a series of nettlesome questions. Asked today what Mr. Clinton's goal for the news conference was, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said simply, "Get out alive."
So far this much seemed certain, according to various officials:
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico has told people that the White House has assured him he will either be the chief United States delegate to the United Nations or Secretary of Commerce. Some officials said tonight that the United Nations job appeared most likely because the Secretary of State-designate, Madeleine K. Albright, had raised objections to the other leading candidate for that job, former Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke.
If Mr. Richardson gets the United Nations post, William M. Daley, a Chicago lawyer and member of the Daley political family, could take the Commerce job, officials said, and the Federal Highway Administrator, Rodney Slater, could be Secretary of Transportation.
The new White House chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, has chosen Sylvia Matthews, now chief of staff at the Treasury Department, and John Podesta, a former White House staff secretary, as his two deputies, replacing Evelyn S. Lieberman and Harold M. Ickes.
Also still up in the air is the post of Labor Secretary. Former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania and Alexis Herman, the White House director of public liaison, remain the leading candidates.
For weeks, the President has passed up repeated chances to say anything that could be interpreted as an endorsement of Ms. Reno, whose independent-minded actions in appointing special prosecutors to investigate various Administraion officials has drawn the anonymous sniping of some White House aides.
Aides said Mr. Clinton had resisted making any public comment about Ms. Reno because he did not want to be seen as trying to influence her decision on whether to appoint a special prosecutor to look into disputed Democratic Party fund-raising practices. She decided last month not to seek an outside inquiry, and aides said the President now felt free to resolve her future.
Mr. Clinton finds himself in a particular bind concerning the National Economic Council, an institution he created to act as an honest broker among competiting Cabinet departments on economic issues.
Many in the White House have urged the President to reward Gene Sperling, the deputy head of the council, with the chairmanship, replacing Laura D'Andrea Tyson. But other members of his Cabinet have urged the appointment of someone with more experience and political weight than Mr. Sperling.

HEADLINE: Plan Revamps Hospital Care For Uninsured

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
To help control the cost of providing medical treatment to the poor, the Whitman administration announced today a plan that requires hospitals to manage the care of uninsured patients, who now have little choice but to go to emergency rooms.
Under the plan announced by the State Health Commissioner, Len Fishman, New Jersey and the Federal Government would continue to reimburse hospitals for the uninsured patients who walk through their doors. But the hospitals would be able to send those patients to doctors, clinics and treatment centers that may be able to provide better care for less money. For example, a hospital could help a person with a chronic illness like asthma find a doctor who would provide regular care, reducing the need for emergency-room treatment. 
 "This will allow hospitals to provide care in the most appropriate setting, which has not been possible in the past," Mr. Fishman said.
For years, New Jersey has been one of the leaders in the nation in creating innovative health care financing plans. And some national health care plans have drawn heavily from New Jersey's experience.
New Jersey is one of only a handful of states committed to reimbursing hospitals for treatment of the uninsured, a system known in the state as charity care. This year, the state distributed $310 million to 75 hospitals to help pay for the medical care of more than 100,000 uninsured people.
The plan requires approval by Federal health care officials. If the plan wins Federal backing, Mr. Fishman said, "we will be making history."
Officials of hospitals in the state said today that they support the plan. Gary Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said hospitals in the state had long wanted more options for treating the uninsured. "We see this as an important and positive step forward," Mr. Carter said. "There is no reason to have someone with a substance-abuse problem to be cared for only in a hospital setting."
Although administration officials said they hoped the plan would reduce the costs of caring for the uninsured, they did not say today how the state would pay for charity care when the current financing system expires at the end of next year.
Paying for medical care for the uninsured has long perplexed state officials. It took five months this year for state officials to decide to continue to rely on payroll taxes designated for the state's unemployment fund to cover most of the cost. In the meantime, hospitals had to wait for the state aid. Legislators and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman have promised business leaders and organized labor that they will find an alternative to the unemployment fund and a permanent financing solution next year.
New Jersey officials feel confident that Federal health care financing officials will approve the plan. Many states have received Federal waivers for plans that increase the use of managed-care practices. New Jersey, like many other states, has already set up a managed-care system for poor people who qualify for the Federal Medicaid program. Under the program announced today, which is expected to begin on Jan. 1, 1998, each hospital must submit a plan to the state with a list of clinics and doctors. Because many hospitals in the state already participate in managed-care programs, some hospitals already have affiliations with neighborhood clinics.
The state will also require each hospital to have a substance-abuse treatment program for uninsured patients. And each year, the state will review the quality of care provided to the uninsured by each hospital and its network of providers.
If a hospital fails to meet state performance standards, the state will use part of the hospital's subsidy to hire an outside contractor to work with the hospital to improve care.
"This is a plan that holds hospitals accountable but gives them the flexibility to use other providers," Mr. Fishman said. "It benefits the charity-care patient who will have access to the medical care he or she needs. And it helps the taxpayer because it gets the best value for every charity care dollar."
State officials hope the plan will help get more people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol into substance-abuse treatment centers since the hospitals will be allowed to refer their uninsured patients to the programs, and then will reimburse the treatment centers with some of the money they get from the state and the Federal Government.
But the State Assembly Democratic leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr., called the Republican administration's proposal a "concept without details."
"Before we could support the Federal waiver required to implement this plan, we would need more information," he said. "We don't even know how much this system will cost, how much it will save, or how it will be funded."

Trade Forum to Take Note Of Issue of Labor Standards

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 12

 BODY:
As the end of the World Trade Organization's first meeting neared, national representatives compromised today over the question of whether the group should be involved in improving standards for workers, officials said.
They said the ministers had agreed to include a mention of labor rights, the most contentious issue at the five-day conference, in the group's final declaration on Friday. 
 Earlier today, the United States and the European Union reached agreement on a deal to liberalize trade in information technology. The agreement removed the last barrier to extending the pact to Asian nations, some of which still object to its provisions. The trade pact would phase out tariffs on a range of goods like computers, software and telecommunications equipment.
But on labor standards, the talks were in doubt. Early in the day, Pakistan declared victory in its effort to keep the trade group's communique free of a statement on the matter. But Commerce Minister Mohammed Zubair Khan, conceded later that it would be mentioned.
That would be a success for the United States, which, conference officials said, had threatened to block the declaration unless labor rights were mentioned. Washington argued that a key area of human rights had to be mentioned in connection with world trade, aware of rising concern at home about sweatshops and child labor, mostly in the third world.
But nations like Pakistan, India and Malaysia, which led the arguments, said the push to link labor rights and trade was merely a disguised attempt to use the trade organization to undermine their low-cost labor advantage.
They said that the International Labor Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, was the right forum for the issue and that the World Trade Organization had no role.
Officials at the conference said the final declaration would refer to the labor organization as "the competent body" to set and promote good labor standards and that it and the World Trade Organization would "continue their existing collaboration" on the issue. The message, they said, would "reject the use of labor standards for protectionist purposes." The ministers will also declare that they "agree that the comparative advantage of countries, particularly developing countries, must be in no way put into question."

HEADLINE: New Whitewater Aide Had Troubles From Failed Business

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A lawyer-lobbyist hired this week to be a high White House official handling Whitewater issues has only recently emerged from his own significant legal and financial problems arising from a small publishing business he helped to run before it collapsed three years ago.
Lanny J. Davis began working on Monday as a special White House counsel supervising Congressional and media relations on Whitewater and a variety of other investigations of the Clinton Administration. Mr. Davis, 51, an old friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, was hired after spending the last year defending the President and his wife on television and radio programs. He had been a partner at the law firm of Patton Boggs, and is well-known in Washington and its suburbs as a radio commentator and an unsuccessful candidate for a Congressional seat in nearby Montgomery County, Md. 
 Less well known, however, is how Mr. Davis, with three other investors, embarked on a small business venture in 1988 that failed five years later, leaving behind a trail of acrimony and lawsuits that eventually were settled. Mr. Davis was a senior executive at the publishing company, as well as one of its largest shareholders and its lawyer. The business was seized by a bank in 1993 after being delinquent on loans and on payroll taxes, which it had failed to withhold from employees' paychecks nearly from the outset.
The collapse of the company left Mr. Davis near financial ruin and contemplating the possibility of personal bankruptcy. Instead, five months ago Mr. Davis settled the last of two lawsuits, which had accused him of mismanagement and negligence.
But the court settlements left unresolved Mr. Davis's actual role in the collapse of the company. And the White House never attempted to sort out those issues. Rather, the White House relied on the facts outlined in the court papers and Mr. Davis's explanation of events.
Jack Quinn, the White House counsel, said that his staff had examined the court papers describing the lawsuits against Mr. Davis, and had questioned him. Since Mr. Davis had settled the suits, Mr. Quinn said the accusations in them would not impinge on Mr. Davis's ability to perform his job or represent the Clintons on Whitewater issues that, like Mr. Davis's problems, involved delinquent loans, failed businesses, unpaid taxes, and dissatisfied business partners who say they have had to bear a disproportionate share of the venture's losses.
"We have no reason to believe this commercial dispute will in any way affect his ability to perform his duties on this staff," Mr. Quinn said in a prepared statement that he issued on Wednesday.
In performing their review of Mr. Davis, White House officials never tried to contact his three former business partners, some of whom are still angry about his role in the affair. In court papers, one investor blames Mr. Davis for mismanaging the business and misrepresenting its financial condition, being negligent in allowing payroll checks to be issued without tax being withheld, and failing to take steps to safeguard the company's books and records.
Mr. Davis said he sees some similarities between the failure of his business and Whitewater. In both cases, he said, allegations have been made that were unfounded. In both cases, a real estate recession and the savings and loan crisis took a heavy toll on the businesses.
But, he said, there were also important differences. His was a publishing venture and not a real estate one.
"My business partners were never accused or convicted of any crimes," Mr. Davis said. "No taxpayer money was ever lost by the loans."
Moreover, he said, unlike the Clintons, he was far more heavily involved in the early stages of the business.
"I was much more active in the business than either of the Clintons and therefore had much more responsibility," Mr. Davis said. "I feel proud that I ultimately stepped up to the line at great expense and pain to me and my family and paid a heavy price to settle all my obligations."
In a $5.5 million leveraged buyout in 1988, Mr. Davis and three other investors bought the Record Company, a small newspaper and printing business in Silver Spring, Md., from the Mahaffeys, a family that had run the company for 50 years. Mr. Davis was one of the three largest shareholders of the company, served as its lawyer, was a member of its board and a senior corporate officer.
 
The Partners
Business Venture Dissolves in Failure
The group put together by Mr. Davis initially consisted of Vicki L. Bagley, a Washington businesswoman, and Theodore J. Venetoulis, a former Baltimore County executive who had run unsuccessfully for governor of Maryland. The fourth investor, Stanley Cohen, joined the group after the bank complained that there was not enough capital in the venture.
After the company collapsed five years later, lawsuits were filed against Mr. Davis and Ms. Bagley by the bank and by Mr. Cohen. Mr. Venetoulis sought shelter under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. During negotiations over how to resolve the competing claims, Mr. Davis said he also might seek bankruptcy, but he never did.
Instead, last June he agreed to pay $40,000 to settle the suit filed by Mr. Cohen, who had guaranteed a $100,000 bank loan to Mr. Davis for the venture. By the time of the settlement, the loan had been reduced to about $60,000. The lawsuit accused Mr. Davis of mismanagement, misrepresenting the financial condition, and of negligence in failing to make sure that the company had paid its payroll taxes.
Mr. Davis also successfully contested a $300,000 tax lien that the Internal Revenue Service had placed on his home for the payroll taxes that the Record Company had failed to withhold. Mr. Davis said that the I.R.S. concluded that he was not the responsible party.
In addition, last year Mr. Davis paid $127,500 to Nationsbank to resolve the $400,000 personal guarantee he had given for a $3.2 million loan to make the acquisition. At the time, the bank claimed it was owed $1.8 million on the loan; it collected $268,000 from Ms. Bagley and $254,000 from Lynn M. Venetoulis, the wife of Mr. Venetoulis.
The Mahaffeys, who received a $2.3 million promissory note from Mr. Davis, Mr. Venetoulis and Ms. Bagley, had to make do with about $1 million less than they had been promised, lawyers said.
Mr. Davis acknowledged in interviews that he had over-extended himself in taking out such large loans, and that he and Mr. Venetoulis, the two investors most heavily involved in running the company, had made business mistakes, but did nothing venal.
"Mistakes were made by all of us, but certainly by Ted and myself," he said. He said he ultimately lost $232,500 in loan repayments and settlements, wiping out most of his savings. (The calculation does not include $145,000 in salary and other payments Mr. Davis received from the company.)
 
The Accusations
Assessing Blame For Collapse
In court documents Mr. Davis denied the accusations in the lawsuit he settled in June that had been brought by Mr. Cohen. The complaint said that because of Mr. Davis's negligence, the company had failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll taxes, corporate assets were wasted, and some of the company's books and records were not kept in an orderly way. After the bank had seized the company, it complained that it was unable to find some important records.
"Cohen understood that Davis remained intricately involved in the Record Company's business and financial affairs," Mr. Cohen said in court papers. "It is disingenuous at best for Davis to plead a lack of responsibility for the financial failure of the Record Company."
Mr. Davis denied Mr. Cohen's accusations.
"Stanley Cohen was very bitter," Mr. Davis said. "He threw in a lot of charges in his complaint that were totally without foundation. His charges are totally unfair."
Mr. Cohen initially declined to discuss the failure of the Record Company. But he changed his mind after hearing Mr. Davis's comments about him.
"The court record speaks for itself and is accurate," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Davis said in court papers that Mr. Venetoulis was responsible for the Record Company's failure to make the payroll taxes.
"I was not aware that payroll taxes were not paid," Mr. Davis said. "When I found out about it, I was shocked by it. I was made aware of it after the fact. Ted Venetoulis was in charge."
He also said it was Mr. Venetoulis who was responsible for safeguarding the books and records. "Ted Venetoulis was in charge at the time and I had no knowledge of what happened," Mr. Davis said. "There clearly was a problem with the books and records."
In court papers, Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Davis's professed ignorance of these matters "is either inconceivable or demonstrates his complete ineptitude as a director and officer of the Record Company."
Mr. Venetoulis declined to discuss the Record Company. His lawyer, Judith Sturtz Karp, said the payroll taxes became a problem because a bookkeeper whom she would not identify had failed to withhold the taxes. Ms. Karp said that at the time, Mr. Davis was acting as a senior financial officer of the company. Mr. Davis denied that.
Court records show that Mr. Davis's title was president and associate publisher of the publishing unit of the Record Company and executive vice president of the composition unit of the company.
Ms. Karp said that the breakup of the Record Company was "a nasty, nasty, nasty situation."
"Lanny was slinging the most mud," she said. "He accused everybody of everything except he never looked in the mirror. He would say, 'my wife didn't sign anything, so I've got nothing to lose.' Lanny thought he was untouchable under Maryland law," which protects the assets owned jointly by a husband and wife from the creditors of them individually.
Ms. Karp said that although the bank complained when it seized the company's assets that it could not find some of the books and records, neither Mr. Venetoulis nor Mr. Davis removed or destroyed any records.
Joanne Stevens, a spokeswoman for Nationsbank in Maryland, declined to comment.
Mr. Davis said that when he became involved in the Record Company and pledged to guarantee $400,000 of a $3.2 million bank loan, he was told by his banker that he was pledging his entire net worth. Still, two years later he borrowed heavily again, buying a townhouse with Mr. Venetoulis on Fenwick Island, Del., for $425,000, which required a $375,000 mortgage. After Mr. Venetoulis went into bankruptcy, Mr. Davis said he could not meet the payments on the house and he sold it for $315,000. Rather than surrender the house, he said, he decided to take out a new $90,000, 10-year loan from Citibank to make up the shortfall.
 
The Career
A Tough Time As a Politician
Mr. Davis has been a partner at Patton Boggs since 1978 and has long been active in politics as a Maryland representative on the Democratic National Committee.
After graduating from Yale Law School, Mr. Davis decided to make his own run at politics, twice running for Congress. He did not have an easy time. In 1974, as political scandals cast dark clouds over Washington, he reported that important campaign files had been stolen from his office. The papers later turned up in a storage room. Mr. Davis's critics accused him of a publicity stunt. Mr. Davis has said the incident might have been staged by a disgruntled campaign aide.
When he ran again two years later, he was criticized for campaign literature that said he had graduated cum laude from Yale Law School even though Yale did not use that distinction. He apologized at the time and said the error was inadvertent. He also failed to report properly to the Federal Election Commission that he had received $8,500 in loans from colleagues at Patton Boggs and family members. He said that mistake was based on a misunderstanding of Federal election law.

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge Again as Dow Falls by 98.81

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks continued their December swoon yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.5 percent in a daylong decline that was capped with a 46-point plunge in the last half-hour of trading.
Other indexes dropped as well, with the Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks also off 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite index down eight-tenths of 1 percent. The Dow fell 98.81 points, to 6,303.71, its sharpest one-day drop in terms of points since July 15. 
 The declines were sharper than they were on Wednesday, when world markets plunged and American interest rates shot sharply higher in a sign of investor nervousness after strong rallies in both stocks and bonds since the American elections.
Yesterday, global stock markets were up or down only slightly. And the American bond market finished the day little changed. But it was the reversal of an early rally in the bond market that helped propel the decline in stocks. And a further rise in interest rates could push stock prices even lower in the near term. It was the sharp drop in long-term interest rates in November that helped propel the Dow and the S.& P. to their highs.
"If you introduce any kind of interest rate threat you have some real vulnerability," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The nervousness on Wall Street spilled over into the Asian markets early today, with stocks in Tokyo tumbling at the opening. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell more than 500 points, or 2.5 percent, in hectic morning trading to less than the psychologically important level of 20,000.
But the Nikkei rebounded to close down 159.81 points, or 0.78 percent, at 20,341.39. Stock markets in Hong Kong and Australia were also sharply lower.
The decline overseas was prompted largely by a sharp drop in a S.& P. 500 futures contract, which trades around the clock on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The March S.& P. contract fell to a low of 725.95 in early trading in Tokyo, down from its close in the United States at 734.50, and down from the actual S.& P. 500 index of 729.30. Typically, the futures price is slightly higher than the actual index. At midnight in New York, the contract had recovered to 734.50.
The selloff in Asia may further rattle nerves on Wall Street today, given that yesterday's tumble in the Dow came largely in the last 15 minutes of trading.
And after the market closed, a leading technology stock on the Nasdaq market, the Oracle Corporation reported earnings that were lower than expected. The company reported earnings of 27 cents a share in the second quarter, a penny shy of Wall Street estimates. In after-hours trading, shares of Oracle fell 2 1/4 from its close of 47 1/4..
Still, several analysts were not worried late yesterday about Wall Street's recent slump.
Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St Louis, said yesterday that the selloff was positive. "This is a very normal correction," he said, alluding to the kind of breather markets take after strong rallies. And referring to the comments of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, last week, he added, "This is removing some of the greed that Greenspan was worried about."
In a speech Dec. 5, the Fed chairman asked whether the stock market was rising because of "irrational exuberance." He did not answer the question but his comments set off a stock selloff last Friday. Investors are still talking about what his comment meant for the stock and bond markets.
The Dow is now down 3.73 percent since it set a closing high of 6,547.79 on Nov. 25. That is half in percentage terms of the fall the Dow took from its closing high in May -- then the record -- when fears of a too-strong economy and a Federal Reserve interest rate increase sent stocks plunging in July. In December, the Dow is off 3.34 percent, which has eaten up about 40 percent of its spectacular November rally.
Nearly 30 percent of the Dow's decline was accounted for by two stocks, Philip Morris, which was off 3 3/4, to 113 3/4, and I.B.M., which fell 4 1/2, to 151 5/8. Philip Morris and I.B.M. helped lead the November rally and the selling now seemed to indicate that some investors and money managers were trying to lock in their gains at a time when the near-term market outlook has been clouded by Mr. Greenspan's comments, the rise in interest rates and the outlook for the economy.
Another unknown is how mutual fund investors will respond if the declines continue. There are preliminary indications that the flow of money into stock funds slowed considerably in the first week of December.
"Whether 6,500 on the Dow was too much or 6,300 is the bottom, I don't know," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company. But, he added, the economic fundamentals that have helped push the stock market higher have not changed.
The decline in the Dow was the first since January in which the Dow fell more than 1 percent on each of two consecutive days.
Laszlo Birinyi, the head of Greenwich Associates, a market analysis firm in Greenwich, Conn.said that after the bond rally failed yesterday morning, there were numerous computer-driven sell programs that hit the market, with many coming in the final minutes. He estimated that but for those programs the Dow would have been up for the day.
David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said that there was no clear cause of the selloff, other than a failed bond rally.
Hugh Johnson, an investment strategist at First Albany, also said that there was no obvious reason for the selling, but that it reflected investor nervousness after the big rally that pushed up the Dow more than 500 points during November. "When they start to sell stocks, it can look like a race to the exit," he said. "That's what it looked like today."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher After an Accord To Stabilize the Planned Euro

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar seesawed in global foreign exchange trading yesterday before shooting higher on news of an agreement among European Union finance ministers to stabilize the proposed single European currency.
New hope for a viable single European currency, called the Euro, undermined the mark. Traders who had incorrectly bet on a falling dollar scrambled to buy the dollar to minimize losses. That pushed the dollar even higher in what is known as a short-covering rally. 
 "There was a rush to get in and buy some dollars," said Victor Polce, corporate foreign exchange manager at the New York branch of Commerzbank.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5558 marks, up sharply from 1.5423 marks Thursday. The dollar traded at 113.95 Japanese yen, up from 113.27. The British pound fell to $1.6554 from $1.6576.
The dollar initially strengthened in early Asian trading on rumors that Japanese officials want an exchange rate of 120 yen to the dollar, a level of yen weakness last seen nearly four years ago, in order to make Japan's exports more affordable abroad and help its economic recovery.
The rumors were said to come from the newsletter of Johnson Smick International, a Washington consulting firm founded by Manuel H. Johnson, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a former Congressional aide, David M. Smick. But the firm denied it was reporting such information.
In New York trading, the dollar fell, rose and fell again, mimicking the stock market in a pattern that has been repeated most of the week. But currency traders diverted their attention from the stock market when European Union finance ministers reached an agreement aimed at insuring the Euro's stability after it makes its debut on Jan. 1, 1999. Word of the pact at a European meeting in Dublin, led to a selloff in the mark, which would be replaced by the Euro as Europe's dominant currency.
"When the stock market started off down we sold the dollar, when it came back we bought the dollar, when it went down we sold the dollar again," said Thomas Lapinski, chief dealer at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "When the stability pact was announced, the dollar just took off, and it was pretty much one way up after that."

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities Higher As Firm Dollar Aids Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Government securities traded higher yesterday, aided by weak economic data and a firm dollar.
Shorter maturities attracted investors who were shifting from the stock market, while a strong dollar, which makes United States investments more attractive to foreign investors, helped underpin bond prices. 
 The 30-year bond rose 21/32 , to a price of 993/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, slipped to 6.57 percent, from 6.62 percent on Thursday.
For the last few sessions, the market has largely ignored economic data, with technical factors dominating trade. But yields declined yesterday after the Government reported that business inventories in October had increased a larger-than-expected half-percent -- matching the gain in July. While inventory buildups can help the economy in the short term, they threaten an economic slowdown if not matched by sales.
Investors also reacted to a University of Michigan survey that indicated consumer sentiment fell in December to 98.8 from 99.2 in November. Most had expected a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent.
James Padinha, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, said that consumer expectations had been rising for a long time and that the University of Michigan index was indicating "there was not much of a slowdown in the economy."
"The inventory increase," he added, "on the other hand is stronger than expected, but not threatening."
Steven Landis, director of fixed- income investments at Bull and Bear Advisors Inc., said he saw value in the market. "All of the news this week has been market friendly," he said, "and the market has reached levels where you will be glad you bought securities."
He said the Treasury auction of two-year and five-year notes next week, along with coupon payments and payments on maturing issues, would put about $4.5 billion in cash back into the market by the time the year is out.
Mr. Landis attributed the positive ending to the market's week to short- covering by dealers and overseas buying spurred by a strong dollar.
"The dollar firmed," he said "on news that the European Union finance ministers had reached agreement on penalties to protect the future European common currency from being wrecked by excessive borrowing by national governments. And the agreement seems to have clout behind it."
Next week, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy arm will meet on Tuesday for a one-day meeting; few expect the central bank to adjust interest rates in the last meeting of the year. On Wednesday and Thursday, the Treasury will auction $30.75 billion of new two-year and five-year notes.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note is being offered at a price to yield 5.74 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.05 percent.

HEADLINE: Anti-Apartheid Fighter Charged With Defrauding Relief Funds

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A former clergyman who was once a prominent anti-apartheid activist and became a high-level official in the African National Congress was charged today with fraud and theft involving the misuse of half a million dollars contributed to his nonprofit organization.
The investigation of the ex-clergyman, Allan Boesak, took nearly two years, and the case has often been cited as an example of the new Government's failure to deal swiftly with charges of corruption and misconduct leveled against its own. 
 But today in a Cape Town courtroom, Mr. Boesak was charged with 9 counts of fraud and 21 counts of theft involving the disappearance of more than $500,000 -- mostly money donated to his Foundation for Peace and Justice by Danish and Swedish aid organizations.
Mr. Boesak, who has been living in Berkeley, Calif., for the past year as a fellow at the American Baptist Seminary of the West, was not in court. But lawyers for his accountant, Freddie Steenkamp, who was also charged, said Mr. Boesak would return in January to face charges. Mr. Steenkamp appeared in court today and was released on $500 bail.
Mr. Boesak did not return telephone calls to his office in Berkeley. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Back when challenging apartheid was dangerous, Mr. Boesak was a minister in Cape Town who won international fame for leading the charge to have the Dutch Reformed Church condemn apartheid.
When the charges of misusing funds first surfaced in late 1993, Mr. Boesak had become the A.N.C.'s provincial leader in the Cape Town area and was South Africa's representative-designate to the United Nations.
At first, African National Congress officials tried to brush aside the charges. Lawyers assembled to investigate the incident under the direction of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki issued a report clearing Mr. Boesak of all wrongdoing.
Mr. Mbeki did say Mr. Boesak's accounting practices were extremely poor, but he found that it was Mr. Boesak who was actually owed money -- about $65,000.
Mr. Boesak demanded apologies, retractions and reparations from the aid agencies that had made the accusations. But the donors scoffed at Mr. Mbeki's findings.
Lawyers for DanChurch Aid, a Danish church group, said Mr. Boesak had diverted as much as $835,000 from helping victims of apartheid to buy a luxurious home in Cape Town and to settle his wife's debts.
The aid agencies turned their findings over to the Office for Serious Economic Offenses in South Africa, which took more than a year to turn its findings over to the Attorney General for Cape Town.
The allegations over misappropriation of funds were not Mr. Boesak's first brush with scandal: He had been forced to resign his ministry in 1990 after acknowledging an extramarital affair with the woman who is now his second wife.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM;
Remarks From Nominee for Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of William M. Daley's remarks today after being chosen as Commerce Secretary, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a transcription company:
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your kind words and particularly for your confidence. Let me extend my deep appreciation to you and the Vice President. I am honored to join such a strong team and a distinguished economic team. 
 I believe there has never been a more vigorous commitment to the creation and expansion of markets for American businesses large and small than the one which we have seen under this Administration.
President Clinton understands the economic challenges of our times. He understands the new world in which America must compete if we are to meet, make, the next century as promising and as prosperous for our nation and its people as the one that's about to end.
I was privileged to witness firsthand his leadership, and his leadership of Secretaries Brown and Kantor, when we launched unprecedented efforts to aid American business by identifying opportunities and lowering barriers at home and abroad. And that's one major reason that we have seen steady economic growth and robust job creation for the past four years.
I deeply believe in the ingenuity, creative energy and productive capacity of this great nation. In the nearly 100 years since the Commerce Department was inaugurated, these qualities have helped America become the economic engine and envy of the world.
I should not let this moment pass without noting the tremendous efforts and dedication of the department's staff and the workers of that department throughout the world.
We live in a very different world today, a world in which competition is all around us. And more is required of us to maintain that economic leadership.
My commitment to you, Mr. President, and to our fellow Americans, is to work day and night in partnership with American businesses, from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses, in our inner cities and rural America, to help face the challenges and seize the opportunities which lie ahead for us.
And if you'll permit me one note, one final note, Mr. President, public service often is demeaned and denigrated in these days. But I have a very different view. I come a family in which we were taught, by word and example, that there is no higher calling or greater trust. If the Senate will honor me with their confirmation, it is my intent to serve in that spirit.
Mr. President, I can think of no greater distinction than to serve you and our country. On behalf of my family, my wife, Loretta, my daughters Lauren, Moira, and my son, William, who's here, I thank you immensely. And congratulations to my new colleagues. And, again, I thank you for this great opportunity.

HEADLINE: Salesman For Unity Kofi Atta Annan

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A year ago, Kofi Annan flew to the war-battered capital of Bosnia to preside as the United Nations handed over a foundering peacekeeping mission to NATO.
His eloquent litany of the West's failings there was a performance, many say, that helped establish him as the leading contender for the job he won today: Secretary General of the United Nations. 
 "The world cannot claim ignorance of what those who live here have endured," Mr. Annan, a Ghanaian who was then the representative of the Secretary General in Bosnia, said that day in Sarajevo. "In looking back, we should all recall how we responded to the escalating horrors of the last four years. And, as we do, there are questions which each of us must ask: What did I do? Could I have done more? Did I let my prejudice, or my fear, overwhelm my reasoning? And, above all, how would I react next time?"
A diplomat known for candor and clear speaking, Mr. Annan is regarded as particularly suited for one job that defeated the departing Boutros Boutros-Ghali: selling the United Nations to skeptics, especially in the United States Congress.
Where Mr. Boutros-Ghali is an intellectual, private to the point of being reclusive, and sometimes prickly, Mr. Annan is considered accessible, affable and astute in the public politics of the job. Where Mr. Boutros-Ghali is admired, Mr. Annan is liked.
This evening, after the soft-spoken descendant of a family of paramount chieftains was named the next Secretary General -- the first black African to hold the job -- diplomats recalled how skillfully he negotiated his way among the four contentious outside powers in Bosnia: the United States, Britain, France and Russia.
"He is the only top official of the U.N. who came out of the Bosnia experience with dignity and without having harmed the organization or relations with any one of the great powers," an American official said. "That's what a great diplomat's about."
The United States vetoed Mr. Boutros-Ghali's pursuit of a second term, contending that without a new face the United Nations would never persuade a dubious Congress that it was on a serious course of reform. Of Mr. Annan, the American official said, "He has the right skills and credentials to bring this organization into the 21st century."
In choosing Mr. Annan, the Security Council has selected a consummate insider, a lifelong international civil servant.
Among his critics, especially the French, who would have preferred a candidate with political and ministerial experience (and from a French-speaking nation), there is concern that Mr. Annan may lack the stature or clout of his predecessor.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, a former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in his native Egypt, came to the United Nations from a career in international diplomacy, much of it in the tough world of Middle Eastern and African peacemaking.
Mr. Annan's resume is more administrative: Assistant Secretary General for Program Planning, Budget and Finance, head of human resources and security coordinator, director of the budget, chief of personnel for the High Commissioner for Refugees, administrative officer for the Economic Commission for Africa.
He was named Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations on March 1, 1993, just in time to watch the debacle in Somalia the following fall and the genocide in Rwanda the next spring. He stood by in frustration as the major nations of the world, led by the United States, refused to intervene in Rwanda.
But over the years Mr. Annan has been given assignments in difficult moments, and has undertaken risky diplomatic missions and managed them with quiet success. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he was sent to Iraq to negotiate the release of hostages and the safe passage of 500,000 Asian workers stranded in the region.
His handover of the United Nations operation in Bosnia impressed officials of several major countries.
Back in New York in 1996, he brought the same clear language to renewed threats of genocide in Central Africa.
In July, with a crisis looming in Burundi, he said: "We have to move very quickly before everything blows up in our faces. As it is, history will judge us rather severely for Rwanda. I don't think we can repeat that experience in Burundi."
His calls for a multinational force went unheeded, however. No United Nations official, not even a Secretary General, can force an action beyond what leading member nations are willing to authorize and support.
Kofi Atta Annan was born into a prominent family in Kumasi, Ghana -- a British colony then called the Gold Coast -- on April 8, 1938. His father was the elected Governor of Ashanti Province and a hereditary paramount chief of the Fante people. The young Mr. Annan began his education at a local university of science and technology, then went on to Macalester College in St. Paul for a degree in economics.
Graduate studies at the Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva followed. In 1971-72, he was a Sloan Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a master of science degree in management.
By then he had joined the United Nations, first in Geneva at the World Health Organization. He remained with the organization -- except for two years in the mid-1970's when he returned to Ghana to take over national tourism development -- for the rest of his career, serving in Europe, Africa and New York.
Mr. Annan's first marriage, to a Nigerian, ended in divorce. In 1984, he married Nane Lagergren, a Swedish lawyer and judge whose mother was the sister of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who died, apparently in Russian hands, trying to save the lives of Jews in World War II. The couple, who have been living on Roosevelt Island but will soon move to the Secretary General's official residence on Sutton Place, have three children: a daughter, Ama, 27, and a son, Kojo, 23, from his first marriage, and a daughter, Nina, 26, from his wife's first marriage.
Mr. Annan is popular with the United Nations staff, and today a colleague told a story to illustrate why.
Once this official got in trouble for an unguarded comment to the press. Mr. Annan endured the tongue-lashing himself, then called in the offending colleague, who was sure his job was lost, and delivered a short, sweet message, "Don't let the turkeys get you down."

HEADLINE: Often-Criticized Bridge Agency Votes to Increase the Only Toll on L.I.

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC BEACH, L.I., Dec. 13

 BODY:
In the world of bridges, the Nassau County Bridge Authority, whose sole purpose is to operate a drawbridge here, is one of a kind.
Vehicles cross the bridge 7.5 million times a year, filling the authority's coffers with toll revenues. It is the only toll on any road or bridge on Long Island. 
 Over the years, its operations have been denounced by District Attorney Denis Dillon as a Republican Party patronage mill, criticized by State Comptroller Edward Regan as wasteful and investigated by several county grand juries for things like toll skimming and no-show jobs.
The bridge connects Atlantic Beach, at the western tip of the Long Beach barrier island, with the main body of Long Island. The north end of the bridge is where Nassau meets Queens and the Nassau Expressway begins. Lawrence is on one side of the border and the Rockaways on the other.
Many critics contend that the tolls should be abolished, along with the authority itself. They call the agency a self-perpetuating expense, because it spends most of its $3 million annual toll revenue to pay the collectors and for administrative overhead, rather than for bridge operations.
Nevertheless, the authority's three-member commission voted unanimously today to raise the passenger-car toll to $1.25 each way, from 75 cents, despite a protest by 200 angry drivers at a hearing last week. But the authority scaled back the increase proposed for discounted frequent-user passes, a tactic it has used in the past to mollify those who use the bridge the most. A round trip for those who buy a 40-trip ticket book will increase to 75 cents.
"Instead of highway robbery, these guys have figured out a new crime," said the County Legislature's Democratic minority leader, Bruce Nyman. "It's called bridge robbery." The bridge divides his district from that of the Republican majority leader, Bruce A. Blakeman, who also opposed the toll increases.
Although its construction bonds were paid off long ago, the authority says it needs more money to offset inflation since the last increase a decade ago. For three years, the agency has been operating in the red. It says it also needs $14 million for overdue repairs of wear, rust, rot, corrosion, cracking and deterioration of the bridge and its underwater electric cables.
"This is what we need to move ahead," a bridge commissioner, Les Hecht, said at the meeting, in the cramped basement cafeteria of the authority's headquarters.
Many residents in this wealthy community, where bayfront homes can cost $1 million, say they prize the battery of 10 gated tollbooths as a barrier to unwanted outsiders. The bridge property abuts the New York City boundary at Rockaway.
"We do not mind paying a reasonable toll," said Barry Ringelheim, president of the Atlantic Beach Estates Civic Association. "People feel it's a protection. God forbid somebody will come over to rob and have to go back over the bridge and be seen" by toll collectors.
The bridge has long been a target of scrutiny. In the 1980's, a county grand jury recommended eliminating the authority and tolls and turning over the bridge to the County Public Works Department, which operates two other drawbridges.
"The authority operates not as a business, but as a base to keep a relative handful of people in jobs that are largely make-work," the investigators' report said. "Supporting this patronage is a highly inequitable system of charges that subsidizes local residents to the detriment" of other bridge users.
One of the authority's biggest critics is its own former executive director, Edward J. Walpole, who left in September and has filed a $2.5 million wrongful discharge claim. He accused politicians of padding the payroll with useless jobs and forcing him out when he tried to cut costs by laying off 9 of the 38 full-time workers. He said he had also planned to cut the hours of the 65 part timers.
Even the authority's last chairman, Peter DeSibio, once proposed doing away with the agency. Skeptics pointed out, however, that he had regularly recommended relatives and other job applicants to the authority. Mr. Walpole is his son-in-law.
Despite such calls for change, the authority and its tolls have endured. County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who appoints the commissioners, has his own budget problems and is not looking to add an aging bridge to the county's portfolio.
Critics say the bridge symbolizes the persistence of fiefs, even in the era of downsizing, that have endowed Long Island with the nation's highest local taxes. The Island has two counties, two cities, 13 towns, dozens of villages and school districts and nearly 1,000 other districts for libraries, sewers and other purposes.
"The bridge is really the lifeline of this community," said the Mayor of Atlantic Beach, Stephen R. Mahler.
Long Beach Island has two other drawbridges, a county-operated bridge at mid-island and the state-operated Loop Parkway Bridge at the east end. Both are free, but using them to avoid the toll could mean a detour of up to 15 miles.
When New York City residents commit misdeeds in Nassau, at least one weekly newspaper labels them "crossover crimes." Underscoring the security concern, an unoccupied county police car is often parked prominently by the tollbooths.
Some residents are said to make disparaging racial remarks about "those people" coming over the bridge. The beach is restricted to village residents and beach club members.
Most of the traffic consists of regular commuters, plus beach users in the summer. The daily number of trips doubled from a low of 13,594 in February to a high of 27,130 in June.
For frequent users, 40-ticket books will go to $15 in January, from $10 now, instead of the initial proposal of $25. A decal that provides unlimited passage for a year will go to $75 from $60, instead of the proposed $100. The discount users make up about two-thirds of the trips over the bridge but pay a little over a third of the toll charges, a disparity that will grow under the new rates.
The authority is exempting two small groups from the new tolls. Pedestrians and bicyclists, who now pay a nickel, will cross free.
The steel and concrete bridge, 1,173 feet long and 68 feet wide, carries three lanes of traffic in each direction. The center decks raise to allow tall boats to pass. Last year, the bridge opened 2,300 times, with a daily average ranging from 4 in February to 9 in July. The control tower is staffed 24 hours a day.
Under Federal law, boats pay no tolls. Most are oil tankers and barges headed for the Oil City depot near Island Park. The others are fishing and pleasure boats.
The bridge originated with the dream of Stephen P. Pettit, a developer, to transform the fragile sandbar here into a luxury seaside community. He once envisioned the world's longest boardwalk, linking Long Beach and the Rockaways.
In the 1920's, he organized work crews and teams of horses to dredge and fill. He won Federal permission to build a private toll bridge, which opened in 1927. With his death, the bridge passed to a new company. In 1945 the State Legislature and county officials created the authority to take over the old bridge and replace it with the current one in 1952.
Although bridge officials hinted today that they would try to curb costs through attrition, the critics are doubtful. Phoebe Goodman, director of the Nassau Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit watchdog group, said traditions die hard. "Around here," she said, "we do what we do because we've always done it this way."

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: Man in the News;
The Patient Nominee: William Michael Daley

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The appointment of William M. Daley to President Clinton's Cabinet was supposed to have been a done deal four years ago, or at least that was the way people around here saw it.
Back then, Mr. Daley, who was nominated today as Secretary of Commerce, was the odds-on choice to be named the Secretary of Transportation, his reward for all the work he and his big brother, Mayor Richard M. Daley, had done to help send the Governor of Arkansas to the White House. 
 But Mr. Clinton chose Federico F. Pena, the Mayor of Denver, and Mr. Daley stayed home in Chicago, where a lot of the Daley brothers' political allies fumed over the President's decision. Two years later, when the Republicans buried the Democrats in the 1994 Congressional elections, the wounds were still raw.
"They don't know what they are doing at the White House," the younger Daley said at the time.
Still, the brothers remained loyal supporters of President Clinton, even if they worried that he was moving too far from their beloved middle. William Daley, a lawyer and former banker, commuted to Washington and helped push the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, using the political skills he learned at the feet of his father, Richard J. Daley, the legendary and longtime mayor.
He also played an important role in managing the Democratic National Convention here last summer, helping to insure the party's successful return to the city where its 1968 convention ended in tear gas and protests. And last month, he helped deliver to Mr. Clinton 80 percent of the vote in Chicago, and nearly 55 percent of the vote across the state.
As it turns out, said Paul Green, a political science professor at Governors State University in Illinois, Mr. Daley is probably a better choice as Secretary of Commerce than he would have been as Transportation Secretary.
"He's very comfortable working with the Republican business community," Professor Green said. "He'll work as smoothly with the Republicans in Congress as anyone you've ever seen. He's a coalition builder. He's very smart, very professional. Summing up, Bill Daley is a winner."
In Chicago, when one's last name is Daley, winning, especially at politics, is like a family heirloom, handed down from generation to generation. But by most accounts, Mr. Daley, 48, is a formidable talent in his own right.
James R. Thompson, the former Republican Governor of Illinois, described Mr. Daley as "a good thing for the President, because Bill Daley is a smart, savvy guy and he's the kind of guy who belongs in the President's Cabinet."
Mr. Thompson said Mr. Daley would be an aggressive representative of American business and would help shine a spotlight on business Chicago and Illinois.
"Believe it or not," Mr. Thompson said, "we're still relatively unknown in Europe and Asia, which focuses on the East Coast and the West Coast. A lot of European businessmen have never been to Chicago. The appointment of a Chicagoan at Commerce is going to raise our visibility around the world."
Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Chicago Democrat who rarely sees eye to eye with the much more conservative Mayor Daley, was more cautious in praising the President's nominee. But Mr. Rush praised him for his political shrewdness.
"He knows the art of the deal," Mr. Rush said. "He's a moderate Democrat. Part of his philosophy is what's good for Chicago is good for the nation. Another part is what's Daley's is good for Chicago."
William Michael Daley was one of seven children -- four boys and three girls -- born to Richard and Eleanor Daley. He grew up in the working-class South Side Bridgeport neighborhood, his father's political power base, attending De La Salle High School.
Mr. Daley graduated from Loyola University, on the city's North Side, and obtained a law degree from the John Marshall Law School here. He began practicing law in Chicago in 1975, and two years later was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to a post on the Advisory Council on Economic Development.
Unlike his father and older brother, Mr. Daley has never been elected to public office, but he has advised a number of campaigns for others, including those for his brother and Carol Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first black woman elected to the United States Senate. He also worked on the Presidential campaigns of Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis.
In recent years, Mr. Daley has served as a partner in one of Chicago's biggest law firms, Mayer, Brown & Platt, where he has spent much of his time on corporate and government relations.
Mr. Daley was the president and chief operating officer of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago from 1990 to 1993 and sits on several civic and corporate boards, including the board of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the board of the Field Museum.
Mr. Daley and his wife, Loretta, have three children.
Today, Mr. Daley's older brother, the Mayor, was beaming.
"Bill has had a great career in his own right," the Mayor said. "He's earned this. Our family is very proud of Bill and excited for him. It's an early Christmas present for our family."

Clinton Fills Economic Jobs, Bolstering Rubin's Powers
President Clinton rounded out his team of senior economic advisers, nominating William Daley, a lawyer and scion of the legendary Chicago Democratic family, as Commerce Secretary, and making several appointments that effectively consolidated the power of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin as the dominant Cabinet officer.
To head the National Economic Council, Mr. Clinton picked his longtime domestic adviser, Gene Sperling. He named Daniel K. Tarullo, Mr. Sperling's co-deputy under the outgoing chairwoman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, to oversee international economic affairs. Lawrence Summers, Mr. Rubin's deputy at Treasury, was given a seat on the Economic Council. All are allies of Mr. Rubin. [Page 1.]
 
William Daley's nomination as Secretary of Commerce comes as a reward for many services, from lobbying for the North American Free Trade Act to helping deliver 80 percent of the vote in Chicago. [11.]

Debut of the Euro's Design
The design for the Euro, the proposed single European currency, was introduced in a news conference that highlighted how sensitive the matter is to some member nations. The bills will have no images of historic figures, or even of identifiable landmarks. Its sweeping bridges and stone gateways are fictitious. In a concession to national loyalties, though, a small space has been reserved for nations to insert their own national symbols. [36.]
 
Swiss Bank Discloses Nazi Profit
The Swiss National Bank publicly acknowledged that it had made a profit, which it estimated at 20 million Swiss francs, on its wartime dealings in gold bullion with Nazi Germany's central bank. But it denied there was any evidence it held gold stolen from individual Holocaust victims. [3.]
 
Boeing 747 Fuel Problem Identified
The National Transportation Safety Board says it has identified a fuel-system piping problem on Boeing 747's that can ignite explosions like the one that destroyed T.W.A. Flight 800 last July, and it issued an urgent recommendation that airlines be required to take steps to address the problem. [1.]
 
Chances End for Data Base Pact
Prospects died for an early agreement on an international treaty extending copyright protection for computerized data bases, with the chief American negotiator acknowledging that many countries needed more time to debate it. But discussions continued on two other proposals on intellectual property. In Singapore 28 nations endorsed an Information Technology Agreement. [36.]

Inventories Grew in October
Business inventories rose half of 1 percent in October, the biggest growth in three months, the Commerce Department said. It was the biggest rise since a half-percent advance in July and topped the three-tenths of 1 percent forecast of many analysts. [37.]

Dollar Strengthens
Against Mark
The dollar shot higher on news of an agreement among European Union finance ministers to stabilize the Euro, whose improving prospects particularly undermined the German mark. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.5558 marks, up sharply from 1.5423 marks Thursday. The dollar also traded at 113.95 Japanese yen, up from 113.27. [38.]

Prices of Treasuries Climb
The strong dollar, aided by weak economic data, helped underpin bond prices. The 30-year bond rose 21/32 to a price of 993/32 , pushing its yield down to 6.57 percent. [37.]

Heating Oil and Gas Prices Rise
Heating oil and natural gas futures prices surged, as traders reacted to forecasts of unusually cold weather in the Midwest and Northeast this winter that could leave the fuels in short supply. [38.]
 
A Fast Trip to the Slots
Atlantic City and Foxwoods are closer than Las Vegas to New York. But gamblers from the metropolitan region still face a trip. So next week, a start-up company in Brooklyn plans to offer daily cruises to the high seas -- where gambling is unregulated. [27.]

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Fills Top Posts, Keeping Reno

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton rounded out his team of senior economic advisers today, nominating William M. Daley, a Chicago lawyer and scion of his city's legendary Democratic family, as Commerce Secretary, and selecting several others whose appointments effectively consolidated the powers of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin as the dominant Cabinet officer of a second term.
Mr. Clinton also nominated Representative Bill Richardson, an eight-term New Mexico Democrat who has made a specialty of amateur diplomacy in recent years, to be chief delegate to the United Nations. He made the appointments at a news conference in the Old Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House. [Excerpts, page 12.] 
 Mr. Clinton also settled a personnel question that has lingered since his re-election. After meeting with his outspoken Attorney General, Janet Reno, on Thursday night, he announced today that she would stay on for a second term. But he did so without a word of praise for her work and in the context of announcing that two officials whose fate was not in doubt -- Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency -- would stay on.
To head the National Economic Council, which Mr. Clinton created with Mr. Rubin as its first chairman, the President elevated his longtime domestic economic adviser, Gene Sperling, also a close ally of the Treasury Secretary.
The President straddled a long-running dispute over how to replace the outgoing chairwoman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, by also elevating Daniel K. Tarullo, Mr. Sperling's co-deputy under Ms. Tyson, to a new rank overseeing international economic affairs.
Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Rubin's deputy at Treasury, was given a seat on the Economic Council, effectively assuring Mr. Rubin three votes in deliberations of the panel, which is intended to mediate economic disputes within the Administration. The number of votes on the panel varies according to the issue being decided.
Together, those moves consolidated the already enormous influence of Mr. Rubin, who is not only one of the President's most trusted private advisers but now becomes, more clearly than ever, the Cabinet officer with the biggest, most clear-cut public reputation as a forceful advocate of fiscal moderation and a balanced budget.
Of the major economic posts, only Labor Secretary remains open.
Officials said Mr. Clinton was still weighing various candidates, including former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania and Alexis M. Herman, the White House director of public liaison.
Today's announcements were marred by one moment of unintended drama. Minutes after Mr. Daley accepted the President's nomination, saying he came from a family in which "there is no greater calling than public service," he stumbled forward and collapsed, falling off the small stage into a row of poinsettias and hitting his head on a television equipment box. He was helped out of the crowded auditorium but later returned, a bit pale but apparently all right. White House officials said a medical team had found his vital signs normal. They said he had not eaten lunch and had apparently fainted from the heat.
In Chicago, a spokesman for Mayor Richard M. Daley, Jim Williams, said that William Daley had been commuting from Washington to be with an ill sister in Chicago. "Bill has spent a few overnights at the hospital," Mr. Williams said. "The whole family has been deeply concerned and pretty exhausted."
In the hourlong session, Mr. Clinton dropped the tightly worded style of his recent campaign for a series of ruminative answers on a wide range of topics, including these:
*Mr. Clinton said that it was "time to quit killing" campaign finance reform with filibusters and that he was "prepared to do my part" to pass it.
*He promised an unspecified but "more serious effort" to solve the District of Columbia's fiscal problems, calling the capital "not quite a state, not quite a city, not quite dependent, not quite independent."
*He said the State Department had asked his wife, Hillary, to continue her efforts to promote "human rights around the world" by traveling abroad and said she would do so.
*He indicated that he would not propose a capital gains tax cut in his budget next winter "because we have other priorities," but he again declined to rule out the possibility of supporting one someday in the context of negotiating a balanced budget.
*He said the television industry's proposed rating system should be tried for 10 months and "we'll see where they are."
The appointments of Mr. Richardson and Mr. Daley to some senior posts had been virtually assured for some time. The question was only whether Mr. Richardson, an amateur diplomat who has helped negotiate the release of Americans captured in rogue states like Sudan and North Korea, would take the United Nations job or Commerce. After meeting with Mr. Richardson this week, Mr. Clinton settled on him for the United Nations post.
Some senior Administration officials have said that Secretary of State-designate Madeleine K. Albright had objected to the other leading candidate for the post, former Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke. But Ms. Albright's spokesman in New York, James Rubin, said today that she "categorically denied" that she opposed Mr. Holbrooke, saying she thought highly of both candidates and looked forward to working with Mr. Richardson.
Mr. Clinton also announced today that he would nominate Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States Trade Representative, to take the post full time.
Officials said that with Mr. Daley at Commerce, the way now appeared open for Mr. Clinton's old friend, Rodney Slater, the Federal Highway Administrator, to become Secretary of Transportation, the other post for which Mr. Daley had been considered. Mr. Slater, who is black, would help Mr. Clinton make the Cabinet more racially diverse.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, praised Mr. Richardson's nomination. But he warned that Mr. Daley would need to "restore the credibility" of the Commerce Department, which was rattled in the final weeks of the Presidential campaign by reports that one of its former officials, John Huang, had later engaged in questionable fund-raising practices for the Democratic Party.
"To accomplish that, he will need to restore a chain of command and accountability, remove domestic and international political fund raising from the job descriptions of Commerce's employees and cooperate with the Congress in the investigation of allegations that employees of the Commerce Department solicited illegal foreign political contributions," Mr. Lott said.
For weeks, Ms. Reno's fate had been in some dispute. Up until late Thursday night, various senior White House officials said they expected Mr. Clinton to reappoint her, even as they continued to suggest anonymously that he was far from keen on doing so. They intimated that he was annoyed at her past willingness to appoint special prosecutors to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Administration officials. Four independent counsels have been appointed on her recommendation.
But with the Justice Department still overseeing an inquiry into the Democrats' fund raising, officials said, Mr. Clinton realized that if he sought to replace Ms. Reno, he would be accused of seeking retribution and would doubtless face a Senate confirmation fight over almost any successor he chose.
The President kept his options open until the last minute, refusing on Thursday evening to tell even two of his most senior aides what he and Ms. Reno had decided in their meeting at the White House before repairing together to a black-tie holiday party in the residence.
Today, Mr. Clinton again seemed to go out of his way to avoid any comment on Ms. Reno's stewardship, relegating her name to a list of others who would stay on. White House and Justice Department officials said he was eager to avoid offering either a ringing endorsement of Ms. Reno or to draw criticism from Republicans by appearing to curry her favor as the department's investigations proceed.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM;
Excerpts From the President's News Conference at the White House

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the question-and-answer portion of the news conference held today by President Clinton at the White House, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription company:
Q. Can you tell us how you hope history will judge your eight years in office? What single accomplishment would you like to be remembered for? And along those lines, could you share your thinking with us on the specific role the First Lady will play in the next four years? 
 A. That's enough for an hour. You've heard me say that I believe this time is most closely paralleled in our history to about a hundred years ago when then we moved from the farm to the factory, from the rural areas to the city. We became primarily an urban manufacturing country.
We are now a global leader and the basis of economic activity is increasingly knowledge and information and technology. I would like to be remembered as the President who prepared America for that future. Who prepared America for the 21st century, where we have opportunity available to all Americans who were responsible enough to exercise it.
Where we lived with the diversity of this country and the diversity of the world on terms of respect and honor, giving everyone a chance to live up the fullest of his or her own ability and building a stronger sense of community. Instead of becoming more divided as so many countries are. And where we continue to be the indispensable nation in the world for peace and freedom and prosperity.
That is my vision of America in the 21st century.
And when I'm finished, I hope people will add up all the things we did and say, "That is what they achieved."
I have nothing to add to what I've already said about the First Lady, except that the State Department has asked her to undertake more efforts around the world following up on the Beijing conference like the one she did in northern Thailand recently, speaking out on behalf of the human rights dimensions of women and young girls around the world.
And I expect she will do more of that. And I expect she will continue her interest in children and families and related issues here at home. But I have nothing else to say beyond that.
 
Welfare
 Q. What is your response to the perception that you are willing to sacrifice immediate compassion at the altar of a balanced budget and bipartisanship? I refer to the fact that you have not mentioned any remedy for the punitive parts of the welfare law recently, that you're reviewing children with disability with an eye to dropping them from benefits, that you may wipe out fuel heating oil subsidies, that you may slash by $1 billion low-cost housing budget, and a few other things.
A. Well, first of all, let me say I have no intention of slashing the home heating oil budget as we come to the winter. That's one budget item I know something about.
In a drive to balance the budget, we have to make some tough decisions, and some of the housing issues will be brought before me, I'm sure, in the last round of appeals, but we've not made final budget decisions there.
If you look at the record of this Administration, I think it would be very hard to make a case that we have been callous toward the poor. I mean, look what we did. We doubled the Earned Income Tax Credit, raised the minimum wage, increased the availability of immunizations to poor children, dramatically expanded the number of poor children in Head Start, vetoed two welfare reform bills which revoked the guarantees of health care and nutrition to poor children because they did.
As a result, there are about a million fewer children living in poverty today. We had the biggest drop in poverty among children in 20 years, the biggest drop in poverty among working single women in 30 years, the lowest poverty rate ever recorded in 1995 for African-Americans.
Now that is the record of this Administration. I think it is very hard to make a case that an Administration with that record and those policies is insensitive to the problems of the poor.
Now in welfare reform, there are two great issues before us in the welfare reform. Issue No. 1 is there are not now enough jobs available, particularly in a lot of urban areas, for all the able-bodied people on welfare when they run out of their two-year time limit under the new law. I said that all along. And that's why a big part of my campaign for the Presidency this time was the commitment to present to Congress and to challenge the states to do things like provide special tax incentives and wage subsidies and training subsidies to employers to help hire people off welfare and to help the cities with a lot of welfare case load. That's the big welfare reform problem.
No. 2, there are problems in the welfare reform bill, as I have repeatedly said, that have nothing to do with welfare that will hurt a lot of innocent people principally, the way legal immigrants who get hurt through no fault of their own are treated, and the way the nutrition programs, the food stamp programs, are treated for single men who are willing to go to work, and most importantly, for working families.
I have set aside several billion dollars in my balanced budget plan to fix those problems. And the budget I present to the Congress will address both of those within the context of a balanced budget plan.
On the question of the disabled children and I'm going to ask all of you to help all of us on this because here is the issue. Nearly everyone who reviewed the law as it used to be said that the disability definitions were too broad and that it was very difficult to justify giving all the needs of the country the coverage that existed under the old law. And we even proposed to the Congress that some changes be made to tighten the standards of disability coverage for children under S.S.I.
Now what we have to do is to define regulations under the new law; so the trick is going to be to do it in a way that does not hurt genuinely needy children and families and cause harm instead of just tightening up a program that virtually everyone who analyzed it thought out to be tightened up.
So, we are all going to have to just watch that one and try not to mess it up. But the welfare reform bill, I think, is going to prove to be a good bill. I do not think it will increase child poverty if we create jobs. . . .
 
Independent Counsel
 Q. Could give us your current thinking on the whole independent counsel process, and on how this particular one is uniquely doing his job?
A. I was impressed by the comments made by Archibald Cox. I believe he wrote an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times a day or two ago. And what I think we ought to do is to search out people like that.
The American Bar Association recently had a seminar where a lot of people who had been involved in this work for years came and talked about what it would what kinds of cases ought to be covered, what kinds of time lines ought to be there, what kinds of limitations there ought to be.
And I think what we ought to do is take people who aren't so personally involved in it and but who understand the enormous costs of the present system, as well as whatever benefits might come through it, and reassess it.
But I think, you know, we could start with what Mr. Cox had to say and analyze it and go from there. But I think I have to focus my attention on trying to complete the agenda the American people elected me to complete. And that's what I intend to do.
I do think this is worth some study and thought, but I think you ought to refer to people who are not so caught up in it and don't have other things to do, like I do. I need to not think about that. I need to think about my plans to grow the economy and improve education and other things.
Q. Republicans on Capitol Hill still want to cut the capital gains tax. Are there any conditions in which you would agree to such a cut if it would result in a budget deal?
A. I have always said that I was not inherently opposed to any kind of capital gains tax, and indeed there was capital gains treatment in my first budget in '93, where investments in new and in small businesses that were held for a significant period of time. It is not part of my balanced budget, because I had other priorities which I was trying to advance. We are not going to get a balanced budget, which the American people need, which our economy needs, and which would do, I think, very good things for us, not only economically but also psychologically as we move forward into this new century, in the absence of bipartisan cooperation.
In the 50-plus hours I spent with Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich and Mr. Armey last year, I made clear to them in private what I have said publicly several times, which is that obviously, I had no right to say that was the show-stopper in the deal. I was perfectly willing to talk about it. But only in the context of balanced budget negotiations.

District of Columbia
 Q. I wonder what you could tell us what help, perhaps, or comment you might offer on what many people think to be is a chaotic and failing District of Columbia government. Now the financial control board does recommend a partial takeover. I wonder how you feel about that, or is it time for a complete takeover, sir?
A. Let me first of all say I have had several conversations in the last two months right? leading up to and after the election about what I believe is my responsibility and the responsibility of our administration to try to play a constructive role in making Washington the kind of city it ought to be.
In the last four years, first Alice Rivlin and then Frank have worked hard to coordinate what our Administration was doing in Washington. Henry Cisneros, for example, has done a lot of good work on homelessness here in Washington.
The Commerce Department has taken some community-based initiatives. Even my Secret Service detail adopted a school in response to my request for people to do more in Washington.
But we have not done as much as we can. So that's the first thing I want to say.
The second thing I want to say is that the American people need to understand the unique challenges facing Washington. Washington, D.C. is really not quite a state, but not quite a city. It is not quite dependent, and not quite independent. And I think that is the source of a lot of the difficulties we face today.
There are sort of a series of purgatories in which Washington has found itself over the years, and very often, when functions are divided in responsibility, they wind up being nobody's responsibility and easy for people to avoid, therefore, the tough decisions that have to be made. So what I have asked the Office of Management and Budget and Frank Raines and, in his capacity as head of this task force, to review that.
I was very impressed that the D.C. Control Board came out with a set of specific recommendations, and I want to review them and try to do two things. No. 1, I want to respond to the financial recommendations that will come both from Frank Raines and from the D.C. Control Board. And No. 2, I want to think in a larger way about what kind of more systematic effort we could make to be a constructive force in the revitalization of Washington. . . .

Senate Confirmations
 Q. With it now revealed that the Justice Department investigations ongoing about two members of your national security team one nominee and one person who doesn't have to get Senate confirmation. Wondering if you could tell us why you decided to ahead with people under Justice Department investigation?
And whether as Mr. Daley stated or alluded to you worry that the level of scrutiny has become so high that maybe people feel that they are driven out of accepting jobs? It's also been reported that you're having trouble filling the White House counsel's post because people don't want a job that is going to just be one problem after the next.
A. I will take full responsibility for whatever happens here. I'm fully aware of the status of the issues relating to Mr. Berger and Mr. Lake. And based on the advice of Mr. Quinn, my White House counsel, I decided to go forward because I am convinced that nothing they did was in any way disqualifying.
And because the issues involved were very straight-forward but had been over at the Justice Department for sometime and we had to make a decision. I mean, the work of the people has to go forward.
So, what we decided to do is to, you know, let the thing go forward. You know what the issues are. They've been fully disclosed. There's nothing there that has not been disclosed to the best of my knowledge. And I made a decision based on the advice of my counsel that the best people that I wanted to appoint could, in fact, be appointed. And that the issues outstanding were not disqualifying.
Now, to the larger question you asked. There is no question that the climate has changed to the point where a lot of people don't want to fool with it anymore. There's no doubt about it. In fact, I was sort of touched by what Mr. Daley said because that I have to say that the truly moving thing is how many gifted men and women of all walks of life are still willing to serve not withstanding the fact that they know they may be subject to things that excessive and unfair. . . .

A Balanced Budget and Abortions
Q. With Congress coming back into a new session, there seems to be indications they will take up two issues which are contentious which you have opposed in the past. An amendment to balance the budget a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget. You caused, I guess, some concern a few weeks ago among some of your aides by suggesting you could live with a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
And secondly, legislation that would ban a late-term abortion procedure, known as partial birth abortions. Could you tell us exactly what kind of language you could accept on both of those issues that would allow you to go forward and support those matters?
A. I do not believe it is good policy or needed to have a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I do believe it is good policy for America to pass a balanced budget plan now and to implement it. And I believe I have some credibility on that, because we cut the deficit by more in four years than anybody has in a month of Sundays.
So everybody knows it. And my record as governor was that of a fiscal conservative. So this is not about fiscal conservatism. It is about whether you can design a Constitutional amendment which in difficult and very different times than the ones in which we now live won't do more harm than good. That's my only concern there.
And so, the only thing what I was trying to say when I was asked about this before is there have been changes in the composition of the Senate which at least apparently give them enough votes to pass this amendment. So what I was saying is I'm not for this, but if you're going to do it, try to do it in a way that gives you enough flexibility to deal with the kinds of things that can happen.
We're passing this constitutional amendment in a very different environment than some of the environments in which we've lived in the last 30 years. That's the only point I was trying to make on that.
Now, perhaps changes in the House will make it more difficult to pass in the House, but I just don't know. You know, the President cannot veto a constitutional amendment. It gets passed and sent out to the states. So that's the point I want to make on that.
On the partial-birth abortion issue, I would very much I wanted to sign that legislation. When I first heard about it, I thought I would sign it since I am generally opposed to third trimester abortions anyway and signed legislation to restrict them in Arkansas. The problem is I will say again there are a few hundred women every year who have personally agonizing situations, where their children are born or are about to be born with terrible deformities, which will cause them to die either just before, during or just after childbirth.
And these women, among other things, cannot preserve the ability to have further children unless the enormity the enormous size of the baby's head is reduced before being extracted from their bodies. This is a very painful thing to discuss. I have met six of these women. I will say again three of them were pro-life Catholics. One of them was a pro-life Evangelical Christian. This is not a pro-life, pro-choice issue. To me this is a practical problem. I believe that people put in that situation ought not to have Congress tell them that they're never going to be able to have children again. Now, I know there are just few hundred of them and I know that all the votes were on the other side.
And I am well aware that there were several places in this country where major political headway was raised made against the Vice President and me and against some of our candidates for Congress, and against others running for other things because of this issue because it sounds so awful when you describe it that you can that the politics is all on the other side. But one of the things the President's supposed to do is to look out for the few hundred against the many millions when the facts are not consistent with the rhetoric.
And I'm just telling you you know, Hillary and I we only had one child. And I just cannot look at a woman who's in a situation where the baby she is bearing, against all her wishes and prayers, is going to die anyway, and tell her that I am signing a law which will prevent her from ever having another child. I'm not going to do it.
Now, I pleaded and I pleaded and I pleaded last time with the Congress to adopt highly restrictive language on this procedure, which would make it clear that there had to be a very serious health problem for the woman involved before it could be adopted in addition to having her own life at stake, a very serious health problem like having the ability to have a child again and they would not do it. And they would not do it, I believe, because it was great politics. But it's bad policy.
So, if we will if we can have the right sort of language here. I don't like this procedure. I don't think anybody ought to just, you know, try to show up eight months and two weeks pregnant and say, "I just think I'd like to have an abortion, and this is what I want to use." You know, I think the states should have taken care of that; 80 percent of the states have, but 20 percent haven't. But if they will help me with language here and do it in good faith, I will happily sign this bill. . . .

Wall Street
 Q. Do you share Alan Greenspan's view that Wall Street is currently in the grips of irrational exuberance? And agree or not that the market is overpriced? When the inevitable correction comes, what is the degree of risk that it will throw the economy into a tailspin?
A. I don't comment on the Fed's decisions, and I don't comment on the market's movement, so I shouldn't talk about the Fed chairman's comments about the market's movement. Nothing I say will produce any good.
I think the answer to your second question is the same. I'll tell you an interesting story. When the market fell in '87, by blind accident, when the market closed, the then wealthiest man in America, Sam Walton, was sitting in my office in Little Rock in the Governor's office. Just by pure coincidence. He was there on business. He came to see me, and we were sitting there at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, or whenever it was, when the market closed in New York, so he called, and I said, "Sam, how much money did you lose today?" He said, "A billion dollars on paper." I said, "What do you think about it?" He said, "I think tomorrow I'm going to get in my airplane and fly to a little town in Tennessee where they're opening a new Wal-Mart, and if the pick-ups and the cars show up and people get out and buy goods, America's all right. This is a Main Street economy."
So, I say to you, I'm very pleased that not only wealthy, but a lot of middle-class people have made a lot of money in the markets. A lot of people's retirements are more secure because of it.
I'm proud of the vibrant markets we have. They will change. They go up and down. They always did. My job is to keep the underlying fundamentals sound so that tomorrow in all those little towns across America, people can get up and go to work and go the store and buy something. If that happens, I think we'll be O.K. . . .

Television Rating System
 Q. As the country prepares to see its first television ratings that were ever devised, can you give us some of your thoughts about whether or not an American parent who feels particularly concerned about violence, but perhaps not so concerned about exposing his or her child to sexual content or bad language, should that parent be able to know, in advance, if a television program has violent content?
A. Let me try to answer you based on what I know now. Of course, that is the controversy about the proposed television rating systems which the industry has come up with. They said that they would try to develop a television rating system which would more or less parallel the movie rating system. I have not yet had a report on it, but apparently that is what they have done.
All I know is what all of you have reported about it. But apparently that is what they have done. There are therefore, the big conflict now is whether the rating system should be more content-based instead of age-based. This is like the movie system, except it has more age categories than the movie system, as I understand it.
I guess what I would say to you is that I believe that it's a good thing that on these cable movies, you know, they have you you get a sort of a sheet comes on the screen and checks the content issues. But it's a very different thing with all these hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of television programs that are on every night.
What I would say is, let's remember how far we've come. This has been debated for 10 years. We now have one. We're going to have one a year before televisions have to start including the V-chip. The industry itself has promised to review where they are within 10 months. So what I think we should do, since I feel very strongly the Government should not do this, this must be an industry-based thing. The Government should not be involved in this.
What I think ought to happen is that all the parents in the country ought to look at these ratings, ask themselves the questions you just asked, check the shows against the ratings, give it 10 months to work. And then if they're inadequate and there needs to be some more content in the rating systems, then after a 10-month test period, we'll be able to make that argument.

Campaign Finance
 Q. Our political system does not outlaw contributions by foreigners. And these legal contributions are made to both Democrats and Republicans. When foreigners give huge sums of money, $10,000, or $100,000 $400,000, what do you think they think they will get in return?
A. I think it's probably different for different people. You know, in sometimes according to reports that I've read in the press, they think maybe it may enhance their standing in their own countries.
Sometimes they may think it's something they ought to do because they have business operations in America, which they have to have. They have to be somehow involved in America to give legally. They may think that it enhances their standing as citizens.
Sometimes there may be a specific issue, I suppose and I don't begrudge this; this is perfectly legal. But when the British tobacco company Brown & Williamson, made significant contributions to the Republicans, they did it because they agreed with their position and disagreed my position on the regulation of tobacco and the restriction of the advertising sales in marketing of tobacco to children.
So, there are different reasons. But let me reiterate what I said about this earlier. I believe that it has been legal, and I can understand why it has you know, if you've got a green card, you're paying taxes, you're working here and maybe you ought to be able to give. If you have a business here, maybe you ought to be able to give.
I understand the argument. But I think that, as we have seen in the last few weeks, it raises more questions than it answers.
And I personally believe that the campaign finance reform legislation should make contributions by adult noncitizens illegal. Now and we shouldn't do it anymore. Furthermore, I think we ought to go on and pass the campaign finance reform legislation.
As I said Wednesday in my speech to the D.L.C., repeated reasonable bills have died by Senate filibuster. Let me tell you, there is always an objection to any bill. There has never been a perfect piece of legislation passed by the Congress.There is always theoretical, or actual, objection anybody can raise to any bill.
But the time has come to quit killing this by filibustering to pass it. I am prepared to do my part. And we ought to start with the McCain-Feingold bill. It's a good bill. It's a reasonable bill. It's a bipartisan bill, and we ought to pass it. And we should amend it to make the foreign contributions not legal anymore.

Education
 Q. When you begin your campaign to improve public education in this country, are you going to follow-up on a suggestion that you made in the first Presidential debate which is to encourage states and cities to offer vouchers for private school choice?
A. I don't believe I made that suggestion.
Q. You said that states and cities should be allowed to do it.
A. No, well I've always thought they should be allowed to do by supporting Milwaukee's right to do it. But I'm not going to encourage or discourage it. It think it should be made based on the facts of the case. I am opposed to the Federal Government doing it. Our aid is limited, and it is too targeted and is too much needed for what is done now. And if I were at the state or local level, I would not be in favor of it because I think the schools are underfunded. I don't think they're overfunded. . . .
Q. This is along the same lines. You talked over the course of your presidency a lot about college accessibility, affordability, tuition credit, et cetera, but there are festering problems at the secondary and elementary level across this country, probably nowhere more pronounced than in this very state. Do you have anything initiatives or programs in mind that can reform if not rescue the public schools of America?
A. Well, the rescue of the public schools of America will have to be done by the people who are in control of them. We do fundamentally have local control of our schools and under the constitutions of virtually every state in the country, the states are constitutionally responsible for them. So when you hear people say they want local control, and they don't like all these Federal rules, the truth is we do have local control.
The Federal contribution to public education is about 7 cents on the dollar. It's never been higher than 10 cents on the dollar.
But there are things that we can do and that I believe we should do. First of all, I think we should support reform efforts.
That's why I have supported things like public school choice and charter schools. And we have in this balanced budget plan sufficient funds for 3,000 charter schools, which would triple the number of schools created under the umbrella of local school districts, but without a lot of the rules and regulations which I think make real learning more difficult, with more control for the parents and the principals and the teachers in each school.
Secondly, I think we should support the establishment in every state of national standards of excellence and means of measuring it.
And one of the things I think we should do more of, or I think we have not let me back up and say when we did the education summit in 1989 with President Bush, he was and the governors all came together and we stayed up all night and wrote the national education goals.
It you read the document that goes with the goals we wrote, we were moving to deal with what was the really tough issue. We had keep in mind, this is now a 13-year effort in our country, starting back going back to the Nation at Risk report in early '83, when we said our schools are in trouble.
We need more math. We need more science. We need more foreign language. We need higher standards. We need better-paid, better-trained and more accountable teachers all those things that came out in '83.
So then all the states worked on that, so by '89, we could see that the problem was you can always have more and better of anything. But what is the goal here?
And that's why the national education goals were adopted so we'd have some way of measuring whether we were succeeding. But we all understood that even though we wanted state constitutional responsibility and local control, that our children were going to be judged by global standards.
And the next step is plainly to devise not Federal Government, but national standards of excellence. We got there in mathematics and science. There are actually pretty widely accepted mathematics and science standards at the high school level, and to some extend at the junior high school level. . . .

Political Fund-Raising
 Q. In the last election, the Democratic Party raised more money than it ever had before. Do you think you put too much pressure on your fund-raisers? And, do you take any sort of personal responsibility for the problems and the embarrassments that subsequently developed.
A. Well, yes, I think any of us who were involved in it have to take some responsibility. I certainly do. But let me say that I did everything I could to make it clear that I wanted the law followed to the last letter. I wanted every "t" crosses, every "i" dotted.
In our campaign, Lynn, you tracked and others rigorously checked every check that came in. But I feel very badly that there were some funds received which should not have been received.
Some of them were illegal. Some of them were not illegal, but better judgment would dictate that they not be received. I also believe it's a disservice to the more to the 99 percent of the people plus, and the more than 98 percent of the contributions that the Democratic party received that were perfectly legal and perfectly appropriate.
So yes, I think that and that's why I am pleased that the Democratic Party has contracted with a law firm and an accounting firm to review all this, to analyze what was done, get to the bottom of it and make sure that it never happens again.
But I'll say again, the real answer in spite of all of that, it is very difficult to raise that kind of money in that kind of way without some problem occurring. You remember back during the campaign there was an official of the Dole campaign who actually had to plead guilty to a money-laundering operation. And I'm sure Senator Dole felt somewhat responsible for that, although I do not believe in any way he knew about it or condoned it.
What you see here is too much money being raised, raising too many questions and taking too much time away from all the people involved. The answer to this there will never be a perfect answer until we reform the campaign finance system. So yes, we should the Democratic Party should be investigate, evaluate what's done, make sure it's house is clean and should live within the rules. . . .

Mideast Terror
 Q. Have you seen any evidence to support Saudi Arabia's suspicions that Iran may be somehow involved with the Khobar Towers bombing? And if those suspicions do get played out, what kind of consequences might Iran face?
A. Well, as you might imagine, I have spent a great deal of time on the Khobar issue since it occurred, first of all making sure that we redeployed our forces in Saudi Arabia, making sure that we strengthened our defenses, making sure that we analyzed very carefully what had been done, because all of us policy-makers from top to bottom underestimated the degree of terrorist threat which could be presented to our men and women in uniform. And they don't deserve that. They deserve the best possible decision-making by us.
I have also exerted a lot of effort to make sure that we were cooperating and working with the Saudis in investigating the murder. The F.B.I. Director has been there on more than one occasion. We have worked hard on this. I think it is only fair, however, to say that the investigation is not completed. I have not reached any been presented with any final conclusions. I have not reached any final conclusions myself.
And because of that, anything I say about what we might do if we knew what had happened would only give rise to an inference that I had really concluded someone was guilty of something that I don't know they're guilty of yet. So, I can't say more except to say that we are on top of this and we're going to stay on top of it.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: Profiles of Leaders of Economic Team;
Robert E. Rubin -- Treasury Secretary

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger 

 BODY:
From the start of the scramble to assemble key economic players for Bill Clinton's second term, there was no mystery about who would serve, in the President's words today, as "the captain of the team."
Robert E. Rubin, first as chairman of the National Economic Council and then as Treasury Secretary, has grown steadily in influence. Today he is one of the few truly powerful members of the Administration who is not, by his own description, a close political intimate of the President. 
 For most of the first term Mr. Rubin was often described as a creature of Wall Street -- where he served as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and amassed a considerable fortune. Now, however, he is described by one of Mr. Clinton's top aides as "the prototypical Clinton centrist" -- the man who has defined many of the Administration's budget priorities and has argued that continued deficit reduction is the only way to keep the markets happy.
Mr. Rubin's tenure at Treasury has been marked by three major political battles: First to save Mexico, then to save the dollar, and finally to outmaneuver Congressional Republicans who were threatening to send the United States into default if Mr. Clinton did not accede to their budget demands. The Mexico bailout worked, though Mr. Rubin conceded later that at times he wondered whether Mexico would abide by the stringent economic requirements he set as a condition for $12.5 billion in American loans. The dollar recovered. And Congress backed down.
In the next term, Mr. Rubin is likely to play a central role in designing policy toward China, negotiating a budget that will balance by 2002 and managing economic expectations so that investors do not get spooked by a sky-high stock market.
"The only thing you can do about markets from Washington is get the fundamentals right," he said recently. "And usually that means not talking about them too much in public." DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: Profiles of Leaders of Economic Team;
Charlene Barshefsky -- Trade Representative

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger 

 BODY:
Her husband was there, and their two young daughters, when Charlene Barshefsky was formally nominated by President Clinton today to be the United States Trade Representative. But, as usual, Ms. Barshefsky herself was a no-show -- she was en route from Singapore to Tokyo, moving on from a successful effort to win a world-wide agreement to wipe out tariffs on technology products, to talks on a nasty dispute with the Japanese Finance Ministry over American access to the Japanese insurance market.
And that is probably where the 47-year old former trade lawyer from Chicago would rather be. After three years in the Clinton Administration, first as the deputy trade representative and then, since April, as the acting trade representative, after Mickey Kantor left the job, she remains outside President Clinton's top circle of advisers. But she is most at home in a negotiating room, and revels in the stories that circulate in Washington about marathon sessions that drag on for days. 
 "Sometimes I think countries sign trade deals with Charlene simply so their negotiators can get some sleep," her top aide, Ira Shapiro, said recently.
She has developed a keen sense of how trade negotiating has become the heart of American diplomacy. "You have to make countries understand that this is an age in which they will define their relationships with America largely in their economic interactions with America," she said earlier this year.
Whether dealing with Chinese leaders or European bureaucrats, Ms. Barshefsky, the daughter of Polish and Russian immigrants, can mix high diplomacy with a string of epithets describing the what she sees as nefarious motives of opposing nations and their negotiators; in one of her kinder moments, she likened a top European trade official to the imperious Owl character in Winnie-the-Pooh.
"I've learned a lot of negotiating strategy," she said once, "reading stories to my daughters."
In fact, she learned it as a highly paid trade lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson, where she represented, among others, Canadian lumber interests -- a problem today because of a year-old law prohibiting anyone who has represented a foreign government from serving as Trade Representative. Administration officials say they believe they have now worked around that issue with Republican leaders. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: Who gets the liver transplant? Which one's the mother? When do you lie? (And those are the easy ones)

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer for the Magazine. A collection of her interviews will be published in the spring by Seven Stories Press.

 BODY:
ON A WARMISH AFTERNOON LAST MONTH, DR. Arthur Caplan, 46, PROFESSOR of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, and the director of that institution's Center for Bioethics, sat in his Philadelphia office, frantically plowing through some 68, yes, 68, telephone messages from journalists littering his desk.
Among the messages was a call from a Chicago reporter seeking a comment on Joseph Cardinal Bernardin's death from pancreatic cancer. CNN was sending over a camera crew for footage on gulf war syndrome -- Dr. Caplan is a member of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, which had just concluded hearings. A journalist from Southern California wanted Caplan's views on the big local story out there: the indictment of Dr. Richardo Asch, a famed fertility expert, for improprieties at his Orange County clinic. And oh, yes, "Nightline" wanted to book an appearance. 
 "Gosh, people are in the grip of bioethics fever today," said Caplan. A burly, unprepossessing figure in rumpled, nothing-special clothes, he talks at breakneck speed. "It used to be that I'd have to fight to get any coverage for these kinds of issues. Nowadays, there's so much bioethics in the news that there are times when I can't keep tabs on it all."
This is a problem that Art -- as everyone calls him -- Caplan, Ph.D., has made for himself. And one that wins him little sympathy from his academic peers. In the booming specialty of bioethics -- an interdisciplinary splice of philosophy, law and health policy planning -- Dr. Art Caplan, philosopher, is both a serious scholar and a popularizer.
Caplan's particular skill is an ability to identify, analyze and explain the extremely complex moral questions that grow out of changes in health care, science and medicine. At the Center for Bioethics, he runs a combination think tank and ethics fire station for the university's vast system of hospitals and research laboratories. He does what he calls "hands-on philosophy," which means that he advises the university hospital on everyday bioethics problems on the wards, teaches medical students about moral ambiguities in their work and helps researchers design ethically consistent projects. He has been a health policy adviser to the Clinton Administration, and he writes a syndicated newspaper column, "A Question of Ethics," and produces a blizzard of professional publications with titles like "Why the Problem of Reductionism in Biology Won't Go Away" and "What Are the Morals of Our Treatment of Renal Failure?"
"He's a very controversial figure in philosophy," says his wife of 25 years, Jane Caplan, a psychologist. They have a 12-year-old son, Zach. "When he was a student, he never really fit in with the rest of the Columbia philosophy department. He was a guy who admitted it when he was wrong, who loved to argue and thought it was fun. To this day, he loves showing how complicated an argument is, and he believes the public is educable. A lot of people in his field don't. To them, applied philosophy is second-rate."
Actually, Caplan is a classically trained philosopher with all the right credentials. He completed his master's and his Ph.D. at Columbia in the 1970's; his mentors were Ernest Nagel and Sidney Morgenbesser, two giants in the philosophy of science. In 1976, while still a graduate student, he took a part-time job teaching ethics to medical students at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and found himself hooked on the moral issues of the medical world. That post led to Caplan's attending a national bioethics conference, where he was spotted by the founder of the field, Daniel Callahan, who asked him to work at the Hastings Institute, which was then and to some extent still is the pre-eminent bioethics think tank. Caplan would eventually become associate director at Hastings.
Seven years later, Caplan was offered the chance to run a biomedical ethics program at the University of Minnesota. Seven years after that, in 1994, he got an unrefusable offer from the University of Pennsylvania: a $500,000 annual budget, access to the cutting-edge research in genetics going on at the school and an income of around $200,000.
Caplan's center is located on a bleak Philadelphia avenue -- near the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, but not within it. "I wanted to say, 'We're new.' I didn't want to be located on the medical-school campus. I wanted to be partners. Not beholden."

What Is Bioethics?
 
Q: Give us the job description of a bioethicist.
A: I spend a lot of time trying to identify ethical issues in health care and science and then thinking through ways of arguing about them to change behavior. Or policy. Or both. Sometimes, I will come into a medical setting and suggest changes in practices, simple things like, "Will you please stop interviewing hospital patients while they are going to the bathroom." It can be as crude as that. Or as elegant as, "Have we thought through how sperm-cell transplants could be misused?" I've been laboring in the bioethics vineyards for more than 20 years, but my mother still has a hard time figuring out what I do for a living.

Q: What are the roots of your bioethics obsession?
A: When I was 7, I had polio. Not a bad case, but I missed a good chunk of first grade and went to rehab for many years after. That definitely got me interested in ethics. You don't have to get Freudian, it's right there. I thought about things like why the hospital didn't let your parents stay over. I wondered about why such a bad thing had happened to me since I was such a good kid. Truthfulness bothered me a lot. The doctors and nurses at Mass. General would never tell you when a kid was going to die. And on my floor, a lot of kids died. You couldn't get a straight answer. Johnny would be in the next bed, looking terrible, and they were saying, "Johnny is going home now." And then, suddenly, there'd be this empty bed.
It has never ever left me, that not being truthful is a tricky thing in medicine. That experience reminded me that people in health care situations get a lot of information from other patients. So it's better for them to have good information.
 
Q: How do you know what is moral?
A: Ask patients; they'll tell you. Also, I know what the law says and what the customs of the tribe -- of the medical profession -- are. The good bioethicist will get some help from looking at traditions, the norms of right and wrong, and also from what the law says. If you're operating on someone without a signed informed consent, there may be a good reason -- but you're probably doing something wrong. If the law says that people are dead after their brains have stopped functioning and you are still treating somebody after that, you may be doing something wrong.

Q: Is it true that some academics see you as a charlatan?
A: They wouldn't go that far. But I have my critics. Mostly, they think I shouldn't spend time yakking to the masses.
What we do at my center is a kind of applied philosophy. For instance, right now the center staff is looking at a gene therapy trial that is being conducted at the medical school here. There's a gene therapy being developed to kill off tumor cells in a fatal brain cancer called glioma. In order to test this stuff, you have to try it out in low doses on people with the disease. The first people who get it are never going to get cured.
In fact, the goal of the first trials is to see whether you kill the subjects by giving them the gene therapy as opposed to letting the brain cancer kill them. The things we want to know when they sign up for these experiments include: Do the patients really understand that no cure is being offered them? Do they nevertheless come in with hope? And if they do, is it right to tell them, "There's no hope"? No one wants to say it, and certainly no one wants to hear it.
So on one hand, we're looking at the way informed consent is given in this particular experiment. But we are also in the trenches, doing real-world, real-life ethics here. And that's what philosophy ought to be: about real people, speaking to human concerns -- not armchair fantasies about right and wrong.

Q: Why didn't you become a doctor?
A: I loved thinking about medicine, but I didn't like doing it. I could never adjust to the idea that you had to cause people pain in order to help them.

Right and Wrong
 
Q: Do you think science will be able to give people the ability to achieve a kind of immortality in the near future?
A: Yeah, well, sort of. I can envision a situation where by transplanting your heart, liver, spleen, lungs and bone marrow, you can be transformed into an immortal-like thing.
It will be done by excising diseased human body parts and by grafting on human and animal parts. I don't see a problem with it. Now, a lot of people might say, "It sounds intrinsically yucky to have 10 animal organs keeping me alive." But we can adapt to that, much as we have to other kinds of bioengineering. No one complains much nowadays about the unnaturalness of heart transplants.
I do think it has a social cost, though. The dollar price of pursuing an extended life is big. We can wind up distorting the health care budget to add 5, 10, 20 years of life to those who can afford it. But to do that, we might be pulling social resources away from people who won't get to live 50 years because they were born in India or West Philadelphia.

Q: Do you fret about the ethics of using animals as an organ source for humans?
A: If you believe in animals' right to life, then you should begin at the breakfast table, not the surgery table. The number of animals killed for bacon is incredible.

Q: Well, pigs are not endangered. Chimpanzees are.
A: In the long run, nobody is going to use primates for transplantation. You can't use a 60-pound-chimp's heart to support a 200-pound man.
Oh, of course it's sad to have to kill an animal, but it's something I would consider doing, even to the point of killing thousands of pigs to get parts for people. I think these pigs will lead very happy lives, so that they will be healthy when their organs are put into you. It is just a mistake to think that the only way you can give moral worth to something is to equate it with us. There are degrees of moral worth.

Q: How do the popular television doctor-dramas "E.R." and "Chicago Hope" cover bioethics?
A: C plus, at best. They do a pretty good job at laying out clinical issues. Should a drunken man get a liver transplant? Should we allow a baby who's been through a lot to die? But there's never any attention to the economics of modern medicine: "How do people pay for this?"
Sometimes, the producers of these shows phone me for story ideas. I told one a while ago about a case I'd worked on where I'd gotten a call from the operating room and the doc was saying, "We've got a guy open on the table, on a heart-lung machine, and we dropped the heart we were going to put into him on the floor. There's no choice -- we've got to use this heart. When he wakes, do we have to tell him about what happened?"
"You've got to offer to tell him there was an accident," I said. "Because people have a right to know if you're putting them at risk of infection and death." That became one of those TV episodes.

Q: O.K., let me ask you an "E.R." question: Should a drunk be able to get a liver transplant?
A: Yes. Sin does not belong in bedside rationing decisions.

Q: But the fact is that someone who's been drinking a lot -- Mickey Mantle for instance -- is not going to give that liver the mileage it deserves.
A: Effectiveness certainly counts. If someone can't survive with a new liver, there's no point in giving them one. And that was true of Mickey Mantle. But the real test is: Will it work? Not: Is the person good enough?

On Eugenics
 
Q: What's your take on that eugenic sperm bank that opened in Southern California a few years ago?
A: You mean the Nobel Sperm Bank? The Repository for Germinal Choice? It still runs. It started out with Nobel Laureates. Then it became smart scientists. Now it's business leaders, celebrity types, "people of achievement," athletes. O. J. Simpson is a great athlete. He could be in the bank, for all I know.
The whole thing is bonkers. Even if parents could select for eugenic possibilities, you might be able to increase the odds of having a kid with certain traits maybe just a little bit. But let's say you could do it. To what extent should parents be allowed to put their tastes and values onto the biological design of their kids? There's something weird about saying, "I had my kids because I want them to be little exemplars of traits I value." You can almost see the parents complaining, "I had you to be a violinist, and what's this, you're tone-deaf!"

Q: But isn't it true that some of the new developments in genetics and reproduction technologies really could get us there?
A: Oh yeah, definitely. I think that the eugenic dreams and biological perfectionist aspirations of the Nazis and others were hindered, in part, by their not having the science. Well, look out world: the science is coming! In genetic testing, for instance, huge leaps are being made -- and they bring with them big, big questions. Let me give you just a few: What will happen when we can, with precision, tease apart the genetic contribution to violence, aggression, mathematical ability? Will that mean that we'll start to have a lot of public debate about social programs, arguments linked to the wisdom of the genetic identification of the violent, the nasty and the mentally ill? People are sure to be asking, "Should we step in early and do something about that?" That will quickly lead to new arguments about "What is man?"
I'm really interested in how the sale of genetic information and the sale of genetic perfectionism is going to shape us. The early signs are not good. I think that there will be an attempt to generate markets for people to feel bad if they don't get genetic report cards for their embryos and reproductive mates. Soon, it will be, "How dare you create a child with a known mental disorder?" In a market society, notions of perfection will be sold. You can almost see the shops at the mall: Genes "R" Us.
We'll also be wondering what to do with virtual technology and pleasure enhancement. Should everybody be allowed to go in a box and have all their sexual fantasies acted out in their minds with what's called prio-perceptive or feedback loops? Instead of getting genital stimuli, it will all be going on in your brain. Now my question is, "Is there anything wrong with spending a lot of your time doing that?" These issues are going to be real. Not for our generation, but for the next one.

Dr. Death
 
Q: Why do you loathe Dr. Kevorkian?
A: How much tape do you have? I think he's a zealot and fanatic. You don't want an advocate for the right to die to be the same person making the judgment on who should die. If you watch his videotapes with people, there's no psychiatry, no psychology, and he's not exactly the most warm and giving guy that's ever been around.
Part of the reason he troubles me so much is that he's so into his own movement, which means he's the least likely person to be able to achieve a true informed consent and to weed out the depressed, the despondent and the dingy from those who truly do want to die. Some of the folks he's seen seem to me to be just depressed, not necessarily in need of his services. I also don't trust him because I think he's obsessed with death. I think he's obsessed with trying to control death. He wants to make sure that it doesn't sneak up on him.

Q: Is medically assisted suicide a form of cowardice?
A: There's almost no one who can't find a way to kill themselves if they really want to. What Kevorkian is asking for is different: assistance by doctors. And that's troubling. People come to doctors and say, "I can't do this myself." But what they mean is: "I can't do it because I might be cursed in the afterlife." They have all sorts of religious baggage they bring to the subject of suicide. It's just that no one likes to admit it.
I think this is one thing for which a person ought to take personal responsibility. It should not be made easy. Besides, medicine's job is to make the case why you should stay here. How will people be able to trust doctors if they know that the doctor can kill you? I can see nursing home patients wondering: "When the doctor offered me assisted suicide, was it time for me to go? Or was it my bill?"
The bigger reason his movement disturbs me: We still don't have a national system of health care. To have the right to die before you have the right to treatment seems a little bit backward. We may end up saying: "We've got assisted suicide -- we don't have to worry about fixing up the pathetic nursing home system for the frail, old and disabled. They can kill themselves if they don't like it."

Q: On his deathbed, the Archbishop of Chicago, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, called on the Supreme Court to reject physician-assisted suicide. What do you think of the way he used his illness to make his bioethics point?
A: You know, I doubt his call against assisted suicide will be heard because many will dismiss the source as a Roman Catholic cardinal. But that would be too bad. His comments against assisted suicide had as much to do with fears of abuse of the vulnerable and coercion of the poor as with any specific religious belief.

Who's Who
 
Q: Let's move to the other end of the spectrum. Have you wondered about what all the changes the birth and reproductive technologies do to traditional concepts of parenthood?
A: Oh yeah, and a number of very serious things have already happened to motherhood. With advances now available, the pregnant person might have no genetic relationship to the baby. Right now, you can take sperm from one man, put it in a dish with an egg from another woman and put that embryo into a third woman. In a situation like this, it's not at all clear who is the mother and why?

Q: Should licenses be issued for baby-making?
A: Maybe they should, but the licensing bureau would have to be in the bedroom, making the job attractive for the prurient but impractical for anybody else. You can't control birds-and-bees-style reproduction. Even the repressive Chinese regime has failed. What you can control is artificial reproduction. Someone has to look out for the interests of the desperately infertile -- as well as for the well-being of children created outside the familiar context of sex and family.
Here's an example that shows how much we need some controls. James Alan Austin, a fertile single man from Pennsylvania in his late 20's, hired a surrogate to be artificially inseminated with his sperm. Upon payment of the fee, the child was delivered to him. A few weeks later, he murdered the baby. I think he said, "It wouldn't stop crying," or something like that. The standard excuse. Why a fertile man should be allowed to buy a baby with no screening or check on his character or motives is not at all clear to me.

Q: What's the difference between pimping and surrogate-brokering?
A: Nothing. I think that buying babies is a practice that society should not accept any more than it does paid exploitative middlemen dealing in sex. I've talked with lawyers who broker surrogacy arrangements, and I've felt that the distance between them and a kind of brothel arrangement was not all that far. They sit there, sort of saying, "What type of surrogate do you want and these are the women we have in our book and who would you select and here's the fee."

Q: One of the world's leading fertility experts, Dr. Richardo Asch of the University of California at Irvine, was just recently indicted in Federal Court. Though the charge was "mail fraud," his university and patients claimed he was switching around frozen embryos at his fertility clinic. Is this the sort of thing you think needs regulation?
A: He is the poster boy for regulation. Asch may have secretly removed embryos from storage that couples had left behind in clinics and given them to other couples who had no idea where he'd gotten them. This means that a lot of people became parents without their consent. Or even participation. There are people all over California with genetic children they didn't know about.

Politics
 
Q: You were an adviser to the Clinton Administration during the failed health care reform effort of the first term. Any advice for the President this time around?
 
A: He should go back to the plate, but he needs a more modest agenda. I would say stress four things: managed care reform and children . . . children . . . children. The American people know that taking care of our kids is morally the right thing to do.

Q: In Oregon's Medicaid insurance program, the procedures the state will pay for are clearly prioritized. Will all the states be following Oregon's example?
A: It was incredibly courageous what they did there. They took on the issue in a public way that was unprecedented and hasn't been duplicated since. I admired it, but . . . it also had a fatal flaw: the effort to think about rationing was confined to the poor. In Oregon, they focused on Medicaid, which serves a population politically unable to look out for itself. Oregon shows both what can be done -- put the public on notice that it must grapple with hard choices -- and what should not be done: confine discussions of rationing to the weakest, most vulnerable among us.

Tell Us About You
 
Q: What was the biggest moral crisis you've faced?
A: Going for a draft induction physical in 1971, in the middle of the Vietnam War. Many people were going to Canada or not showing up. My wife, Jane, didn't want me to go to the physical. She thought Canada looked better at the time, but I reread Socrates' discussion in Plato's dialogues about why he was going to take the hemlock. He argued that he'd accepted society's benefits, and so it was wrong for him to reject society. This led me to decide, "I don't support this war, I'm going to argue against it, but I'm going to go."
As it happens, the doctor who gave me the induction exam was one of the guys who was exempting anyone he could. When he heard that I'd had childhood polio, he said, "You should not be going to Vietnam." But I never did anything to get out. It wasn't patriotism. It was just a feeling that you shouldn't rip off the system.

Q: Do you believe in the small lie?
A: Absolutely. One of the lubricants of social comity is . . . the small lie. It's like learning to use any small sharp object -- you have to use it carefully. I certainly don't have a problem with a small lie if I'm trying to save a life.
For instance, early in my career, I realized that by paying attention to the ethics of what good informed consent is, I was missing something. Whenever I'd been involved in a case of a Jehovah's Witness who was refusing a lifesaving blood transfusion, the family and clergy were present. It occurred to me that maybe they were pressuring the patient to say, "No, we don't want blood." So the next time I had a Jehovah's Witness case, I got everyone out of the room and talked to the patient alone: "Do you really want to refuse the blood? Because if you don't, I am willing to make sure you get a blood transfusion and lie about it."
With kidney donations, I began having questions on the way we were counseling family members who'd been called upon to donate live organs. I realized family ties could be coercive. So I went in and talked to our transplant team and said: "Before we accept any more live kidney donations, we'd better be prepared to give people a medical excuse, lie for them -- so that they feel they don't have to withstand the wrath of their family if they say 'no' to having someone cut them up and take one of their kidneys." And I got a guy right away who, when offered the chance, said no to donating to his brother.

Q: Was that the right to thing to do -- somebody probably died there?
A: It was, if you believe that to take organs from someone, they have to have a truly free choice about it. The way bioethics works is that all the questions of right and wrong aren't always all up for grabs at the same time.

 BODY:
"Charlotte Perriand? Isn't she a furniture designer?" ONE prominent architect, a man, responded when told that I was writing about her. And, indeed, that is the way she has usually been characterized, if not dismissed -- on those rare occasions when she has been mentioned at all. The distinction is taken for granted. Men design the buildings; women furnish them. Men work in concrete and steel; women, in fabrics and occasionally wood. Men organize the public spaces; women feather the nest, presiding over the realm of domestic interiors. That Perriand, despite the buildings she has designed, should be known as a furniture designer while Philippe Starck and Ettore Sottsass, whose fame is based primarily on their furniture and household objects, should be known as architects is only one indication of the bias at work in a field that is notoriously and to this day overwhelmingly male.
In a photograph from 1927, Perriand stands at Le Corbusier's side -- a girl who felt most at home in the mountains of eastern France, about to be inducted into the ranks of men who have taken the future of urban life into their own hands. Now 93, she has lived long enough to see the furniture she designed with Le Corbusier and others become so famous that it is copied with impunity, sold to collectors and exhibited in museums. (At a New York furniture gallery, 1950, a mahogany dining table is priced at $45,000. At the Design Museum, in London, "Charlotte Perriand: Modernist Pioneer," a retrospective, is on view through April 13. And the Architectural League is planning an exhibition of her work for late next year in New York.) Perriand has watched the modernist movement, which she joined in its earliest stages, give way to post-modernism and subsequently make a comeback. Lately, as one of the last surviving members of the first generation of modernists, she has been present at her own apotheosis, looking on as she and her contemporaries have been consigned to history. She has also, as it happens, lived long enough to witness the aftermath of the revolution they brought about. 
 She seems an unlikely revolutionary -- this rotund grandmother with sparkling eyes and a pixie's smile, her white hair wound in a topknot. Some 70 years after she and Le Corbusier and their fellow visionaries proclaimed a new era that would be the culmination of our evolution as a species -- an era in which houses and chairs and even clothes would be logical, functional and efficient, and people would be high-minded and happy as a result -- Perriand sits in her apartment, surveying the congested cityscape of Paris through a black veil of pollution, and reflects on the outcome of their efforts. "It's a little disappointing," she says.
 PERRIAND ARRIVED IN PARIS in 1920, as a scholarship student at the School of Decorative Arts, housed in the attic of the Louvre. To supplement her training, she enrolled in design courses taught by Maurice Dufrene, the artistic director of Galeries Lafayette, the department store. In 1925, still a student, she was selected to display several projects at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs -- among them a fresco depicting the nine muses, for a music room, and an upholstery fabric produced by Galeries Lafayette and incorporated in Dufrene's display. After graduation, with his encouragement, Perriand continued to participate in trade exhibitions, where she was singled out by the critics.
Soon, however, she broke with the style instilled by her teachers -- the patterned wallpaper, the swollen furniture that typified Art Deco -- and struck out in a new direction, embracing the machine age. The aerodynamic chrome-and-aluminum bar she created in 1927, for the Salon d'Automne, caused a sensation, announcing the esthetic potential of new materials that were already transforming life outside the home. The photograph of Perriand and Le Corbusier was taken there, in front of that bar: the master has come to see for himself, conferring his interest; she makes no attempt to conceal her elation. That October, Perriand was hired to work in his studio, where she remained for 10 years.
It was an auspicious start to a career that has turned out to be distinguished and so diverse as to encompass prefabricated aluminum bivouacs, Air France ticket offices and a pavilion made from live bamboo, at the Unesco headquarters. An extended sojourn in Japan -- where she found herself trapped by the war, having served, at the Government's invitation, as a consultant on industrial design -- inspired her to incorporate certain aspects of the Japanese tradition into the practice of modernism. With Jean Prouve, in the late 40's and 50's, she produced more landmark furniture. When Le Corbusier was commissioned to do a housing project in Marseilles, he recruited Perriand in 1950 to design the prototype for the kitchens.
Perriand believes that her early years with Le Corbusier laid the foundation for everything that followed. She speaks of her first encounter with his ideas, in 1927, as a kind of conversion experience, brought on by reading his books, in which he exhorts mankind in general and architects in particular to overthrow the tyranny of convention. Perriand claims that Le Corbusier tore down the "wall" that had been obstructing her view of the future. From then on, she was consumed by the desire to participate in the moment at hand, and by an acute sense of urgency. "I'm aware and in tune with my own age," she exulted at the time. "It is mechanical: the cars in the street . . . are polished, shiny. I wear chrome beads around my neck, a belt of metal links. My studio is chromed steel; and I wear my hair a la Josephine Baker."
An air of excitement pervaded Le Corbusier's studio, with its staff of young idealists who had come from all over the world to work for the man they considered the master. "We believed in what we were doing," Perriand says, "and we would have sacrificed everything for it." She describes the atmosphere as a cultivated one in which the design of buildings was considered in the context of new developments in other fields -- it was Le Corbusier, Perriand recalls, who sent her off to listen to Stravinsky's music.
Together, Perriand, Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, with whom he shared his practice, conceived furniture that would serve as elements in the architecture of a building's interior. Chairs were constructed on a chassis of chrome tubing, as light and sturdy as the frame of a bicycle. For carrying on a conversation, there was the now-classic armchair -- a low cube of fat cushions covered in leather and held in place by a chrome cage; for reading, there was the now-familiar chaise longue, its tubular-steel skeleton curved like a hammock and upholstered in pony skin. At trade exhibitions, the chairs, along with glass-and-steel tables, and storage units that took the place of armoires and chests of drawers, provoked a response that was sharply divided.
Like Le Corbusier, Perriand often wrote (in her case, primarily for magazines) in an attempt to explain to a reluctant public the principles underlying her work. "Understanding can change the way people see," she says, "and enable them to appreciate a form that is unfamiliar to them." The Western eye, she says by way of example, is predisposed to interpret empty space as a void, as the absence of things, whereas in Japan empty space is viewed as the presence of possibilities -- an alternative Perriand came to appreciate during her stay in Tokyo. Consequently, in the rooms she designs, she "affirms the emptiness." Beauty, as it turns out, is largely in the mind of the beholder.
In retrospect, modernism's detractors in its initial stages seem to have been hoping to slow the pace of change by withholding their approval. The telephone, the automobile, the airplane and any number of other inventions threatened to sweep away the routine of everyday life as people had known it. Clinging to the familiar, many critics actively opposed the modernist attempt to overhaul the world. When, in 1929, an article in an English design magazine campaigned against the use of metal for furniture, condemning it as "cold and brutally hard," Perriand rallied to its defense, in clipped sentences that suggest she had assimilated not only Le Corbusier's beliefs and his zeal but also his prose style, with its declamatory ring echoing that cadences of Scripture:
Metal plays the same part in furniture as cement has done in architecture.
IT IS A REVOLUTION.
The FUTURE will favour materials which best solve the problems propounded by the new man:
I understand by the NEW MAN the type of individual who keeps pace with scientific thought, who understands his age and lives it: The Aeroplane, the Ocean Liner and the Motor are at his service;
Sport gives him health;
His House is his resting place. . . .
UNITY IN ARCHITECTURE and yet again
POETRY
A new lyric beauty, regenerated by mathematical science.
Perriand's veneration for Le Corbusier was nothing less than total, and it is still intact, despite evidence that some of his ideas have proved impractical, or worse. His greatness as an architect, she believes, lay in the fact that he was not only an architect. He painted every morning, arriving at the office at 2 in the afternoon and working into the evening. His sense of color, of the harmony of shapes and of the balance of proportions informed the buildings he designed; Perriand calls him "a poet of right angles." He was also, she adds, a superb thinker, philosophical and analytical, concerned with human nature and society. It was to her mind his rigorous insistence on function that set him apart from many other modernists, including those of the Bauhaus. How does she reconcile that notion with Notre-Dame du Haut, the chapel he designed at Ronchamp -- a building that approaches the condition of sculpture, a stark departure from the machine-age fundamentalism that became his signature? Even in that case, she insists, the architecture is functional: it "puts you in a state of grace, and that is its purpose."
 NEVERTHELESS, FOR ALL HER admiration, Perriand is circumspect when it comes to many of modernism's consequences. Like pollution. She faults herself, Le Corbusier and their fellow idealists for failing to see that chemicals from industry would poison the soil and the rivers, that exhaust from cars and trucks would ruin the air in cities. That much, she says, should have been obvious. After the war, she continues, "we thought it was chic to have a nuclear reactor as a source of energy -- we didn't foresee the dangers." In their headlong rush to espouse the means of mass production, they helped to bring about a shortage of artisans and the loss of skills acquired and passed down over centuries. "We were utopian in the sense that we didn't see where our ideas would take us," Perriand admits. "We thought that society would change, that mankind was going to improve. That's where we made our mistake." If architecture is to find a way out of this predicament in which we now find ourselves, she contends, its practitioners must team up with sociologists, biologists, computer scientists and economists.
Perriand deplores that there is no forum for the exchange of ideas today, as there was in the early years of her career, when CIAM (the Congres Internationax d'Architecture Moderne) selected a theme, like "The Functional City," and brought together noted architects from all over the world -- Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Gerrit Rietveld and Jose Luis Sert among them -- to discuss it. In fact, she says, she finds the spirit of cooperation that prevailed among architects in those days now conspicuously lacking:"Of course I'm interested in contemporary architecture -- it's my era. But I don't see architects concerning themselves with collective housing, as Le Corbusier did. Architects today make monuments -- everywhere there are monuments. It's pointless. Meanwhile, the place that people call home is left to the taste of developers and handymen, and no one thinks it through."
The design and outfitting of a building's interior, which used to be part of the architect's job -- and part of his training -- is now left to a decorator. Chairs are conceived by furniture designers, another "specialty." "With Le Corbusier, I learned that architecture is a whole," Perriand says. "He conceived the structure, the fittings and the furniture all together. We designed a chair because, at a given moment, in a precise context, we needed a chair." Their furniture, now considered so "classic" that it exists in our minds in some Platonic vacuum, was in fact initially created as an integral part of the designs for Le Corbusier's residential projects, like the Villa Laroche and the Villa Church.
"But now there is a split," she continues. "On the one side you have the schools of architecture, and on the other the schools of decorative arts -- when all along they were meant to live together. Now, when an architect completes a project, it's just an empty building. And then the decorator is called in -- but it's already too late. Between the outside and the inside, there is no harmony. The resonance of things together is gone."

 
PREDICTABLY, PERHAPS, PERRIAND has been championed by feminist architectural historians looking to anoint some women to the modernist hall of fame. There are precious few candidates in her generation: Eileen Grey, whose career was in some respects more consistent and conspicuous; Lily Reich, who worked with Mies van der Rohe and was the subject of a small exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York, last spring. The fact that until as recently as a few years ago the furniture Perriand designed in collaboration with Le Corbusier was attributed to him alone has surely enhanced the perception that she has been slighted. Like Reich, she has been portrayed as a talented woman laboring in a great man's shadow.
It is a portrayal that bears little, if any, resemblance to her experience as she recounts it. Asked if she met with any prejudice or resentment as a woman in a man's profession, she claims that she never thought about it. Confronted with ideas that dominate much of the current critical discourse about modernism -- reinterpreting it as aggressively masculine, as a renunciation of all things decorative (i.e., feminine) -- she expresses bewilderment. Legend has it that the first time Perriand approached Le Corbusier about a job, before her success at the Salon d'Automne, he responded, "We don't embroider cushions here," and sent her away. In her memory, however, that insult has been rendered harmless by the respect he subsequently showed her in their work together.
That certain avenues might be closed to her, or that she might encounter obstacles simply by virtue of being a woman seems never to have occurred to her -- possibly, she volunteers, because she grew up doing things that boys did. Introduced to exercise at an early age, as a means to correct a curvature of the spine, she learned to love physical activity. Growing up in the mountains, Perriand took up downhill skiing, slalom skiing, canoeing, white-water rafting, mountain climbing and spelunking. It is, she believes, her background as an athlete that instilled in her a sense of competence and power -- a subliminal, unshakable self-confidence that spilled over into everything else she undertook.
 LE CORBUSIER'S DICTUM THAT architecture should express its own era still meets with widespread resistance more than half a century later. In the rantings of Prince Charles and in the popular appeal of entire communities that offer a choice of Victorian, Colonial, Tudor and other styles, the impulse to take refuge in the past is alive and thriving. Post-modernism, a movement that by virtue of its name alone signaled the demise of modernism's continuous present, has ushered in the rampant use of historicisms, and Perriand has no patience with -- much less sympathy for -- its playful disregard for content, its emphasis on novelty. "It's all gadgets," she says.
In some larger sense, of course, post-modernism does indeed express its era: the longing for some semblance of continuity, forfeited when modernism broke with the past; a certain dissatisfaction with modernism's perceived constraints; the marriage of anxiety and confusion. But in Perriand's opinion, the fact that modernism didn't turn out as planned is no excuse for turning one's back on the future and resorting to pastiche. "I agree that it's necessary to be acquainted with everything that has gone before us," she concedes. "And I respect each era and all that it can express. But I think of tradition as a chain, with the last link being the previous century. And to that link, we attach another one that we make ourselves, from the century in which we live."
If modernism -- or Perriand's view of it -- can be reduced to a single tenet, it may be this insistence on articulating the time in which one lives, in the present tense. "Louis XIV and Louis XV were modern because they were true to their own eras," she says. "I don't see why I should do what has been done before. I express my era, period."
Her own apartment illustrates just how quietly subversive a notion this still proves to be. She reamed the structure, knocking down interior walls that divided the space into a rabbit warren of tiny rooms, doing away with the calculated quaintness. The result -- open and filled with light, with a stereoscopic view of the western half of Paris and privacy provided by a sliding scrim of sailcloth lashed to a teak frame -- is completely at odds with the building's stated intent. A typical bourgeois apartment house, it was built in 1956, in the style of the 30's. "This building," she says disdainfully, "was old before it was born."
The problem, as Perriand sees it, lies not in architecture but in society. "There is a saying," she recalls, "that 'every society has the architecture it deserves.' " What is it that prompts these paroxysms of nostalgia? "Fear," she says. "A failure of nerve. A lack of virility." Her own personal philosophy -- which, she is convinced, is responsible for her longevity -- is in some respects a reflection of the modernist credo, applied to the course of an individual life. "In every important decision," she explains, "there is one option that represents life, and that is what you must choose." The alternative -- a retreat from change, from the future -- is corrosive. The mere act of preparing for a retrospective exhibition, or giving an interview, or writing her memoirs -- all of which oblige her to revisit the past -- puts Perriand in a state of suspended animation that she deeply resents. "Life," Perriand asseverates, "is something in motion."
 THE MODERNIST REVIVAL IS IN full swing, and if demand is any indication, appreciation for Perriand's contribution to the modernist canon is running high. Does all this new-found attention somehow vindicate what she and her colleagues produced? No, she says. They felt vindicated at the time. "These chairs," she says matterof-factly, "will last until something better comes along to replace them."
The ironies are not lost on her. The romantic promise of the machine age resided in the notion of mass production, but much of the furniture Perriand made -- with Le Corbusier, with Prouve -- was never manufactured; the prototypes, however industrial the materials, are precious, one of a kind, crafted by hand. Many of her pieces, which set out to describe their moment, have since been declared timeless. But even more striking is that the current return to the forms of early modernism is, finally, a wave of nostalgia for a movement that forswore nostalgia. Gazing into a future that seems abstract, disembodied, a succession of technological breakthroughs unfolding in cyberspace, we are at a loss to imagine how upcoming changes in our lives might manifest themselves in the shape of a building or the design of a chair. We envy the modernists their certitude, back in the days before progress had taken leave of the material world. On the verge of the millennium, we're faced with the daunting task of inventing a style that could express the possibilities of the next hundred years. In their time, Perriand and her colleagues rose to the occasion -- a fact in which she takes evident pride. "We made our century sing," she says.

THE DEATH OF SATAN: How Americans Have Lost the Sense of Evil
By Andrew Delbanco.
Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $13.
As our culture has grown more secular, moral relativism has replaced religion, Mr. Delbanco maintains. Although he sees little value in fundamentalism, he encourages ethics that emphasize personal responsibility. His book is "brilliant, passionate, erudite and beautifully written," Wendy Doniger said here last year.
 
MRS. TED BLISS
By Stanley Elkin. Avon, $12.
In his final novel, published shortly before his death in 1995, the author focuses on an octogenarian Jewish widow in Florida who has been tied to the kitchen all her life except, perhaps, in her heart. It is this vulnerable spot that is targeted by various con men and unscrupulous types, from Latin drug traffickers to her husband's former business partner. Mrs. Bliss's story is "a smart, generous, melancholy, funny, even elegiac work by a prodigious practitioner," Walter Goodman wrote in these pages. Avon has also restored to print several of Elkin's earlier novels. In GEORGE MILLS ($14), first published in 1982, the title character, a man of about 50, contemplates his family's miserable history of servitude at the same time that he is driving his employer, an incurably ill woman, to Mexico. Our reviewer, Leslie Epstein, praised the "fine writing, flashes of humor and memorable heroine." THE LIVING END ($12) takes place largely in the afterlife, where Ellerbee, the main character, is sent by the gun-toting thieves who rob his liquor store. The result, in which God turns out to be not such a nice guy, was "a big book for Stanley Elkin, and a fine and daring novel," John Irving wrote in the Book Review in 1979. Judgment for one's deeds also pervades A BAD MAN ($12), the tale of Leo Feldman, a department store owner who has allowed the basement to be used for underworld purposes. Describing Elkin, Josh Greenfeld said here in 1967, "I know of no serious funny writer in this country who can match him."
 
OVERCOMING LAW
By Richard A. Posner. Harvard University, $17.95.
A Federal judge and legal scholar argues that economics -- the real costs and benefits of a decision -- should play more of a role in the courtroom, and that empirical evidence rather than precedent should influence justice. Selected as one of the best books of 1995 by the editors of the Book Review, this is "the most scholarly, the most thoughtful, as well as the sharpest and most provocative" of current legal commentaries, Jeremy Waldron wrote in these pages. Harvard has also reissued A NATION UNDER LAWYERS: How the Crisis in the Legal Profession Is Transforming American Society, by Mary Ann Glendon ($14.95). The author, a law professor, criticizes both litigiousness and what she sees as the tendency of judges to make law rather than interpret it. In 1994 our reviewer, David Luban, called her work "one of the most accessible and best-written books about the legal profession in the past few years."
 
IN THE CUT
By Susanna Moore. Onyx, $6.99.
Frannie, a linguist, teacher and the narrator of this novel, embarks on an odyssey of sex and secrets after she stumbles upon an intimate scene in a New York bar. One of the participants is soon dead, and Frannie becomes involved -- in several senses -- with the investigating police. The book is "a ferociously uninhibited erotic thriller," Molly Haskell said here in 1995.
 
SAVAGES
By Joe Kane. Vintage Departures, $13.
The Huaorani, a tribe of Amazonian Indians, lived undisturbed by industrial civilization until oil was discovered on their land. The author, who spent months with them, shows how they have since been exploited by both corporations and environmentalists. He offers "superb eyewitness reporting and fluent storytelling," Mark Hertsgaard wrote in these pages last year. Another sojourn in an indigenous culture is described in KABLOONA: Among the Inuit, by Gontran de Poncins (Graywolf, $14.95). Just restored to print, the book chronicles the French author's exposure to Eskimo life in the Arctic in 1938 and 1939. "He is obviously not an eccentric running away from something but a potential enthusiast running toward something," R. L. Duffus said in The New York Times in 1941.
 
THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES
By Amy Tan. Ivy, $6.99.
The author explores the relationship between two half sisters: Olivia, a part-Chinese but thoroughly American-bred photographer, and Kwan, fully Asian in blood and sensibility, a believer in a spirit world that Olivia denies. Last year our reviewer, Claire Messud, said, "Kwan, in particular, is a memorable creation."
 
CITY LIFE
By Witold Rybczynski.
Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.
Why can't New York be more like Paris? The author shows how our landscape and values -- democracy and technology among them -- inspire Chrysler Buildings rather than Eiffel Towers. His book is "wonderfully informative, entertaining and nuanced," George F. Will wrote here in 1995. Laurel Graeber

THE HOUSE OF MOSES ALL-STARS
By Charley Rosen.
490 pp. New York:
Seven Stories Press. $24.95.
In 1936 it wasn't easy to make a buck. But the seven enterprising young men in Charley Rosen's novel "The House of Moses All-Stars," taking advantage of their skills on the basketball court, barnstorm the country, competing against local teams for cash. 
 These guys are good, several having played college ball in the metropolitan New York area. But mere skill isn't always enough -- you need a gimmick to put people in the seats. The come-on here is for the seven stalwarts to call themselves the House of Moses All-Stars and (as with similar real-life teams) to take to the court wearing yarmulkes and long beards, letting folks in the hinterlands know what real Jews look like.
In his novel, set against the backdrop of Hitler's rise in Germany and economic hard times here, Mr. Rosen, the author of three previous basketball novels, as well as four nonfiction books on the subject, re-creates a world of basketball that has been all but forgotten amid the hype surrounding star players like Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. Yes, there was a time, before the establishment of the National Basketball Association in the late 1940's, when basketball was played in small gymnasiums as the prelude to a dance, or in wire cages (hence the nickname "cagers") to protect players from rowdy crowds who poked lighted cigarettes at members of the opposing teams. It was a time when the players drove to games, sometimes hundreds of miles apart, in station wagons and sedans hardly large enough to hold them. But the House of Moses All-Stars do this one better: they hopscotch across the country in the dead of winter in a renovated hearse, with the Star of David painted on the side.
This is not simply a novel about basketball in the dark ages. Mr. Rosen has much more on his mind here. This is a book about guilt and redemption, about the loss of innocence, about racism and bigotry, about class differences.
The seven young men on the team are all running from, or to, something. The narrator, Aaron Steiner, is the guiltiest of all -- because, with some of his teammates, he shaved points in college; because his daughter was born deformed and died shortly after birth; and because before tossing her ashes in the ocean he visited a freak show on Coney Island; because he has left his wife after sleeping with one of his high school students. And, perhaps most of all, he is guilty because he enjoyed it.
His teammates include Brooks, the Bolshevik who stops the barnstorming tour to play a benefit game for a group of striking workers; Leo (think Leo Gorcey of the original Dead End Kids), the troublemaker more interested in the point spread and any angle that can make him an extra buck than in winning; Saul, the lapsed Hasid, who loses his innocence the hard way when the boys play a game in the unfriendly confines of Sing Sing prison; Ron, the thief, who has spent most of his life on the streets; Mitchell, the somewhat priggish Zionist, who keeps the books, doles out expenses and longs to emigrate to Palestine; and Kevin, who isn't Jewish at all, but the Irish Catholic son of a New York City cop.
Mr. Rosen gets the ambiance just right: the moving from town to town, the sometimes horrid conditions under which they play, the weariness and sense of dislocation, the bigotry and ignorance they encounter.
Unfortunately, as the team reaches the middle of the country -- Oklahoma -- the book turns a little sappy. When the players find themselves on an Indian reservation, being shielded after a scrape with the law, political correctness begins to seep in, with stereotypically wise elders. And when the team plays its final game in California, things seem to happen at an alarmingly hasty pace, as if Mr. Rosen realized the clock was winding down and he'd better end the game.
Some people think most of the important action of a basketball game takes place in the last two minutes. To real fans, of course, that's heresy. It's how you got to the last deuce that really counts. And, in the end, even if the final two minutes of Mr. Rosen's novel don't satisfy, the rest of it certainly does.

THE CASE FOR MARS
The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must.
By Robert Zubrin with Richard Wagner.
Illustrated. 328 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $25.
Almost 25 years have passed since humans last set foot on the moon, and a generation of young Americans who believed they were witnessing the dawn of the space age have grown gray watching space shuttles fly nowhere in circles. In the post-Vietnam, post-cold-war, post-modern era we live in it is an accepted truism that the public will no longer tolerate grand, expensive adventures without a guaranteed bottom-line return to national security or the gross domestic product. "Are we still a nation of pioneers?" ask the authors of this book, one of the most provocative and hopeful documents I have read about the space program in 20 years. "Do we choose to make the efforts required to continue as the vanguard of human progress, a people of the future, or will we allow ourselves to be a people of the past, one whose accomplishments are celebrated only in museums?" 
 Part history, part call to arms, part technical manual, part wishful thinking, "The Case for Mars" was written before last summer's announcement of evidence for past microbial life on the red planet made it the solar system's hottest tourist destination. It lays out an ingenious plan -- "Mars Direct" -- for humans to explore Mars within 10 years, using existing technology, for $20 billion or so. Robert Zubrin (formerly a senior engineer at Martin Marietta) and his colleagues invented the idea in 1990 out of frustration after NASA placed a $450 billion price tag on going to Mars. They have been barnstorming it ever since.
Mr. Zubrin compares NASA's approach to that of 19th-century Arctic explorers who set out for the Pole in expensive armadas of large ships stuffed with years' worth of supplies only to get stuck in the ice. The successful explorers traveled by dog sled and lived off the land. Martian explorers should also plan to live off the land, particularly the planet's thin atmosphere -- carbon dioxide, which can be turned into a methane-oxygen rocket fuel with the help of a very small amount of hydrogen. Being able to make fuel abroad for the trip home means astronauts will not have to lug it from Earth, and that means their spacecraft can be light enough to launch with existing rockets. No risky, expensive on-orbit assembly of "Battleship Galactica" spaceships. Economies follow like dominoes.
Part of the fun in reading this book is seeing a crack engineering mind operate. Mr. Zubrin knows how to make things work, and he sees possibilities and alternatives everywhere -- which he can't help explaining in occasional blizzards of numbers and acronyms. There are enough charts and graphs to tempt the serious student to try to design his own mission. Mr. Zubrin has already figured out the crew: two engineers and two scientists; no pilot-commander, no doctor (surely wishful thinking).
The first Martian homes will be of brick made from Martian sand. The planet's economy will be based on mining and selling deuterium (five times as abundant as on Earth) for use in nuclear reactors. At times Mr. Zubrin's can-do enthusiasm verges on chilling, as when he discusses possibly thickening Mars's atmosphere by melting the planet's polar caps and permafrost to make it more habitable (900 years -- no price tag): "I would say that failure to terraform Mars constitutes failure to live up to our human nature and a betrayal of our responsibility as members of the community of life itself."
When it comes to paying for all this, Mr. Zubrin is no less ingenious. One idea, worked out with the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, would be for the Government to award cash prizes for the completion of various Mars tasks: $20 billion for the whole mission, $1 billion for a working fuel plant, and so on. If such an arrangement could lead to someone like Bill Gates owning or running Mars, that is not necessarily a bad thing by Mr. Zubrin, who is fed up with how things work on Earth. Bureaucratization, economic stagnation, overregulation, irrationalism, "Malthusianism" and the stifling of diversity, he says, are sapping our spirit. Just as the necessities and opportunities of frontier America supposedly drove progress in the 19th century, he believes, Mars would be a new frontier of enterprise and innovation, a new New World where humanity can renew itself. Such romanticism, of course, overlooks other aspects of the American West, like the contribution of the railroads, built by vast land give-aways and coolie labor, or the Indians, who were here first.
But one can agree that exploring Mars would be an exciting and noble thing to do, and that Mars Direct would be a cool way to do it. There may be natives on Mars, too, in the form of those microbes famously hypothesized last summer. What if we find them still making a living somehow, under the red sands? Would we have the right to colonize the planet, reprogram its climate and kill them? There is the mother of all snail-darter controversies, awaiting us in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: In High Sumatra, Another Way of Life

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE; BARBARA CROSSETTE, chief of the United Nations bureau of The Times, is writing a book about the great hill stations of Asia.

 BODY:
FOR the price of a cup of coffee -- home grown Sumatran kopi, served in a big glass with rough brown sugar for a sweetener -- what an eyeful of glory we got! The precarious back porch of a roadside food stall clung to the rim of a deep, long valley. In the distance there were the ubiquitous green, green rice fields of Indonesia. But here, near the town of Bukittinggi in the highlands of Sumatra, a volcanic island about the size of California, there was more. Rose-red leaves atop the cinnamon trees and huge yellow daisies bobbing in the morning sun splashed unexpected color over dense tropical undergrowth. Off to one side the soaring pinnacled rooftops of a village peopled by one of Indonesia's most sophisticated cultures, the Minangkabau, could be glimpsed above a tangle of trees.
Among the great hill stations of Asia, where European colonizers went to escape the lowlands' suffocating heat and the merciless diseases that sent many white men, women and children to early graves, the name of Bukittinggi, about 50 miles north of the Indian Ocean port of Padang, never figured prominently. The Dutch built it not as a place of respite, after all, but as a fortress against 19th-century Islamic militants bent on installing a fundamentalist order.
Bukittinggi had none of the cachet of Simla, the Himalayan hill station to which the British rulers of India decamped in sedan chairs, preceded by caravans of porters with the season's household goods. Or Dalat in the highlands of Vietnam, where the French created a town that was part resort, part sanatorium.
But Bukittinggi, still a fairly small town in a rural setting -- and a few other Asian also-rans, including Murree in the hills of northern Pakistan -- may for varied reasons have brighter futures than more famous colonial hill stations, if growth does not come too fast. In West Sumatra, as in Indonesia generally, tourism is on the upswing, and Bukittinggi and the hills and lakes nearby are increasingly favored destinations. Sumatra is a steamy, rainy island. We who backdrop our images of the Islamic world with Middle Eastern deserts or barren and dusty West Asian landscapes are often surprised to encounter the ponds, lakes and pools of Muslim Southeast Asia.
The attraction goes beyond nature. The people who call themselves Minangkabau, and once enjoyed 500 years of independence as a kingdom that survived into the early 19th century, have created an unusual culture in these hills. Devoutly Muslim, they are also matrilineal, with an egalitarian social system and an economy in which women own virtually all the property. The Minang have produced poets, thinkers, novelists, educators, politicians and even revolutionaries of national stature in Indonesia.
Daily life in Minangkabau country is governed by intensely complicated and arcane rules of etiquette called baso-basi, which an outsider cannot help but breach in some way. The Minang are forgiving, however, because they are also cosmopolitan. Villagers get together to invest in satellite dishes and tap into television from other Asian and Pacific nations, including Australia. Part of growing up here, especially for young men, includes a stint abroad in the rantau -- a word that means, roughly, "anywhere but here." No wonder anthropologists are drawn to the Minang like bees to clover.
The traveler most easily enters Minangkabau country by air through the port city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra. As the plane approaches through long mountain valleys -- Sumatra is the world's fourth largest island -- Padang unfolds as a low-rise city of white walls and red-tiled roofs punctuated by those breathtaking Minangkabau spires. Shaped like buffalo horns and often tipped with silver, many of the spires are on new public buildings, evidence of a revival of interest in traditional architecture after years of modern, flat-topped concrete boxes.
The trip by winding road from Padang to Bukittinggi in the Minangkabau heartland takes about two hours by car or three hours by public bus. Although there are other towns with small hotels in Minang country, Bukittinggi is a good base in the highlands because it has a wide range of accommodations, from new luxury hotels to very basic losmen, those Indonesian-style inns well known to backpackers and other bottom-budget travelers.
I stayed about a mile out of town on the Jalan Soekarno-Hatta in the new Hotel Pusako, set in luxuriant flower gardens with water terraces. My comfortable room, decorated with Indonesian fabrics and local hardwoods, had a balcony that looked out over the small plot of a village farmer. The air was refreshingly clear by day and cool at night -- not cold, because Bukittinggi is less than 4,000 feet above sea level and barely 50 miles south of the Equator.
AN acquaintance with the Minangkabau is best established before reaching Bukittinggi. At Padang Panjang, about 12 miles south of the mountain town, a magnificent center for the study of Minangkabau culture opened less than a decade ago. Its centerpiece is a traditional rumah gadang, or great house, the center of communal life for the extended Minang family.
The large rectangular wooden structure is a kind of lofty longhouse built on stilts with six saddle-shaped sections of thatched roof, three to the left and three to the right of a central entrance. Their six soaring pinnacles, rising like three pairs of buffalo horns, are tipped in silver. Below the tiered roof, the exterior walls are intricately carved and colorfully painted in designs drawn from nature and the imagination of folk artists. The house and two small but equally ornamented rice barns in front are set in gardens planted with flowers and shrubbery native to West Sumatra.
Indoors, this exotic "big house" serves as a small museum, a gallery of historic photographs, a library, a bookstore, and the headquarters of the Center for Information and Documentation on Minangkabau Culture, a private foundation. Entrance to the complex, which is open daily from 8 to 5, costs about 22 cents.
Bukittinggi is not a particularly pretty town. Its structural landmarks are limited to a fragment of the Dutch Fort de Kock, an old Dutch-built clock tower called Jam Gadang and a Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose bright red-and-white logo is a useful pole star for locating the center of town. A sprawling indoor-outdoor market, the Pasar Atas, dominates Bukittinggi. It is a fascinating stroll, but tourists won't find too much to buy beyond the richly woven gedong, a length of silk or cotton patterned with gold or silver thread, sometimes made into sleek, dressy purses appropriate to evening wear. Locally embroidered household linens or garments are often too lavish and too fussy for many tastes. Despite its growing popularity Bukittinggi has remained small (fewer than 100,000), and walking around it (or up and down its hills) can offer certain pleasures. On the grounds of the sad little zoo near the market, there is, unexpectedly, another traditional Minang great-house museum full of the paraphernalia of common and royal daily life, including ornamented costumes for special occasions, carved furniture and utensils of all kinds.
In this rumah gadang, someone has made an effort to post explanations in English, still a rare practice in Indonesia. In front of a small diorama of a wedding scene I saw this sign:
"There are three layers of material separating the bride and groom . . . indicating that the couple must be able to control desire for one another for up to three days before the marriage is consummated."
On the way out, I passed another model of restraint: a bored cobra and an understandably neurotic white chicken sharing a small enclosure in the zoo.
From the clock tower and the market it is a short walk to a park along the Jalan Panorama overlooking Sianok Canyon, part of a rift valley running the length of Sumatra. An easy hike of about an hour or two through the canyon leads to Kota Gadang, a village of silversmiths. Apart from the pepper and spices for which it was famous, this part of Sumatra was once rich in silver and gold. Jewelry makers here specialize in silver filigree.
Although many tourists prefer to head west from Bukittinggi to Maninjau, a large volcanic lake with water sports, I chose a trip to the southeast, a voyage into myth and legend. Much of Minang lore springs from the farmland around the town of Batusangkar, where in a nearby pasture a legendary event occurred that many like to believe gave the Minangkabau their name, which translates variously as "victorious buffalo" or "sharp-horned buffalo." Versions of the story differ, but essentially it goes like this:
A king from the neighboring island of Java, threatening conquest, was persuaded by a local ruler to let the battle be fought by buffaloes, to save human life. The Javanese king agreed, and sent for his biggest bull. Meanwhile, the people of Batusangkar had been starving a nursing buffalo calf, while fitting its small head with sharp metal horns. When the calf was turned loose to face its opponent, it made a frantic dash at the bull's belly in search of milk, goring and killing the larger animal.
The Minangkabau creation myth revolves around Mount Marapi, one of two volcanoes -- the other is Mount Singgalang -- visible from Bukittinggi and many other places in the highlands. Legend says that the proto-Minang came down from Marapi to build their first earthly settlement in Pariangan, a few miles away from Batusangkar along a narrow country road climbing into the hills. Here families now struggle to keep ancestral houses in repair, and some are collapsing. But the place remains special for the Minangkabau, whose passion for these lands seems to give life to everything around.
On the grassy fields of Batusangkar there are banyan trees with spirits, a sultan's tomb that is reputed to change size every time someone measures it, and a megalith with a hole in it and a few tales to explain why. One story, the one favored by the groundskeeper, says it was used by warriors whose peaceful king told them to attack it if they felt the need to stab something. Megaliths, some with ancient inscriptions if not with holes, have been found in a number of places in the highlands.
AT Pagarruyung, a few miles outside Batusangkar, there is a fine collection of new buildings that together illustrate Minangkabau thinking. One is a reconstructed royal palace, a traditional rumah gadang of larger than usual proportions built to replace and replicate a nearby royal residence destroyed by fire in the 1970's. Close by, an imposing white mosque has arisen, and behind it a local government headquarters also constructed in traditional style. For the Minangkabau, the three are symbols of a philosophy found in few other Muslim societies, a belief that there can be a separation of religion, culture and civil authority.
The Minangkabau may rise before dawn to the call of the mosque, but they also go to secular schools by day and dance into the night in colorful costumes and headdresses of silver, their music and movement drawn from a pre-Islamic age.
And then there is the water. In the Minangkabau highlands, pools and watercourses -- simple things, not grand Mughal designs -- are all around, softening the reflections of the village mosque and cosseting small households with fish to eat, water to bathe in, and moisture for the fruit trees and gardens.
Life can be just too easy and too good to sustain a work ethic or even a cause, complained A. A. Navis, a Minang novelist and historian, when I stopped to visit him on a rainy day. Fertile ground, he says, but not for militancy.
 
What to see, where to stay, what to eat in the highlands
 
The Basics
The best time to visit is from April to August, though sudden showers can occur year round in the highlands. Coastal areas are always hot; in the highlands, cooler nights, with temperatures in the 60's or 70's, follow 80- or 90-degree days.
 The Indonesian currency is the rupiah. A dollar is worth between 2,250 and 2,300. The cheaper inns do not take credit cards.
Padang, the gateway to Minangkabau country, is connected by nonstop flights to several Indonesian cities, including Jakarta and Medan, as well as to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The easiest route is the Singapore-Padang flight on Silk Air, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines ($121).
 
Accommodations
Padang has several new hotels. The most luxurious is the Hotel Sedona Bumi Minang, 20-28 Jalan Bundo Kandung, (62-751) 37555. Rooms are listed as $130 for a single and $150 for a double, but I paid about $110, including 21 percent in taxes and service charges. Ask for discounts.
Another centrally placed hotel, but a cheaper one, is the Natour Muara, 34 Jalan Gereja; (62-751) 35600, 25660 or 33751. Rooms begin at about $38, single or double.
The Andara Duta Andalas travel agency in Padang, 53A Jalan Pemuda, (62-751) 33689, fax (62-751) 29142, can arrange for a car and driver and hotels in the highlands. The trip to Bukittinggi costs about $48. Ask for Budi Agnesya, the assistant operations manager, who speaks English.
In Bukittinggi, the most attractive hotel is the new Hotel Pusako, set in luxuriant flower gardens with water terraces about a mile out of town on the Jalan Soekarno-Hatta, (62-752) 32111, fax (62-752) 32667. A room with balcony starts at about $68, plus taxes and service, for a total of $81, single or double. No tipping is expected. There is no air-conditioning, so take insect repellent, since the only effective ventilation is an open door and there are mosquitoes.
Novotel has also recently opened a hotel in Bukittinggi on the Jalan Laras Datuk Bandaro, (62-752) 35000, fax (62-752) 23800, with single or double rooms starting at $85, plus 21 percent tax and service charges. The hotel is closer to the town center than the Pusako, but has none of its natural setting.
A pleasant hotel popular with tour groups is the Denai, 26 Jalan Rivai, (62-752) 32920, fax (62-752) 33490, with non-air-conditioned rooms from $30 and air-conditioned rooms at $55 single and $65 double, plus taxes and service.
Cheap hotels abound in Bukittinggi. Near the Denai is Lima's Hotel, at 34 Jalan Kesehatan, (62-752) 22641, fax (62-752) 32570, where rooms with bath start at about $15.50.
For transportation within Bukittinggi, there are plenty of taxis that charge a flat fee of $1.20 to go anywhere. Hotels can telephone for taxis and there is no extra charge. There are also many picturesque horse-drawn carriages called bendi. Every ride has to be bargained for. I paid the standard 3,000-rupiah taxi fare, which is more than generous, but less than the 5,000 rupiah ($2.22)
that drivers try to extract from tourists.
 
Food
West Sumatra -- Padang in particular -- is well known for the hottest food in Indonesia. Most hotels tone down the chilies for tourists, but if you get a chance, sample a real beef rendang, for example -- bite-sized chunks of beef boiled down in lavishly spiced and seasoned coconut milk until the meat appears nearly black. Served with rice also flavored subtly with coconut milk, it is delicious. In hotels, a rendang will cost no more than about $4.40 tops. At food stalls, a meal may cost less than half that. But hepatitis and cholera are endemic in Indonesia, and it is wiser to stick to places where plates and cutlery are free of contamination.
A real Padang dining experience means having plate after plate of food -- lamb and fish dishes along with beef -- brought to your table automatically. You pay only for what you choose to eat.
Sate (satay) restaurants, serving grilled beef, chicken or lamb on skewers also often operate this way: a big tray of mixed sate with squares of pressed rice cakes and bowls of peanut sauce arrive at the table. The waiter counts the empty sticks after the meal. In Padang Panjang, three of us ate a lot of sate at a noisy family resturant called Sate Mak Syukur. With tea and soft drinks, the total bill came to about $4.78.
In the Minang region as everywhere in Indonesia, a safe and tasty staple is nasi goreng, fried rice served with a chunk of fried chicken or a few sticks of sate or both and crowned with a fried egg. Even in the most luxurious hotels, a good nasi goreng won't cost more than about $5.
Beer and soft drinks are available in tourist hotels and restaurants. Bottled water is sold in most towns. Never drink iced drinks or tap water.

Closing Costs on A Purchase
 
Q How can I anticipate how much I will have to pay in closing costs on the purchase of a house? Is it true that mortgage lenders are required to supply good-faith estimates of closing costs? . . . Bi-kim Liu, Manhattan
 
A Douglas F. Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that closing costs varied widely depending on the type and amount of mortgage financing the borrower was obtaining.
"I generally advise purchasers to anticipate that they will have to pay closing costs of about 5 to 8 percent of the purchase price, including attorney's fees," Mr. Wasser said, adding that lenders were indeed required to provide borrowers with a good-faith estimate of closing costs. 
 Most lenders, Mr. Wasser said, charge origination fees, or points, when a mortgage is made. Each point, he said, is equal to 1 percent of the mortgage amount, and different mortgages carry different numbers of points. Generally, Mr. Wasser said, the higher the interest rate, the lower the number of points, and vice versa.
The cost of title insurance -- required by lenders to insure that the purchaser gets clear title to the property -- also varies with the purchase price and mortgage amount. On a $250,000 purchase with a $200,000 mortgage, Mr. Wasser said, a purchaser can expect to pay a title insurance premium of about $1,600 plus several hundred dollars more for title searches, inspections and a survey.
In New York, Mr. Wasser said, purchasers usually have to pay mortgage recording taxes that range from 1 percent to 2.75 percent of the mortgage amount, depending upon the county where the property is.
Purchasers should also anticipate being required by their lender to buy a homeowner's insurance policy, and to deposit several months' worth of real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums into an escrow account maintained by the lender.
Finally, Mr. Wasser said, purchasers can also be required to pay various miscellaneous expenses associated with the mortgage, including document preparation fees, lawyer review fees and recording fees.
 
Pointing Charges In a Co-op
 
Q Can you tell me whose responsibility it is when it comes to pointing in a building? How often should a building be inspected and where does the responsibility of cost and repair fall? I live in a co-op. . . . Maria Pucci, Manhattan.

A James Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law, said that in a co-op, the co-op corporation was responsible for maintaining basic building systems and keeping the building in good repair.
"This includes the roof and facades of the building," Mr. Samson said.
Pointing, Mr. Samson said, is part of the routine process of facade maintenance by which old mortar between the bricks or masonry blocks is replaced. Such work is essential, he said, to prevent leaking and to hold the masonry in the proper position.
"There is no hard-and-fast rule as to how often repointing should be done," Mr. Samson said. "If the occupants are reporting leaks, an inspection should be performed."
Mr. Samson added that in New York City, if a building is more than six stories high, Local Law 10 of 1980 requires that all portions of the facade that are within 25 feet of a public street or sidewalk be inspected every five years by a licensed architect or professional engineer. Reports of the inspection must be filed with the Department of Buildings.
If repointing is necessary, he said, the co-op board has the power to pay for the work by using reserve funds, declaring a special assessment, raising maintenance fees or borrowing the necessary funds.

HEADLINE: A 90's Twist On Town Meeting Tradition

BYLINE: By LEONARD FELSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Richard and Doris Sugarman arrived in Hartford in 1989 the region's economy was spiraling downward. They had come from Richmond, Va., home for both of them, because Mr. Sugarman's employer, Advest Inc., had asked him to run its Connecticut division.
As Advest's division manager, part of Mr. Sugarman's job was to learn about the community. And what he saw worried him. 
 "It looked like a community struggling in a lot of respects," he said. "It appeared not to have a sense of community." There was a sense of futility, of addressing problems that many people perceived as too big to tackle, Mr. Sugarman recalled.
As newcomers, the Sugarmans wondered if they could help. So began what came to be known as the Connecticut Forum, a series of discussions on important issues of the day featuring speakers ranging from Henry Kissinger to Bill Cosby to Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
Now in its fourth season, the forum, held at The Bushnell Memorial Hall in downtown Hartford, draws a crowd not only from the Hartford region, but also from parts of Massachusetts and New York.
Just last month, the weekend before Election Day, the first session of the current season featured "A Spoof on Presidential Politics" with Rob Bartlett, the comic whose work is best known on the "Imus in the Morning" radio show; Al Franken, the political satirist who has been a regular on "Saturday Night Live"; Jeff Greenfield, the ABC News political and media analyst, and Bob Englehart, political cartoonist for The Hartford Courant. Like all the other forums, it resembled less a performance than a living room chat, in this case, a group of friends getting together for some laughs.
An earlier forum, "Heroes Among Us" was scheduled for October, but the Sugarmans agreed to reschedule it until March 18, so that the first Presidential debate could be held at The Bushnell that night.
In addition, over the years, the Sugarmans have helped create community outreach programs that have attempted to put into action forum-generated ideas.
"There was a feeling of bridge building and bringing together various elements of the community from day one," said Drew Beja, a Boston investment manager and former Advest analyst who worked with the Sugarmans when the Connecticut Forum was still just an idea.
The idea of a forum was one the Sugarmans brought with them from Richmond, which had created the Richmond Forum about 20 years ago in the midst of a school desegregation ruling that had divided the city.
Mrs. Sugarman saw Richmond and Hartford as two very similar cities, but, like her husband, one of the first things she noticed, she said, was how disconnected the different towns that make up greater Hartford were. The Sugarmans, for instance, settled in Avon, which Mrs. Sugarman discovered was isolated from neighboring Canton. Although the Sugarmans like the small-town feeling of New England, they said they saw how it got in the way of what Mr. Sugarman called "a greater sense of community."
They decided to see if there was support for a forum in Connecticut. Mr. Sugarman asked and won support from Advest. Then the couple went to The Hartford Courant and to Connecticut Public Television and Radio. There too they won a commitment. They went to about 25 businesses, seeking financial support. "The response was an enthusiastic 'yes' with a big 'but,' " recalled Mr. Sugarman. "We were told, 'It's a great idea but not in these tough times.' "
The Sugarmans' response was, "Why not? Particularly because of the tough times." The couple proceeded, and won over the Hartford Downtown Council, the Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, the Hartford Graduate Center and Trinity College, among others.
People signed on as volunteers to help organize the forum. "Some were new to the community and just wanted to get involved," said Mrs. Sugarman. "Some were forever looking for something new."
Because the organization was in Mrs. Sugarman's words "very grass roots," ideas were turned into action quickly, "and we all started to feel this was the start of something new and exciting."
Support grew, in part, said Mr. Sugarman, because it was so easy to get involved. "We had people say to us they were not challenged to think in their jobs, to create, to experiment, to use their imagination, their passion. Here they could."
That dare-to-experiment attitude also helped shape the character of the forums. The skepticism brought on by Hartford's economic woes led many longtime residents to think the only panelists they could attract would be local or at best, from elsewhere in Connecticut. But organizers decided to seek out the top experts in their respective fields.
The first forum, held Oct. 16, 1992, was "The Changing Political Landscape," moderated by Lesley Stahl of CBS News. Among those on the panel were Ron Brown, Pat Buchanan, William Proxmire and John Sununu.
Four months later the forum topic was "Straight Talk and Honest Answers About AIDS," which again featured a distinguished panel. One of the panelists, Arthur Ashe, was unable to attend on the advice of his doctors who had just changed his medication, trying to battle his AIDS. In his place, he sent a video he had taped a few days earlier.
At intermission, rumors floated through the theater that Mr. Ashe had died, and a call to The Associated Press revealed that the rumors were true. The announcement was made on stage at the beginning of the second part of the program, and Mr. Sugarman recalled, "There was a lot of collective grieving and a lot of coming together that night."
The experience, Mrs. Sugarman said, "elevated the importance of what we were doing."
The Sugarmans never did want the forums to be simply an alternative to theater, or just another form of entertainment. Bridge building remained their focus. At intermission during the AIDS forum, doctors from the University of Connecticut Medical Center, Hartford Hospital and St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center decided there ought to be a way to work together to provide better treatment for those with H.I.V., the AIDS-causing virus. That led to a collaborative effort to create a common database.
After a forum on race relations -- which included the rap artist Chuck D., William F. Buckley Jr., Dr. Betty Shabazz (the widow of Malcolm X) and the former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates -- a group of high school students wanted to continue the dialogue. As a result, the Connecticut Forum Student Board was created, allowing teen-agers from differing backgrounds and communities to meet monthly at each other's schools to discuss current issues and plan a variety of programs.
A ticket program was developed to insure that the forum draws residents into The Bushnell who could not otherwise afford the admission price.
The most recent outgrowth of a forum is the two-year-old Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame exhibition, which grew out of a panel titled "American Women in Focus . . . Breaking New Ground" with the help of Hartford College for Women, the University of Hartford and Fleet Bank.
Geena Clonan, the executive director of the Hall of Fame and a friend of the Sugarmans who has been involved in the forum since the early days, said the forum's success may stem from its harkening to old New England town meetings, where neighbors would gather to talk about pressing issues of the day.
"It's the same thing the Mayflower Compact was founded on," she said. " It's the whole idea of communicating once again, analyzing problems and solving them."

HEADLINE: Weighing The Ethics Of a Trip

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; SETH MYDANS is chief of the Bangkok bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
A VACATION trip does not commonly require a moral choice, but in the case of Myanmar, the former Burma, there is no way to avoid one.
One of Asia's loveliest and least-traveled nations, Myanmar is in the grip of a military junta that has drawn condemnation from around the world for its suppression of democracy and its abuses of human rights. This month, the junta's problems have increased as campus demonstrations raised the possibility of student unrest spilling onto the streets of Yangon. On Monday, the United States Department of State issued an announcement recommending that "U.S. citizens exercise all due caution in traveling to Burma and should for the time being curtail travel to Burma (Myanmar) absent a compelling reason." 
 In a bid to build tourism and win international legitimacy, the military Government has undertaken an effort to attract visitors by inaugurating Visit Myanmar Year in November. Its opponents are urging tourists to stay away, part of a broader call for an economic boycott. The first major effort by the country in decades to open its doors to the outside world has become a test of the world's attitudes toward it.
Almost the entire leadership of the junta, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, turned out on Nov. 18 for the start of Visit Myanmar Year.
"Today is a red-letter day for tourism in Myanmar," said Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, who is in charge of both tourism development and military intelligence. "We are celebrating not only the launching of Visit Myanmar Year but also our commitment to open our doors to the world."
The moment had been many months in preparation, involving a considerable portion of the country's limited resources. Scores of new hotels have been opened in the capital city of Yangon and other tourist areas. Two new domestic airlines have started service and a new airport arrival hall has been opened in Yangon. Tourist sites have been refurbished and visa procedures eased.
But politically, little has changed, and this year has seen an escalating crackdown on the pro-democracy forces that rally around the country's most popular and charismatic figure, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. It is this behavior that has raised calls for a boycott.
The junta came to power in 1988 following the killings of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators, then clung to power after losing an election in 1990 to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. She herself was held under house arrest for six years until July 1995 and was temporarily put under house arrest again last week after the student demonstrations in the capital.
Since May of this year, the Government has arrested nearly 1,000 of her supporters -- though most have since been set free -- and is now preventing her from making the weekly addresses that had been the country's one forum for free speech.
Just nine days before the start of Visit Myanmar Year, bands of officially sanctioned thugs attacked Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's car in the first act of violence against her. One of her aides was slightly injured.
A year ago, Yozo Yokota, then the human rights investigator in Myanmar for the United Nations, reported that forced labor was being used to refurbish tourist sites like the temple complex at Bagan.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi herself has asked tourists to stay away.
"We are not saying, 'Don't come to Burma forever,' " she said in a recent interview. "What we are saying now at the moment is, 'Boycott Visit Myanmar Year.' And that's not a big thing to ask, you know."
Not everyone agrees. Even some of her supporters abroad argue that visitors will bring much-needed dollars, as well as ideas of freedom and democracy, to the country's people.
"I don't bother about politics," said a Greek tourist on a recent flight into the country. "I have visited many countries with unpleasant Governments. And I think every dollar I spend here will help someone to make a living."
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi rebuts that argument by saying that the main beneficiaries will be the generals, foreign hotel owners and the relatively well-off workers in the tourism industry. And any sacrifice of tourist dollars that the people must make, she says, is a small price to pay to oppose the junta.
But her call for a boycott has given the Government its best propaganda argument against her. In a lust for personal power, it says in newspaper commentaries, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is taking food from the mouths of her fellow citizens.
Even without a boycott, the success of Visit Myanmar Year is far from assured. The country has already scaled back its 12-month target from 500,000 visitors to 250,000.
And it is not even clear that it can accommodate that many. Last year fewer than 100,000 tourists visited Myanmar, according to Government figures. There are fewer than 5,000 seats a week on international flights into the country and, despite the flurry of building, fewer than 3,500 hotel rooms in the capital.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Donald S. Strait;
Redigging the Environmental Trenches

BYLINE: By LAUREN BROWN 

 BODY:
DONALD S. STRAIT, a native of Fairfield County, joined the Connecticut Fund for the Environment in 1990 as legal director and is now its executive director.
A 1981 graduate of Amherst College and a 1986 graduate of Harvard Law School, he returned to his home state after serving as clerk to Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of the Federal District Court in Newark, N.J., and working in New York for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 Founded in 1978, the Connecticut Fund for the Environment combines the tools of the legal profession with knowledge from the scientific community to tackle such issues as clean air and water, pesticide use, wetlands protection and transportation. One project is working out alternatives to the proposed new Route 6 in eastern Connecticut, which, as currently planned, would entail the filling of 55 acres of wetlands. The fund has also intervened to protect inland wetlands in Branford, Cromwell, Middletown and Windsor. Staff lawyers often take legal action to bring polluting businesses and municipalities in line with their state permit limits.
With offices in New Haven, the fund is supported by dues from 3,500 members, individual donations and private foundations.
In a recent interview Mr. Strait discussed the current state of the environment in Connecticut and the fund's work. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How does your strategy differ from that of other environmental organizations in the state?
A. C.F.E. is the only statewide environmental organization that is staffed by lawyers. We don't lobby or go into the schools, and we don't own land. But we are prepared to go to court. We often choose cooperation over a lawsuit and we provide technical information to individuals and communities. So we think of ourselves partly as the legal arm of the environmental movement, but we also help people to understand problems themselves, to get involved and become more effective.

 Q. On the legislative level environmental protection has taken a beating. How do you deal with that?
A. We've been forced to dig the trenches again. In the 1970's and 1980's systems were put in place to deal with traditional environmental problems, like smokestacks and discharge pipes. So in the early 1990's we felt we could focus our attention on some of the tougher issues, like the serious sewage problems in Long Island Sound, contaminated runoff into waterways from pavement and lawns and the effects of traffic congestion. Unfortunately the current political situation has diverted us from these issues by forcing us to fight many of the old battles again. Right now we're working hard just to save protections that have been on the books for decades.

 Q. How about on the regulatory front? Are existing laws being enforced?
A. In Governor Rowland's first year in office, court actions against polluters were slashed by 75 percent. We are very concerned about this because some companies will not obey the law when they know that they won't be punished, even if they are caught.

 Q. Given the poor state of the economy, does it makes sense to ease up on environmental regulations?
A. We don't think it makes sense to allow the environment to got down the drain in order to give a short-term financial break to companies who claim that it will help them. Many environmental laws have encouraged companies to operate more efficiently and thereby save money, which is a benefit to the economy. When illegal pollution is tolerated, responsible companies can be hurt because unscrupulous competitors will lower their costs by dumping illegally

 Q. What are some of your current projects?
A. Here's a neat case. We are representing the Steep Rock Association, a very effective group of citizens in the Washington area who want to save the Shepaug River from its continued degradation by the city of Waterbury.
Waterbury uses the Shepaug river for its water supply. It has, even in the worst droughts, plenty of water yet it refuses to release more than a trickle down the Shepaug in the summer. So the Shepaug is basically killed every year. You can walk across the Shepaug in the summer without getting your feet wet.

 Q. With so many skirmishes going on, how do you choose the issues to become involved in?
A. We struggle with it constantly. Given our small size C.F.E. itself can only take on issues that have statewide significance. Where we can't get involved, we try to help out nevertheless, by providing legal or technical information or by referring the caller to a volunteer attorney who may be interested in helping out.

 Q. What do you consider the most pressing issues today?
A. Obviously, we need to get the state government back on track so that the laws are enforced adequately. Especially in southwestern Connecticut, traffic congestion is choking the air and beginning to change peoples' lives for the worse. Fairfield County has the third-worst smog problem in the nation. It's not that surprising when you look at all the driving that goes on.

 Q. What do you see as solutions to the traffic problem?
A. The first thing to understand is that people don't like sitting in traffic. They don't like the fact that more and more streets are inhospitable to walking because they are overrun with cars and trucks. People do need their mobility, however, and right now people have few choices other than driving their cars to get to work, shop or bring their kids to school.
That's why we think it's important to bring people together to see what approach will work. For example, C.F.E. and others convinced the Connecticut Department of Transportation to withdraw a massive bridge and highway widening proposal in favor of a cooperative process where a broadly representative committee is designing ways to reduce traffic on the Quinnipiac River Bridge. What is so exciting is that ConnDOT has committed to accept the committee's recommendations if they meet certain legal and financial constraints. We hope that the dialogue will result in a plan to reduce traffic on the bridge by improving mass transit instead of widening the bridge.

 Q. What improvements are you hoping for?
A. In mass transit? More train stations, increased frequency of the trains, interceptor parking lots with signs visible from the highway which would tell when the next train is due in.
It would allow people to get off the highway and jump on the train if they see that the bridge traffic is too much for them.

 Q. Can Long Island Sound ever really be cleaned up?
A. In the past decade, a tremendous amount of effort has gone into studying these problems. We now have set of commitments from the states to reverse the decline in the Sound and we've even begun to see some improvements. The question, in this era of cutbacks and suspicion of government programs, is whether the political will is there to follow through. We think the answer will be "yes," but people need to make their voices heard if they don't want their beaches closed and if they do want aquatic life to thrive again.

 Q. Isn't the main problem sewage? Do you think people are willing to spend the billions of dollars required to upgrade treatment plants?
A. The Sound is a regional and even a national treasure and we think that the financial burdens need to be shared by the Federal Government as well as the state and local governments. But yes, I think that if people are faced with a clear choice, and if they have faith that spending the money will get the job done, that they will say "yes." They said yes in Mystic. Voters were faced with either continuing unhealthy discharges from their sewage treatment plant or an expensive upgrade. They chose the upgrade.
Also, it's not billions of dollars or nothing. There are a lot of little things people can do. People can work to save wetlands in their own towns. Wetlands are natural water purifiers which are essential to the health of the Sound. Homeowners can pay attention to how much fertilizer they put on their lawns. People can pump out their septic systems regularly. People should write to their congressmen, write to the governor, say, "The Sound is important to me." People sometimes forget that politicians will listen to them.

Training Brokers for Financial Planning

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
THE needs of today's investor are changing, and so, too, is the brokerage industry. Individuals putting children through college, caring for elderly parents and planning for their retirements -- sometimes all at once -- are seeking comprehensive financial advice.
As a result, the broker as a salesman is being replaced by the broker as financial consultant. As vice chairman of Gruntal & Company, a Manhattan-based investment firm with three Long Island offices, Barry Richter has helped develop a one-year financial education program with the National Endowment of Financial Education, formerly the College for Financial Planning, to train brokers in the widening gamut of investor needs and services. Seventy-five of Gruntal's account executives have completed the course so far, while 125 are currently enrolled.
Mr. Richter graduated from Brooklyn College in 1957 with a degree in economics. He has been with Gruntal since 1960, and has served as vice chairman for several months. Previously, he was executive vice president in charge of branch retail sales.
Mr. Richter and his wife, Fran, are longtime residents of Port Washington. They have three children and one grandchild.
Q. What is the Gruntal Forum of Achievement?
A. We give special privileges to our account executives, or brokers, who've committed themselves to higher education. To qualify, a broker must complete this one-year asset management education course. It's designed to help them recognize the best investment solutions for their clients in various situations. And it teaches them personal financial information that applies directly to their everyday work.
We reward those who complete this program with trips, seminars and other entitlements. But, the additional training also helps them develop more and better business.
Q. You say this concept differs from the current Wall Street mentality?
A. Yes, it's very different. We want people who've already reached certain goals, like getting their broker's license, to continue their education so they can understand the wide array of investment opportunities that are out there. We want them to do this before they've put in the 20 years it can take to learn these things on the job. But, to do it, they need to take a course.
Q. What is the curriculum?
A. It goes through a gamut from birth to death. There are estate plans, wills and trusts, old age care, insurance, real estate investments, derivatives, options, regular stocks and bonds, and more.
Naturally, as someone gets older and his friends get older, he'll start looking at planning for his will and his estate. But how do you focus on that early? And, it needs to be done early, unless you don't mind if most of your estate goes to Uncle Sam when you die.
That's why we developed this program, to teach our brokers to recognize these things. And we designed it to be different from Wall Street, in that our brokers are rewarded, not for the sales they make, but for this enhanced education, which lets them deal with clients at a higher level.
Q. What do you want your brokers to learn from this?
A. Most importantly, I want them to know they may not be the ones suited to handle everything. Wall Street firms traditionally tell their clients they should give them all their assets, because they have the legal department over here and the insurance department over there -- everything's under one roof. The client gets sort of locked into it, because the firm has developed a plan for him. That's not what we're doing.
I feel quite strongly that some of these services should be done by accountants, lawyers, insurance brokers and others. It benefits our clients to know that the person they entrust with most of their money knows enough to say: "There are other things to do and other directions to go. If you really want what's best for you, it's time to see your lawyer, your accountant, etc."
And, contrary to a lot of firms, we feel financial planning should not be a pre-packaged, one-size-fits-all concept. People are simply too different.
Q. How have clients' needs changed?
A. The client's needs have changed dramatically as the availability of information has gotten faster and faster. Newspapers are filled with information about every subject that we discuss as asset managers.
As a result, people have become informed, to a much greater degree, about a variety of financial subjects. Now, they need someone to help them disseminate all of this information and bring the focus back to the individual, because the media sweeps the masses.
I think a lot of Wall Street firms want to be supermarkets to the world and really package their own "home" label -- their own mutual funds, their own products, and so on. I don't think that's the way to go. Brokers should be encouraged to choose what they believe is best, not what management wants them to sell. That's why we have no proprietary products.
Q. Who needs a financial plan?
A. Everyone needs some planning. You have to know where you're going with regard to business, family, etc. Part of that is being concerned with your current expenses -- your budget, schooling for the children, a home, vacations, etc. But part of it is also knowing how you're going to fund the future. The extent to which you want to deal with the future now is the extent to which you may need certain planning aids.
Do you need a financial plan? It depends. As you budget your life, do you need a printed budget? Some people do. People who need a graphic, didactic displays of information probably should have a plan. For those whose plan is not financial, but rather about the derivative benefits they're going to get out of their lives, they may just need someone to direct them to the help they need.
Q. What about people of different financial means. Do some need planning more than others?
A. Again, it's a very individual thing. Sometimes, the role of a financial consultant is simply to help an individual organize his or her financial affairs. In this case, yearly tax returns, monthly investment statements, insurance policies and other financial information are stitched together to form a more coherent picture of the individual's current and prospective financial condition.
In other cases, it's not so easy. An individual must scale back on his financial goals or assume a greater investment risk to achieve them.
Q. What do people most often overlook when planning their finances?
A. They tend to overlook the practical reality of the day. When you make a plan, you must keep in mind both realism and need. And, as people are different, so are their needs. Everyone should be aware of their existence budget -- their weekly, monthly and yearly budgets. They should also have a contingency budget. Then they can see what is extra. They should know if they can realistically afford to go to Hawaii for two weeks, or if they'll barely make a weekend in the Poconos.
If you have money beyond your day-to-day living expenses and want to build for the future, you may want to make a plan. But, I firmly believe that, whatever you do, you should not be going to one person and saying, "Here's my money -- you handle it." You may need certain newspapers or magazines. You might need a friend, a lawyer, or a consultant. You might have a broker who is really terrific and who can suggest some good investments, but you wouldn't go to that broker and say, "I have an invalid mother to care for, what should I do?", unless you have enough faith that he's informed enough to direct you to the right people.
Q. Wall Street firms have been doing a great deal marketing to the baby boomer generation in the belief that these people are the least prepared for their retirement years. Is this a target group of yours?
A. No, and I think that assumption is unrealistic. Baby boomers get the same education in reality as everyone else, and they come to recognize what they have to do. Q. How would you advise people when choosing a financial consultant?
A. It requires a lot of care, the same kind of care you'd use in selecting anyone who will be an important part of your life. How do you pick your doctor, lawyer, accountant? You do a little research. Word of mouth is certainly one way of doing this. Try to get recommendations from a friend or someone you respect. Then, go meet with the adviser and see if there is chemistry there. Do you feel comfortable with this person? Do you feel he understands you? Can you trust him, because trust is really essential? If you can answer yes to these questions, I'd be inclined to go with that person. But, you should also make sure the individual is working out of a reputable firm. And years of experience are very important.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Architecture of Light and Remembrance

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
NEVER FORGET. BUT THERE IS A GREAT deal more than the Holocaust to remember. There is creativity: the blazing talent of 20th-century Jews, the inspiration of a people marked for extinction but not destroyed. And there is remembrance itself: the capacity of a culture to bring itself to mind. Memory, creativity: the linkage of these two ideas is the cornerstone of the Skirball Cultural Center, a museum and study center that opened in April in Los Angeles.
Designed by Moshe Safdie, the Skirball Center lies on a stretch of hilly ground beside the San Diego Freeway, halfway between the city's west side and the sprawling San Fernando Valley. Viewed from the road, the Skirball is not an easy building to decipher. It looks new. It looks old. Its walls of concrete, pink stone and steel send out a contradictory message: the building wants at once to blend into this rugged desert terrain and to attract notice. Gabled roofs echo the line of the hills above. A delicately dirty bloom on the surface of the concrete makes the walls look like old stone. Steel panels reflect the sky, dissolving sections of solid wall into framed pictures of light and space. 
 It is also apparent, even from a passing car, that the Skirball is a piece of modern architecture. It is assertive. It stands out. It grabs the eye with crisp, geometric forms of concrete and steel that catch the light. In a synthesis of modes at once strong and pliant, the Skirball announces: "Hey, there, I'm a good neighbor! And, by the way, I'm here! Pull in and see me sometime."
If you do pull in, prepare to toss negativity by the roadside. Under the direction of Uri D. Herscher, the Skirball's spirit of optimism is opulent to the point of contagion. Without diminishing the meaning or magnitude of the Holocaust, the place gathers rays of light that have penetrated through a dark century.
Distributed over a 15-acre campus, the Skirball includes a library, an auditorium, galleries and outdoor meeting places. (It was named for Jack and Audrey Skirball, major benefactors of the $90 million project.) But its core is "Visions and Values," a lesson on how to connect the eye to heart and mind. The permanent exhibition, organized by Robert Kirschner and Nancy Berman, traces 5,000 years of Jewish history, but focuses on Jewish life in 20th-century America. Anchored by a three-quarter scale replica of the Statue of Liberty's torch, the displays include a recreated kitchen from a Lower East Side tenement, a newsstand stocked with Jewish-American publications and garments by America's greatest clothing designer, Levi Strauss. The show culminates in a kaleidoscopic audiovisual presentation of achievements by writers, scientists, artists, social workers, politicians, media moguls and financiers. Building on the idea that the power to create is stronger than the will to destroy, the display adds up to the stunning proposition that the 20th century has been nothing less than a golden age of Jewish achievement.
In architecture, the point is beyond argument. This art has produced an unprecedented flowering of Jewish talent in recent years. A generation ago, Louis I. Kahn stood out not only because of his towering genius but because he worked in a profession largely dominated by the Protestant establishment. Today, Jewish architects lead the field. Besides Safdie, their ranks include Frank Gehry, Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, Denise Scott Brown, James Ingo Freed, Stanley Tigerman Robert A. M. Stern and Eric Owen Moss. Esthetically and ideologically, this group spans a wide spectrum: from the boldly inventive forms of Gehry to the cartoon classicism of Stern, from the intellectually inquisitive designs of Eisenman and Scott Brown, to the evolutionary approach to modern architecture conducted with integrity by Meier and Freed.
Is this worth comment? There is a mine field full of reasons not to. To talk about Jews in the arts -- or, for that matter, in the media, finance, psychiatry and many other fields -- is to risk echoing anti-Semitic ravings about Zionist conspiracies. Every salute to Jewish achievement carries with it the danger of buttressing the paranoia of nut cases, as well as the discreet bigotry of polite society. Jewish contributions to the arts have long been subject to nudge-nudge, wink-winking. What was it Nixon said on those tapes? "The arts, you know -- they're Jews, they're left-wing. In other words, stay away." Shocking! But the wink-wink goes on.
Then, too, there is the risk that by talking about the particularity of any artist's background, the universality of the art is compromised. This risk has long been faced (or skirted) by critics. Forty years ago, when Abstract Expressionism was at its peak, to examine the potentially Jewish dimension in the work of Barnett Newman or Mark Rothko was to risk courting the kind of philistine reaction that ultimately surfaced in the ridiculing term "Cultureburg," coined by Tom Wolfe in his 1975 book, "The Painted Word."
There is also the fatally blase response: isn't this old news? Jewish accomplishments have long been acknowledged. Respectful silence is taken as a healthy sign of democracy's capacity to assimilate. So what is the point of making an issue of their impact? Well, why should the Skirball Center exist?
The skirball exists because the experience of Jews in America has much in common with the experience of most Americans. The particular is the universal; or rather, American cultural vitality stems from the impulse to negotiate between individual and collective experience. Culture here, to borrow Peter Gay's description of Weimar Germany, reflects the paradox that the outsider is an insider. Art is not dispensed from high to low in a fixed hierarchy. It erupts from self-invention as individuals and groups make a place for themselves on democracy's common and constantly shifting ground.
How could the story not have major implications for architecture, historically the art most directly engaged with distinguishing inside from outside? Land, shelter, stability, the impulse to find a place to stand, the envisioning of relationships between public and private realms: these are among architecture's essentials. So, to flip the coin, is the impulse to exclude, to be superior: the gated community, the restricted club. Architecture has been the gentleman's art, the vaguely creative WASP profession, the classical column raised as the barricade against undesirables. The emergence of Jewish-American architects pertains to both sides of the coin. To the extent that architecture has been an establishment art, the experience of Jewish architects differs from that of Jewish painters, writers and composers. They are insiders, blessed with the opportunity to describe outsider experience in the medium of the consummate insider art.
Louis Kahn was revered not just for his architecture but also for the reverence in which he held architecture -- and his fearlessness in saying so in words that often sounded biblical. "The beginning of any work must start from Belief," he wrote. "I distrust competitions because the design is unlikely to stem from Belief, which is of religious essence out of a commonness sensed from other men."
There is nothing specifically Jewish about his references to religion and belief; his inspirations included Christian monasteries and pagan temples. The architectural historian David G. De Long wrote, for Kahn, "places of meeting shared essential qualities that rendered differences between secular and religious use secondary in importance." This is not to say that Kahn promoted secular ideas at the expense of religious ones. His designs, whether for a synagogue, a church, a government assembly or a laboratory, came from a negotiation between secular and religious spheres. He conducted that negotiation in the context of an increasingly secular society. Indeed, his power lay in the vigor with which he resisted that context while flourishing within it. Jews are not the only people who have struggled with this problem. But Jewish identity has often hinged on the capacity to negotiate: for a place to stand, the right to dignity, the freedom to be.
On a tour of the Skirball last spring, I asked Safdie whether there was anything explicitly Jewish about its design. He answered that there was no historical "Jewish" style comparable to classical, Gothic or Moorish styles. Jewish architects, rather, worked within building traditions indigenous to the places where they settled. Nonetheless, in designing the Skirball, he said, he had in mind the image of a garden. Jews, Safdie said, were the first people to imagine a paradise on earth. His verdant image will become clearer as foliage covers the trellises over walkways connecting parts of the campus. Already the cluster of buildings resembles an encampment around an oasis.
Though Sepulveda Pass lies in the middle of Los Angeles, it is not a developed urban place. Coyotes are out there somewhere. Sagebrush barely holds the hills together. Even if the Skirball had not been designed by an Israeli, its surroundings would recall the terrain of Israel. In Los Angeles terms, of course, the pass is brilliantly urban: the freeway represents urbanity here more than buildings do. As the cars stream by they seem more deeply rooted than the Skirball. Not in space but in meaning: the city's mobile sense of place.
A generation ago, Jews were American architecture's most enlightened patrons. Now they are its most gifted practitioners too. The Roman Catholic Church recently confirmed this view. In honor of the forthcoming Jubilee Year, the Vatican organized a competition to design a Church for the Year 2000. The six finalists (the projects go on view on Friday at the Urban Center in New York, 457 Madison Avenue at 51st Street) included three Americans: Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry and Richard Meier, who won the commission.
 
Richard Meier
Wrestling With The Symbolic
 "I do not think that anyone realizes the novelty of this," the architectural historian Bruno Zevi wrote about Meier's commission in the Italian journal L'Architettura: "You must remember that for centuries and millenniums the Jews were defined, at best, as faithless. They were accused of murder, of procuring the death of the symbol of humanity, of the Son of the Father, of the Son of God.
"Until the day upon which a Pope, motivated by a universal vision without precedents, decided to accomplish an unforseeable, unheard-of, epochal act. He decided to call the head rabbi of the Jewish people and asked permission to be received at the synagogue, in order to resume contact with his, he said, 'higher brothers.' The rabbi responded, 'Welcome.' "
A reconciliation is under way in Meier's design, too: an agreeable encounter between the formalist esthetic for which he is known and the symbolic language that modernists like Meier once so sternly rejected. The church is to be built in a working-class district near Rome, amid high-rise housing blocks. It will rise in an open space between two blocks, a passage that leads from fields to the main shopping street. Philosophically, the idea descends from Bernini's grand colonnade at St. Peter's, the arms of mother church reaching out to embrace the world.
The building's major formal gesture consists of three curving walls that rise to enfold the chapel. Skylights catch the light and diffuse it into the sanctuary below. Curves like these are unprecedented in Meier's work. So is the symbolism the walls represent. Clearly they stand for the Christian Trinity, but Meier is not likely to spell out that meaning. He is a formalist, committed to abstraction. For him to acknowledge a symbolic meaning is to commit an esthetic taboo, akin to uttering the unmentionable name of God. He would rather acknowledge his indebtedness to Alvar Aalto than confess: these walls stand for Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
This taboo is worth pausing over. In "Iconophobia," published in a 1981 collection of essays, Kenneth Clark drew a parallel between abstract painting and the Hebraic prohibition against representation. The comparison was insightful but undeveloped: Clark does not acknowledge that the impulse to shroud or blur meanings may be universal. Esthetic formalism, it should be recalled, emerged in part in an ecumenical spirit, in the belief that pure forms could transcend differences implicit in content.
In 1963, Meier organized a show on synagogue architecture at the Jewish Museum in New York. It was remarkable not just because of the caliber and variety of the designs but because it represented a rare instance in this century when an intelligent effort was made to link architectural and religious values. A Kahn drawing of his design for the unbuilt Mikveh Israel appeared on the catalogue cover, and the show itself can be seen as a tribute to the spiritual aura Kahn brought to his field. Reading the catalogue today, you can see that the architects were struggling with something momentous: the desire to free themselves from 19th-century forms and attitudes while retaining the historical idea that architecture is a sacred calling.
It's extraordinary that Meier is wrestling, perhaps for the first time in his career, with issues raised by his show 33 years ago. The church is his first explicitly religious building. Admirers of Meier's work are aware that his passions for whiteness, light, clarity and openness are in themselves spiritually symbolic. Those qualities are in full evidence here but informed by his awareness of iconography and its historical value. The result is a knowing negotiation between modern formalism and the metaphoric approach that historically preceded it. It reflects a desire for something more than esthetics to fill the void left by religion's withdrawal from a secular society.
 
Peter Eisenman
Raising a Question For Every Answer
 In his 1966 book "Frank Lloyd Wright: A Study in Architectural Content," Norris Kelly Smith characterized Jewish thought as dynamic, vigorous, passionate; classical thought, by contrast, was static, moderate and harmonious. The distinction is worth recalling: you don't have to be Jewish to engage in what Smith regarded as "Jewish thought." Wright, raised as a Unitarian, expressed it with the open floor plan, the pinwheeling interiors of prairie houses, the impulse to flee the city for new horizons.
At least in his contempt for classicism, Peter Eisenman is a match for Wright. Earlier this year, he was commissioned to design a Jewish Museum for San Francisco. Housed in an old power plant opposite Yerba Buena Gardens, the museum will take its place among the complex of museums and performance spaces that have sprung up around the Moscone Convention Center south of Market Street. As a renovation, the Jewish museum may not offer the creative scope he enjoyed in projects like the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio, and the Aronoff Center in Cincinnati yet he has approached the project with the same inquisitive vigor.
In a proposal that helped him gain the commission, he wrote: "It has been said of the Talmud that rather than having an answer for every question, Jewish culture and identity has a question for every answer. The question is asked, Is God good? Instead of providing the answer, the book gives no answer. Rather, it is a catalogue of the debate. The answer is the debate, the argument itself."
Eisenman's design, still in development, uses two strategies to turn the museum into a visual and spatial equivalent of this Talmudic tradition. The first visualizes the project not as a building but as an urban passage linking Market Street to Yerba Buena Gardens. This, in effect will stretch the architecture outside the building envelope. Pedestrians will be drawn through a warped Eisenman environment whether or not they intend to enter the building.
The second device is an electronic facade, an enormous screen at the rear of the power plant, that will physically upstage it. The screen can be programmed as curators see fit: coverage of chess tournaments, news from the Middle East, sacred objects from the collection, a visitor's search through cyberspace for events in Jewish history.
Layers of meaning overlap here. One is the juxtaposition of two kinds of power: the industrial model, represented by the power station, and its displacement by the information economy. Another reflects San Francisco's leadership in communications technology. Finally, the screen reflects the degree to which members of the information society have become electronic nomads, not unlike "wandering Jews," surfing the net for fragments of meaning and place.
 
Frank Gehry
A Bump and a Bow Into History
The liberation of Czechoslovakia from a totalitarian regime called for symbols. The most potent of these was the election of a dissident artist, Vaclav Havel, as political leader. Another was the choice of Frank Gehry to design a new building for a prominent riverfront location in the center of Prague. Though commissioned by a private firm, a Dutch insurance company, the building nonetheless held civic importance. Havel, as it happened, lived in the building next to the site. His support was instrumental in gaining approval for a new and somewhat rambunctious addition to one of the world's most beautiful cities.
The building, completed in May, has come to be known as Fred and Ginger -- Gehry's nickname, derived from the building's two towers, one of masonry, the other of glass with a pinch in its side. To me, though, it recalls a number Astaire performed with Rita Hayworth to the tune of "I'm Old-Fashioned" in the 1942 film "You Were Never Lovelier." The couple bump into each other while trying to pass through a doorway, then bow with exaggerated courtesy. A lot of bumping and bowing is occurring as this startlingly contemporary building tries to enter into the city's history.
The basic elements of Gehry's design -- corner towers with ornamental crown, window proportions, decorative moldings on the plaster facade -- derive from local traditions, but they are nudged into the contemporary poise of controlled disarray. Windows are staggered; moldings wave across the facade, as if of independent mind from the structure they animate; the dome atop Fred is woven of steel mesh strips.
The Czechs loathed the figuration implied by the name Fred and Ginger -- they'd had their fill of representational art in the years of Soviet domination -- so it is worth noting that Gehry had no intention of creating an oversize kitsch Hollywood figurine. The pinch was made to frame the view of Prague Castle. Still, the spirit of dance conjured by Gehry's nickname is apt: formal but breezy, deferential to the occasion but fancy-free. Gehry would be the last to deny that figuration plays a part in his architecture. The fish form that often occurs in his designs is derived in part from a childhood nickname. But it also represents something elusive: the right to assert an identity, the right to wriggle free from the identity imposed by others.
In these projects, the negotiation is not between a particular and a universal but between two universals -- one social, the other religious -- that coexist. One is what Kahn called "the commonness between men." The other is the relationship between people and the idea of transcendence. The social being has good reason to be wary of the religious; that wariness is called tolerance. The religious being is right to be wary of the social; that wariness is part of faith. Contemporary architecture is one of many forms in which people of different faiths reckon with the line between them.

Restoring Derelict Houses in Irvington, and Repairing Lives

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
The abandoned two-story house at 319 Olympic Terrace in Irvington had been an eyesore on one of the better-kept blocks of this crowded Essex County town of 61,000 on Newark's northern boundary. But a pair of ex-convicts turned nonprofit developers have purchased the house, and another nearby, from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a crew is now fixing it up for resale.
Harvey George and Richard Hochman are lifelong friends who served time together at East Jersey State Prison on convictions as accessories to murder. After their release they founded the Friends of the Lifers Youth Corporation in 1992 as a non-profit counseling and hunger-relief agency and later moved into housing development. It is an extension of the Lifers Group, a program in which prisoners bluntly counseled teen-agers, which was depicted in the documentary "Scared Straight." 
 An Irvington councilman, Brian E. Coleman, has proposed that the town sell Mr. Hochman, 51, of Toms River, and Mr. George, 52, of Jersey City, abandoned houses for $1 each in a long-term rehabilitation effort that would train and employ local residents. The two men spoke recently outside the house on Olympic Terrace.
Q. How do you do your rehabs? A. HOCHMAN We get a HUD list every two weeks and then determine which ones are best suited for us, something that we can rehabilitate at an affordable price then turn it around and sell it as affordable housing. The lowest price I've paid for a house is $2,500 and the highest is $57,000. Roughly, it costs about $40,000 per house to rehabilitate. We sell them at 10 percent above the net cost that we produce the house at.
Q. Who works on the houses? A. HOCHMAN Contractors, and they have a deal with us where they have to hire one nonskilled person who is unemployed, from the community and one skilled person who is unemployed, from the community. And they come from a pool of people that we interview.
Q. What brought you to Irvington?
A. HOCHMAN My halfway house was in Irvington. When I saw the HUD list and there were two houses in Irvington for sale I jumped on the houses. Because the town of Irvington says to Richard Hochman: Freedom. It was unbelievable. After 15 years of prison, to be free.
Q. Does "Scared Straight" lend you credibility?
A. HOCHMAN I'm in Irvington trying to get permits so we can get the building going, and these clerks are giving me a hard time. I lose my temper and say, "I'm done with this, I'm leaving Irvington." I bump into a guy in a suit [Mr. Coleman] coming out of the town clerk's office and I ask him, "Can you help me?" He says, "Well, I have a meeting in a minute. What's this all about?" I said, 'We originally had a program in prison called Scared Straight . . . " He puts his hand on my shoulder and says, "Just hold on one minute." He runs down the hall, cancels whatever meeting he's going to, comes back and says, "I want to tell you something. My friends and I went through Scared Straight. I wasn't a bad kid, but it straightened out some of my friends who were real troublemakers. I'll do anything I can to help you." He walks me through, gets me everything I need.
Q. If someone had told you what the contracting business was really like, would you have stayed out of it?
A. GEORGE If I'd have had a contractor who ran his own Scared Straight program, and he's saying, "This is what it's like! You better look out!" I'd have said, "Oh, no, I don't want to be no contractor!" STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: When the Offspring Raise Their Children in the Family Home

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO

 BODY:
WHEN their house needed a new exterior paint job, Ginny Cousins approached her husband, Peter, to discuss which color they should consider. Her question was met with incredulity. The house, Mr. Cousins said patiently to his wife, was red, had always been red and would always be red.
It is not that Peter Cousins is an old curmudgeon at the age of 40, or a particularly stubborn man. It is just that his family lives in the house in which he himself grew up as a child, and certain things -- including the color of the house -- are simply traditions. 
 The Cousins are among those who defy the adage "you can't go home again." Many people have done just that and quite literally -- tucking their children in at night in their own former bedrooms, watching them climb on the very same trees and skin the very same places on their knees.
Though housing authorities do not keep official statistics on adults who return to their childhood homes, experts on history and housing patterns say that the trend is, for the most part, economically motivated. In many cases, the older generation wants to retire and move, while the younger one is ready to set up housekeeping. But with the enormous rise in the cost of housing -- particularly in places like Westchester, with its limited housing stock, easy commuting and natural beauty -- many couples cannot afford to live in the communities in which they were raised.
"Everyone used to be expected to do better economically than their parents, and in the last generation you wouldn't want to move back to your parents' house, because it was smaller," said Kenneth T. Jackson, chairman of the history department at Columbia University and a Mount Kisco resident. "But now we live in a completely different and much tougher world. The whole formula has changed. People growing up in areas like Westchester County, especially in places like Chappaqua, Katonah and Scarsdale, can only hope to do as well."
In a move that makes financial sense and also offers sentimental rewards, some young adults have rented or bought homes from their own parents, often at bargains. The older generation reaps the benefits both of keeping the house in the family and offering their children and grandchildren the advantages that they themselves enjoyed. The younger generation garners affordable housing and a profound sense of deja vu.
"It's a complete replay of history," said John Truslow, who lives in his childhood home in Chappaqua with his wife and three children. (Mr. Truslow pays rent to his parents, who retired to South Carolina, but he will ultimately inherit the house.) "My oldest son, Steve, lives in the room I lived in. When I took him to elementary school, I could see myself walking through the halls as a 5-year-old. It's like reliving your childhood through a different perspective." Mr. Cousins, too, said that re-entering his old elementary school building -- this time as a parent -- catapulted him back in time.
"It was one enormous flashback," Mr. Cousins said, when he first took his son Robert to Roaring Brook Elementary School in Chappaqua. "I could remember my first day at kindergarten, the nervous feelings, the cinder block walls. A few of the same teachers were there. But it has been so neat for me to be able to tell the boys my experiences there."
Sometimes, memories come at unexpected times. Several weeks ago, during a violent rainstorm, Christine Ferguson Donaldson, 38, who lives with her children in her childhood home here in Mount Kisco, was told by her 8-year-old daughter that the ceiling was leaking.
"I looked up at the leak, and said, 'Son of a gun, that's the same place where the stupid ceiling leaked on Christmas when I was 5 years old,"' Ms. Donaldson said. Some time before that, her son had come running in from playing outside, announcing that he had found the perfect spot to build a fort. Sure enough, it was the same spot that Ms. Donaldson had used as a fort about 30 years earlier with her girlfriend down the street.
Such moments bring reassurance and a sense of peace to those who are back home, they say. The word "comfortable" was most commonly used to describe the feeling. Such a reaction is not surprising to those who have had happy childhoods in their homes, experts say.
"When you lived in that house, and the wallpaper or the furniture or other surroundings are associated with a positive feeling, then when you're put back in that situation, it will evoke that emotion," said Linda Bastone, assistant professor of psychology at Purchase College. "It's familiar and it's comfortable, although that comfort may not be of your own doing."
Dr. Bastone said that those who have chosen to move back home are a select group who probably have good relationships with their parents and positive feelings about their childhood experiences.
"There are tons of people making the opposite choice," Dr. Bastone said. "For many people living in the home would be almost synonymous with living with the parent, and for them it would not be this pleasant experience, and anything short of dire circumstances would prevent it."
Even when it is positive, the dynamic can be a curious one. Mr. Truslow reported that moving into his parent's bedroom was "pretty strange at first." And when the older generation comes back to visit, there is a peculiar sensation about putting one's parents in their old guest room. "I don't know if my father is comfortable being there and not being lord of the manor," Mr. Cousins said.
The situation does afford an intriguing mix of the old and the new. Mr. Cousins was not alone when he wanted to keep the house its original color -- change can be a tricky thing when the status quo is steeped in childhood memories. At the Truslows, the Christmas tree is placed where it has always been placed. Ms. Donaldson said that when her fiance wanted to move some telephone books, she responded. "No! Why? They've been here all my life. Why would we move them? How would I find them?"
When things are changed, it can be traumatic for the older generation. Some spouses reported that their in-laws noted new curtains, rearranged rooms and felled trees with suspicion and general disapproval, leaving the younger generation with the feeling that the house was not truly their own. For others, the experience has been more benign.
"One thing that appalled my mother-in-law was that we used the living room all the time, but they had never used it and the children couldn't go in there," Glenda Truslow said. "But in the last two years when she has come back, she has said, 'Oh, I wish I would have used this room.' "
Tom Trotta, 44, managed the ultimate combination of old and new -- he bought the Mount Kisco house that he and his seven siblings were raised in, had it torn down and then built his own house on the same property -- a stunning piece of land overlooking the Kisco River. While his children attend the same school, crawl on the same rocks and swim in the same swimming hole as he did, they live in a house that Mr. Trotta describes as "everything I ever wanted." He said his house was "10 times bigger" than the old one, with 5 full bathrooms as opposed to the one his large family used to share.
"The anticipation of tearing down the old house was terrible," Mr. Trotta said. "But the reality was not so bad. If my mother was alive to see the house here now, she'd have gladly done it herself."
One might think someone who razed his childhood home would not be sentimental, but when Mr. Trotta's wife, Bonnie, wanted to have a tree cut down, he would not allow it -- that was the tree where his childhood swing had hung.
The person who has probably seen the most change from the windows of his childhood home is Robert Hochhauser, 75, who lives in the Hartsdale house his parents bought in 1917. Mr. Hochhauser and his brother and sister attended public school in a building that held eight grades, with several classes sharing a room. It was a town where everyone knew one another, and mail would arrive simply with the family name and "Hartsdale, New York," as the address.
Mr. Hochhauser left home to attend college and went to work for the United Nations, living in China for several years, and then on to a 30-year career with Ciba-Geigy. He never married, living with his parents until they died, and then staying on. He said the house has been modernized but "basically looks exactly the same" as it did 70 years ago.
"Over the years, I'd go off and I'd come back," Mr. Hochhauser said. "But this has always been home to me. This is my headquarters."

HEADLINE: The Mood For Merchants Is Still Optimistic

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE jobless rate moved upward, the highest in the last four months, and Wall Street may have a bad case of the jitters, but all that appears to be having little impact on Christmas shoppers. Like Kenneth Mendez last weekend who left Victoria's Secret here laden with gifts, many people this holiday season are optimistic and untroubled by the economic indicators. And they are spending accordingly.
"As far as I'm concerned, things couldn't be better," said Mr. Mendez, an electronics technician from the Bronx who was shopping at the Galleria mall. "Maybe it's because I have a better job this year, but from my point of view everything is wonderful." 
 Farther north in the county, concerns about the economy were also taking a back seat to the holiday spirit. Especially at the Mount Kisco Book Company, which last week reopened for business 11 days after a fire, the mood was decidedly upbeat.
"They're calling us the Miracle on Moger Avenue," said Irwin Hersch, the owner, who opened in another location on the same street. Three stores, including the bookstore, were gutted by the fire on Nov. 25, and it took 200 firefighters more than 15 hours to put out the flames
 which were most likely caused by malfunctions in electrical equipment, authorities said.
"Our shelves may be a little sparse, but everyone's spirit is full," Mr. Hersch said. "Even though we have lost some steam for Christmas, this is turning out to be a real live story with a happy ending."
At Arise Futon, less than a mile from the bookstore, Bernard Berch, the owner, was also filled with the holiday spirit -- especially since business there, as elsewhere, was better than ever. "Futons are literally flying out of the store," Mr. Berch said. "We're selling samples off the floor." He said many of his customers were preparing for an onslaught of house guests over the holidays.
The increased consumer confidence and generous holiday spirit on the part of buyers are greatly welcomed by merchants this year, especially after the dismal Christmas of 1995.
And though there are five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, merchants are optimistic that sales will far surpass previous seasons.
Thanksgiving spending, as an early indication, was up 3.6 percent this year after a 2.7 percent increase in 1995, according to data compiled by Telecheck Services in Houston.
Even more heartening, the sales pace begun early in the season has continued, the check-acceptance company reported on Tuesday. Mr. Mendez, who was shopping at Victoria's Secret here, is apparently typical of buyers throughout the country.
"Consumers are more confident this year; incomes are up and more people have jobs, which should result in an improved retail picture this holiday season," said William Ford, Telecheck's senior economic adviser.
Mr. Ford also said that aggressive merchandisers, worried about this year's shortened season, deserve at least some of the credit for robust activity at the cash registers.
Consumers are being lured into stores with sales promotions and heavy advertising, and Macy's at the Galleria here was a case in point last weekend. Signs announcing deep discounts -- in some cases up to 50 percent -- were prominently displayed throughout the department store.
The chain also got a jump on the shorter holiday season on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, featuring a one-day sale, which drew shoppers into the mall in advance of Black Friday, which is considered the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and is known as such because retailers hope that strong sales will result in black ink on their balance sheets. Those three shopping days over the Thanksgiving weekend are considered a barometer of the season to follow, even though that weekend usually represents less than 10 percent of all sales tallied before Dec. 25.
The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade organization in Manhattan, reported that mall sales increased by 11.9 percent over that critical period, according to a national sample of 57 malls. By contrast, last year's sales, figured on a square-foot basis, were flat over the three-day weekend, compared with 1994.
"Although it is not likely that sales will remain in double digits for the season, this was an outstanding start," said John Konarski, vice president of research for the shopping center group. "It was the best three-day weekend since we began tracking mall sales in 1993."
Despite Mr. Konarski's early concern that the momentum might not last, sales activity has continued at a strong pace, building each day as Christmas nears, with the 10-day period after Thanksgiving showing a 17.4 percent increase. But the increase over last year for the entire period is projected at significantly less because of the shorter shopping season.
"In other words, this year's 10-day selling period is 5 days closer to Christmas than it was last year," Mr. Konarski said. "That makes a huge difference. Our research shows that sales increase incrementally as you get closer to Dec. 25, so right now we have strong comparisons. At the end of the season, when the 5 fewer days are factored in, we expect to see gains of between 4 percent and 5 percent as projected."
To date, the strongest showing for sales has been in jewelry, up 16.6 percent over last year; food, which gained 14.3 percent, and footwear, up 14.2 percent.
Cards, gifts and books were up 11.5 percent. Miscellaneous, which includes personal-care and toy stores, was up 13.9 percent. And the category that includes music, entertainment and software rose 8.9 percent, according to the council, which represents 32,000 members in 60 countries.
While many stores have been crowded with holiday shoppers, there appears also to be a down side to all of the activity. At Kay-Bee Toys in the Galleria, for example, frustration abounded because early shoppers had cleared the shelves of this season's hottest item for children -- a Tickle Me Elmo doll from Sesame Street, which laughs and vibrates when its $29.99 tummy is tickled.
"Forget it!" cried Lena Shkreli, one of the disappointed shoppers. "Elmo is nowhere to be found."
So Mrs. Shkreli, who drove up from the Bronx, reluctantly settled for a teacher Barbie doll and other assorted toys for the 18 nieces, nephews and other children on her shopping list.
But the Barbie doll may not have been a poor second choice, said a Santa Claus at The Westchester here. He said, "Barbies were hot" as always, along with Star Wars toys, remote-control cars and videos for the boys.
"Some things," he said, "never change." And Santa Claus, of all people, should know. The line of children waiting to see him snaked through the mall, as his fans waited to share their wishes for Christmas.
Not to be left out of the merriment, the White Plains Parking Authority announced over the Thanksgiving weekend that it would offer two free hours of holiday parking to shoppers at selected locations from Tuesday through Christmas Eve. Albert T. Moroni, executive director of the Parking Authority, said the purpose was to lure shoppers to smaller stores along Mamaroneck Avenue, which often have a difficult time competing with malls. Shoppers should look for red bags labeled "Happy Holidays" on the free meters.
All of the positive signs notwithstanding, Harold E. Vogt, chief executive officer of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce, expressed worry that the troubling economic indicators may yet dampen the shopping ardor, which to date has been part of the holiday season.
"Yes, the initial push of Thanksgiving has been strong," he said. "But the question is whether that will hold up. The unemployment figures could in the last week send the wrong message to consumers."
At least in parts of the Northeast, there may be cause for concern. Telecheck reported that while sales were up nationally, the Northeast region overall had lagged behind the rest of the country.

HEADLINE: Backing Up Santa at the Post Office

BYLINE: By JACKIE FITZPATRICK 

 BODY:
Dear Santa Claus, I'm almost 10 years old. I have two brothers. I am very good with my Mom. I help her and take care of my baby brother. Santa, I know you are just like God. I know you could do miracles. I've been very, very good. And all I want for Christmas is happiness and to be with my family. Santa, I want you to make the best Christmas for my Mom. She needs it because she is the best Mom in the whole world. My Mom is very sad and if she is sad, I can't be happy. She takes care of me, my brother and my baby brother and her mentally retarded brother. She is the only thing we have. I don't know where my father is. He left us. My Mom has to take care of us by herself. So please Santa, make my wish come true. Make my Mommy happy for Christmas.
The letters are simply addressed "Santa Claus, North Pole," handwritten in pencil or pen. Inside the envelope are their wishes, grand and small. One child asks Santa for an Easy Bake oven, another for a bike, but many of the children whose letters pour into the Bridgeport Post Office ask for other things: health for a father who is dying, warm blankets for little brothers and sisters, a coat, a Christmas tree. 
 The letters are answered. They get responses because of the generosity of postal workers and of other volunteers in the Bridgeport area and because of the concerns of two postal employees in particular: Doug Carey and Nancy Hernandez.
Mr. Carey, the director of customer relations for the Bridgeport Post Office, has been a postal employee in Bridgeport for 23 years, as a clerk and later in management. Over the years, he watched as letters to Santa piled up, then were thrown out.
So one day, 13 years ago, he opened one of the letters, and another and another. What he read astounded him.
"As a child, I'd ask Santa for a G. I. Joe or a color TV or something, and most of these kids weren't asking for gifts for themselves at all; they wanted a lost family member back. And many children just asked Santa for food. It was very touching, and I thought these letters had to be answered."
Mr. Carey asked other postal workers for their help; clerks and carriers alike immediately embraced the idea, taking home letters to answer in the midst of their busiest time of the year.
That first year, with the help of the Big Brother/Big Sister organization, the postal workers answered 80 letters, giving each of those children a gift. The second year, Mr. Carey received help from the city's welfare department, whose employees helped them screen letters, trying to determine if a child who wrote in had brothers and sisters, so they would also receive gifts. Over the years the program has grown so that last year more than 300 letters were answered and gifts provided to more than 500 children, according to Ms. Hernandez, a postal clerk who has taken the baton from Mr. Carey and now administers the program.
Letters start arriving by the pileful in late November and early December. The postal workers open and sort them. The neediest are answered first. Letters are also placed in a box, so that people dropping off Christmas cards or other mail can pick up one or two. Usually they return with a wrapped present; sometimes they open thin envelopes of worn dollar bills and contribute a few to the children.
"We know where the very needy neighborhoods are," Ms. Hernandez said. "Most of the letters are very genuine. Every now and then we get beat and someone scams us but that's bound to happen."
As Christmas draws near, Ms. Hernandez urges people to take letters home and answer them, encourages local companies to take a bunch. "There are always letters that go unanswered and that breaks my heart," she said. Mary Ann Harp, a postal clerk, said the entire post office gets swept up into the program. "It's so nice to be able to help a child," she said. "That's what this holiday is supposed to be about."
When Ms. Hernandez comes across a particularly moving letter, she visits the home. "Sometimes I get to a home and I can't believe what I see," she said. "Last year, one little boy wrote to Santa, saying that all he wanted were blankets for his family. I got to his apartment and there were five kids there and the family literally had nothing. They had just moved to Bridgeport and all they had was the kitchen sink, two sheets on the floor to sleep on, no food, nothing."
Ms. Hernandez talked to postal employees and others, and by Christmas the children had blankets and coats, a toy each and a kitchen full of food.
By late December, she and the other postal workers are weary indeed. "Every year I say, 'I'm not going to take this on this year,' and then I think, how can't I?" she said.
As Mr. Carey explains it, the project is made possible by the belief of Bridgeport postal administrators, particularly Postmaster Michael Boccio, that they are part of the community.
"Many of our employees are single parents themselves; they're working to keep their own families going," Mr. Carey said. "This time of year they're already putting in 12-hour days and then they're out their buying gifts for a total stranger. It gives you a warm feeling to be around here at Christmas time."
Mr. Carey said they continue to see a growing need not only in Bridgeport but also in Stratford, Shelton, Trumbull and Monroe. "Supposedly the economy is better," he said, "but all of the towns we serve have some needy families."
When a child receives a package, a little yellow notice is sent to the home, asking the child to go to the main Post Office to pick it up. Tucked in the corner of the notice, the return address reads "Santa, North Pole."
Many businesses in the area take dozens of letters and answer them. Ms. Hernandez said the staff of one Bridgeport law firm regularly answers more than 50 letters.
Jeff Vogt and Mitch Wein of the Westport-based advertising firm Vogt/Wein answered 50 letters last year and plan to do more this season. "Mitch had been helping with the Bridgeport program, taking his own children out shopping to get some gifts for children in need," Mr. Vogt said. Then they decided to expand their efforts and work as a company, piling shopping carts full of Barbies and Power Rangers, but mostly clothes because that is what is needed.
"Instead of giving our clients a nice bottle of champagne, we buy a gift for a child in their honor and we give them a small token and the copy of the letter we answered in their name," Mr. Vogt said. "Our clients have been very moved by the letters, as we are, and everybody benefits."
Last year, Vogt/Wein answered the letter of a little boy who wanted a Christmas tree. When he was at the store buying an artificial tree and lights, employees at the store noticed he was reading a letter. The store wound up donating a whole cartful of decorations and tree trimmings. "It's catching," Mr. Vogt said.
The letters pour in.
Dear Santa, I am writing to tell you that my mother is in jail. We are staying with my mother's boyfriend. He is trying to be good to us but he can't walk too good. Please Santa, don't forget us please. I am 14 years old. I would like a leather coat cause we have to walk to school and it is cold in the morning. My sisters need a coat, too. My mother said she would buy us coats for Christmas but now she's not around. Love you.

 Santa, How are you? I hope you are in good health. You have a lot of work ahead of you. I am 11 years old. I live alone with my mother and I don't have many toys or friends. I like the Power Rangers. The Green Ranger is my favorite. That's what I would like for Christmas, a Talking Green Ranger. Thank you so much, Santa. I love you.

 Dear Santa, I am six years old. I want a nice big kids Bible so I can take it to church and some pretty shoes for church. Thank you Santa.
Ms. Hernandez can recall many cold, starlit nights when she delivered presents to children whose families had no means for getting to the Post Office.
One year, a letter came in from an older woman. She was caring for her own children and her grandchildren; none had coats. Ms. Hernandez went to visit. "The children were going to school in 20-degree weather in sweaters," she said.
The grandmother didn't actually ask for anything. She just knew one of her youngest grandsons wanted to see Santa Claus.
"So I went back to the post office," Ms. Hernandez, "and we got coats for every one of those kids, and toys and all kinds of food. And one of the guys, who'd never been involved in the program before, dressed up as Santa.
"We got there and this woman had the humblest of houses but it was spotless and those children were loved. You should have seen the look on the faces of the children when they saw Santa. There had to be 11 or 13 children, ranging from 1 to 15. We were about to leave and one little boy looked up and said, 'Hey Santa? Where's Rudolph parked?'
"Our guy in the Santa suit had tears in his eyes and so did I," she said. "You see their faces pressed against the door and you know that for a split second they've forgotten all about poverty, and the violence in the streets, and they believe in Santa Claus."

HEADLINE: Communities Squabble Over Water Charges

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
SEVERAL central Westchester communities have recently thrown down the gauntlet in unrelated disputes over water bills. The disagreements reflect the complicated relationship between some water districts and some municipalities, which can be as bewildering as the plumbing underneath the kitchen sink.
The districts involved in the present disputes are the New Castle/ Stanwood Consolidated Water District, the Valhalla Water District, the Thornwood Water District, the Apple Hill Farm Water District and the Old Farm Water District. The municipalities are the town of New Castle, the town of Mount Pleasant and the village of Pleasantville. 
 A long-simmering conflict about water rates recently boiled over between the village of Pleasantville and the town of Mount Pleasant. The town contends that the village owes it about $500,000 for emergency water, which was supplied from last January through last June; the village asserts that the fee should be significantly lower.
The town of Mount Pleasant had supplied water to the village of Pleasantville from the Valhalla Water District. The water passed through pipes belonging to the Thornwood Water District.
"The village of Pleasantville had to rely on water sources from Hawthorne and Valhalla when the New York State Department of Health ordered us to disconnect our taps to the Catskill Aqueduct in January," said Patricia Dwyer, Administrator for the village of Pleasantville.
Ms. Dwyer added: "On average, the village of Pleasantville consumes 1.1 million gallons a day, and during the winter our consumption is traditionally low. The problem we're having in paying our claims is that while we have records of consumption, and know what we've consumed because we have water meters, Valhalla and Hawthorne historically have unmetered water. We have not been able to get information from town records that are useful."
For Mount Pleasant, the issue has to do, at least in part, with greater parity on the water rates themselves.
"We're saying we want to be treated fairly," said Robert Meehan, Supervisor of the town of Mount Pleasant. "This goes back to unfair water rates. The water rates are rising to astronomical numbers. Municipalities are unregulated, and the consumer has no remedy. Double water rates are being charged to outside customers, and that has nothing to do with costs. The water rate we charged Pleasantville was set at what Pleasantville charges Mount Pleasant."
Both sides hope to resolve the issue before the end of the year.
For its part, Mount Pleasant recently lost a court battle to contest the water rates that the town of New Castle charged to supply water to about 700 homeowners in the Apple Hill Farm Water District and the Old Farm Water District who receive their water from New Castle.
"Some people pay $2,000 a year, if they don't live in New Castle," said Mr. Meehan, who expressed frustration with a recent Appellate Court decision ordering Mount Pleasant to pay its bill of $1.5 million to New Castle. "The courts haven't been open to these arguments. The only answer is legislation to regulate this."
Water suppliers and consumers, like square dancers, are rarely static. In a decision unrelated to its dispute with Mount Pleasant, Pleasantville recently agreed to join with the town of New Castle in the Millwood Water Treatment Plant.
"We have excess capacity that we can sell to Pleasantville," said Clinton Smith, Supervisor of the town of New Castle. "We will still have excess capacity that we will be happy to sell to someone else, but we would need to do a study to determine what would need to be done to expand our capacity, and at what cost."
Mr. Smith added, "We expect the Pleasantville sale will lower our water rates by about $7 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet, and that $7 reduction would stay in place for 10 years, and then result in greater reductions."
For Pleasantville, the water partnership with New Castle solves the village's problem of how to provide filtered water to its residents. "We're under consent to have filtered drinking water," Ms. Dwyer said. "We had boiled it down to three options: building our own filtration plant, working out an agreement with New Castle and building a regional plant with Mount Pleasant. The New Castle alternative is the most economic and efficient."
Pleasantville anticipates being fully connected to the New Castle plant by the summer of 1998.

Newark's Slice of Italy That Survives Only in Memory

 BODY:
In 1953, the postwar wave of urban renewal swept over the old First Ward of Newark. As the tenements in the half-mile square around St. Lucy's Church fell to make way for the Christopher Columbus Homes Housing Project, so did a way of life. For the First Ward had been the heart of a community, one of the largest Little Italys in America. Thousands of Italian immigrants had settled there and had families, the first generation of Italian-Americans. Today, their countless descendants throughout the United States can still trace their roots to Newark.
Michael Immerso is one of them. A Newark native whose great-grandparents settled in the First Ward more than a century ago, Mr. Immerso began the First Ward Documentary Project, dedicated to preserving the neighborhood's Italian heritage. Since 1994, he has collected more than 60,000 photographs from the children of the First Ward, whose families lived there between 1875 and 1955. Pictures came from as far away as Florida, Texas and California. 
 Thanks to the project, the old neighborhood lives again in "The Vanished First Ward: Newark's Little Italy," an exhibition at the Newark Public Library downtown through Jan. 24. The project is also creating for the library a permanent archive of memoirs, letters, articles, dissertations and other memorabilia of Italian-American life. In addition, a companion book for the exhibition is to be published in June the library and Rutgers University Press.
The people of the First Ward lost their homes to a "renewal" that ultimately failed. (The last of the Columbus Homes buildings were demolished in June.) But they never lost sight of their heritage. These are just a few of the more than 300 images on display chronicling their lives in a time and place long gone.
"The Vanished First Ward" is on view in the second- and third-floor galleries of the Newark Public Library, 5 Washington Street. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Information:
(201) 596-6550.

Speculative Offices End 7-Year Construction Drought

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE latest sign of a gradual improvement in New Jersey's office market is the willingness of developers to start new projects, ending a seven-year drought in speculative construction.
Evidence of that are four projects, totaling some 600,000 square feet of Class A space, under way by three separate developers. They are rising in two of the state's strongest submarkets, the Interstate 78 corridor in Somerset County and eastern Morris County. 
 The activity is redefining the term speculative construction, brokers and analysts said. During the mid-80's building boom, the term referred to offices built without leasing commitments from tenants. Now, developers premarket their buildings, often securing verbal or written commitments for a big chunk of space, leading some industry experts to tag the activity semi-speculative construction.
What the market is seeing may well be the equilavent to college sports recruitment where players commit to joining a team a few months before they sign contracts, said James W. Hughes, dean of the school of public policy and planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. Tenants often want to see construction start, he said.
Three of the buildings have tenants for most or all of their space. They are Hoffmann-LaRoche and Hoechst Celanese, pharmaceutical concerns, and Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of electronic products and systems.
In today's more cautious lending climate, developers must put up 25 to 50 percent of the cost of their projects, said Steven A. Kohn, managing director at Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, a Manhattan-based real-estate investment-banking concern. Traditional lenders will not give construction financing unless a developer has signed leases for 30 to 65 percent of the space in a building, Mr. Kohn said. Without that, developers would have to invest more of their own money or find equity partners like pension funds or real estate investment trusts, he said.
The developers of the buildings under way said they were using their own equity to at least start construction.
Still, the activity by whatever name, most brokers agree, underscores the health of the 11-county northern New Jersey market. The lack of construction has helped cut the supply of all office space, and of prime space in particular, said Mr. Kohn, adding that there was "pent-up demand."
In this year's third quarter, the Class A vacancy rate for newer, better-situated sites was 12.8 percent, down 2 percentage points from a year ago, and the rate for such space was below 10 percent in 19 of the state's 32 submarkets, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage. Asking rents in some markets have also risen to reflect the cost of new construction, added Edwin H. Cohen, executive director at the concern's East Rutherford office. His concern puts the average rent for such space at $22.74 a square foot but said it could be as high as $26.
THERE are fewer than nine blocks of prime space of 100,000 square feet or more available in the 11-county northern New Jersey marketplace, down from 40 in 1990, according to the Saddle Brook office of Edward S. Gordon, another national brokerage.
"Demand is driving construction and that is a better sign because it will keep the market in balance with supply," said Robert J. Rudin, executive director of that office. Companies in the state are expanding again, he said, adding that the worst of the corporate downsizing was over and that what space was put back on the market could be absorbed.
The biggest threat to the market last year was AT&T's announcement that it would cut 7,000 jobs in New Jersey as it spun into three companies. But so far that move has had little impact since collectively the companies have added almost as many jobs as were eliminated, about 4,000, and occupy about the same amount of space, some 23 million square feet, said Ritch Blasi, an AT&T spokesman.
Dean Hughes said that the state, now in its 55th month of recovery, had recaptured 204,000 of the 262,000 jobs lost during the recession.
Those market forces are what the developers of the projects under construction say convinced them to move ahead.
Along the Interstate 78 corridor in the Somerset County community of Warren, the Bellemead Development Corporation of Roseland began work in the fall of 1995 on a 207,727-square-foot building, the last at its 118-acre Somerset Hills Corporate Center. By last April, before the steel frame was erected, Hoechst Celanese leased the building for its headquarters.
The company is scheduled to move into the $40 million structure by May, said Robert R. Martie, a vice president at Bellemead, a subsidiary of the Chubb Corporation. Brokers said the insurer, which is selling Bellemead, would have taken space if a tenant had not come forward.
"We were committed to go ahead with or without a tenant because the conditions of the market were so strong we were convinced the building would lease," Mr. Martie said. The vacancy rate for Class A space along Interstate 78 in Somerset County is 2.7 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
In Parsippany in Morris County, the company began work last spring on a 107,000-square-foot building at its 132-acre Waterview Corporate Center at the confluence of Interstate 287 and Routes 46 and 202. At the same time, Bellemead began negotiating with tenants for space in the building and last month Hoffman-LaRoche's Vitamins and Fine Chemicals division in Paramus leased the $16 million building. It will be completed next fall, said Mr. Martie, noting that his company "is selectively looking to develop additional properties."
IN Florham Park, also in eastern Morris County, Gale & Wentworth Inc., a local real estate services and investment firm, is developing, in partnership with J. P. Morgan, a 100,000-square-foot building. It is rising at the developer's 170-acre corporate campus along Route 24, known as Park Avenue at Morris County. A division of Hewlett-Packard has leased 75,000 square feet of space in the $18 million building and will move there from elsewhere in Florham Park by next fall.
"The key in this market is being able to deliver product for tenants who typically have a lead time of 18 months," said Mark Yeager, president of Gale & Wentworth's Commercial Group. He said his company also planned to start a similar-size building before year's end and another, with up to 175,000 square feet, by next summer.
In Bridgewater, part of the Interstate 78 corridor in Somerset County, SJP Properties of Parsippany is constructing a $40 million, 240,000-square-foot building. It is the maiden project at the 118-acre Somerset Corporate Center, near the intersection of Interstates 78 and 287. SJP is developing the center in partnership with the real estate development arm of Foster Wheeler, the Perryville-based engineering concern.
The company is negotiating with several tenants for 40 to 60 percent of the space, said Peter Eppie, executive vice president at SJP. But with the limited supply of quality space on the market and the lack of developable sites, Mr. Eppie said his company was confident the building would be substantially leased before it was completed next November.
Because of those factors, he said his company would also look to start a second, similar-size building next year.
Developers, brokers and analysts said the construction activity would continue, albeit on a selective basis and barring an economic downturn. But no one is anticipating, at least in the near term, a repeat of the overbuilding of the mid-80's. Among the reasons are that banks continue to be conservative in their lending and there are fewer approved building sites in prime locations. Also, the pool of developers financially strong enough to secure loans and proceed with projects is down from what it was in the 80's.
"Banks are scrutinizing developers' balance sheets and track records," said Dean Hughes, noting that the days of anyone proclaiming himself an office builder were over.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/World Financial Properties;
From Olympia & York Bankruptcy, a New Company

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE remains of Olympia & York's United States operations emerged from bankruptcy recently, marking a symbolic end to the wild, speculative era of the 1980's that was followed by the crash of the early 1990's.
Renamed World Financial Properties, after the four-building World Financial Center complex in lower Manhattan that is its prime asset, the new company is controlled by Brookfield Properties Corporation of Toronto, which holds 47 percent of the equity. Citibank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce each own 20 percent, with the remainder owned by various investors. 
 The surviving company is considerably smaller than it was in its heyday; it owns 11.5 million square feet of office and retail space, down from the 24 million square feet that at one time made it the largest landlord in New York. The Reichmann family of Toronto, which built Olympia & York from a small company that put up warehouses into an international giant, is completely out of the picture.
Despite World Financial's diminished size John E. Zuccotti, the former First Deputy Mayor of New York City who guided Olympia & York through bankruptcy and reorganization and is now chairman of its successor, said he and his investors were interested in growth, through acquisitions, mergers or, possibly, the formation of a real estate investment trust.
"We now have a well-capitalized company with landmark properties and positive cash flow," said Gordon E. Arnell, the chairman of Brookfield , a subsidiary of the Toronto-based Edper Group, one of Canada's largest conglomerates. "Our intention is to grow the company as economic prudence permits. The company is a platform for further expansion in the Northeast region."
Although Edper is often identified as a vehicle for the interests of the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, cousins of the family identified with the Seagram whiskey business, it is really a public company with limited family influence, Mr. Arnell said. "Peter Bronfman had a 15 percent interest, which is part of his estate, and his brother Edward sold years back," he said.
In addition to the World Financial Center in Battery Park City, the company also owns One Liberty Place at Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District; 245 Park Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, and Exchange Place in Boston. Company officials said that except for One Liberty and 245 Park, the buildings were almost fully rented with leases averaging 12 years. Even the less than full buildings are in reasonable condition, with 85 percent of the space leased at One Liberty and 89 percent at 245 Park.
Mr. Zuccotti said the company and Brookfield were formulating post-bankruptcy strategy. "Our collective job is to figure the best capital and financial plan, and that might include a REIT and an initial public offering," he said. "We hope to make these decisions by the end of the first quarter."
He said REIT's were proving attractive to investors, large and small, who want to own real estate without taking title to properties. Since REIT's typically invest in a broad portfolio of properties, the effect on REIT investors of any one property getting into financial trouble is expected to be minimal. "A REIT is somewhat like investing in a mutual fund," Mr. Zuccotti said.
ANOTHER advantage of a REIT would be its favorable treatment under tax law, which imposes no corporate income tax as long as 95 percent of taxable income is paid out to shareholders. The law also allows the owners of real estate to defer capital gains taxes if they accept units of partnerships sponsored by a REIT.
"As a REIT we might be an attractive partner for owners of real estate who might want to be more liquid but are not big enough to do their own REIT," Mr. Arnell said. "It would be quite sensible for them to roll their buildings into a REIT in return for the partnership units."
Although Mr. Arnell speaks of prudent growth, prudence was not usually used to describe the operations of the three Reichmann brothers, who fled their native Vienna ahead of the Nazis, rode out World War II in Tangier, Morocco, and made their way to the Toronto area in the 1950's. They borrowed billions of dollars to finance a privately owned real estate and industrial empire in Canada, the United States and Great Britain until a worried commercial paper market refused to or refinance, short-term borrowings in March 1992 and the entire Olympia & York edifice collapsed.
Mr. Arnell said that Paul Reichmann was still somewhat active in real estate. . "He has put together a group that holds a small interest in Canary Wharf," a huge office complex in an old industrial area of London, Mr. Arnell said. The two other brothers, Albert and Ralph, are retired.
"I became involved in 1990 when Paul Reichmann said he needed someone to look after his New York properties," Mr. Zuccotti said. "Prior to that I had been his attorney for 10 years."
One reason Mr. Reichmann needed a strong local manager in New York was that his energies were being devoted to putting together Canary Wharf. The burden of financing the project in the face of falling rents and property values in the United States and Canada triggered the financial crisis that sank Olympia & York.
"In April of 1992, Mr. Reichmann said he had no more resources and that we were on our own," Mr. Zuccotti said. That began a four-year series of negotiations that resulted in many buildings being turned over to creditors, but which succeeded in preserving the core of the company. Among the properties that reverted to lenders or were sold were 55 Water Street, 2 Broadway, 237 Park Avenue and 125 Broad Street.
He said the effort was aided by bankruptcy law in this country, particularly Chapter 11 of the Federal statute, which gives debtors more leverage than in other countries. "The English and Canadian companies were liquidated," Mr. Zuccotti said. "The secured creditors took all the assets and left nothing for everybody else."
In New York, he said, the talks persuaded lenders not to push the company into bankruptcy until a formula for resolving the financial problems was in sight. "We did not even file for Chapter 11 until about a year ago," he said. "And it was a consensual reorganization. We demonstrated to creditors that it would be more rewarding to do it this way."
And that is the way it turned out. The unsecured creditors of the New York company eventually received eight cents for each dollar owed -- not a princely amount, but better than nothing.
"Looking at it from the tenant-broker perspective, you have to say that the company remains a major New York landlord,"' said Michael T. Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate Company, which has extensive operations in lower Manhattan. "Tenants are certainly not shying away from the properties and nobody has redlined the company."
A key transaction was the sale of $1.31 billion of debt securities backed by leases on two of the office towers at the World Financial Center. The proceeds allowed existing debt, often carrying higher interest rates to be paid down. Merrill Lynch & Company was on both ends of the transaction, as the issuer of the securities and as the long-term tenant of the two buildings.
MR. ZUCCOTTI said there were some parallels between the Olympia & York negotiations in the early 1990's and the near-bankruptcy of New York City during the administration of Abraham D. Beame in the mid-1970's while Mr. Zuccotti was First Deputy Mayor. "Both the city and O&Y got into trouble for the same reason: the inability to sell short-term paper," he said.
"The skills to manage both were similar," he added. "You have to be credible, patient and have a thick skin. Basically you are addressing the concerns of creditors. So you have to be open, reasonable and put out numbers that are reliable. I'm not sure I could have done this job without the experience back then."
Since most of World Financial's properties are in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Zuccotti said it was likely the company would go shopping elsewhere in the Northeast once the financial plan has been developed. Not, he hastened to add, that he lacks faith in downtown.
"We have the best buildings in Lower Manhattan, and with the exception of One Liberty, they are almost fully rented," Mr. Zuccotti said. But, he admitted, "when you look at a portfolio, you want to be more balanced and diversified."
While the company wants to diversify geographically, it is likely to stick to its basic business of owning and operating office buildings, Mr. Arnell said. "My personal bias is to stay in office buildings," he said. "They may be in the suburbs rather than central business districts, but they are still office buildings."

HEADLINE: Loft Market Grows, at Lofty Prices

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THERE it is: an old seven- or eight-story brick manufacturing building with big windows across the front, standing vacant or partly vacant and forlorn on a side street in TriBeCa, SoHo, North Gramercy, Flatiron, Chelsea, the Meat Market area, the Financial District, across the river in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn -- anywhere in New York City where art collectors, bankers, designers, stockbrokers and hip upper-middle-class parents might consider living in enormous sheet-rocked spaces.
A few years ago the building might have been labeled an eyesore. Now it is a prize. And alerting a developer -- small-time, big-time -- to such a building is like dangling a piece of hamburger in front of a hungry Pomeranian. A small building is generally better than a big building: To be desirable, apartments need natural light, and apartments deep in the center of a big square building don't have much natural light. 
 "For every good vacant building that you see, there are already 20 developers circling it," said Jack Lefkowitz. Mr. Lefkowitz should know. He is involved in two large residential loft projects, one in the heart of TriBeCa and one in the heart of Williamsburg.
"You wouldn't believe how many small-time developers there are now -- people who spend their weekends prowling streets off the beaten path, jotting down the addresses of vacant or nearly vacant buildings -- and they're on the phone Monday morning," said Richard Tola of Massey Knakal Real Estate, who sold two loft buildings in the East 20's in the last six months. "The problem is, there are very few sites left."
Development sites have been snatched up: For the fortunate few who began buying in the recession, the cost was between $15 and $50 a square foot; for developers who bought them in the last year, they were on average about $100 a square foot. This month, at least a dozen buildings in TriBeCa alone, totaling over one million square feet are being gut renovated or are in the process of getting the necessary permits -- more than at any time since the heyday of the mid-to-late 80's.
Real estate agents are beginning to sell, or more correctly to show, prospective buyers some of the raw spaces, most of which when finished will have many more services than the buyers used to find in lofts. Most of the buildings do not yet have a Certificate of Occupancy, which allows people to move in; many do not even have their condominium plans approved by the state, so the lofts cannot be sold. Nevertheless, brokers stress that "reservations" can be accepted -- and that business is brisk. And prices for the "end buyers" -- the people who are actually going to live in these spaces -- can be over $400 a square foot for jumbo-sized million-dollar lofts. (The 2,350-square-foot penthouse loft at the 129 Duane Street conversion, by no means the most expensive in the city , is priced at $1.2 million, or $510 a square foot.)
Loft buyers are a hardy group. A few days ago, a trip to see just-unveiled loft spaces necessitated navigating among workers squirting wet cement out of a giant hose onto an entrance corridor floor; workers "blasting" (luckily, warnings referred to sandblasting some old yellow pine beams), and workers hammering metal pipes.
"Watch the holes," said one broker as she escorted a visitor onto the top floor of the new conversion at 166 Duane Street. The holes were about 6 feet by 2 feet, and the visitor was able to see straight down from the 12th to the first floor.
"For some people, the adventurous conditions are all part of the fun," said Mark S. Blau, 166 Duane's developer, confidently surveying the activity as the rickety stripped-down freight elevator shuddered from floor to floor. As if to prove the point, earlier this month at another new conversion a couple celebrated their forthcoming marriage with champagne -- in their raw loft at 429 Greenwich Street. The couple -- she owns a design firm, he's a computer marketer -- had got their marriage license in the morning, closed on their loft in the afternoon and held a party at the construction site that night.
Besides being daring, these new loft buyers are a more inclusive group than those of the go-go 80's, who were largely artists and art lovers. And because the buyers include different types of people, the lofts being created are designed differently.
FOR one thing, today's lofts are bigger than the 1,600 and 1,700-square-foot spaces partitioned off in the late 80's. (One advertisement, for lofts at 140 Perry Street in the West Village, labels its 2,800-square-foot lofts "Heroic Scale Condominiums, Carved From a Former Stable.") As if they had attended the same class on loft sales -- or the same political convention -- one sales agent after another repeated that these new lofts were "designed for families."
"These are the families -- father's a banker, mother's a lawyer -- who would have been looking for a $600,000 house in Short Hills to raise their family," said Mr. Tola. "But their work is in the city, they've got the schools nailed down already in the city, so what kind of apartment do they want?"
Lauren Applebaum, an agent with A. J. Clarke who specializes in prewar apartments on the Upper West Side and rarely touches a loft, said that city families naturally want big apartments -- which used to mean the big classic sixes and sevens on the Upper East and Upper West Sides. But increasingly, Ms. Applebaum said, "there is a mismatch between what buyers want and what the market provides."
The classic six in a prewar, doorman building can start at a half million dollars, and depending on building and location shoot up to over a million dollars.
"And they may not really be suitable," the agent said. A classic six, for example, has only two bedrooms, plus a maid's room near the kitchen and a formal dining room, also near the kitchen. Contemporary families with two or more children, however, rarely dine formally and might prefer a bigger eat-in kitchen or another bedroom. As an alternative, the loft agents report, families are attracted to the open spaces of the converted manufacturing buildings and now increasingly can select their own layouts, with open kitchens and huge multipurpose rooms: kitchen/dining room/living room/family room -- even study or playroom -- combined.
They are also attracted to the neighborhoods. "I grew up on the Upper East Side," said Michael Selverne, a 37-year-old entertainment lawyer who will close at the end of this month on a 2,100-square-foot loft in North TriBeCa, "and I had enough of the population density up there -- it's gotten so bad you can't even walk on the sidewalk any more. I crave the quiet, the complacency, the neighborhood of downtown.
"Downtown, you can still walk into a pet store, grab a bone and say 'Bobby, put it on the bill' and walk out," said Mr. Selverne, who lives with his wife, Stacy, their 3-year-old daughter, Hannah, and a golden retriever named Lucy. The Selverne family has lived in Battery Park City since the late 80's and has seen the whole TriBeCa/Battery Park City neighborhood change dramatically since they moved in. Besides the chic restaurants ("Robert De Niro took a whole block of Franklin Street and gentrified it," the lawyer said, referring to Mr. De Niro's film center and the three TriBeCa restaurants in which he is a partner), Mr. Selverne said there are plenty of educational options.
"I am a alumnus of the Friends School on 16th Street, and I intend to send my daughter there," he said. "But my friends tell me the local elementary school, P.S. 234, is great and they're building an intermediate school. Then there's Washington Market, the Park Pre-School and Buckle My Shoe, just to name a few TriBeCa preschools. Then Hannah goes to tumbling classes on Friday nights and there's a music school."
Then there is the space. "Our apartment is 2,100 square feet," he said, referring to his new apartment, with barrel vaulted ceilings, at the Dietz Lantern Building at 429 Greenwich Street at Laight Street, where all 28 of the new lofts have been spoken for. "A client of mine bought a 2,400-square-foot classic seven on Park Avenue in the 80's. He paid $1.2 million and change, half cash. And it's a co-op building: his neighbors actually have a say in what he can do."
All the new loft conversions are condominiums, which do not have the strict rules of co-ops. And although Mr. Selverne declined to say what he will pay when he closes at the end of the month, he said it was "substantially less" than his client paid. (The 2,100-square-foot lofts in the building range from $550,000 to $585,000, according to the marketing material, with monthly common charges from about $1,300 to $1,600.)
While two owners have already closed and have moved into the Dietz Building -- one of the first of the new wave of TriBeCa condo conversions -- Mr. Selverne said his family might wait for the end of the construction and the advent of the 24-hour doormen. This brings up another difference between the old- and new-style lofts. Brokers and agents emphasize that many of the new loft buildings come with many more services than they used to.
Buyers are "bringing with them the services from the Upper East Side," said Koby Ravitz, a real estate agent with the Halstead Property Company. "Twenty-four hour doorman, live-in super," he said. "You want it, you get it." Mr. Ravitz is living his dream. Two years ago, he bought his own 19,110-square-foot loft building, at 47 Warren Street, and is developing it himself into four large loft apartments. Because of the size of the building, Mr. Ravitz cannot offer the services larger buildings may have.
Today's loft is also frequently done with a different level of finish, although one loft project -- the 133,348-square-foot, 17-story Atalanta Building at 25 North Moore Street -- will be offered as 45 raw lofts, according to Bruce Brickman, the lead developer.
In the main, the new loft spaces are offered with elegant, if streamlined, kitchens and baths, with central air-conditioning and heat and refinished floors. At 129 Duane Street, a small project -- seven residential and two commercial lofts -- with Paula Levine as developer and Tamara Beudecz as architect, the bathrooms come with polished pure white Grecian marble floors and walls, and a refined open kitchen has light maple cabinets, Bosch dishwashers and SubZero refrigerators, (Prices range from $590,000 to $1.7 million.)
The lofts at 129 Duane, despite their fine finish, suffer a drawback that some others of the new breed do not. Because of the building's narrow width, they are the old-fashioned type: long and skinny, with substantial light only from the front windows.
Buyers will presumably be comparing these lofts with those in Mr. Ravitz's building, which, while not on as desirable a block, is much wider and allows for much more light in the four full-floor units, each offering 3 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths. There, the 27- by 50-foot living rooms are high, wide and bright, finished with Canadian paneled maple kitchen cabinets in a more traditional style. (Prices: $895,000 to $1.9 million, carrying charges $1,100 to $1,300 a month.)
Both developers -- at 129 Duane and 47 Warren -- are adding wood-burning fireplaces -- a trend in most of the new conversions. Mr. Ravitz called them "de rigueur." A few days ago all the metal flues were still visible above the metal firebox in the stunning penthouse space at 47 Warren, snaking their way to the roof in a configuration that resembled an abstract sculpture.
The developers say they are also presenting potential buyers with more choices -- the old lofts often came with nothing but plumbing hook-ups. "That was when they paid $100 a foot," Mr. Ravitz said. "Now they are paying at least $300 and they want something more to show for it."
"It's kind of a competition, " he said. "There's now four or five conversions just in TriBeCa that are coming on the market -- with a lot more being planned -- and if you want to get the customers, you'll put in better finishes; the competition is pushing the quality."
The competition is also pushing the locations. Almost every week, a new conversion is announced in the Wall Street area. Two that have not yet been announced are loft-rental conversions at 110 Liberty Street and 205 Pearl Street. At 110 Liberty, David M. Baldwin Realty plans to market 13 lofts ranging from 950 to 1,350 square feet for from $2,400 to $4,000 a month. At 205 Pearl, the developer David Silverstein is planning to offer nine lofts, each more than 2,000 square feet, for as yet undetermined rents.
DEVELOPERS are consulting privately with real estate agents and marketers about several other sites. They include 345 West 13th Street; 245 Seventh Avenue at 24th Street; a garage at Hudson and Charles Streets, and 14 East 33d Street, where a developer plans on building an as yet undetermined number of 1,900- to 2,700-square-foot lofts. "There's 2,000 new units scheduled to come on just in the financial district alone," said Michael Goldenberg, head of the Halstead Property Company's downtown office, referring to the total of both lofts and traditional apartments planned for this section of downtown. "And I'm not including the little projects."
"There's a new development on 14th Street," Mr. Ravitz said, referring to the new Union Lane Condominiums conversion over Bunnies, a children's clothing store at 116 West 14th Street where Zuberry Associates, the developer, has sold all 14 units at prices ranging from $250,000 to $600,000 for half-floor lofts. "A few years ago, who would live on 14th Street?" He added that developers were exploring the Meat Market area, the area around 14th Street and 10th Avenue. But developers point out that residential development there might be more tricky than in some other areas. "the city wants to keep the butchers there," said Mr. Lefkowitz, the developer.
Mr. Lefkowitz grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, but moved out, he said, because there weren't big spaces to raise his large family. But now he is coming back -- to build big spaces for others.
"We were all brought up in large families," he said. "Our parents squeezed us into small brownstones. Now people have the money for big lofts." In Williamsburg, Mr. Lefkowitz has bought the 250,000-square-foot Royal Baking Powder Company, a three-building complex around a central cobblestoned courtyard. While some developers might put a deposit on a site and make the deal contingent on receiving the permits necessary to change the existing zoning from manufacturing to residential, Mr. Lefkowitz took a chance.
"We went a little bit speculative," he said. "This product we bought, we closed all cash without the permits. That is because we call this a slam dunk. Why would the city not give us permission? Housing here is needed; the buildings are vacant; the city will grant us permission. On one hand, it is speculative, but my business head tells me it's a slam dunk. We will get it."
The complex of six- and seven-story buildings at Kent and Wythe Avenues had been used most recently by a clothing manufacturer who made uniforms during the Gulf War, Mr. Lefkowitz said. "As the Bush Administration pulled the plug on the war, the manufacturing company went into bankruptcy and shut down," he said. The complex has been vacant since 1991. Chemical Bank had foreclosed, and in 1995 Mr. Lefkowitz bought it from them, for an undisclosed figure. "The building has a market value of $6 million," the developer said, "but we bought it for considerably less."
Mr. Lefkowitz, aided by Howard Hornstein, a lawyer and a former member of the City Planning Commission, and Joseph Pell Lombardi, an architect who boasts of 150 buildings that have been converted to loft apartments, are ready to go before the Board of Standards and Appeals, and then before the City Planning Commission, to change the manufacturing zoning to create 136 residential units. The developer estimates the process could take nine months to a year. If all goes well, the $25 million project could be ready by the spring of 1998.
The loft apartments will average 1,750 square feet; each will have exposures on the outside and on the courtyard. At $300,000 to $350,000 each, they will sell for less than Mr. Lefkowitz's TriBeCa venture -- the 49-unit Ericsson Ice House at 27 North Moore Street -- where the penthouse is tentatively set to sell for $1.7 million. But like the TriBeCa lofts, the Williamsburg loft-apartments will be sold "semi-finished," according to the developer, with the buyers able to choose their own finishes and even the way they would like to partition the space.
Mr. Lefkowitz admits to occasionally cruising around looking at sites. "What do you think of the Financial District?" he asked. "My jury's still out."
SO FAR, developers appear to be having good luck with sites that might still be labeled off the beaten path.
At the Spears Building, at 525 West 22d Street -- almost in the Hudson River in Chelsea -- the developers, Savanna Partners, have turned a 110,000-square-foot, 1930's furniture warehouse into medium (1,784 square feet) and large (3,686 square feet) lofts with fireplaces. In two months of sales, they have sold 25 out of the 30 lofts, for prices ranging from $841,000 to $1.6 million, according to Helene Luchnick, a vice president at Douglas Elliman real estate.
Ms. Luchnick knows the loft scene as well as anyone; she can recite square footages and price tags for every project announced -- and for some that haven't yet been announced. For her, the activity is exciting -- and lucrative.
"But the market may be glutted, especially in TriBeCa," she said the other day, cautioning restraint. "It remains to be seen if the area can absorb all these lofts. TriBeCa's a pretty small place. The Dietz Lantern Building sold out so quickly because they were the first. The Merchants House" on North Moore Street "took a little longer."
She paused. "But look at SoHo, where the only loft project is the New Museum Building at 154 Mercer Street," she said. The building, which runs from Broadway to Mercer Street and is to be developed by BPM Associates, will continue to house the New Museum and will eventually include residential and commercial loft units. "The plan was approved by the Attorney General on Nov. 25," she said. "And we've already got two out of nine lofts spoken for."

HEADLINE: CHARITY;
Unmanned Kettles Are An Anomaly

BYLINE: By JULIE BEGLIN 

 BODY:
One of the most visible symbols of the holiday season, the Salvation Army kettle, is notably absent in New Jersey this year. Salvation Army officials attribute the scarcity of volunteer bell ringers at its 25 state offices to what is perhaps a surprising source: corporate downsizing.
"We think a big part of it is the downsizing among the corporate community," said David Bishop, resource development manager for the Essex County Area Services Office of the Salvation Army. "There are less people and less people with the time available. Who has the time to spend a few hours on the corner helping a charity?" 
 However, other charities are doing well this season. For instance, a December gift-giving program for the needy sponsored by United Way of Somerset County, is expecting a 70 percent increase in volunteers and 10 percent rise in donations between last year and this year. Elijah's Promise soup kitchen of New Brunswick, with an average annual volunteer pool of 450, has had about 50 more volunteers commit to serving meals on Thanksgiving or Christmas, or to coordinating the collection of toys and clothing.
For many other charitable organizations, giving has at least remained steady. The statewide Hyacinth AIDS Foundation, based in New Brunswick, has not seen its base of 400 active volunteers change during the holiday season, and donations have risen a little this month. Similarly, the 70,000 people who volunteer for the American Cancer Society's New Jersey Division do their work throughout the year, and the society's 1996 direct mail campaign, which has drawn $300,000 since September, is about even with last year's.
Eleanor L. Brilliant, a professor at Rutgers University's School of Social Work, has studied United Way agencies across the country and found that corporate cutbacks led directly to drops in volunteerism and donations in the affected communities. Those who lost jobs tend not to give money or their time to charities immediately after the downsizing, she said, and those who keep their jobs often have more work and thus less free time in which to volunteer.
Professor Brilliant said that it is hard to know exactly why the Salvation Army, and not other charities, is facing problems. "I really don't know why they took the hit this year. To answer the question we would have to know the makeup of their volunteers."
Between 1994 and 1995, charitable giving increased by 11 percent nationally, according to Bob Semple, a fund-raising consultant based in Nutley. Although data for New Jersey alone is not yet in, it appears that charitable giving in the state is not up to the national rate. "The Northeast corridor hasn't really caught up with national trends in giving, but we do see signs of it improving," said Mr. Semple.
"I would predict contributions to charities would be up this year in New Jersey," he added, pointing to the surging stock market and stable economy.
Nationally, the time people devote to volunteering has risen slightly in the recently, up 5 percent between 1993 and 1995, according to Paul Clolery, editor in chief of the national Nonprofit Times, based in Cedar Knolls. Most nonprofits retain relatively stable bases of volunteers throughout the year, he added, as opposed to seeing dramatic upswings during the holidays.
But not the Salvation Army. Last year, 20 volunteers rang bells for the Westside Newark office, asking passers-by to drop donations into the familiar black kettles. This year, 19 of those kettles are usually lying around the office, unused.
In Hackensack, there are 10 locations where bell ringers may stand, but only two people to do the work. And in Plainfield the lone bell ringer these days is Lieut. James Stephenson, who runs the office. "We don't have any volunteers at all," Lieutenant Stephenson said.
In fact, the Westside Newark Salvation Army office has even offered to pay bell ringers, albeit minimum wage, but still has had no takers.
"It keeps us on our knees, praying to the Lord," said Capt. Darlene DeGroate of the Westside Newark office.
Particularly difficult for the Salvation Army is that its decrease in volunteers, which is certain to translate into a decrease in donations -- the organization took in 45.4 percent of its total 1995 New Jersey contributions during the last holiday period -- comes when demand for its services is up sharply. The Salvation Army provides food baskets and rental assistance and runs social-service programs such as support groups for adults raising their grandchildren. The number of people served in Essex County alone rose 44 percent in the last two years and is likely to rise again this year, Mr. Bishop said.

Modern Cliffhanger: Movies on Main Street

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: WESTFIELD

 BODY:
For 74 years, the Rialto was where fantasy could be lived out on a movie screen, a home away from home where parents still drop off young children on a Saturday afternoon and feel they will be safe. Now, it is in danger of closing, another casualty of the more profitable highway multiplexes.
United Artists Theater Circuit Inc., which owns the Rialto, expects to sell it to a Long Island developer. But many residents in this town of 28,000 people have banded together to save the 980-seat, three-screen theater on East Broad Street. They feel it is important to the town's economic health as well as having a special place in their emotional landscape. 
 "People who grew up here still enjoy it," said David Owens, a spokesman for a group of about 250 residents trying to save the movie house, who recalls the Saturday night dates he had with his wife at the Rialto before they were married.
They have written letters and staged rallies to try to persuade the developer, Hy Carlinsky, president of Armstrong Management Corporation of Garden City, to preserve the theater as part of his plan to intall Banana Republic and Baby Gap clothing stores.
No one knows how many Main Street theaters have closed since the first twin- and triple-screen theaters began opening on highways and in shopping centers in the mid-1960's. In the last 15 years, theaters with 10 screens have become the norm, 14 screens are more common and a 30-screen complex is in the works for Linden.
According to the National Association of Theater Owners in North Hollywood, Calif., despite the loss of older theaters, between 1990 and 1995 the number of screens in New Jersey increased from 559 to 692. Jesse Sayegh, president of the New Jersey chapter of the association, estimated that only 25 to 35 percent are in the the state's neighborhood theaters.
Downtown theaters are still an endangered species in some communities. Nonetheless, Mr. Sayegh, who operates two neighborhood theaters -- the Linden Fiveplex, and Cinema 23, a five-screen house in Cedar Grove, as well as several other larger multiplexes -- said local movie houses can fill a niche the huge largest multiscreen theaters cannot.
"As long as they are well maintained," Mr. Sayegh said, "they offer a lot of convenience to people who don't want to go to the highway and fight traffic and the crowd."
Local movie houses are doing well throughout Bergen County, in communities like Hawthorne, Ridgewood, Rutherford, Teaneck and Washington Township.
Among the more successful operators of downtown theaters is the Clearview Cinema Group Inc. of Madison, N.J. Dale Mayo, president and chief executive officer of Clearview, moved into the movie management business 10 years ago when he and his partners re-opened the theater in Tenafly. They planned to build a mini-mall on the site of the town's shuttered theater but were persuaded by the mayor to re-open it. Since developing the five-screen theater in Tenafly, the company has resurrected or rescued theaters in several towns, including Bergenfield, Closter, Bernardsville, Chester, Madison, Emerson and Manasquan.
Clearview, which also owns downtown theaters in Westchester County, N.Y., and on Long Island, provides ammenities like courtesy phones for local calls, concession stands that offer healthy snacks, espresso and European chocolates and enhanced-listening devices for people who request them.
"Our theaters are especially appreciated by parents with young children and older people," Mr. Mayo said. Even successful independent operators acknowledge that every downtown theater can not be saved. Older theaters are more costly to renovate and bring into compliance with Federal requirements to make them accessible to the disabled. The value of the real estate makes it more profitable to replace old theaters with stores. They are also difficult to maintain, said Robert Roberts, president of Roberts Theaters, a group of independent theaters, who in the late 1970's created one of the first art houses in New Jersey, the Lost Picture Show, in Union.
"It took many years for the Lost Picture Show to prosper and survive," Mr. Roberts said. Part of his success is knowing his audience and choosing the right art, foreign and crossover films for his theaters, which include the Wellmont in Montclair and two rare, single-screen theaters, The Chatham in Chatham and The Brook in Bound Brook.
Bill Stampes, a local businessman who is trying to bring a theater back to downtown Summit is seeking $600,000 from potential investors for the $2.3 million cost of developing a new five-screen theater there.
"I am asking potential investors to think of what a movie theater will mean to Summit," said Mr. Stampes, who owns a Summit store that sells flooring
Many residents in Westfield believe the Rialto can be a viable operation, either as a first-run house or by specializing in art or foreign films not seen in the larger theaters.
"Our research shows that a movie theater in a compact downtown like ours is an essential anchor," said Michele Picou, executive director of Westfield MainStreet, a preservation group. "It's a key element in our night life, along with art galleries, coffee houses and restaurants."
Mr. Carlinsky, who is negotiating to buy the Rialto said that of the five independent theater operators he approached to run it, none thought it financially sound or could afford the rent.
Mr. Carlinsky, who has until mid-January to buy the property for $1.7 million, met with residents recently. In return for permission to put stores on the ground floor, he promised to give them air rights to develop a four-screen theater on the second floor. Mr. Owens said residents are feeling a little more optimistic.
"For nearly 75 years this has been a treasured institution," said Mr. Owens, speaking of the Rialto. "And we think it's valuable in the life of the town."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
A 'Gentle Presence' Off Court

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK

 BODY:
THERE was a point last May when he Secaucus Seven the seven sometimes disagreeing owners of the New Jersey Nets -- met to discuss selling what has long been one of the losingest teams in the N.B.A.
David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, had urged them to sell the franchise or change a hydra-headed ownership structure that had fostered a lethargic decision-making process. At the last moment, they chose to restructure, centralizing authority in a fellow owner who would become chairman and chief executive officer. 
 The man they picked, Henry Taub, owns a little more than 20 percent of the team and seems, on the surface, to be the least likely candidate to shape a more exciting identity. Quiet and unassuming, he had attended an occasional game but had shown little interest in daily operations. Unlike many owners who like to hobnob with the players, in the 18 years since he bought into the team with his younger, more gregarious brother, Joe, he had ventured into the locker room only once. That was many years ago, to congratulate the players on a victory that got them into the playoffs.
But Henry Taub, who is 69, had credentials that appeared to suit the task of setting policy and offering steadfast direction to an organization that has needed it: great success in business.
As a 21-year-old accountant, he created a company that began by preparing payrolls for dye houses out of an office above a luncheonette in his native Paterson. That company grew to become Automatic Data Processing.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who joined ADP in its infancy and resigned as its chairman when he won his Senate seat in 1982, called his longtime friend a modest man with a genius for organization and a philanthropist who created organizations that financed improvements in education in Paterson and provided 1,000 jobs to its residents.
"Henry is almost the ideal product of American opportunity," Mr. Lautenberg said.
Henry Taub's father, Morris, was a junk peddler, Paterson's last.
A native of Lodz, Poland, who had been conscripted into a German labor battalion during World War I, he came to America in the early 1920's. He began his trade in the Depression to support his wife and two sons after being laid off as a weaver and soon was making $20 to $30 a week when others could not find work. Long after the economic need passed and well into the late 1960's, his weathered, horse-drawn wagon remained a familiar sight on the streets of the old industrial city, its tinkling bell announcing the arrival of an anachronism.
He continued doing what others might find demeaning, because he liked the feeling of being out of doors and roaming the city, he told a reporter for the Paterson Morning Call in 1967. It had been his life.
"I give this thing up five years ago, but I started to feel bad," he said. "I feel better when I go out. The air makes me feel good."
Like many immigrants of his era, Morris Taub sacrificed so that his children could get an education.
"That was the ladder," Henry Taub said recently. "That was the American ladder."
Mr. Taub was sitting in his spartan office in the Taub Foundation in Hackensack, a philanthropy he founded 20 years ago, recalling the education he got not only at School No. 6, where he skipped two grades, and New York University, from which he graduated in three years at age 19, but the education he received from the streets and working.
Carroll Street, where he and his brother grew up, was a melange of working class people, immigrants with widely varying political views.
"The streets were just filled with people and kids and debate and excitement," he recalled, "and from my point of view, intellectual fervor."
HE got his first job at age 12 in a downtown Paterson grocery store and in high school worked for a freight company called Associated Transport, one of a battery of typists preparing freight bills and forwarding documents, an experience that he says gave him his first taste of how work can be efficiently organized.
While at N.Y.U., studying accounting, he worked part-time for several accounting firms doing "write-ups" for companies that had no bookkeepers, preparing payrolls. In this experience, too, lay the seeds for ADP.
On graduation in 1947 he went to work full time for an accounting firm. One day, a client, a women's clothing firm in the garment district that was having labor problems, had a crisis: a salesman had a heart attack and the payroll could not be prepared on time. The employees walked out.
The experience showed what Mr. Taub calls "the critical timing in payroll" and prompted him and two friends to form ADP. But the business was slow to prosper, Mr. Taub said, and the two partners dropped out.
The company began in 1949 in a large room above Grinker's, a luncheonette on Church Street, next to The Morning Call newspaper, he said. After the partners left, the company for a time was Mr. Taub and "a bunch" of part-time employees.
"Paterson dye houses were our first major area of opportunity," he said. "And we'd get many a client by proving to them that they were calculating the payroll erroneously."
Beginning in 1950, his brother came aboard and in 1952, by the time the company had moved to the basement of the old Carroll Plaza Hotel on Market Street, an insurance salesman, Frank Lautenberg, who had been a Paterson neighbor, joined.
Senator Lautenberg recalled 12- and 15-hour days, six days a week for at least seven years, with Henry Taub in charge of organizing the work, Joe Taub in charge of production and Mr. Lautenberg in charge of sales.
"We'd finish at 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock at night and he'd say, 'Let's clean up,' " Mr. Lautenberg recalled. "And Joe and I would look at one another and look at him and say, 'What's wrong with you? We just put in a 14-hour day. What do you mean, 'We're going to clean up?' The place is clean enough.' And he'd say, 'We're not leaving this place until the place is so clean we can't make mistakes.' "
Mr. Lautenberg laughed and said: "He was an incredible, soft-spoken driving force."
By 1961, when the company went public, it had gross revenues of $600,000 and earnings of only $20,000 after taxes. The company, which is based in Roseland, now has $3.5 billion in revenues and operates worldwide.
When it started, the name was Automatic Payrolls. The word "automatic" meant something to Paterson, Mr. Taub reasoned, because of the introduction of automatic weaving machines in the city. To him it meant automation and advanced approaches to work.
"Then in 1957, we moved into the age of punch cards," Mr. Taub recalled. "They preceded computers. So we changed the company's name, because we went beyond payroll processing to data processing.
He added, "We called ourselves Automatic Data Processing, not realizing we were creating a generic term which would identify a whole industry that would emerge."
Joe Taub, who played basketball at Eastside High School and is known for his love of the game and sports in general, was instrumental in getting a group of businessmen to buy the Nets in 1978 and served as president for five years. His brother was one of them.
Retired and holding the post now of honorary chairman of ADP and chairman of the executive committee, Henry Taub has time to give to the Nets, but he still avoids the locker room.
"There were six other partners floating around the locker room and I didn't think that I had anything to add to the situation," Mr. Taub said. "I believe in putting professionals in place and letting them do the job, supporting them in the best way possible."
Michael Rowe, the former general manager of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who was hired as the president of the Nets in October 1995 before the restructuring, called his boss's management style, "a gentle presence."
B UT, Mr. Rowe added, "In Henry's own way, he makes known that he's the chairman when he has to and he does it privately. He doesn't need to do it publicly. He doesn't need to have a parking spot with his name on it or 15 credentials and walk in and out of the locker room."
Mr. Taub, however, is getting to know the players and their families on an individual basis. And whenever he does talk with the new coach, John Calipari, after a slow start (5 wins, 11 losses as of Thursday), Mr. Rowe said, it's to offer support and reassurance.
Morris Taub died at the age of 91 in 1988, shortly after the death of his wife, Sylvia. Henry Taub likes to think of his father as an "entrepeneur." In describing him, he could be speaking of himself. "He enjoyed work. He enjoyed being on his own. He was very independent and very self-reliant."
Back in 1967, Morris Taub asked the reporter not to use his name in the story because he thought it might cause problems for his sons.
"They keep telling me, 'you don't have to work," ' he said. "You would know them if I told their names. They're very important businessmen."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MANHATTAN UP CLOSE;
The Howard Stern of Cable

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
The setting: Metro Access, a low-budget TV studio on East 23d Street.
The time: Tuesday at 10:30 P.M. 
 The character: Paul Joffe, hyperactive host of "Car Talk," a public access cable TV show that is broadcast each week in Manhattan on Channel 16.
With 30 seconds until air time, the studio's five call-in lines are already flashing. Mr. Joffe, 35, covers his mechanic's uniform with an ill-fitting Santa suit, opens a bottle of Colt 45 and raises the ragged microphone to his lips. "It's time again for the Salty Santa Show," booms Mr. Joffe, as footage from "It's a Wonderful Life" fills the background. "What can Santa get you?" he asks the first caller, who responds with a string of expletives. Click.
And so begins Paul Joffe's weekly 30 minutes of low-level fame. For Mr. Joffe, an out-of-work radio shock jock, public access offers the kind of exposure money can't buy. Under public access rules, the air time is free. "You'd think all of New York's unemployed actors would be lining up for a slot, but it's so easy to get on the air," he said after the show, which includes 10 minutes of hypnosis and almost no car talk, a theme he chose at random.
Mr. Joffe, who lost his last radio job in Key West, Fla., for insulting the children's TV character Barney, is one of the more popular of at least 500 self-made television stars who appear on Manhattan Cable's four public access channels. But Mr. Joffe's weekly dose of notoriety, he says, only fuels his appetite for greater celebrity. "The real reason I do it is to maybe get hired to do a radio show," he conceded. "Public access just gets me out of the house."
By day, Mr. Joffe combs the wastelands of industrial Brooklyn looking for undervalued buildings to develop. He also takes helicopter lessons and runs a hypnotherapy practice for actors. "The first thing I'll do when I get rich is buy a helicopter with a P.A. system so I can hover above Columbus Circle and regale people with my poetry," said Mr. Joffe, who grew up on the Upper West Side and lives in TriBeCa.
For now, he makes do with a pickup truck, which features a pair of high-powered speakers mounted under the chassis. Last week, as he drove through midtown blasting the theme song from "Flipper," Mr. Joffe bemoaned the difficulty of getting attention in a city packed with attention-starved performers.
While stopped at a red light on Park Avenue, Mr. Joffe grabbed the goose-neck microphone above his steering wheel and shouted out a poem to the midday lunch crowd. "Curb your dog/the thick foul smell/ whole wheat bread/you tried to sell," he boomed to blase pedestrians. Disappointed with the response, he shouted out a few more verses, slightly more profane. "That did it," he said, content with a few glares. "This sure beats watching reruns of 'Kojak.' " ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: Daring to Wear Fur In Spite of Protests

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON 

 BODY:
ALLA ZELIKOVSKY walks to work on Fifth Avenue every day in a long, silky mink coat. "I came all the way from Russia 23 years ago," said Mrs. Zelikovsky, a skin specialist at Elizabeth Arden, "and I won't be told what to do."
Neither will many other women, who say they are so fed up with the tactics of some fur protesters that they are wearing fur with a new fear-free, militant attitude. 
 Many who stopped wearing fur in recent years are out and about in luxurious animal skins again. Indeed, Fifth and Madison Avenues are so densely populated with minks and sables that it looks like a reprise of the opulent 1980's.
"All my friends have started wearing fur again," said Joy Rosenthal, the president of the Rosenthal Bee jewelry company, who said she used to be "a little afraid" and was once confronted by noisy protesters. Now, she wears her three sables and a red mink "daringly -- I don't care."
With the economy strong and memories lingering of last winter's cold spells -- the two most influential sales factors, according to the Fur Information Council -- furriers report that business is brisk.
Jack Pearson, the director of sales at the Fur Salon at Saks Fifth Avenue, said business in October and November tripled over the same period last year. And Dennis Basso, of Dennis Basso Furs in New York, said his sales are up 35 percent over last year. "The tactics of fur activists turned people off," he said.
Dan Mathews, the campaign director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal-rights group, is firm that the movement is not losing ground. He calls fur council statistics reporting an increase in sales -- from $1 billion in 1991 to $1.2 billion last year -- a public-relations line. "They are trying to revive a dying industry," he said.
The group, which says it has 500,000 members in the United States, stands by its tactics, ranging from a sit-in in front of the Fendi and Revillon shops on Fifth Avenue several weeks ago to a protest last week outside Vogue magazine, whose editor, Anna Wintour, announced in the September issue that she wears fur. (Another group, Friends of Animals, showed up outside the Conde Nast building on Friday.) "I have no qualms about bothering people on the streets," Mr. Mathews said.
He says that his group gets frequent reports of protesters splattering coats with paint but that the extent of such incidents is difficult to confirm. "We've been instructed that it has happened, but it is very rare," said Police Officer Kevin Tyrell, a spokesman for the New York City Police Department, which does not keep statistics on these incidents.
"I never had that happen," said Nancy Corzine, who owns furniture and textile showrooms around the country. "I wear mine all the time."
In the newly emboldened environment, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's are expanding fur salons in their stores, and Revillon has just opened an opulent Fifth Avenue store. The fur council says the number of designers working with fur has also increased, from 42 in 1985 to more than 150 today.
Among them are Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, whose styles appeal especially to young customers.
"I don't have an emotional problem with fur," said Mr. Jacobs, who uses ermine, sable and shearling. "If people choose not to eat meat, then they don't. If people choose not to wear fur, then they don't."
Other designers, like Bill Blass and Carolina Herrera, continue to shun fur and use fakes instead. Ironically, the protesters may have made the streets safe for fur wearers by spurring interest in fakes: it can be impossible to tell if a fur is real.
As one woman said, she is wearing her old leopard coat for the first time in many years. "There is so much faux leopard on the streets," she said. "Who can tell the difference?"
Mrs. Corzine is typical of women who say they are comfortable wearing skins of ranch-raised animals.
"I'm an animal lover," she said. "But I feel that furs are like shoes: we all wear shoes. Mink and sable are produced to be used as furs, and nothing in the whole world makes a woman feel more luxurious and feminine than a fur."
Except, as animal-rights advocates might say, a fake fur.

HEADLINE: Will Ford Become The New Repo Man?;
Financial Powerhouse Takes Aim at Bad Credit Risks

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.

 BODY:
HENRY FORD famously insisted that buyers could have any color of car they wanted, as long as it was black. But he was just as reluctant to offer them credit. Only in 1923, two decades after he began selling cars, did he begin to experiment, cautiously, with financing.
Ford customers could buy a $265 Model T on layaway, paying $5 a week for a year. Only then were they allowed to drive the shiny black car home. (Not until four years later did Mr. Ford give in to demands for more colors.) 
 Ford long ago overcame its founder's misgivings about making loans. With Americans now financing four-fifths of all new cars, the Ford Motor Company has earned more as a banker than as a car builder in five of the last six years. Its banking businesses had higher profits last year than all but two of the nation's commercial banks.
And while Ford's automotive divisions are struggling to hold up against stiff competition worldwide, a subsidiary, the Ford Motor Credit Company, has become the biggest auto financing company in the world. In the third quarter, Ford Credit earned $299 million, compared with a paltry $15 million for the company's worldwide automotive operations.
Now Ford Credit has an ambitious plan to extend its lending reach into an area that would have baffled Henry Ford: borrowers with proven records of not paying back their loans on time, a group collectively known as the subprime lending market.
The lure is the $100 billion that people with flawed credit ratings borrow each year to buy new and used cars, and the interest rates of 18 percent and higher that Ford will be able to charge on loans to its share of that market. That is the equivalent of paying for a car at credit-card rates.
Ford Credit's new business is risky on two counts. First, whether a company makes money depends on which loan applicants it decides to trust, and how far it trusts them before sending out the repo man to seize the collateral. Secondly, Ford's image could be damaged if the company is seen as profiting at the expense of the poor.
Consumer advocates already say a Ford consumer lending unit, the Associates, charges unfairly steep interest rates and fees. That unit's target market is similar to that of the new subprime auto-finance operation, named Fairlane Credit after Henry Ford's gracious Fair Lane estate here.
"Ford Motor Credit doesn't want to be seen charging 40 percent interest rates or repossessing cars," said Jordan Hymowitz, an auto services analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It is a potential public relations problem if the rates get too egregious."
But at a time when profits are down and default rates are up at Ford Credit, the cornerstone of Ford's financial businesses, its executives say they have studied the companies in the subprime lending market, are proceeding cautiously and are confident they can make good money.
Ford is also planning to move slowly to build its new business. "We aren't going to make any big, bad boo-boos" with Fairlane, William E. Odom, the chairman of Ford Credit, said.
But he said he expected Fairlane's returns to be more volatile than its parent's. Fairlane must be tough enough to compete with the dozens of scrappy, small companies that dominate subprime auto lending. But Fairlane will be walking a tightrope, particularly on the repossessions that come after people stop making car payments.
"If we pull the trigger too quickly on a repo, the customer is going to be upset with us and with the Ford Motor Company," Jerry Heimlicher, president of Fairlane, said.
Mr. Heimlicher said that Fairlane had not decided what interest rates it would charge, but that he expected them to be in a range of 18 to 22 percent, and perhaps higher. While other subprime lenders charge rates of 18 to 40 percent, where state laws permit, Mr. Heimlicher said Fairlane's rates "will never get into the range of 40 percent."
He added, "We are going to charge the fairest rates that we can charge, and still make a fair rate of profit."
Fairlane is planning to hold the line on rates because it hopes to build loyalty to Ford vehicles. One reason Ford Credit chose the name Fairlane is that executives want customers to think of it as "fair."
Mr. Odom said consumer groups should not fear that Fairlane will treat poor customers unfairly. "It is not inconsistent to go into the nonprime business and run the business on the high road," he said.
When deciding whether to approve loan applications, lenders look at two factors: borrowers' income, and their record of repaying other loans. They often charge higher interest rates to people they consider less likely to pay them back.
FORD CREDIT now lends primarily to the most creditworthy borrowers, what the industry rates as A or B credit risks, though it makes some loans to people with very poor credit. As Fairlane starts up, Ford Credit will begin referring the loan applicants it rejects to Fairlane, to see if they qualify under its underwriting standards for higher-interest loans.
Ford Credit assigns A ratings to people who earn enough to meet their bills without strain and have almost never paid a bill late, Mr. Odom said. Borrowers with B credit have occasionally missed payments but later paid up, and lack financial reserves to cover emergencies; people with C credit are highly indebted and often late with bills, but always pay up eventually.
Borrowers with D credit typically have declared bankruptcy and have had property repossessed. They end up paying lots of late charges because they never pay on time. "They try to juggle, but they drop the ball when they juggle," Mr. Odom said. "The C can juggle pretty well."
Fairlane will focus on the lower end of the scale. "Fairlane will pick up where Ford Credit leaves off," Mr. Heimlicher said. "We would be going into the C and D and what would be an E, if there were an E."
Customers will feel the difference when they apply for a loan. While Ford Credit uses sophisticated computer models to approve loans within an hour, Fairlane may take days to check the assertions made on loan applications.
The more thorough process is intended to sort out people who have bad credit but will repay their loans from those who are unlikely to make payments. Fairlane's customers are likely to have bad credit because of a one-time crisis like a layoff or a divorce, Mr. Heimlicher said.
"Our main process is to determine the why -- why did the customer have the difficulty," he said. "These are not bums -- these are not always people who are going to have bad luck."
Once Fairlane approves a loan, it plans to keep in close contact with anyone who misses a payment. Mr. Heimlicher calls it "coaching": When borrowers fall behind, the company will not simply mail overdue notices but will call the debtors, weigh whether there are legitimate reasons for the late payments, and then try to coax them into promising, for example, to pay when the next paycheck arrives.
While most subprime lenders focus on used cars, Fairlane plans to lend 20 percent of its money toward new cars, particularly to first-time buyers like students who have had trouble paying off credit cards or college loans.
Fairlane, based in Colorado Springs, is still hiring managers. Ford's goal is for it to begin making loans in Colorado and nearby states by the end of March. Expansion is planned for later.
Ford intends to tiptoe into the new lending market. "I'm not looking for a home run in 1997," Mr. Odom said. "I'm looking for a solid organization at the turn of the century."
But executives at other subprime auto lenders say it isn't easy to make money. "Our job is to differentiate between bad things happening to good people, and just bad people," said Tommy A. Moore, chief executive of First Investors Financial Services Inc., a Houston-based company that writes subprime auto loans in 17 states. His company approves only one of every five applications.
Mr. Moore and other experts on subprime lending said that being choosy in approving loans was only part of the job. Even tougher, they said, is counseling people who are struggling to pay bills while still moving to repossess cars as soon as it is clear that a borrower will not be able to repay.
But subprime auto lending is a tough business. Since 1990, 24 auto-finance companies have sold stock to the public, according to SNL Securities of Charlottesville, Va. Since their initial offerings, shares of 11 of the companies have dropped by 15 percent or more.
Unless Fairlane fails, it is likely to dwarf its competitors within a few years, if it follows the lead of another new Ford Credit subsidiary, Primus Automotive Financial Services.
Ford Credit lends only to Ford customers and dealers, but Primus was set up to lend money at rival dealerships. Just six years old, Primus has $11.5 billion in assets. Though it is a relatively small piece of Ford Credit's business, Primus, if freestanding, would be the nation's 12th-largest finance company.
Fairlane won't get that big in its first five years but "it will have some recognizable-sized profits in three, four or five years," Mr. Odom said.
Analysts say that to make money, Ford will have to show some ruthlessness in repossessing cars. "This is a business where you measure your ability to collect your collateral in days or hours," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz, a New York investment banking and brokerage firm.
Otherwise, another creditor could seize the car, or the borrower could drive out of town with no forwarding address.
Yet the danger of ruthlessness is that it could attract the attention of consumer groups, some of which are already unhappy with the lending practices of the Associates, the Ford unit that makes home-equity and personal loans.
Ford Motor "owns some finance companies that target poor people with less than healthy loans," said Remar M. Sutton, president of the Consumer Task Force for Automotive Issues, a nonprofit group that works with consumer groups and state attorneys general on auto fraud investigations.
The auto lending practices of Ford Credit and its main rivals, the finance arms of the Chrysler and General Motors corporations, are already under Federal scrutiny. Last year the Justice Department began investigating whether the companies discriminated against minority groups. "There is an investigation and I can't make any comments about it," Mr. Odom said.
Fairlane Credit will be relying heavily on the ethics of used-car dealers -- many of whom stand to profit from the loans -- to make sure its customers are treated fairly.
The unscrupulous practices of some dealerships have led to trouble for people borrowing from other auto finance companies. "It is the people who don't have access to credit who are most at the mercy of these people: new- and used-car dealers," said Richard N. Feferman, a lawyer in Albuquerque, N.M., who specializes in consumer fraud issues.
WALL STREET, of course, cares about profits as well as lending practices. And profits of the Associates have been growing steadily. Like Ford Credit, it has watched its bad loans increase, to 2.16 percent of all loans in the third quarter, but it is growing so quickly that its profits have also increased, to $230 million in the third quarter, up 17 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts, however, are divided over whether Ford Credit itself, after years as the crown jewel of the world's second-largest industrial company, could be facing difficulties. The number of loans going bad has nearly doubled, and in the third quarter Ford Credit's usually stable profits fell 16.2 percent from a year earlier, to $299 million.
Most analysts say that in the long run, Ford Credit will dust itself off and continue to contribute mightily to the parent's bottom line. "I have no doubt about Ford Credit," Ms. Keller said. "With some bumps in the road, they will still do just fine."
But other analysts are more concerned. "There is a big question hanging over Ford Motor Credit right now," said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "It is certainly disconcerting to see the significant drop we saw in third-quarter net income."
Ford Credit's main competitors -- the finance subsidiaries of General Motors and Chrysler -- have been going gangbusters. The Chrysler Financial Corporation, which has $16.7 billion in assets, has set quarterly earnings records this year. In the third quarter, it earned $94 million. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which has $106.5 billion in assets, has set profit records for the last nine quarters, earning $307 million in the third quarter.
Counting overseas operations, Ford Credit has assets of $119 billion.
While Chrysler Financial and GMAC also make a small proportion of loans to car buyers with spotty credit, they have avoided getting into the business in a big way. "There is no free lunch," said James P. Holden, the Chrysler Corporation's executive vice president for sales and marketing. "Subprime paper is subprime for a reason."
Ford has decided to make the bet. While its banking businesses have not always been successful, no one is suggesting that Ford Credit will become a billion-dollar sinkhole like the First Nationwide Financial Corporation, a savings and loan institution that Ford sold in 1994 after nine years of ownership.
Ford's nearly bulletproof balance sheet allows it to borrow money at lower interest rates than many of its rivals can obtain, giving it more room to trim the rates it charges on car loans while staying profitable. Just last month, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its A+ rating on Ford Credit's senior debt, the best debt rating by a wide margin among the auto financing arms of the Big Three auto makers.
The level of Ford Credit's profits is important because the unit is the mainstay of Ford's earnings. Last year, $2.1 billion of Ford's $4.1 billion in profit came from the banking side of the business, and Ford Credit earned $1.4 billion of that. Most of the rest came from the Associates.
Ford Credit's earnings have been down mostly because of rising losses from unpaid loans. In addition to a $58 million drop in third-quarter profits from a year earlier, profits in the second quarter fell $9 million short of the previous year's level. First-quarter profits were just $5 million ahead of last year's pace.
Other lenders have been stepping up their efforts to woo borrowers buying cars. Commercial banks have increasingly been willing to offer competitive rates on auto loans as a way to develop financial relationships with affluent borrowers, the customers the banks prefer.
"Those buyers are pretty well-heeled," Mr. Holden of Chrysler said. "They may need other financial services."
Ford officials dismiss these worries, arguing that the banks' interest will be fleeting. Mr. Odom said profits had temporarily slipped because of fierce competition from commercial banks, as five years of economic growth have helped banks to rebuild their balance sheets and begin lending aggressively again. Ford Credit's profits had also dropped during previous economic booms, he said, only to recover quickly.
BY any measure, Ford Credit customers are having a harder time paying back loans these days. Credit losses nearly doubled in the third quarter, said David N. McCammon, the Ford Motor Company's vice president for finance, at a mid-October briefing. He said losses might rise, but not to the level reached in 1989 at the peak of the last economic boom.
Ford's loan losses are usually worst when commercial banks are at their best, he said. Many other lenders are facing rising default rates as consumers pile on debt.
Ford Credit's loan losses jumped in the third quarter to 0.89 percent, from 0.48 percent a year earlier. Mr. Odom said the higher losses provided "a loud wake-up call, if you didn't already get it, but of course we already got it."
He said he had been scrutinizing credit losses since August 1995, and "I'm pretty well satisfied that the increases have flattened out."
Ford Credit executives rely on the company to contribute more than profits to the parent. Edsel B. Ford 2d, president of Ford Credit and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, said in a statement this month, "The potential to cement the relationship between Ford Credit and the customer is tremendous during the two to five years of financing repayment."
Still, competitors in the subprime auto-lending business said Ford was entering the risky market in a difficult period. At a time of record bankruptcy filings and high levels of credit card debt, "there is a lot of money being thrown at the consumer," said Mr. Moore of First Investors Financial Services. "From that standpoint, I guess they are picking a bad time."
Ford officials beg to differ. "Actually, it is an opportunity," said Mr. Heimlicher, the president of Fairlane Credit. "These are the times when people need help -- this is the right time to be stepping in."
Mr. Odom agrees. "It is a perfect time to start, while everybody else might be getting nervous," he said.
William H. Ryan, a senior specialty finance analyst at Smith Barney, said Ford's high credit rating and correspondingly low cost of borrowing would give it an advantage. But he cautioned that just as some Ford car designs flop, many subprime auto finance companies fail.
Fairlane Credit, he said, "could turn out to be an Edsel."

The Financial Services Group
 
Ford Motor Company had total revenue of $34 billion and net income of $686 million in the third quarter of this year. Nearly all of its profit, or $671 million, came from the financial services group. Here's a look at that group's components and how they did in the latest period.

Ford Motor Credit Company Net income $299 million
The unit, with 14,800 employees and about $100 billion in total assets, is primarily an auto lender and leasing company serving both consumers and dealers. It has three significant subsidiaries:
Primus Automotive Financial Services Inc., with $11.5 billion in assets, finances autos at non-Ford dealerships.
 The American Road Insurance Company, with $1.2 billion in assets, offers auto insurance to drivers and dealerships.
 Fairlane Credit, scheduled to start next year, will lend at above-market rates to people who are considered high credit risks.

The Associates Corporation of North America Net income $186 million
It is the second-biggest independent finance company in the United States, and is owned 80.7 percent by Ford. The remainder is publicly held. (Ford booked $186 million of the Associates' total $230 million in net income.) The company offers a wide range of consumer products -- home equity lines, credit cards and personal loans -- as well as commercial finance and insurance services.
 
USL Capital Net income $117 million
Ford has been selling off this diversified commercial finance business piecemeal all year. Ford sold the last piece in the third quarter, resulting in a one-time gain of $76 million that brought the unit's net income to $117 million.
 
Hertz Net income $74 million
The nation's biggest rental car company. (Although Ford owns the nonvoting preferred stock in Budget Rent A Car, it has reportedly run into antitrust problems in its bid to acquire all of Budget, which has not contributed in some time to Ford's profits.)
 
International businesses Net income $61 million
Includes auto lending in Europe, Taiwan, Brazil and Argentina, managed by Ford Credit, with $19 billion in assets.

Interest payments and losses Net income -$66 million
Mostly from debt payments related to its stake in The Associates and from other, smaller businesses within the Financial Services Group.

LEAVING DISNEY
 
Hollywood's Edgy Galaxy
These Hollywood big shots just can't seem to sit still. A year ago, Michael S. Ovitz was officially just a talent agent, but everyone knew he was practically running Hollywood single-handedly. Then, for some reason, he decided to get a taste of life inside the system, and deigned -- for untold millions, of course -- to take the No. 2 job at Disney. Well, scratch that idea. Even in the sunniest of climes, apparently, there is room for only one superstar at any given company. At Disney, that is Michael D. Eisner. Period. And last week Mr. Ovitz bowed to the inevitable and resigned -- getting, of course, untold millions in severance. (You don't want to know how many.)
 
STOCK MARKET
 
Musical Chairs, Wall St.-Style
This stock market is like a game of musical chairs in which the adults get confused and keep adding chairs instead of snatching them away. The screaming kids just keep running around, wondering how long the fun will last. They're nervous, though -- always watching to see if the adults will catch on -- and occasionally they flinch, as they did last week, when the Dow industrials tumbled for two days in a row. But the game has been going on so long that no one seems to believe it can ever end. Just look at the words they use, or don't use. The market never really "falls" -- in the sense of, yes, actually heading down for a while. No, it's always a "correction" -- the only right and proper direction is up, and any deviation is just an adjustment. And those extra chairs? They are, of course, those mutual fund dollars that keep pouring in. But just how many chairs are there?
 
BOARD ROOMS
 
It's a Guy Thing, Still
November saw a lot of huffing and puffing about the women's vote, but for the real news, look at the statistics on campaign contributions: Business, they show, runs the country. And who runs business? Well, an excellent place to start would be the 6,123 directors at Fortune 500 companies. And yes, yes, for all the talk of women charging ahead, this is still overwhelmingly a male preserve. Only 626 of those board members -- barely 10 percent -- are women, according to a new report by the research group Catalyst. Those relentless optimists who insist, when spying a few water droplets, on seeing a half-full glass will take comfort in this 10 percent milestone. But that entrenched 90 percent is ceding power only by millimeters. This becomes starkly clear when you look at the next number: of 1,216 inside directors, just 11 are women. It's insiders who run the show.
 
SPENDING SPREE
 
Overpriced? I'll Take It
Close your eyes, and you can hear America spending. In December, people who look totally sane to the untrained eye -- well, somehow they just lose it. We've become master bargain-hunters, though: Neither sleet nor curbside Santas will keep us from slogging to the discount store. But there's another America out there, mainly invisible to coupon-clipping mortals -- people seemingly incapable of buying anything unless it costs about 10 times what it should. Maybe it's a weird point of pride, or maybe a genetic disorder, but the number of people buying luxury goods is growing like crazy. Neiman Marcus had this strange idea of listing a mere automobile -- a limited-edition Jaguar -- in its catalogue for $75,000; it sold all 50 in eight days. In what had to be a typo, Patek Philippe offered a watch for $44,500; they're on back order. (A watch! For $17.95, you can get one that keeps perfect time!) It goes on. While sales of most stuff toddle along at about a 5 percent annual growth rate, for luxury stuff, they've been growing at 18 percent -- and, by all reports, even faster these days.
 
JAPAN
 
Sticking With Hondas, Thanks
So what did Detroit expect? When trade negotiators pried open Japan's car market a bit, did General Motors and friends really think the Japanese would scurry to trade in their Toyotas and Hondas for Cavaliers and Neons? Apparently so, for the Americans dutifully churned out some right-hand-drive models and set some lofty sales goals. But they aren't even coming close to those targets, partly because of the widespread notion that the cars just aren't as good. And this problem clearly isn't helped by the reviews the cars get in Japan. Buyers of the Cavalier, one commentator wrote, "are either nuts or people who sincerely worry about the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance."
 
THE ECONOMY
 
The Zen of Statistics
Economic statistics are the mud pies of our glorious democracy; politicians hurl them for sport. But are they always accurate? Let's see. There was that little flap recently when a panel of experts said the Consumer Price Index was, well, a little off, costing taxpayers some obscene number of billions. So can statistics lie? Of course. Politicians twist them, manipulate them -- they're like sausage: you don't want to know what's done with them. But in Singapore, the practice is frowned upon. A politician in the frail opposition misstated a statistic about health costs -- an accident, he said. He was fined, he faces ruinous lawsuits and he nearly went to jail. A model for our error-filled times? Hardly. When you think about the iron fist of Singapore's rulers, creative statistics suddenly don't seem so bad.
 
CATALOGUES
 
Thinking Fleece? Think Fast
Haven't done your shopping? No time this week? You could simply skip the whole overblown affair -- but no: joy is mandatory this time of year. So it's got to be the catalogue, the last refuge of the mall-averse. Be warned, though: if you've been spoiled into thinking L.L. Bean and Lands' End and their multiple cousins are bottomless pits of the plaid and the cuddly, think again. Things are different this year: paper prices are lower, which means the companies sent out even more catalogues; inventories were kept low, based on last year's poor sales; the weather's cold, prodding people to think fleece and fluff; and, well, people are spending more. A result: if you've waited until now to order by catalogue, you may be out of luck. The dreaded mall awaits.
 
NORWAY
 
What? Invest in People?
Speaking of welfare states -- all the talk that they're doomed to failure -- there's something downright un-American going on in Norway. One company owner has this ridiculous idea that he should make only about twice what his employees do; any boss here would be laughed out of his country club if he took home any less than 100 times his workers' salaries. Norwegians, it seems, have these odd egalitarian notions -- and have turned them into a welfare state with broad health benefits, financial protection for children, even a proposed "Lifelong Learning" plan, giving workers time off to sharpen their skills. In short, Norway -- rich in oil, yes, but with a different philosophy, too -- invests in people, not multimillion-dollar salaries for the few. Downright un-American.
 
COMPUTERS
 
Naughty? Nice? Nerds?
No, Santa's headquarters has not computerized -- as far as anyone knows, anyhow. These are technicians hunting for computer viruses at the Symantec Anti-Virus Research Center in California. They find plenty.

A Country Burgers Can't Save

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF McDonald's restaurants are a harbinger of Western institutions and democracy, Belarus has a lot of Big Macs yet to swallow.
The country's first McDonald's opened last week, in Minsk, the capital. But this watershed event produced a riot among 4,000 people who thought they'd get free fries. 
 Then the police, as befits the constitutional dictatorship that Belarus has now become, waled away with their clubs.
In time, McDonald's may help to produce a peace-loving democracy in Belarus, but for now its experience only serves to point up the incoherent, even bizarre, politics of the lands that lie just beyond the Central European countries that NATO is trying to absorb. It tells a lot about why countries like Poland and the Czech Republic are so eager to join NATO, but also points up some of the dangers if they do.
Over the last few weeks, President Aleksandr Lukashenko has effectively seized power in Belarus, and aside from the magic of McDonald's, the United States doesn't have many effective levers with which to encourage him to back down.
 
 
 
A Dictator Rises
 The unpredictable Mr. Lukashenko has carried out a rolling coup: manipulating a referendum to extend his term and powers; shutting down the parliament and recreating one limited to his supporters; pushing the resignation of members of the constitutional court and the chief prosecutor, and blocking the distribution of independent newspapers.
"Lukashenko has taken over the Government through nondemocratic means," a senior American official said. "This is now a constitutional dictatorship in the heart of the new Europe, right on the borders of where NATO is going to expand, and there's not a lot we can do about it."
Belarus, while a tragedy, is not yet a crisis. But it is, writ small, an example of worrisome trends throughout the former Soviet Union, where presidential manipulation or distortion of short-lived democratic institutions are something of a norm.
In Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and even Armenia, there have been egregious examples of electoral manipulation or an overstepping of presidential powers in the name of efficiency and economic reform.
At the same time, Russia itself has grown more haughty toward its former colonies, with demands, backed up through pressure on energy supplies, for better economic, trade and military ties.
No one has loudly objected when Russia has turned imperiously toward the east and Central Asia. But the west -- Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic nations -- is quite a different matter. These are the "borderlands" between Europe and Asia, between the powers of the East and West, and this makes them a source of nervousness for everyone. Mr. Lukashenko himself, a populist former collective farm boss, is considered highly unreliable.
Paul A. Goble, a former intelligence analyst and now assistant director of Radio Free Europe, says that when NATO moves eastward to take in Poland, the Russians may say in response, " 'We have to project power,' and Moscow is likely to do that through Belarus."
A senior American official agreed, then asked: "And where does that put Ukraine? That's why Belarus is important."
Mr. Lukashenko, who is thought to have political ambitions in Russia, has called for the reunification of Minsk with Moscow, and has offered to station nuclear weapons in Belarus to counter any NATO deployments in new member countries -- an option that NATO, for now, says is unnecessary. Ukraine, on the other hand, would only fear a greater Russian presence and pressure to its north.
The United States and its allies have condemned events in Belarus and the American Ambassador, Kenneth Yalowitz, has been called back to help think through what to do about the country, in talks scheduled for Friday.
 
 
 
A Lack of Clout
 But Washington has little to work with to overturn the swing to dictatorship. The United States is providing about $225 million in aid to Ukraine, about $100 million to Russia and $95 million to Armenia, but Belarus gets only about $5 million, nearly all of it going to nongovernmental institutions that are still trying to "build democracy" in a place where it is being snuffed out. And cutting off that aid would not cause Mr. Lukashenko any pain.
Washington has also offered and committed $118 million over the last four years to pay for the removal of Belarus's nuclear warheads and missiles (now accomplished to great sighs of relief) and the destruction of launching pads, silos, garages and so on (crucial jobs still left to do).
But yearly certification, based in part on progress in human rights and democracy, is required for this money to be spent, and President Clinton can't waive this requirement, even on national-security grounds. Ironically, then, the Administration may be forced to withhold the money it wants to spend in Belarus without any prospect that withholding it will produce any change for the better.
To further the dilemma, the one actor with leverage on Belarus is Russia. But therein lies a Catch-22. "We want to keep Russia engaged, but we don't want to reinforce the sense that Belarus belongs to the Russian sphere of influence," an official said ruefully. "That could be very counterproductive."

 BODY:
Thinking of buying your loved one the $350 sterling silver Slinky they're selling at Neiman-Marcus or the $850 Montblanc pen introduced two months ago? You'd better get a move on for the Slinky (going fast), and forget about the pen (sold out). Scratch the $400 gray flannel Prada stretch pants and the $4,000 Hermes Kelly bag off your list too (also sold out). Just about any luxury good (translation: hideously expensive) is selling these days.
So just what has consumers pulling out the gold cards? Retailers and economists say that baby boomers are moving into their peak earning years. Incomes of the wealthiest Americans are rising sharply and the stock market has been running like a bull in a Tiffany's shop. 
 The result: "People have lightened up," said Dan Phillips, associate publisher of the Robb Report, a magazine that focuses on luxury lifestyles. "The luxury industry is alive and well. It's acceptable to be well off again." DANA CANEDY

In Spanish, It's Another Story

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
ONE Friday early this month, ABC, CBS and NBC all began their nightly newscasts with the same story: the testimony of Nicole Brown Simpson's mother at the latest O. J. Simpson trial.
Two other American networks, though, did not report that news until well after the first commercial break. Instead, they opened with a story that was less sensational but of more significance to their viewers: the Mexican Senate's approval of legislation that would allow Mexicans who become American citizens to have dual nationality. 
 The United States looks like a different country -- less self-absorbed and self-contained, and more a member of a community of nations -- when it is seen through the Spanish-language television newscasts of Univision and Telemundo, networks that are helping transform Spanish-speaking immigrants into an entity called "Hispanics."
At the same time, these networks, based here in Miami, play a role more intricate than that of their English-language counterparts. Not only do they track and explain developments in the United States and Latin America to this country's potential 25 million Hispanic viewers, but they have also become one of the main prisms through which Latin Americans throughout the hemisphere view their own countries.
 
 
 
Another World
 "Even though ABC calls its broadcast 'World News Tonight,' what I see when I look at any of the English-language networks is not the world," said Jorge Ramos, a Mexican who, along with Maria Elena Salinas, anchors "Noticiero Univision," the most influential and highest rated Spanish-language news program in the United States. "If you compare the kind of world that we cover in comparison to what they have in mind, you'll definitely see that our world is broader and more complex, with a very different perspective."
According to a 1994 study published by the University of Texas College of Communications, 45 percent of a typical Noticiero Univision broadcast deals with events in Latin America, as compared with less than 2 percent of the main nightly newscast at ABC, which features more international news than either CBS or NBC.
Even when Univision and Telemundo cover the same stories as the Big Three, they do so in a strikingly different manner. In general, stories on the two Spanish-language networks tend to be "longer, with more depth and more analysis than what you see on any of the English-language networks," said Gonzalo Soruco, a professor of mass communication at the University of Miami who is currently working on a book to be titled "The Evolution of Spanish-Language Television in the United States."
 
 
 
More Bang for the Buck
 In part, that is simply a function of economics: since the Univision news budget is about three percent of any of the Big Three, there are fewer reporters to fill the same amount of air time, so longer stories guarantee more bang for the buck. But both networks are influenced by Latin American traditions of journalism, which, Dr. Soruco pointed out, "prescribe more analysis" and a clear point of view.
At Univision, at least, the nature of that mission is clear to reporters.
"We give a voice to those who have no voice in English and are absent from the major networks, newspapers and magazines," Mr. Ramos said. "We never forget where we come from."
In a separate interview, Ms. Salinas, who was born in California, put it this way: "We are the eyes and ears for Latinos in the United States, their liaison to their neighborhood and their country."
The Spanish-language networks have a very different sense of what is news. Early this year, for instance, all three English-language networks and CNN briefly broadcast footage from a Patrick J. Buchanan campaign rally in Arizona in which a young Hispanic voter challenged the Republican candidate's opposition to immigration and free trade. Univision, however, followed up on the initial controversy by tracking down the youth, 18-year-old Marciano Murillo, to his high school in Gila Bend.
There they quickly discovered he was the son of an "undocumented worker" from Mexico (the Spanish-language networks never use the term "illegal immigrant" unless they are quoting someone). The American-born teen-ager, who has worked in the fields with his parents since he was 9 years old, told the network, "I'm always going to defend my people."
Similarly, during the 1993 flap about child care that followed President Clinton's aborted nomination of Zoe Baird as Attorney General, it was the Spanish-language networks that made a point of seeking out Hispanic women who work as nannies and housekeepers and listening to their tales of abuse and exploitation. English-language coverage, by contrast, focused on the plight of the middle-class professional couples who typically employed those women.
The differences go beyond editorial content. While CBS's much-ballyhooed experiment with Dan Rather and Connie Chung as joint anchors failed, both Spanish-language networks, representatives of a culture supposedly mired in machismo, have paired male and female anchors for nearly a decade with no apparent problems.
"There are many stereotypes and prejudices and biases that we have been breaking down without anyone noticing," Mr. Ramos said.
 
 
 
What the Ads Say
 Even commercials can be instructive in that regard, particularly those that demolish the myth that newly-arrived Hispanic immigrants do not want to learn English.
One of the largest types of advertisements on any Spanish-language television station, in fact, are the multitude of schools and home-study programs that teach English. These ads stress that the key to advancement in the United States is a command of the nation's dominant language.
In one typical ad, a husband sorrowfully informs his wife he has been passed over for a better job because his English just isn't good enough. But six months later, after taking the Ingles sin Barreras (English Without Barriers) course, he is able to tell his family over dinner that he has won that coveted promotion to manager because he is now fully bilingual. "Gimme five," one of his children says to him, in English. "Way to go, Dad," another proudly proclaims.
 
 
 
Seen in Latin America
 Increasingly, Univision and Telemundo are also helping form the image that the rest of the Western Hemisphere has of life in the United States. One or the other is available on virtually every cable system in Latin America. And in smaller, poorer countries, local television stations often simply tape stories from Univision or Telemundo's nightly newscasts for their own use, which gives these American networks a degree of credibility and visibility unusual in the region.
"With Univision and Telemundo, I know that what I am seeing has not been subject to any form of censorship by the government or political parties, and isn't slanted to favor the interests of some local bigwig," Rafael Salazar Navarrete, an engineer who lives in Nicaragua, said recently. "I certainly can't say that about my local stations or those submissive Mexican channels that are also on my cable system."
Within the United States, that approach appears to have broad appeal both to recently arrived immigrants and more acculturated Hispanic-Americans.
When the Univision affiliate here, WLTV, surged past the CBS, NBC and Fox stations in news ratings, those astonished affiliates were quick to attribute the results to sampling error, apparently unable to imagine that Spanish-speaking viewers, who comprise a majority here, just might prefer substance to the usual English-language formula of happy talk and mayhem, and the routine mispronunciation of Hispanic names.
"Though not perfect, Univision and Telemundo provide a Latino perspective that no one else will," said Federico Subervi, an expert on Spanish-language media who teaches at the University of Texas. "Along with the Spanish language itself, they are the glue of Latino identity across the country."

HEADLINE: Of Stocks and Speculation;
When the Market Is Too Good to Be Good

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
IN the American economy of the 1990's, good news so often turns sour. As employment rises, so do interest rates, to temper the high spirits and keep inflation in check. People buy like crazy and retail sales rise, but once again the response is a nervous concern that too much prosperity will unbalance the economy.
Stock prices had escaped this adverse reaction, going up month after month, and carrying the middle class -- with its huge investment in mutual funds -- to new levels of wealth on paper. And then the booming stock market, too, became a liability to the economy. 
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, blew the whistle with his now-famous reference in a speech on Dec. 5 to "irrational exuberance." He did not claim that irrational exuberance had actually infected stock trading, driving up prices in pure speculation beyond their true value. He only asked, "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?" But in asking that question, he served notice that a rising market can endanger the economy, and the Fed's efforts to regulate it.
Stock prices promptly plunged, here and abroad, in response to Mr. Greenspan's remark. While the Dow Jones industrial average has fluctuated sharply since Dec. 5, stock prices have certainly not resumed the upward march that had made millions of investors so happy for so many months. Clearly, Mr. Greenspan reminded people that stocks can go down as well as up. "It was a question that went to the framework within which one should look at investing," Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said last week.
Mr. Greenspan's rhetorical reference to the stock market was rare for a Federal Reserve chairman. The last one came from William McChesney Martin in 1965. He compared the prosperity of the mid-1960's with that of the 1920's. He made no mention of the 1929 crash, but the immediate response to Mr. Martin's comment was a sharp drop in stock prices. His timing was good. While the Dow Jones average soon recovered and rose to a new high, by mid-1966 the bull market was over and speculation ceased to be a danger.
That is not yet the case for Mr. Greenspan. The rising stock prices that seemed such strong evidence of a healthy corporate sector and a strong economy might instead be evidence that stock trading has entered into the realm of speculation.
With such a market as backdrop, the Fed becomes hamstrung as the nation's chief regulator of economic growth, and its actions can misfire. When the Fed's policy makers decide that economic growth is too strong, and potentially inflationary, they raise interest rates to discourage the borrowing that oils the economy. But shareholders frequently respond to higher interest rates by shifting out of stocks into Treasury bills and similar securities that pay interest. If that shift takes place during a period of speculation on the stock market, the plunge in stock prices might be sharp, inflicting its own damage on consumer confidence.
"If there is a sell-off," said Henry Kaufman, an economist, "then Mr. Greenspan is on record as having warned that this could be a problem."
On the other hand, the economy could weaken in the eyes of Fed policy makers, in which case their standard response is to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. But the response on Wall Street to lower rates is to buy stocks, which in a speculative market might result in too much buying.
"If Alan Greenspan were to decide that he needs to raise interest rates, he could end up pricking the stock market bubble and causing a crash," said David Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street firm. "And if he were to lower rates, that could encourage even more speculation. I think his whole sense of timing is forward looking. He is worried that speculation might limit his policy options in the future."
Right now, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues -- the governors and presidents of the Fed's regional banks -- seem willing to leave interest rates alone. In the view of most Fed watchers, they will decide at their next meeting, on Tuesday, that the economy is neither too strong nor too weak. But that cannot last, and Mr. Greenspan, bracing for the future, has already served notice that rising stock prices are no longer good news.

Why Seizing Drugs Barely Dents Supply

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
TRAFFICKING in illegal drugs often seems to defy basic economic principles.
When the authorities seize a trove of heroin, cocaine or marijuana, logic would dictate a predictable effect: a shortage of supply that, given constant demand, should drive up prices, perhaps beyond the reach of some prospective customers. 
 Yet even after many sizeable, well-publicized seizures, the street price seldom changes. Sometimes, it even drops.
Law-enforcement officials, who intercepted nearly 100 tons of drugs in the United States last year, argue that seizures produce other benefits. Without them, the officials say, traffickers would grow more brazen; drugs would become so plentiful that many more people, including teen-agers and younger children, would be tempted to try them. Critics of the nation's drug war say that the negligible impact on supply or price proves that seizures are largely a waste of time and money.
Free-market theories of supply and demand seem inadequate to analyze and develop a counter-strategy against what is, at its core, a criminal activity. For one thing, it defies reliable economic analysis because so much data is incomplete. For another, as it turns out, drug seizures apparently affect warehouse inventory much more than actual street supply.
Law enforcement officials know how much narcotics they seize. But traffickers don't report how much they manage to sneak past the police. Americans spend about $49 billion a year to buy illegal drugs, according to one estimate by the Government.
"The numbers are, in fact, just decorations on the policy process, rhetorical conveniences for official statements without any serious consequences," writes Peter Reuter, who teaches drug policy at the University of Maryland. "Indeed, the irrelevance of the numbers is itself a condemnation of drug policy decision making."
One reliable number is the Federal budget, which includes more than $15 billion this year for drug enforcement, treatment and prevention. Price also can be monitored. And frustrated investigators acknowledge that with the market glutted, many of the much-heralded drug seizures haven't seemed to affect supply.
"The fact that product is coming in and prices don't change means that it is still available at that level," said Patrick Harnett, chief of the Narcotics Division of the New York City Police Department. "It's going to come in and it's going to come in in hundreds of different ways."
So much so that traffickers may have as much trouble storing it as importing it. Investigators found a record 21.4 tons of cocaine in a warehouse in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles seven years ago. Only this month, six tons of cocaine were seized from another warehouse in Tucson, Ariz.
"I think there is an incredible stockpile in this country when we knock off 10 or 20 tons and the price doesn't increase," said Carlo Boccia, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's operation in metropolitan New York.
 
 
 
Excess Inventory
 "There's excess inventory at every stage," said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a specialist on drug policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. "That inventory acts as a flywheel and reduces the impact of any shock."
Moreover, he says, the authorities typically overstate the dollar value of confiscated drugs by calculating not the wholesale price, like $9,000 per pound for cocaine or $40,000 for heroin, but what the consumer might pay somewhere down the line.
Evaluating seizures by this projected street value, Professor Kleiman said, is like estimating losses from cattle rustling according to the price of a steak in a New York restaurant. A more accurate measure would be the lower cost to the trafficker of replacing the drug, which can be less than $1,000 per pound of cocaine when it leaves Colombia.
Professor Reuter suggested that drug syndicates build a projected loss from seizures into their budgets, just as they set aside substantial sums for bribes or drug couriers.
Confronting a stagnant American demand for cocaine, the Cali cartel diversified in the early 1990's into home-grown heroin, which was marketed, through cocaine distributors, at discounts that undercut the price charged for Asian heroin. By last year, Colombian heroin accounted for 62 percent of the domestic seizures of heroin, compared to almost zero as recently as 1992, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
 
 
 
Five and Dime
 Some experts speculate that cocaine prices have declined not merely because of stagnating demand but also more competition among street dealers, who have been forced to accept a smaller markup. The street price itself -- $5 for a "nickel" vial of crack cocaine sufficient for one mind-altering high or $10 for a "dime" bag of heroin for a single fix -- has stayed remarkably constant. To squeeze out more profit, dealers dilute the purity.
Recreational demand for drugs can vary widely. But among addicts, demand becomes inelastic.
If drugs were legalized or if there was no interdiction, air-expressing a couple of pounds of cocaine from Bogota to Miami would cost less than $100, Professor Reuter said. Instead, traffickers have to pay a smuggler $10,000 or more to provide the same service.
"Interdiction can claim credit for accomplishing that," Professor Reuter told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It took the smashing of the Medellin cartel in Colombia to drive up cocaine prices in 1990 before the rival Cali cartel filled the vacuum. Cocaine itself is worthless if no one wants to snort, smoke or inject it. "You can't even patch ceilings with it," Mr. Boccia said.
But the police go after drugs to catch not just the dealers, but also the suppliers' profits, piling up in soiled, crumpled dollar bills. "When they lose money on the way back, it really hurts them because it almost made it home," Chief Harnett said.

Three Countries Face Their Indians

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
BACK when it thought it knew best what Indians needed, the Canadian Government decided that a few hundred nomadic hunters who lived in canvas tents in Labrador would be better off in brand new wooden houses.
The Mushuau Innu were moved to new houses built for them in 1967. But in a short time, many of the interior walls were destroyed. The Indians had tried to rip them out because they knew that one big room was easier to heat than several small ones. 
 A huge cultural gap still separates Indians and the rest of society, not just in Canada but throughout North America. Some 12 million people -- called "aboriginals" in Canada, "indigenous people" in Mexico and "Native Americans" in the United States -- struggle to live their own lives inside structures built for them by outsiders who thought they knew best.
The three nations of North America were founded on Indian conquests, but in recent years they have dealt with the remnants of their native populations in widely different ways. Canada has tried to break a century of paternalism with billions of dollars in Government aid and huge socioeconomic studies. The United States, having long ago recognized Indians as separate nations, has largely treated them with neglect. And in Mexico, contempt for the Indian population -- by far the largest in North America -- helped spur a revolution.
But money and attention may not lead to better lives for Indians. The real key seems to be self-government. Several studies have proven that the more power a tribe or nation has to make its own decisions, the greater chance it has of thriving.
 
 
 
Did Reservations Help?
 It is the Native Americans in the United States who have been able to achieve the greatest degrees of independence and economic achievement, in large part because the hated reservation system established in the last century provided things now recognized as essential for self-government.
Joseph P. Kalt, a Harvard professor who has studied reservation economics for a decade, said the large Western reservations gave some tribes "a land base over which sovereignty can be effectively organized."
Professor Kalt said other factors also promoted political organization. The Federal Government helped most tribes write their own constitutions, enabling them to establish their own legislatures, executive branches and, in some cases, justice systems.
Then the Indian activism of the 1970's, marked by deadly showdowns at Wounded Knee and other sites, pushed the tribes away from both the Federal Government and the fledgling national Indian movement. Instead, they turned inward to tribal leadership. And where that leadership was strongest, economic development followed.
Deep pockets of poverty endure among the 300 or so reservations. But a study by Professor Kalt and Stephen Cornell of the University of California at San Diego found that, while still rare, there are successful Indian development projects, and they're not just bingo and casinos.
For example, the Choctaw of Philadelphia, Miss., have created jobs not only for most of their own people but for 1,000 non-Indians who enter the reservation to work in factories making plastic utensils for McDonald's restaurants, electrical wiring assemblies for automobile plants and greeting cards. The Salish and Kootenai tribes of the Flathead Reservation in Montana have achieved an unemployment rate below the rest of rural Montana by focusing on agriculture, tourism and recreation jobs.
"Successful tribes are marked by what we call the 'Nike strategy,' " Professor Kalt said. "They build their own institutions and their own bureaucracies, displace the Federal Government as primary decision maker on the reservations and then just do it themselves."
Some reservations in the United States sprawl across state lines and provide a base for independence that Indians in Mexico and Canada will find difficult to match.
Canada has 633 Indian reserves, most so small that any attempt to consider them sovereign nations falls flat. In Mexico, Indian communities often adhere to boundaries established before European contact and are usually small, isolated and desperately poor.
There remain sharp debates across North America about the right thing to do for Indians. While no government today would knowingly take Canada's paternalistic approach , there is a strong, though not always publicly expressed opinion, that the Indians themselves are to blame for their condition.
Conflicts over fishing, hunting, land claims and other grievances are constant in all three nations, and occasionally resentment by non-Indians burns through. "They are using up whatever good will there was," David Olmstead, a Liberal party member said in a recent speech before the provincial legislature of New Brunswick. Mr. Olmstead said he was fed up with Indians portraying themselves as victims of white domination. Other members of his party quickly distanced themselves, but Mr. Olmstead insisted that he had only expressed what many felt but were afraid to say.
 
 
 
Spirituality Still Sells
 Public perceptions of Indians seem split. The gelled-lens vision of mystical Indian spirituality still sells well, and in all three countries far more people now want to identify themselves as Indians than are classified that way by their governments. But there is a question of how legitimate some of those claims are. For example, the number of people in New Jersey who identified themselves as Indian in the 1990 census had increased 78 percent from 1980.
And in Mexico City, heroic statues of Indians grace the main boulevards, but racist attitudes keep Indians from going to classy restaurants, even if they could somehow afford to eat in them.
Mexico is where the recent clash for Indian autonomy, mixed with complex political overtones, has been most bloody. Zapatistas of the poor, southernmost state of Chiapas launched a rebellion in the pre-dawn hours of Jan. 1, 1994, the same day that the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. Their initial attacks left nearly 200 dead, and they declared Nafta "a death sentence" for Mexico's 10 million Indians.
The Zapatistas, who gained popular support throughout Mexico and focused attention on the mistreatment of Indians, have suspended peace talks with the Government until there is action on a constitutional guarantee of more self-government, including the right to redraw county boundaries and to use traditional ways of electing officials (by a show of hands instead of a secret ballot).
Violence also ignited change in Canada. After a standoff between the Canadian Army and Mohawk Indians six years ago, Brian Mulroney, who was Prime Minister then, promised a full study of Canada's troubled relationship with its Indians and Eskimos.
 
 
 
The Remedy: Autonomy
 When the report was finally released last month, it included 440 recommendations, foremost being recognition of Indian bands as the sovereign nations with which earlier Canadian governments had signed binding treaties. It noted that the appalling conditions on many Indian reserves were due to the lack of economic opportunities. It also found that the degree of political autonomy and endowment of land for Indians in Canada was far behind that in the United States.
After self-government, the most important goal of most Indians is control of their land. The Chiapas conflict was in great measure about land. In Canada, officials say there are 100 pending land claims covering great stretches of every province. The few settlements already made have brought sudden wealth to those Indian communities.
Zebedee Nungak is a leader of the Inuk of northern Quebec, who formed their own corporation to sign off on all business deals on the territory granted them as part of the James Bay Cree settlement in 1975. Mr. Nungak said the Inuk already owned three local airlines and planned to open four plants to process caribou meat.
"Up to 75 percent of our food still comes from wildlife," Mr. Nungak said. But, he said, the Inuk drive trucks and fly planes: "We're not living in igloos or driving dog sledges any more."
That, many Indian leaders say, is the greatest challenge they face: honoring the past but surviving in changing times.
One big change is already underway in Canada. In 1999, the vast Northwest Territories will be split in two, and the eastern half will become a new territory called Nunavut. Because most people living in the cold and inhospitable area are Inuit, or Eskimos, they will have de facto control of the new territory, making Nunavut not a separate nation but the only major part of a North American government run by native people. This experiment, watched with great interest by Indians all over, may be the ultimate test of self-government.

Is This What Women Want?

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THREE years from the end of the millennium, and a more than a century after Ibsen's "A Doll's House" presaged women's modern emancipation, the question still vexes: How much power do women really wield?
This year, American women put on the most stunning display of political clout since they won suffrage 76 years ago. More women than ever registered and voted, and on the strength of their votes, President Clinton was re-elected. The growling voice of the angry white man was drowned out by the softer tone of the soccer mom, and issues like family leave and day care were forced into the political debate while abortion was forced out. 
 And politics is just the start. Women are increasingly courted by designers of homes and makers of cars. The purveyors of popular culture, from books to movies to prime-time television shows and the Summer Olympics, are struggling to appeal to what they think are feminine tastes. Prime-time television is full of shows like "Roseanne," "Cybill," "Ellen" and "Suddenly Susan." Movies like "Waiting to Exhale" and "The First Wives' Club" are designed to draw in angry women. Jokes about men behaving badly are rampant, while snickering about premenstrual syndrome is all but verboten. Houses are now built with larger kitchens and bathrooms. And doctors are being taught bedside manner, because women asked for it. If this does not signal feminine power, then what does?
In hushed tones some feminists and scholars, fearful of frightening men and of ending the revolution by declaring it won, tentatively call this change "gender creep." With women already the majority of voters and poised to become a majority of the work force, society is changing so radically that the much-talked-about feminization of American politics is looking like but one piece of the feminization of American culture.
"It's like a silent revolution," said Linda Tarr-Whelan, president and C.E.O. of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a feminist research organization based in Washington. "It's nonviolent at its core, but it's a very important transformation."
But is it the kind of revolution feminists envisioned when the modern women's movement began, with the publication of Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique" in 1963?
Does the feminization of politics and culture mean that women now have more power? Or is it just a slick bit of salesmanship, an attempt to make women whistle while they do all the housework?
Early feminists envisioned women moving en masse into leadership roles in government and business and men taking more time off from their jobs to share more of the workload at home. But men still dominate the top slots in the executive suites and in government. And working women still do 87 percent of the shopping, 81 percent of the cooking, 78 percent of the cleaning and 63 percent of the bill-paying, according to a 1993 study by the Family and Work Institute. And that's a burden that single mothers, whose ranks are growing, can only dream of.
The disparity between women's political, economic and demographic clout and their limited status raises beguiling questions about the definition of power. Which is the better yardstick to measure women's achievement: increased representation in positions of power or increased influence on the decisions of powerful people? Should feminism be considered a success if it has not managed to get as many women to the top as men, but has won more flex time, longer shopping hours, more concern for safety, more interest in education?
"In some ways it's the best of the feminist movement in keeping our eyes on the prize in terms of what I would call these quality-of-life issues, so that the issue is not just simply becoming the C.E.O., but how do we reframe the workplace so that it's better for all of us?" said Dr. Paula Rayman, executive director of the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute. "That to me is the feminist issue, not just how we can do it better than the guys in their own terms."
But other feminists suggest that political and business elites have simply figured out more creative ways to sell goods, services and candidates to women without fundamentally improving their lot. As women enter the labor force, do most of the housework, and remain the prime targets of advertisements, the female stereotype is changing from barefoot and pregnant to debt-ridden and tired.
 
 
 
'All Feminism Got Us Is More Work'
 "That may be feeding some of the backlash against feminism among some women," said Heidi I. Hartman, executive director of the Institute for Women's Policy Studies, a Washington research group that just released a state-by-state report on American women. "People are saying that all feminism ever got us is more work."
There is little question, though, that the country has felt some big shifts over the last two and a half decades. Since 1970, women have grown to about half the country's labor force, and are less inclined to stop working when they have children. More female high school graduates, 63 percent, enter college, compared to 61 percent of male graduates. The number of women-owned businesses has increased by 43 percent from 1987 to 1992.
In addition to dramatic increases in the number of married women who work, there have been huge jumps in the number of women who live alone and in families headed by single mothers. All these trends mean that women are increasingly making political and economic decisions independently of men, rather than merely bending to the directives of husbands and fathers.
Because women are making more of the decisions, the producers of big-ticket goods and services are increasingly trying to appeal to them. Women, for example, now buy about half the new cars and about 25 percent of light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and mini-vans, according to J. D. Power and Associates. So, auto-makers are changing how they design and market cars, emphasizing safety and convenience, which women care more about, and playing down speed and power. In the 1970's when auto-makers, prodded by the Federal Government, tried to introduce air bags, the mainly male car-buying public rebelled. Today, air bags are a standard feature on all new cars and are promoted heavily in ads.
In the area of health -- an industry that represents about one-seventh of the American economy -- 75 percent of the purchasing decisions for families are made by women or are significantly influenced by them. As a consequence, some large health providers like Kaiser Permanente have developed new programs to train and retrain their doctors in the art of communications, an area in which women feel physicians are lacking.
Women are changing television, too. They are now the target audience not only for daytime television but for prime-time television. "The primary, No. 1 audience segment in television is adult women under the 55 years of age," said David Poltrack, executive vice president of planning and research at CBS. And that is why there are so many shows tailored to them.
Women are even influencing sports programming, an area traditionally dominated by men. In its coverage of the Olympics in Atlanta, NBC unabashedly wooed women, reducing its coverage of boxing and larding the events with profiles and human interest stories. While some sports fans derided the coverage as the "soap opera Olympics," NBC's ratings were boosted by about 25 per cent over the 1992 and 1988 games, and it was largely due to women. Other networks took note. CBS, which lost a lot of its sports programming, is carrying professional figure skating competitions, and next year it will add professional women's basketball, professional gymnastics and world cup skiing, all popular with women.
"I don't want to exaggerate things," said Rob Correa, vice president of sports programming on CBS. "But a lot more girls are playing sports than there were 15 years ago. It's incredible. They may be tomorrow's weekend viewers."
 
 
 
The Big House
 But whether it is women's consumption of television, cars or health care, the question remains the same. Is consumer power real power? Perhaps the one consumer item that best illustrates this conundrum is the American house. Officials in the home-building industry say that the average size of a home has grown from 1,500 square feet in the early 1970's to more than 2,100 square feet today, even though the average family size has decreased. Most of that increase is the result of larger kitchens, bathrooms and family rooms, features the building industry has found that women, more than men, are demanding.
"When people buy the home they say 80 percent of the decisions are joint ones," said Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Home Builders Association. "But you can't sell a home unless it has a really good quality kitchen with upgraded appliances and plenty of space. So we think it is the female who has the more power."
But it is also possible that houses are getting bigger to make women forget that they are still trapped in them.

What the Goose Eats

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Lu Ping, the Chinese official managing Beijing's takeover of Hong Kong, was explaining a while ago why press freedom in Hong Kong would have to be regulated after the city reverts to China on July 1. To make his point, Mr. Lu opted for an analogy. He said in all seriousness that if a journalist in America were to call for a different form of government or for the independence of Hawaii, "Will it be allowed? I don't think so." Therefore, he added, it's hardly unusual that journalists in Hong Kong would be barred from calling for the independence of Hong Kong or for a new government in Beijing.
Mr. Lu's statement tells you everything you need to know -- and to worry about -- regarding China's assumption of control over Hong Kong, the first time in history that a part of the free world is being absorbed by a Communist state. I believe China has no desire to intentionally harm Hong Kong's unique, freewheeling character. Hong Kong is a goose that lays golden eggs. But while China's intentions may be benign, its capabilities are another matter. As one senior Hong Kong official remarked to me, "I'm not sure they really understand what the goose eats." 
 China's incentives for preserving Hong Kong's special character are many: If China absorbs Hong Kong successfully, without undermining it, Beijing will at least be able to say to the people of Taiwan, "Look, you too can come back to the motherland without losing your special status." But if China fails in Hong Kong, Beijing can kiss goodbye forever the notion of a peaceful unification with Taiwan. China has an obvious economic incentive in keeping Hong Kong a magnet for investment in China, and Beijing also has a deep desire to prove it can rule Hong Kong better than the British imperialists, who seized Hong Kong from China 150 years ago in the Opium War.
But there's the rub. Hong Kong is not just another Chinese city, once lost and now being reabsorbed by the motherland. Hong Kong today is the epitome of a postindustrial city. It is now much more of a global village than a Chinese village. More than 80 percent of its people work in services directed to the global economy. It has moved far beyond the days when it made plastic flowers and cheap radios. It is now a beehive of knowledge-based industries serving Asia. It is an energetic city that thrives by being fast, not by being big, and its particular skill is putting together faster than anyone else those deals where the money is raised in Wall Street, the legal framework, design and marketing are done in Hong Kong, and the backroom manufacturing is done somewhere else in Asia. But a knowledge-based city depends on the free flow of information and ideas and on transparent transactions. That's what this goose eats. No info, no eggs.
In other words, Hong Kong's return to China is not just a slice of the West being given back to the East, it is a slice of the future being given back to the past. And whatever their intentions, the capabilities of China's leaders to understand the importance of free information for a city like Hong Kong, and their capabilities to manage that information flow without debasing it with whispers, raised eyebrows or pressures for self-censorship, are still very limited. (See Lu Ping.) As one diplomat here remarked to me of China's aging leaders: "These guys did not have lemonade stands when they were little" -- they put no value on the free flow of information, they truly believe that you can separate free economic speech from free political speech.
"Hong Kong is a bridge culture, China is a fortress culture," remarked Michael DeGolyer, who is monitoring the transition at Hong Kong Baptist University. "Bridge cultures live off tolls -- they make a little bit of money on each transaction. The more openness, the more traffic, the more interactions, the more flows of information, the better Hong Kong does. But China's image is the Great Wall. China interacted with the world for years by selectively opening doors to the outside and then letting visitors into very small, confined rooms."
So, what worries me about Hong Kong's future is not what China knows about Hong Kong, but what it doesn't know. What worries me is not whether China will do big things to change Hong Kong, but whether it will understand that even doing little things will ultimately spoil this unique city's unique character.

HEADLINE: British Pullout Threatens U.N. Development Agency's Future

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Pressure for reform within the United Nations has taken a somewhat unusual twist, with a decision by Britain to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, even while acknowledging that the organization deserves high marks for the changes it has instituted.
The British representative here, Christopher Hulse, said this week that the withdrawal "was more directed at New York" than at the industrial development organization. 
 "We are worried about the lack of coordination in the U.N. system, and wastefulness," Mr. Hulse said in an interview. "That is the message that we want to be firmly established with the new Secretary General."
Mr. Hulse noted that at least two other United Nations organizations are involved in development -- the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
The Clinton Administration, feeling the heat of the anti-United Nations mood among conservatives in Congress, announced a year ago that Washington was quitting the organization.
Together, the United States and Britain contributed one-third of the organization's budget, and the question now is whether the organization can survive.
It was established in 1966 with a mandate to promote industrial development in third world countries. It operates programs in some 30 countries, ranging from providing support for privatization and for small and medium-size industries to helping former Communist countries in Central Europe reduce industrial pollution.
Until some changes were undertaken a few years ago, the organization had a reputation as one of the more bloated and poorly managed in the United Nations.
"It is the beginning of the end for Unido," an American official predicted after the British decision.
But for the moment, the organization has received a reprieve, with the decision this week by the German Government to put off for another year a final decision on whether to follow the United States and Britain.
The German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Carl-Dieter Spranger, facing demands for budget cuts, said that Germany should get out of the organization. But the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, anxious not to offend third world governments as Germany jockeys for a permanent seat on the Security Council, took a contrary view.
Germany will insist on further reform in the organization over the next year, a German official here said.
Officials of the program say that they have already undertaken significant reforms and that the wrong message is therefore being sent by the British decision to pull out.
"We believe that we did our job in terms of reform, more than anyone else in the U.N.," said Donatella Magliani, a spokeswoman for the organization. The reforms began in 1993, she said, and accelerated after the United States' decision to withdraw.
The staff has been cut from a high of 1,250 in 1993 to just over 800 today, and the budget has been reduced from $131 million in 1995, to about $90 million this year, she said.
More than three-quarters of the those cuts have been in administration, however, and not in field programs, she said.
Mr. Hulse, the British representative, said that the organization had indeed made "significant progress," and "deserves good marks for what it has done."

HEADLINE: In Second Term, Economy by Rubin

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
As President Clinton assembled his second-term economic team this week, one of his close advisers, a veteran of the struggles over welfare and health care and the balanced budget, suggested that the biggest change in the Administration's economic policy making had already taken place.
"When the President wanders off script, he talks like Reich," the official said, referring to Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who rarely passes up a chance to criticize companies that downsized simply to drive up their stock prices, and regularly spits out a list of ideas for Government efforts to bolster the working poor. "But when he is on script, he talks like Rubin." 
 But Mr. Reich is returning to Boston, and Robert E. Rubin is remaining as Treasury Secretary and, in Mr. Clinton's words, will be "the captain of the team." With his latest round of appointments, Mr. Clinton established that Rubin-speak is the new lingua franca of the second term. Though several Cabinet vacancies remain -- including secretaries of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Energy -- the central players in formulating the budget, setting economic priorities and dealing with a new age of economic diplomacy abroad have been appointed. Most of them frame issues like the quiet-spoken, market-driven Mr. Rubin.
No doubt there will be vigorous arguments in the next year, especially over how to rein in entitlement spending on Medicare and Social Security, how to prepare for an inevitable slowdown in the economy and downturn in the sky-high stock markets, and how stringent a line to take with China. But those arguments will be debated, most Administration officials say, in terms set by Mr. Rubin, a 58-year-old former investment banker who was often termed a political novice when he arrived in Washington four years ago. That assessment is rarely uttered today.
Already, Mr. Rubin's language shows up in Mr. Clinton's own phraseology. A month ago, asked about a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Clinton engaged in a rambling discussion of the subject that left it completely unclear whether he supported such a move or merely believed that the Republican-dominated Senate now had the votes to pass the amendment. Mr. Rubin had to call his boss up short, privately telling others in the Cabinet that the President's description had been "a mess" and publicly announcing that the Administration was committed to balancing the budget but thought a constitutional amendment would be "unwise economic policy."
Asked about the subject again on Friday, Mr. Clinton turned to language right out of Mr. Rubin's playbook. And when Mr. Clinton was asked to comment on Alan Greenspan's characterization of the stock market earlier this month -- the Federal Reserve chairman worried aloud about the "irrational exuberance" of investors, a concern that Mr. Rubin clearly also shares -- he paused and seemed to be recalling Mr. Rubin's advice that the only thing Presidents could do to jittery markets was mess them up. "I don't comment on the Fed's decisions, and I don't comment on the market's movement, so I shouldn't talk about the Fed chairman's comments about the market's movement."
He then told a harmless shaggy-dog story about how Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, lost a billion dollars before Mr. Clinton's eyes during the market decline in 1987, and he wound up with Mr. Rubin's oft-repeated phrase about how the Government's job is to "keep the underlying fundamentals sound."
But the discipline Mr. Rubin has gradually imposed on the Administration's economic thinking goes far beyond the President's public comments. In the second term, many of Mr. Rubin's closest aides will be re-emerging in new and more powerful posts. His deputy at the Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers, who was the hands-on architect of the Mexican bailout in 1995 and has led the Administration's efforts at promoting economic reform in Russia, was given expanded powers by the President as a "principal" on the National Economic Council, the White House forum in which most economic issues are supposed to be debated.
The new director of the council is Gene Sperling, who headed domestic economic affairs there and served as Mr. Rubin's deputy when he was its first chairman. Mr. Rubin's trusted and discreet chief of staff, Sylvia Mathews, has been recruited by Erskine B. Bowles, the new White House chief of staff, to serve as one of his two deputies.
Mr. Rubin, in a conversation on Friday, noted that he had met most of those aides during the failed Presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis.
Two other pivotal members of the team -- Franklin D. Raines, who has directed the Office of Management and Budget for the last four months, and Mr. Bowles -- have no past connection to the Treasury Secretary. But, like Mr. Rubin, they are former investment bankers who describe themselves as nonideological.
Mr. Rubin disputes the view that the second-term appointments consolidate his power or will squelch the kind of debate that roared through the first two years of Mr. Clinton's Presidency, when the Administration was still struggling to balance Mr. Clinton's promises of major social initiatives with the realities of reducing the deficit.
"Actually, I think we have a very experienced group of independent-minded people who are pragmatic and sensible," Mr. Rubin said. "Even in the first term, the advice people gave the President defied the ordinary labels -- you know, 'liberal' or 'centrist' -- depending on the issues."
Indeed, some of the advice did defy those labels. Mr. Rubin sided with Mr. Reich last summer in advising the President to veto the welfare bill that dismantled one of the central social programs of the New Deal and transferred much of the responsibility to the states. Others with long liberal credentials, including Mickey Kantor, the departing Commerce Secretary, urged him to sign it.
Mr. Rubin also has a longstanding interest in ways to help the nation's poorest, especially in the inner cities. Toward that end, he has pushed the Treasury into unaccustomed territory, exploring ways to get Wall Street to invest in Government-created low-income housing -- much as residential mortgages are sold as securities to private investors -- so scarce Government money can be recycled for new projects. He has also pressed Congress for larger contributions to the World Bank's programs for the poor.
But he has been far less enthusiastic about direct Government initiatives for working people at the low end of the income scale because he believes that the best way to aid them is to have a growing economy. He has squelched temptations to single out companies that resort to quick downsizing.
In the second term, however, the members of Mr. Clinton's economic team must decide whether to revive the power of the National Economic Council and how influential they will be in foreign policy when jousting with the new Secretary of State-designate, Madeleine K. Albright.
The council's powers were at their height under Mr. Rubin's leadership in 1993 and 1994. Carefully keeping his own views on issues well guarded, he made sure that the major economic problems were argued out at the council's table, where he was supposed to play "honest broker" among competing Cabinet agencies. But after he moved to the Treasury, the council's role diminished; participants chosen by the chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, held debates over the budget in Mr. Panetta's office.
Mr. Clinton often short-circuited the system. Sometimes he reached out to specific Cabinet officials or other advisers -- including Dick Morris, his secretive campaign adviser until last summer -- and that led to decisions that wreaked havoc with the process Mr. Rubin set up.
It will be up to Mr. Sperling to revive that process. "He's very independent, very capable, and Cabinet members view him as a principal," Mr. Rubin said of his former aide.
The other question is whether Ms. Albright, like her predecessor, Warren Christopher, is willing to allow the major economic officials to play a central role in setting policy toward countries whose economic roles loom large, primarily Japan and China.
China will be the biggest test because it is there that America's strategic and economic interests most often come into conflict and there that Mr. Rubin's economic team and Ms. Albright's foreign policy team have so much at stake.

HEADLINE: Romania Is Acting to Keep Families Together

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
In an effort to reduce the number of Romanian children being abandoned in state-run orphanages, the newly elected Government of Emile Constantinescu will increase fivefold a state allowance given to single mothers and families, the country's Ambassador to the United States says.
"The allowance is an incentive to discourage single mothers and poor families with large numbers of children to be tempted to abandon their children," Ambassador Mircea Geoana said at a Christmas party for adopted Romanian children and their American parents at the Romanian Embassy last weekend. 
 He said that the new President had committed himself to the increase and that the Government is expected to implement it. "It will take place," he said.
Under the proposal, the allowance for a single mother with two children would rise to $125 a month from the current $25. The increase represents the first significant state initiative to address the legacy of the former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, whose prohibitions on abortion and birth control left the country's orphanages teeming with neglected children.
Mr. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in 1989.
After dropping to a low of 80,000 in 1992, the number of children in state-run institutions rose to 104,000 in 1995. Mr. Geoana attributed the persistently high numbers to radical changes in the economy and said they would be reversed by the new Government's "active and aggressive promotion of growth, privatization and foreign investment."
But critics of the Government say that Mr. Ceausescu's successor, Ion Iliescu, did little to change the prevailing attitude that children are better reared in state institutions than in a home. Although abortions have been legalized and a ban on contraception supposedly lifted, the Government has made no effort to provide social services for struggling families or single mothers, these critics say.
This may change. Mr. Geoana said that in addition to the increased allowance, he expected the new Government to support a broad campaign to promote family planning through national television and other outlets.
Nevertheless, he was cautious, even guarded, in his criticism of the departing Government's handling of the orphan crisis, saying it had "addressed this issue sometimes without succeeding entirely."
More than 70 Romanian children and their American parents gathered for the Christmas party at the embassy. The children, dressed in traditional Romanian costumes, painted cardboard stars and sang Christmas carols in Romanian and English.
Carol Milazzo, a sales engineer from Freehold, N.J., whose daughter, Ashley, 6, was brought to the United States at 4 months, weighing only 7 pounds, said she hoped the new Romanian Government would "show more concern for children."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plan Would Revamp Child Services

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Nearly a year after announcing its intention to remake the city's child welfare system, the Giuliani administration is expected to unveil a 120-page plan this week that it hopes will significantly transform the care and protection given the city's most vulnerable and neglected children.
The plan, which officials are scrambling to release before the end of the year, will call for the decentralization of the child welfare bureaucracy, which could result in stationing city caseworkers in schools, hospitals or police precincts, according to several people who have been consulted or worked on the plan. 
 Some of the recommendations involve daunting and potentially costly innovations, including one aimed at placing children in foster care in the neighborhoods where they had lived with their biological families.
This geographically based placement would occur in tandem with an overarching change in the city's child welfare strategy: the formation of neighborhood-based networks to help stabilize the life of a child in foster care and to extend that assistance to troubled families. The networks would include workers from a variety of professional fields.
Another goal would be to institute a speedy case-conference program -- requiring all the principals involved in the decision to remove a child from a dangerous household to meet and debate a course of action as soon as 24 hours after an investigation has begun.
The plan, which draws on efforts in other cities as well as the work of a consultant brought in by the administration a year ago, would take years to implement fully and even longer to evaluate fairly. Its ambitious goals are expected to be a cornerstone of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's re-election campaign, following his vow last year to overhaul the agency after several child welfare efforts failed to save 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo from her mother's abuse.
But within the administration, the potential cost of the plan has caused the most debate. The Administration for Children's Services, with an annual budget of roughly $1.2 billion, dodged most major budget cuts hitting other agencies last spring, but it still was forced to trim $28 million.
Since then, the administration's commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, has regularly promised to maintain his staff at maximum levels, and the plan promises no retrenchment. But other elements, such as the early case conferences, could be expensive, and estimates have ranged wildly within the administration. No one, however, has disputed that the plan will require tens of millions of dollars to add staff, raise salaries and expand contracts with private agencies.
That cost could well be difficult to bear when coupled with the potential economic impact of the new Federal welfare law, because its work mandates could mean that millions of dollars would be spent on day care to help welfare mothers in work programs.
Mr. Scoppetta declined repeated requests to discuss the details of the plan over the last several weeks.
But other officials worried that the cost would undermine its goals. "The framework sounds great, and all the philosophical orientations are good," said Fred Brancata, executive director of the Council of Family and Child Caring Organizations, the umbrella organization for the city's nonprofit foster care agencies. "He is taking all the great ideas that have been around in different shapes and forms for years. The key question is whether the funding will be there. It is the question everyone will be asking, and for a long time."
Aside from the financial considerations, Mr. Scoppetta, who was appointed to rectify enduring problems within the agency, will also face other potential roadblocks. The union that represents child caseworkers has objected to its members being stationed in small teams in the city's most troubled neighborhoods, instead of in the centralized offices in each borough. The union might also oppose any financial incentives, some based on merit instead of seniority, offered only to child welfare workers. He has said he wants to raise the salaries of caseworkers to lower attrition rates and find other inducements for them to pursue academic degrees in social work.
Other administration critics, including the lawyers suing the city to have the Federal courts take over the child welfare system, are reserving judgment until the plan is released.
None of the particulars of the plan are revolutionary, and the core concept of neighborhood networks is in effect in Los Angeles and other cities. But Mr. Scoppetta's proposal would allow the networks to be designed within the 59 community districts by individual neighborhoods, perhaps complemented by Mr. Scoppetta's suggestion in speeches and conferences that city caseworkers would be placed in schools or precinct station houses to help the neighborhoods.
The other key part of the plan is the effort to have children remain in their neighborhoods even after they have been separated from their families, which would make visitation easier, allow children to remain in their schools, and could speed either reunification or adoption.
Now, children are placed in foster homes based on a court-ordered formula that often sends them far away from their relatives.
Because the decentralization plan requires a lengthy planning and contracting process, it could be begun in several pilot spots. It likely would be years before it is in place citywide.
The plan's program to make the early conferences on cases mandatory is based on a model Mr. Scoppetta studied in Cleveland. There, family members, doctors, caseworkers, school teachers and others are brought together within 24 hours of an incident to decide whether it is necessary to remove a child. Mr. Scoppetta has said he believes forcing the players in such decisions to come together early makes for wiser choices about present and future risks to children, and offers the potential for finding relatives who can take over temporary care.

HEADLINE: Do Computers Retard Productivity's Growth?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 8 Week in Review article "What Has the Computer Done for Us Lately?" explores why personal computers haven't sparked an expected productivity boom. It neglects one obvious answer, however: the expectation is itself unrealistic. 
 The computer industry has conditioned us to very rapid technological change. That in itself may be one reason for slow productivity growth; business can't make much headway when it has to change products and procedures every few months. We should not forget, however, that individuals and organizations take to change much more slowly. It is only in the last five years or so that inexpensive personal computers have become powerful enough to really affect productivity.
That simply isn't a long enough time for businesses to figure out how to use those computers effectively, for software engineers to develop applications, or for workers to learn how to operate them. If really large enterprises like the I.R.S. and the air traffic control system have been unable to implement this new technology, how can we expect small and medium-sized businesses to be up and running already?
To measure the impact of personal computers on productivity, you have to look at how and where they are used today. So far, a majority of businesses use them strictly for word processing. And, as anybody who has ever done any typing for a living can attest, the productivity gains in that field have been significant indeed.

HEADLINE: Do Computers Retard Productivity's Growth?;
Computer as Controller

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"What Has the Computer Done for Us Lately?" (Week in Review, Dec. 8) misses a couple of important points. First of all, the 1950's and 60's were the golden age of United States productivity mainly because the potential competition was still suffering the aftereffects of World War II. Germany and Japan were flattened and our allies debilitated; only we had the ability to take advantage of the knowledge explosion that followed the war. 
 Second, computers have had profound effects on productivity as machine controllers. For instance, the modern automobile has better performance, better safety and about twice the gas mileage of the cars of 30 years ago. This stems in part from the use of the computer in the design process and in part from its incorporation into vehicular systems as a controller. Imagine if all cars still got 12 miles per gallon and exposed us to the injury rates of 30 years ago; how much more would workers have to be paid for the same work if their transportation costs reflected this?
As management aids, computers have been a disappointment, as your article reports. However, this has almost nothing to do with computers per se; it's just that if a computer lets you replace 10 clerks, and you're the one in charge of those clerks, and your status in the company rests on how many clerks you have, then suddenly you discover a need for more input. So much more, in fact, that 10 clerks pounding computers can barely handle it. The practical effect of computers-in-management has been to increase the workload for everyone at all levels below the level where the computers are installed.

A Service Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the Dec. 8 Week in Review article "What Has the Computer Done for Us Lately?" you overlook the fact that the reason the United States is not meeting the national wealth growth rates of the 1950's and 60's is that our economy has become largely a service sector one, in which industrial production is not occurring to the same extent as in previous decades. 
 No amount of computer use can create substantive production if the economic foundation is increasingly one producing no substance of tangible wealth. But the computer revolution is real. Its "contribution," however, will not be in the form of economic enhancement as much as in the way we interact with each other and the world, for better and for worse.

HEADLINE: Freighter Hits Riverfront Mall in New Orleans

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 14

 BODY:
A 700-foot freighter, moving down the Mississippi River here, went out of control today and plowed into a popular downtown riverfront shopping mall and tourist attraction packed with Christmas shoppers, injuring dozens.
Rescue workers said in the late afternoon that at least six people had been killed in the crash, basing their count on witnesses who reported seeing people disappear under the river or in the debris. But Coast Guard officials said tonight that they could not confirm even a single death. As of 8:30 P.M., no bodies had been reported found, neither was anyone reported missing from the collision. 
 The Liberian-registered freighter Bright Field slammed into the Riverwalk shopping mall at 2:15 in the afternoon, crushing a 100-yard section of the riverfront structure and sending thousands of shoppers running in panic.
The ship, loaded with grain, had drifted and then, riding the strong currents, bore down on the crowded mall. Shoppers, especially diners in the elevated structure's outdoor food court, looked up from their red beans and rice and shrimp po boy sandwiches to see the massive bow of the ship looming over them, horns and sirens sounding a warning.
As they ran, witnesses said, the freighter plowed deep into the side of the three-story elevated structure and raked its side. Some people did not notice it in time, and they disappeared in the rubble when the ship came crashing in, witnesses said.
Odieen Matthews was working as a saleswoman at Chico's, a clothing store in the Riverwalk, when the vessel pushed into the building. "It felt like an earthquake," she said. "It shook the entire building."
The Coast Guard said the freighter was heading down-river when it lost power and steering and struck the building. The crash, which left the building so unstable that rescue workers could not go into some sections of it, could have been much worse, rescue workers said.
The freighter came within 70 feet of a three-story casino gambling boat crowded with 800 people. As the freighter appeared to be bearing down on them, many on the boat panicked. Israel Perez, 23, an unemployed car salesman, was gambling when an alarm sounded and people shouted, "Abandon ship!"
"It was a mass stampede, and some people jumped into the river," said Mr. Perez, who suffered a dislocated shoulder. "I wouldn't jump in the river. I know how furious it is." In the crush and panic, he said, "people were falling everywhere, into the river, into the side of the deck."
Mr. Perez said he was at the casino because friends convinced him that "it was my lucky day."
While rescue workers picked through the rubble and searched the muddy water for victims this afternoon, workers at hospitals here said that most of the injuries were not life-threatening and that people were generally treated for such conditions as heart attacks, broken bones and bruises, the result of "trampling" as they tried to escape the complex.
A group of Girl Scouts who initially had been reported missing was found safe, but four disabled children could not be located after the accident, the authorities said.
Rescue workers searched the rubble with heat-sensing equipment and used dogs to try and sniff out people who might be trapped in the rubble. Meanwhile, tugboats kept the badly damaged freighter pressed up against the wreckage, to keep it from doing more damage. A hole 15 feet in diameter was gouged into its bow, and wreckage from the shops could be seen inside the hole.
Some city officials said the ship might actually be helping to stabilize part of the surrounding structure, but others said it was in the way of the rescue effort.
"Where there was a wharf there is water now," said Oliver Thomas, a New Orleans City Councilman.
The 180,000-square-foot Riverwalk is the former site of the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition. It has more than 100 shops, restaurants and cafes, some underneath the adjoining Hilton Hotel, the rest built above the wharf. It includes stores such as Abercrombie and Fitch, the Gap, Eddie Bauer, the Sharper Image.
Those stores and others were jammed with shoppers this afternoon, a bright, clear day. Patrons had some warning as the freighter and other boats and ships sounded their horns in warning. Some witnesses said the horns started to sound as much as three minutes before the impact, and some shoppers moved safely away. But when it was clear that freighter was going to strike the building, the crush of bodies and ensuing panic slowed down their retreat,
"It just kept coming," said Chris Storey, who works at Riverwalk. "People started running in a panic."
On impact, concrete, glass and water rained down on them. One witness said he had seen a woman and a child walking along the wharf, and then they just disappeared.
New Orleans is one of the nation's busiest shipping ports, and it is common for freighters to hit wharfs. But that usually happens with much less force, rescue workers said, and in places where there are few people. A river pilot, trained in the river's currents and character, was at the helm, taking over from the ship's captain.

HEADLINE: Doctor, What's the Prognosis? A Crisis for Canada

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 12

 BODY:
It was a small thing, a ruptured blood vessel on the end of her nose. Wendee Harper's family doctor told her he would arrange to have her see a specialist, assuring her that Canada's universal health care system would cover even the smallest detail.
But no specialist would see her, because they have stopped taking new patients as part of a growing protest against Government regulations. Ms. Harper, 44, was anything but reassured. 
 "What if this was something quite painful," she said. "And then you start thinking there must be hundreds of people out there dealing with this. If it were my kids, I'd be really angry."
Nothing holds a more sacred place in the shrine of Canadian values than the country's health care system, and nothing incites more raw emotion among Canadians than having to come to grips with its limitations.
Never have those limitations been more evident. The federal Government has slashed its contributions to the system as part of its effort to reduce the federal deficit. Those cuts have forced cash-strapped provinces, which pay the remainder of medical costs, to reduce nursing staff, consolidate hospitals and limit some services, all of which has increased already long waiting times for nonemergency operations.
Add to that a graying population, and increasingly frustrated doctors who feel that in order to call attention to their problems they must take drastic steps like refusing to see patients, and the result is a crisis that in one way or another touches every one of Canada's 30 million people.
The Canadian approach stresses universal coverage over all else. It is often held up as a model for the United States, where 40 million people have no health insurance. Canadians feel it reflects their values of generosity and compassion, and gives them at least one clear claim to being better than the United States.
But the cost of maintaining that system, using little else besides federal and provincial funds, has sometimes forced Canadians to scale back and accept far less than the best.
"We used to work in the best system in the world but now it's become just a pathetic shell of what it once was," said Dr. Ted Rumble, an orthopedic surgeon in Toronto who is cooperating in the doctors' protest by refusing to see new patients unless there is an emergency.
"The public doesn't want a high quality medical system," he said, "it wants a free system."
Right now, Ms. Harper and the other people of Ontario are struggling to deal with a months-long job action by many of the 22,000 family doctors and specialists in the province. They first battled the Government over pay. Every time a doctor submitted a bill for seeing a patient, the province used to hold back 10 percent to cover administrative costs. The doctors forced them to reduce that to 2.9 percent.
Once that was settled, doctors and officials tangled over a plan to help underserved rural areas up north by limiting doctors' ability to set up practice in Toronto and other cities.
Specialists stopped accepting new patients in October, sending many patients to seek help in hospital emergency rooms. A number of pregnant women from the Windsor area who could not get to see an obstetrician have been sent by the province to the Detroit Medical Center for prenatal care, and will have to cross the international border when their babies are due.
[On Friday specialists said after some conciliatory gestures by the Government that they might resume seeing new patients within a week, but would hold one-day strikes in various communities to continue their protest.]
It is not just in Ontario that the myth of Canada's universal health care is being challenged. The federal Government used to pay for about half the cost of running the system but now covers only 32 percent, shifting more of the burden to the provinces. To control costs, provinces have been forced to scale back hospitals and make other cuts. Over all, Canada spends about 10 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, compared with about 14 percent in the United States.
Across the country, long waiting lists have grown even longer, and now a Canadian who has already been examined by a family doctor must wait just over 10 weeks on average before seeing a specialist. The median wait to have magnetic resonance imaging is over eight weeks. Life-threatening cases are taken care of immediately, of course, but someone needing a nonemergency coronary bypass operation may have to wait four months.
Looking ahead, the prognosis is not good. Canada's population is aging, which means that fewer people will be working and paying taxes to support the system even as demands on the system increase because older people need more care.
Health officials insist that the current system can be improved. They want to replace unneeded hospitals with more efficient clinics, and use laser surgeries and other procedures with quicker healing times to reduce costs. They also propose ways of limiting unnecessary visits.
Despite the long waiting lists, refused service and occasional horror stories about filthy hospitals and equipment shortages, Canadians have rejected any attempt to introduce changes that would make their system more like that in the United States, where those who can afford it sometimes can choose to pay more for quicker or better service.
A recently completed survey found that many Canadians opposed a multilayered system where some pay and some do not because they fear that it would cause the entire system to shift in favor of those who could afford more.
The survey, commissioned by the Government-organized National Forum on Health, found that people are split about whether doctors should have to tell patients that the treatment they are receiving may not be the best available. Some said they would want to know so they could choose whether to go to the United States for treatment.
But others said they would have more peace of mind not knowing.
Dr. Bernard Gonik of Detroit finds that attitude difficult to accept. He is head of obstetrics at Grace Hospital, a part of the Detroit Medical Center where several Canadian women are being given prenatal care because Ontario specialists refused to see them. He said the Canadian system is good for screening or generalized care, but someone who needs special care or access to sophisticated technology or the latest medical advances is out of luck.
"In order to serve the masses they have been forced to place limits on technology," Dr. Gonik said. "That's not something I'd be comfortable with." Nor are all Canadian doctors.
"There was a time when I felt that any patient going to hospital would get consistently good care in Canada, but now I feel you have only a 70 or 80 percent chance of getting it," said Dr. Steven Levinson, a Toronto general practitioner, who supports the system but worries about how it has been managed.
Dr. Levinson said his eyes were opened when he had bypass surgery three years ago and found he was getting the wrong medication. When he needed an electrocardiogram, he was forced to wait because one of the only two machines in the hospital was broken. "And when I was in intensive care my feet stuck to the floor it was so dirty," he said.
There are some 55,000 doctors in Canada, but over the last four years, 2,500 have left the country, many for the United States, according to a study by Dr. Robert J. R. McKendry of Ottawa General Hospital. The number that left last year -- 700 -- is more than double the number that left 10 years ago.
Canadian patients also sometimes cross the border to get the care they feel they cannot get in Canada or cannot receive in time. Some of those people turn to Douglas W. Hitchlock for help.
Mr. Hitchlock, a Canadian, is a medical broker who recently started a company called The Free Trade Medical Network to buy on a large scale, and at a discount, the rights to operations and medical procedures at hospitals in the United States with excess capacity. Those rights are then being offered for sale to Canadian insurance companies that write policies for travelers.
Mr. Hitchlock is now getting ready to deal directly with some of the 170,000 Canadians on waiting lists for medical procedures who do not want to wait any longer.
"We are very fortunate as Canadians to have the U.S., where the competitive marketplace lets us cherry pick what we require without having to make the necessary investment in equipment," Mr. Hitchlock said. "What's wrong with that?"

HEADLINE: Selling America on Superstores;
Bargains, Yes. But Not in Our Backyards.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
THERE was something touching and sweetly small-townish about the stand taken by the New York City Council against the influx of more superstores in the nation's largest city. The Council's rejection of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's re-zoning plan last week reinforced what the Kmarts and Home Depots have recently discovered: New Yorkers aren't some weird breed apart. They are like everyone else.
New Yorkers are just as susceptible to buying in bulk as suburbanites. They are more than ready to load up on gallons of olive oil, five-pound jars of gourmet popcorn, half-priced toilet seats and children's clothing at one stop. And like people everywhere, they worry about what goes in their backyard. Just as wary and reluctant are the many, regular-size stores that sell the very same goods. 
 Megastores have met local opposition before. Sometimes they have even retreated in the face of public relations assaults about disappearing downtowns and endangered businesses that can find no place in the Mixmaster of national chain merchandising. The threat of a new Walmart can rouse small towns to fight back, sometimes successfully.
The big stores, however, usually move in, and capitalism wins out in the end. Americans always buy more than what they planned to get, even if the result isn't really to their liking. In effect shoppers can have it both ways: They can be nostalgic about the good old days of small, neighborhood mom-and-pops (the worn wooden floors and the musty, penny-candied shelves) even as they do them in by loading up on all the bulk-pack toilet paper and mass quantities of cocktail weenies that mom-and-pops never sold, because customers never thought to ask for them.
In New York City, the love it-hate it megastore paradox is even more pronounced, because to much of the world, New York City means shopping. For all the talk about mall envy driving New Yorkers to shop in the suburbs, many of the new super-sized retailers in New York City, like the Bed Bath & Beyond that anchors a revitalized lower Sixth Avenue strip with a Barnes & Noble, say it's the other way around. A sizable part of their customer base depends not on New Yorkers but on the tourists and suburbanites who flock to the city to shop -- as they always have.
In a very real way New York City, a manufacturing hub in the industrial revolution, invented super-scale shopping. Nineteenth-century mercantile palaces like A. T. Stewart's dry goods store helped usher in consumerism after the Civil War. In this century, R. H. Macy defined big and then marched out on a national road show, taking the city's retailing imprint to the mall.
The city also pioneered the concept of zoning laws. New York City zoning sounds fiercely specific about what shall be and what shall not be allowed. It is a reflection of the ever prickly local culture: the fiefs, politics and beleaguered citizenry. The city, however, needs the revenues, taxes and jobs that the superstores bring in, Mr. Giuliani argued, since it lost its fabled manufacturing base and jobs traveled not only to New Jersey but to South Dakota and Florida.
For the most part, however, the suburban superstores have avoided New York City not because of the zoning laws but because of business basics like high electricity and real estate costs, taxes, rents and what is known in the trade as high shrinkage, which is a polite way of saying that the city is seen to have more than its share of shoplifters, larcenous staff and organized crime lords. The big stores also stayed out of New York City because they could make more money in the suburbs. Now suburbia is saturated with stores and New York City looks comparatively inviting, despite the costs, zoning and hassles. They have been using loopholes to get around zoning difficulties. Home Depot, for example, gained its foothold in the outer boroughs as a hardware store.
While Home Depot, Walmart and others were multiplying in the suburbs, they were also changing the face of retailing. The new breed of stores offers the shopper more to love and to fear. Today, computers help shape store inventories to local markets; instant databases show what products move, how to display them, when and at what price. It's like a mom-and-pop pumped up on steroids -- big stores make it their business to know the customers, quirks and all.
If the New York City megastore debate is really about economic self-determination -- giving residents a say in what their neighborhoods should be -- Council members might do well to recall how ineffective the current zoning pattern was as a vehicle for making the city a certain kind of place. It was enacted in the 1960's and 1970's based on the brash declaration that New York City was, and always should be, a manufacturing town.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
Listing Sought for Historic Corner of White Plains

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
A CACHE of turn-of-the-century buildings, tucked away in a convent school off North Broadway, could become the largest historic site in this city, which is not known for its abundance of antique properties.
Nine school buildings and a chapel, all part of the Good Counsel Academy, a Roman Catholic elementary and high school, have been nominated for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The New York State Historic Preservation Review Board is now reviewing the nomination and is expected to recommend it for national designation. 
 "If the board approves the nomination, it is forwarded to the National Register of Historic Places for Federal designation," said Ruth Pierpont, director of the Field Services Bureau at the state's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Perservation. "Applications don't get this far unless they already meet the national criteria."
The complex, which was built between 1890 and 1923, is among the very few historic sites left in the city, according to John Harrington, president of the Whtie Plains Historical Society. "Urban renewal in the 1960's knocked almost everything down," he said.
The city now has two buildings listed on the National Register -- the Jacob Purdy House, a former private residence built in the 1720's and now a museum, and the State Armory, built in 1909.
"Since we have so few, we're really trying to hold onto what's left," Mr. Harrington said. "The Good Counsel complex will be a great addition. It's wonderful that a whole complex of buildings has been preserved in this way. It will be the largest historic site in the city."
The school, on the west side of North Broadway between Crane and Lenox Avenues and adjacent to the Pace University campus, is in the oldest and most historically significant section of the city, according to Mr. Harrington "Before the Revolutionary War, the village of White Plains was laid out along North Broadway," he explained. "Where the school is used to be the village common."
The wide boulevard-like street is now lined with apartment buildings and commercial enterprises and its environs bear few traces of the neighborhood's early history. In fact, it is easy to miss the Good Counsel campus, since it is set back from the road and hidden behind leafy trees most of the year.
The Sisters of the Divine Compassion, a religious order that owns and operates the school, began as missionaries working primarily with disadvantaged girls and young women in New York City in the late 19th century. Mother Mary Veronica, the order's founder, thought a change of scene to a more countrifed environment would be beneficial to her charges.
In 1890, using her own money from a family inheritance, Mother Mary Veronica purchased a 15-acre estate on North Broadway from J. Tilford, of Park and Tilford, a well-known grocery retailer of the period.
She quickly began the construction of a school complex. While most of its buildings have been altered somewhat over the years, they still maintain much of their historic integrity.
As the school grew, so did its mission, which is now one of a general educational institution serving a more diversified population. "The whole campus is a great example of the Romanesque and Mediterranean styles that used to be so prevalent in Westchester County," said John Bonafide, program analyst for the state's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
Trained in draftsmanship, Mother Mary Veronica is credited with the single-handed design of the campus's centerpiece, an 1897 stone chapel. The one-and-a-half-story structure, which seats 500, was modeled after the Church of St. Charles Borromeo, in Milan, Italy. It features dark oak exposed roof framing, an 1897 Odell tracker-action organ and original dark oak choir-loft furniture. Also noteworthy are the carved marble altar and stained-glass windows created by Handman Company, of Charing Cross, in London.
The founder worked with architects, primarily Lawrence O'Connor, in the design of the rest of the school's buildings. "She had a lot to say about every one of the buildings," said Sister Jane Keegan, director of grants research for the religious order, who is spearheading the preservation effort. "Our founder was an amazing woman. She was very knowledgable and well-traveled, and found a way to use her talents to the upmost." Mother Mary Veronica started her life as Mary Caroline Dannat, an heir to a multimillion malt liquor business. She had endured a troubled marriage and raised two children before converting to Catholicism and founding the charitable religious order.
"She's such an important 19th-century figure that we plan to research her life after completing the historic designation of the buildings," said Mr. Bonafide, of the state parks agency.
In its heyday, the Good Counsel campus encompassed more than 30 acres. In 1975, it transferred ownership of 12 acres to Pace University, which now houses its law school in several of the convent buidings. None of the Pace properties, however, are included in the nomination for historic designation.
OF the convent buildings nominated for designation to the National Register of Historic Places, a four-story, gable-roofed structure originally called the House of Nazareth was the first completed. Built in 1891, it now houses the Good Counsel High School. It still retains many of its original features, including paneled oak doors hung on ornate hinges, pine floors and pressed metal ceilings.
The other buildings up for nomination include the original two-story Tilford mansion purchased by Mother Mary Veronica, built in 1856; a wood-frame cottage, circa 1901, and a century-old carriage house.
One building on the campus is already listed on the National Register. Called Mapleton, built in 1857, it was once a private residence and now serves as the school's counseling center.
Being listed on the National Register makes Mapleton eligible for government funding, explained Sister Jane Keegan. "We have some grant proposals out there," she said. "I heard they're sitting on Governor Pataki's desk. We're hopeful we'll get some money because the building really needs some work."
Even being nominated for historical designation opens the door to both public and private funding for the academy, Sister Jane Keegan explained. "We got a grant from the New York State Landmark Commission, which is private, for some work we just completed on the chapel," she said. "The money is only available to those buildings already on the National Register or in nomimation."
The work already completed on the chapel includes the installation of new lighting and replacement of the front steps, Sister Jane Keegan said. She added that there were now plans to restore the chapel's bell tower. "We're hopeful that soon the church bells will be ringing again," she said. "for the first time in decades."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Delivery Isn't Guaranteed, but Stamps Are Turning Profits

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
WADE SAADI was anxious before he sold his collection of rare 1869 American stamps last summer. "The fun is in putting the collection together," he explained, and he was worried about parting with stamps he had spent four years gathering.
But Mr. Saadi, 47, who owns a computer software business and lives in Manhattan, was not upset after the sale. "I discovered that letting go doesn't have to be so painful," he said. One big reason was a six-figure profit -- a return of more than 100 percent -- on the transaction. 
 Of course, stamps are not a standard investment, nor should they be, financial advisers say. Like coins, art or other hard assets, they are risky and illiquid, and stamp collectors should never assume that they will earn anything other than enjoyment from what is, after all, a hobby.
In recent years, however, the market has produced something other than fun: decent returns.
Last month, for example, a rare stamp, the 1855 Treskilling Yellow from Sweden, sold for $2.3 million, a record price for a stamp. That was $1 million more than its previous sale price, in 1990. An 1854 Bermuda cover -- collector parlance for a stamp still affixed to an envelope -- sold in April for $373,000. In 1980, in the midst of a stamp boom, it fetched just $231,000.
But the rarest stamps are not the only ones with rising values. In the five years through November, the value of collectible United States stamps in general has appreciated about 14 percent annually, according to Linn's U.S. Stamp Market Index, which tracks the prices. During the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen by an average of 16.96 percent a year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has returned 14.34 percent.
"Globally, the stamp market is also faring well, especially in Hong Kong and China," said Robert Scott, director of the stamp department at Sotheby's, the New York auction house.
The reasons for the steady rise include the influx of baby boomers into the pastime and the relative strength of the economy. "A great many 40- to 50-year-olds who had stamp albums as kids are revisiting the hobby," said Michael Laurence, the editor and publisher of Linn's Stamp News, a weekly publication owned by the Scott Publishing Company, which also puts out the Scott catalogues used by collectors.
According to the United States Postal Service, about 20 million Americans are stamp collectors -- defined as people who have saved at least one stamp. About five million collect up to four stamps a year. And about 550,000 are serious collectors, people who, like Mr. Saadi, carefully research stamps and slowly build collections.
The recent price upswing, driven by collectors, contrasts markedly with the boom of 1979 to 1981, when noncollectors fleeing high inflation crowded the market. "You had serious investor capital flowing into the stamp market, chasing a fixed amount of stamps," said Scott R. Trepel, president of the Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries in Manhattan. As a result, prices soared.
But in 1981 a new Federal law prohibited the inclusion of stamps and other tangible collectibles in tax-deferred retirement accounts; they were thought to be too risky and too difficult to value. With that change and with a lessening of inflation, there was a market bust. By the end of 1991, the prices of American stamps had plummeted by more than 56 percent from their 1981 highs. That collapse should serve as a warning to someone who hopes that stamp collecting can be a consistent money earner.
Still, like gold, coins and other collectibles, stamps move in different cycles than stocks and other financial assets, so, despite the risk, they can help hedge against losses in those assets. Some people also like stamps for less savory financial reasons, including portability: A person can put them in a pocket "and cross a border with no questions asked," Mr. Trepel explained.
Profits from stamps are also difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to detect. "That's why there is a great deal of anonymity in stamp collecting," Mr. Scott of Sotheby's said.
Financial counselors, meanwhile, continue to warn against stamp collecting as an investment. The required knowledge alone is a huge hurdle to profit, they say.
"Unless you know a great deal about individual stamps and have a keen interest in postal history, you're probably going to lose money," Mr. Saadi said. The value of any stamp can be greatly affected by details like the size of the cancellation or the condition of the gum.
High markups are a factor, too. "People in the stock market pay a commission of 2 or 3 percent on a buy-sell transaction," Mr. Laurence of Linn's said. "In stamps, it can be 100 percent or more." That's expensive, and it means "you've got to hold for many, many years" to overcome the dealer charges, he said. Add the danger of fraud and the illiquidity of a small market, and even a risk-embracing investor may pause.
Still, given the five-year rise in stamp prices, stamp collecting can be tantalizing as a hobby. Do you have any 19th-century American stamps in that dusty old album? These days, those stamps are leading the market index to higher levels, according to the people at Linn's.
And check your stamps closely as you send season's greetings to friends. Bloopers can sharply increase a stamp's price. That Swedish Treskilling, for instance, was worth $2.3 million just because it was erroneously printed in yellow rather than the issue's standard green. Then there is the Inverted Jenny, a 1918 American stamp in which an airplane was mistakenly printed upside down. A single specimen of that issue can go for $50,000 to $200,000.
OF course, the odds for such a find are long. Rarely does someone bring in a collection containing goodies, Mr. Scott said, and "that generally happens only when a collection has been passed down from someone's parents' parents." But those who think that they may have valuable stamps can ask an auction house for a free appraisal, he suggested. If the collection's value is too small for the auction house, it will often recommend a dealer.
But in taking an interest in stamps, the best approach may be Mr. Saadi's. True, his decision 10 years ago to resume collecting led to a huge profit. But it was hardly motivated by the bottom line. He just happened to be in the post office, and he spotted some new, colorful stamps -- the Postal Service's transportation series.
"That whetted my appetite," he said.

HOLMES AND FRANKFURTER
Their Correspondence, 19121934.
Edited by Robert M. Mennel and Christine L. Compston.
302 pp. Hanover, N.H.:
University of New Hampshire/
University Press of New England. $45.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, the greatest figure in the history of American law, was also one of our greatest letter writers in terms of both quantity (more than 10,000) and quality. A number of volumes of Holmes's letters, of which the best known are the collections of his correspondence with the British political scientist Harold Laski and the British legal scholar Sir Frederick Pollock, have been published already. But Felix Frankfurter, who throughout most of the period of his friendship with Holmes was an influential professor at the Harvard Law School, is the most important figure in American law with whom Holmes corresponded regularly. (Holmes wrote him 243 letters between 1912 and 1932.) So it was with great anticipation that I opened "Holmes and Frankfurter: Their Correspondence, 1912-1934." 
 One soon discovers, however, that the collection is one-sided: not only are there only half as many letters from Frankfurter to Holmes (the editors conjecture that Frankfurter, who had control of Holmes's papers for a time after the latter's death, threw away a lot of his own letters, for obscure reasons); but Frankfurter's letters are shorter and most contain little more than fulsome praise of Holmes. Since Frankfurter was 40 years younger than Holmes it is not surprising that they did not correspond on a plane of equality; but the more important reason for the one-sidedness of their correspondence -- the difference in age between Holmes and Laski was even greater, yet they did correspond as equals -- is that Frankfurter was an indifferent letter writer. So weak is Frankfurter's contribution that it is as if his role were that of a prompter as well as a foil. But this enables us to read Holmes's letters in closer sequence, undistracted by an intrusive interlocutor.
Another surprise, and to some it will be a disappointment, is that Frankfurter's active involvement in the issues that were coming before the Supreme Court during the period of their correspondence, which covers the last 20 years of Holmes's service on the Court, did not prompt Holmes to say any more about legal matters than he did to his other lawyer correspondents, Laski and Pollock. These letters contain roughly the same mixture of law, philosophy, history, economics, literature and personal chitchat as the letters to Laski and Pollock, except that since Frankfurter selected law clerks for Holmes, there is a fair amount of talk about them.
It has long been a puzzle what exactly Holmes's clerks did, if anything, besides balancing his checkbook, listening to his anecdotes, reading to him at night and doing other valet-like services for this elderly and eventually quite infirm man (Holmes retired at 90). It emerges from these letters that Holmes solicited and occasionally followed the clerks' criticism of his opinion drafts. There was more give and take between Justice and clerk than I had suspected, even on matters far removed from law. "The lad here," as Holmes often referred to his current clerk, "calls himself a pacifist as well as a socialist and exhibits a thin and stubborn rationality. I find myself very fond of him and even liking his society above the average . . . but getting devilish little juice or promise out of his asms" -- that is, enthusiasms -- "for isms."
That Holmes should have created an atmosphere in which his clerks felt free to state ideas patently antithetical to the thought of this formidable old man says a lot for Holmes's character, as does his remarking that "I always wonder at a man who takes himself seriously all the time," and his acknowledgment that "I mind the attacks more than the praise. And the reason is that we find it so easy to think ill of ourselves that when anyone suggests it, we say perhaps at least he's right."
The fact that this collection contains no major revelations about the Court or about Holmes as a judge is only a minor disappointment. The letters convey a more rounded, a more coherent picture of Holmes than any of the volumes of correspondence published so far, making this the best one to read first. Perhaps in part because Frankfurter was so unchallenging a correspondent, the Holmes we meet in these letters is more easygoing, more approachable, than the Holmes we encounter elsewhere.
I do not mean to suggest any discontinuity. The salient characteristics of his letters to Frankfurter -- the extraordinary gracefulness of the style, the warmth and graciousness of the manner, the epigrammatic wit (as in his view that Santayana "has the openness to all thought that is anti-dogmatic and yet he sneers like a dogmatist"), the intellectual breadth and curiosity, the tolerance and serenity, and the absence of malice -- are familiar from the earlier volumes of Holmes's correspondence. But they are blended in these letters in a way that imparts a greater coherence and intelligibility to his personality and mind-set and brings him closer to the reader. They help us see that Holmes's outlook was fundamentally of an esthetic, rather than of an ethical or political, character. "Did I ever tell you of Corot the painter that I heard once that he began as a most careful draftsman, working out every detail and came to his magisterial summaries at the end? I have thought of that in writing opinions latterly. . . . The eternal effort of art, even the art of writing legal decisions, is to omit all but the essentials."
Holmes had views on policy, in particular the view, which history has vindicated, that socialist nostrums were futile, but he was not dogmatic about his ideas -- "What the Hell is the use of being 80 if one can't be an old fogey?" -- and so was untroubled by the socialist leanings of his young friends Frankfurter and Laski. The esthetic outlook was united to a Puritan conscience that imposed a duty of relentless self-inspection. Holmes had the Protestant ethic without a belief in the Protestant (or any other) God. "I don't see how finite human beings can have any opinion whether they have struck bottom or are on some transitory platform."
But sorting out the strands in the complex thought of Justice Holmes is for another place and time. The abiding impression left by these letters is of charm and wit, as when Holmes remarks, apropos of having received a nutty anonymous letter of abuse, "What a queer lot the anonymous would be if you could get them in a room -- perhaps it would take Boston Common." And in the same letter: "I started a while ago on Harrington's "Oceana," 1656, but as it has waited 250 years, it can wait a little longer." Or when he remarks of Carlyle's "French Revolution": "He tells it de haut en bas as if he were recording the outbreaks of dangerous monkeys." Of Goethe: "I don't think I like Goethe greatly. He sat as a statue with a star on his breast for the universal wise man." If Holmes's many critics understood that his shocking sallies were often made tongue in cheek, they might revise their opinion of him:
"I have been chuckling since Monday with some devil talk I let off to an unknown female. . . . I told her . . . that you couldn't have a society like that of Greece except on some sort of slavery -- and that I loathed most of the things that I decided in favor of. If she had been a newspaper reporter, which for all I knew or know she might have been, what headlines were possible as to cynicism in high places. But as I said to Wigmore yesterday, a paradox takes the scum off your mind."
The editors, Robert M. Mennel, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, and Christine L. Compston, the past director of the National History Education Network and History Teaching Alliance, are to be commended for their informative introduction and their useful annotations of the references in the letters to people, books and cases that the passage of time has made obscure.

HEADLINE: As Slashed Arts Grants Are Unveiled, The Backlash Begins to Take Shape

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The National Endowment for the Arts announced a set of drastically reduced grants to organizations today, the first to reflect major budget cuts imposed by Congress after a rancorous debate over whether the agency should exist at all.
And for the first time, impact on the community was used as a criterion for selecting winners. In the past, grants were awarded on artistic merit alone, with little consideration given to whether the work was likely to be seen or heard by the general public. 
 Jane Alexander, the endowment's chairwoman, said the proposals that make it to the final stages of the selection process are of such high quality, and money is now so limited, that the agency had to find a new standard to pick the winners.
"They're all great," Ms. Alexander said. "How then are we going to choose?" The winners, she said, demonstrated in their applications that their work would reach the public to a significant degree, whether locally or nationally.
Hundreds of applicants, who had become accustomed to help from the endowment, were awarded far less than in past years, or nothing. Many of the losers, who were notified last week, have begun a loosely organized campaign to send copies of their rejection letters to their representatives in Congress.
"They're going to tell their Congressmen, 'You may have thought that you were cutting the N.E.A. in Washington, but you've been cutting the people right here in your own district,' " said John Sparks, the director of government affairs for the American Symphony Orchestra Association.
The largest grant, $1 million, went to the Educational Broadcasting Corporation and WNET in New York for the 1998 season of "Great Performances" and "Dance in America," as well as their "American Masters" series. The grant is two-thirds the amount the public television projects received in 1995, before the endowment's budget was slashed and a revision of the grant rules was begun.
Officials at WNET said they were pleased with the $1 million, which was all they had asked for.
In all, about two-thirds of the 887 applicants were turned down. The 293 winners range from large New York institutions like Lincoln Center, which got $200,000, and WNET, to small local workshops, like the Glen Ellyn Children's Chorus in Glen Ellyn, Ill., and the Vigilante Players in Bozeman, Mont., which each received $15,000.
The endowment would not release a list of the losing applicants because the loss of endowment financing can be devastating to struggling organizations, said Cherie Simon, the spokeswoman for the endowment. She said they count on the imprimatur of endowment grants to help raise money from private donors and corporations, which have little ability to do their own analyses of arts projects and rely on the endowment to do the work for them.
The grants announced today amount to about 20 percent of the $82.5 million that will be awarded for 1997. Another round of awards is to be announced in the spring.
"There is a real sense of frustration and anger," said Lee Kessler, the executive director of the American Arts Alliance in Washington, an advocacy organization with about 2,500 members around the country. "I know that there are many organizations that are planning to direct that frustration toward Congress."
Many are worried about the ripple effect of the loss of endowment backing, she said. "If they announce that they didn't get the money," she said, "what does that do to the local donors and benefactors?"
She added that the cuts were beginning to cause a backlash. "There is now a growing sense of awareness that the arts sector is important to education, it's important to the economy and to the quality of life in the community."
The 1997 grants are the first to reflect new conservative policies forced on the endowment by Congress. Nearly all grants to individuals were eliminated.
And the endowment may no longer make grants for general support of organizations. Now, the money may go only to specific projects. The arrangement gives the Government tighter control over how the money is used.
The crackdown came in response to some controversial projects, among them an exhibition of homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, which had been arranged by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, a recipient of endowment grants.
Prompted by complaints largely from the religious right, Congressional conservatives cut the endowment's budget by 40 percent last year, to $99.5 million from $162 million, and vowed to shut it down by 1998.
In response, the endowment was forced to fire dozens of employees and reorganize its grants process. Grants are now awarded in four somewhat vague categories, rather than in specific disciplines, like dance or theater. And organizations may make only one application, while they used to be able to make several applications in multiple categories.
The grants announced today are in the categories of 'Education and Access and Heritage and Preservation. Grants in the other two categories, Creation and Preservation, and Partnership, Planning and Stabilization, will be announced in the spring.
The budget cuts had generated fear in the arts world that big East Coast institutions would be favored over smaller organizations in other parts of the country. But endowment officials said the list showed that a strong effort was made to include diverse projects in all parts of the country.
Organizations with annual budgets under $500,000 got 41 percent of the Heritage and Preservation money and 22 percent of the Education and Access grants, Ms. Simon said.

HEADLINE: In America;
One in Four

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
From Columbia University comes the latest evidence of the growing disturbance in the American dream.
Between 1979 and 1994 the number of children under the age of 6 who were living in poverty in the United States grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million. That's according to a study released last week by the National Center for Children in Poverty at the Columbia School of Public Health. 
 During that period, the rate of poverty for children under 6 also grew drastically -- from 18 percent to 25 percent.
If we were considering some form of military intervention in another part of the world, policy makers would be arguing heatedly over the American interests involved. Senators and members of the House would be leaping to their feet to have their say.
Well, surely there must be compelling national interests at stake when one-quarter of all American children under 6 are poor. That's a rate much higher than in any other major Western democracy. And, yet, we hear mostly silence.
Scratch that. Silence would be a blessing. What we hear from the policy makers are arguments stressing the need to make even more children poor. And so we get a welfare law that, according to an estimate by the Urban Institute, will increase the total number of children in poverty by 1.1 million.
It has not yet been adequately explained how that serves the national interest.
The Columbia study, titled "One in Four," begins as follows:
"In the United States, distinguished by its extraordinary wealth, there are six million poor individuals known to few others but their own families. They cannot vote, they cannot work, most do not even go to school. They are America's youngest poor -- children under age six."
In the United States young children are more likely than any other age group to be poor. The demographics defy the convenient (and execrable) stereotypes. Children in all ethnic and geographic groups are affected. While black and Latino children, especially in big cities, are disproportionately poor, the poverty rate for young children grew twice as fast among whites as among blacks during the period studied. The poverty rate for young white children in the U.S. "is substantially higher than that for children in other Western democracies," the study said.
Geographically, the young child poverty rates are as follows: 36 percent in urban areas, 17 percent in suburban areas, 27 percent in rural areas.
The study also found that most of the children -- 62 percent -- lived in working families. Less than a third lived in families that relied exclusively on public assistance.
Many poor children are resilient and turn out fine. But many others succumb to one or more of the myriad disasters that poverty holds out for them. The study notes that young children in poverty are more likely to be born at low birthweight, to be hospitalized during childhood, to die in infancy or early childhood, to receive lower-quality medical care, to experience hunger and malnutrition, to experience high levels of conflict in their homes, to be confronted by violence and environmental hazards in their neighborhoods, and to experience harmful delays in their physical, cognitive, language and emotional development.
Even when the worst risks are avoided or overcome, the long-term outlook is bleak. "As children in poverty grow into adolescence and adulthood," the study said, "they are more likely to drop out of school, have children out of wedlock, and be unemployed."
Dr. Lawrence Aber, the center's director, warned of the appalling waste of "human capital" that can result from entrenched poverty. Such waste can pose a grave "risk" to the country in terms of lost productivity and other problems, he said.
Julian Palmer, one of the supervisors on the study, said flatly, "Six million kids in poverty during these critical years ought to be a real wake-up call for the nation."
We'll see. The center's study did not get a great deal of attention in the press. It lacked drama and had absolutely no cachet. (Michael Ovitz quitting was a much better read.) Besides, Christmas is coming, and then New Year's. The holidays are not a good time to deal with disturbances in the American dream.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Look Ahead to Fattening Of Rations as Part of U.N. Deal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 15

 BODY:
From a Baghdad storefront today, Khalid al-Zuweidi measured out Government rations for each of 136 families in his charge, scooping out flour, sugar and rice according to strict prescription. But for the first time in six years, he did so with a hope that next month the portions will be bigger.
With a limited amount of Iraqi oil starting to flow to foreign buyers for the first time since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the Iraqi Government has promised as part of a deal with the United Nations to fatten the meager package that has become the main source of sustenance for most of the country's 20 million people. 
 But redemption of that promise may have to wait until revenue from new contracts reaches a special United Nations account, and that has left ordinary Iraqis to wonder when they will witness the alchemy that promises to turn oil to food.
"Everyone wants to know: When will the U.N. food come?" said Mr. Zuweidi, a 50-year-old grocer.
For the Iraqi Government, this has been a week of celebration. On Tuesday, it began to pump oil to Turkey through a pipeline that had been closed since August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. It opened a second outlet today in the southern port of Basra with the loading of a Persian Gulf tanker with oil that Iraq said was bound for two American companies.
And suddenly, the lobby of the Government-owned Al Rashid hotel, the best in the capital, is crowded with French, Italian, Russian and other foreign businessmen who have hurried to Iraq in hopes of securing a contract to buy oil or to sell food and other goods that Iraq will be able to buy up in return. Most walk with nary a glance across a portrait of George Bush inlaid on the entryway floor that until recently was covered by a rug but is once again being displayed with a gulf war-era epithet denouncing Mr. Bush as a criminal.
Without exception, Government newspapers have portrayed the resumption of oil exports as the beginning of the end for the six-year-old embargo imposed by the United Nations after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
But it is far from clear how and whether the easing of the ban on oil sales will change the complexion of Iraq, whose economy remains shattered and whose people have suffered greatly as a result of the strict United Nations sanctions.
Minutes after the deal was announced last week, hundreds of celebrating Iraqis fired weapons that set Baghdad's skies athunder, and people interviewed in markets and cafes and on downtown streets said they were in good spirits. All said their lot would improve under the accord, and some said they expected the increased ration to cover their families' basic needs for the first time since the invasion of Kuwait pitted their country against most of the world.
But some basic foods like meat, cheese, eggs and milk will not be included even in the augmented monthly package, which the Government says will be all that it can afford.
And having lived comfortably before the Persian Gulf war, many of those interviewed said they remained bitter at the prospect that ordinary Iraqis must still bear the burden of an international campaign that the United States and its allies have said is aimed not at them but at Iraq's leader, President Saddam Hussein.
"Do they want to keep us hungry?" asked Mohammed Nuamen Youssef, a shabbily dressed 60-year-old who spoke amid the dust and din of the outdoor Shorjah bazaar. "Even the new ration will not be enough. I am a retired Government official, and my pension is only enough for two eggs. Is that logical?"
It is just such ordinary citizens who are intended to be comforted by the new accord, which was approved in New York last week after nearly a year of haggling. It will allow Iraq to sell only about one-fifth as much oil as it sold before the war.
Under the terms of the United Nations accord, about $1.32 billion in revenue from the $2 billion in oil that Iraq will be permitted to sell in the next six months will be set aside for the purchase of food, medicine and other essential aid under United Nations supervision.
As soon as it can purchase the new supplies, the Government announced last week, it will increase the ration of each of the six basic foods it provides to its citizens by a substantial share. For each person, the monthly allotment of rice is to increase from about three pounds to more than five, for instance, while the sacks of flour doled out to every family will include nearly 20 pounds per person, up from about 15.
International health officials, who have criticized the current ration as woefully inadequate, say malnutrition and inadequate medical care resulting from the sanctions have contributed to the deaths of more than 4,500 Iraqi children each year. A United Nations official in Baghdad said today that the new handout would be enough to provide about 2,020 calories a day, sufficient for minimum nutritional requirements but not much more than the World Food Program provides to refugees.
But Gualtiero Fulcheri, an Italian who is the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said he could not predict when the Iraqi Government will be able to increase the ration under the United Nations plan, which specifies that all revenue from the oil sales be put in escrow in a special United Nations account.
In an interview here, Mr. Fulcheri said it would be "several weeks" at the earliest before Iraqis received augmented rations, and he suggested that the lag could be far longer unless suppliers prove willing to sell to Iraq on credit.
"Everyone is working at full speed, both on the Government and the agency side," Mr. Fulcheri said. But he added that there would be "a certain slowness in starting up."
Until the gulf war, Iraq never had to resort to a ration system, and even after six years of collecting their allotment every month, many Iraqis are still uncomfortable with the procedure. But the collapse in the value of the Iraqi currency, the dinar, under United Nations sanctions has left few with any choice but to present their coupons to grocers like Mr. Zuweidi, who keeps close records that show that none of the families in his neighborhood have ever let their allotment go unclaimed.
An initial fall and then a precipitous rise in food prices here recently have stunned ordinary Iraqis, whose initial glow of good will about the partial lifting of sanctions has clearly begun to subside.
"Even if there has been a fault, all faults can be corrected," said Mr. Youssef, the retired Government official, who like many Iraqis says it is now long past time for the all of the sanctions still in effect against Iraq to be lifted. "Six years is quite enough."

HEADLINE: Previously Reluctant States Moving on Welfare Changes

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Banking on a vibrant economy, states once reluctant to change their welfare systems are devising ambitious ways to push aid recipients into the jobs at the heart of the new welfare law.
Even states with strong liberal traditions, like West Virginia, Hawaii and Minnesota, and states that have long lagged in grappling with welfare policy, like Texas and South Carolina, are charging ahead out of concern that if they do not act now to shift people into the work force, it will be much more difficult later, when the economy turns sluggish. 
 The plans being drawn include offering employers wage subsidies and relocating recipients to areas where they can find jobs.
But critics say that many states, in their haste, are forcing people into dead-end jobs. They also say that drops in the welfare rolls resulting from a good economy will be precarious and that a downturn will make it even more difficult to find work for people now on welfare, who are often unskilled, uneducated and inexperienced.
And the critics still contend that the law is flawed in that it requires states to create new programs to encourage jobs without providing money for training or placement.
Many state officials continue to complain about the law's toughest provisions, including cutting off the Federal welfare benefits of people who have not found a job within two years, and of most recipients after a total of five years on welfare. And it is not clear how many of the new programs being devised will be certified by the Federal Government, a necessary step to get financing, or whether they will even work.
But interviews with dozens of state welfare officials at a conference here this week -- one of the first large gatherings of officials since the new law passed in July -- show that beyond Wisconsin, Michigan and Massachusetts, which have attracted wide attention for their efforts on welfare policy, many other states are now embarking on previously untried programs.
And, the interviews show, state officials have accepted the new approach to welfare: that the goal is to put people in jobs, any jobs, with less emphasis on whether they hold a future. Under this model, job training is secondary to job placement because the assumption is that working in itself helps people gain confidence, skills and good work habits.
Kentucky and West Virginia have begun offering relocation allowances to move the poor from Appalachia's pits of entrenched unemployment to jobs in cities. South Carolina forces people to move to where the jobs are. In Texas, Indiana and Mississippi, welfare officials scrutinize applicants to see if, with a little temporary help, they can be steered into jobs and never join the welfare rolls.
Welfare officials say they are tailoring their efforts to each individual's needs, a striking change from the old system, which, for example, gave every mother with two children the same benefits. "Now they are asking, 'What is it you need so you can get into the work force and stay there?' " said Elaine Ryan, director for government affairs at the American Public Welfare Association, which led the conference here. "This has got to move states farther along."
The welfare law took effect on Oct. 1. Most major provisions do not take effect until next July 1, which is also the deadline for states to submit plans explaining how they will comply with the law. But at least 38 states have already submitted plans to the Department of Health and Human Services and 18 have been certified by the Federal Government, which means they are eligible for block grants of Federal money.
Because of the way the welfare bill is financed, most states whose plans have been certified will get a windfall on their 1997 grant. Indeed, for the next six years, the grants will be based on years when jobs were scarce and welfare caseloads were high, not on how many aid recipients a state has on its rolls. So the grants remain the same, even if rolls fall because of a booming economy.
For big states, that can amount to hundreds of millons of dollars more than they would have received under the old system. That money can be used to meet the added costs of putting people to work.
Anticipating this windfall, even the poorest state, Mississippi -- whose plan has been certified -- has cobbled together a jobs plan that offers incentives for both welfare recipients and employers. "We're providing child care benefits, up to $8 a day for transportation, extended Medicaid coverage" for recipients who find work, said Donald Taylor, executive director of the state's Department of Human Services.
To induce employers to hire the recipients, Mississippi gives them the recipient's cash assistance, which the employers pay back to the new worker, along with some wages. "The employer agrees to pay $1 an hour into an individual development account," Mr. Taylor said.
So in addition to their wages, the workers build up savings accounts that the employers turn over to them when they reach $1,000. "It is our fervent hope," he said, "that the worker will use the money to buy a better car to get to work."
Mr. Taylor said 2,000 former welfare recipients were now working in such arrangements in six of the state's 82 counties. "We'll go to the rest of the counties by July 1 of next year," he said.
In Missouri, welfare officials began experimenting with a different approach three years ago to encourage hiring in Kansas City.
Employers who hired a welfare recipient received a state check, typically $3.30 an hour, representing the client's cash assistance and food stamps. "We're placing people there at $7.50 an hour," all of which the worker keeps, said Gary J. Stangler, director of the state's Department of Social Services.
As it expands the program to St. Louis and other communities, Missouri is redefining it.
Missouri now provides case management services -- like finding a baby sitter or a ride to work for a worker who needs one -- for half the 400 recipients employed through the program.
For all that, Mr. Stangler said the experiment had also revealed an ominous note for people who expect the welfare law to put most clients to work. In addition to the 400 who are working, Mr. Stangler said, 400 others have quit their jobs or have been dismissed.
In Maine, officials are trying yet another approach, which involves shedding some long-entrenched compunctions about intruding upon recipients' privacy
"One of the things we're trying in Maine is home visits for first-time applicants," said Kevin W. Concannon, Commissioner of the state's Department of Human Services. The point is not to detect violations of welfare regulations, Mr. Concannon said, but to ascertain the particular needs of the recipient. "You can learn more looking around somebody's kitchen for 60 seconds than you can during 60 minutes interviewing someone in an antiseptic office."
If the worker sees last night's dishes stacked up," he said, "it's one thing. If she sees two weeks of dishes, it's a sign they need special help before they go looking for a job."
Utah negotiates a self-sufficiency plan with each of its recipients, laying out steps to help the recipient get job training, helping with the job hunt and giving counseling on work habits.
"If they do not follow up," said Robin Arnold-Williams, director of Utah's Department of Human Services, "we can reduce the grant $100 and, after two months, close the case."
In South Carolina, said James T. Clark, director of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, new welfare applicants cannot get cash assistance until they prove that they have applied for at least 10 jobs.
Then, if they refuse or quit jobs, they and their children lose the whole check. "Fairly immediately," Mr. Clark said. But, he added, the check will resume after 30 days of cooperation with the welfare office.
"It isn't that we're trying to be mean," Mr. Clark said. "We want to set some standards for people who are poor that the rest of society lives by. I don't want to make an exception for them."
In many states, having a baby no longer assures much of a reprieve from work. "We used to exempt women with children under 3 years," said Michael Becker, administrator of the St. Petersburg-Clearwater district for the Florida Department of Children and Families. "Now we exempt them with children under 3 months."
Many welfare officials said they were worried that the law does not provide enough child care support. Officials are concerned about migrant workers in Texas and California, and seasonal workers in Vermont and Colorado ski resorts who are losing the food stamps that help keep them afloat in off-seasons.
Some big states, like New York, California, New Jersey, Texas, Florida and Washington, are lobbying the Government to restore the food stamps and disability aid that the law denies legal immigrants. But rather than let their differences stall enforcement of the law, some states are taking on such burdens themselves. "We're going to continue to cover legal immigrants," said Susan M. Chandler, director of Hawaii's Department of Human Services.
She said that Gov. Benjamin Cayatano, a Democrat, was the son of legal immigrants. "And he believes it's the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: Japan and U.S. Resolve Dispute on Insurance

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
American and Japanese negotiators hammered out a final agreement today on greater foreign access to the insurance market here, ending a protracted trade dispute hours before a midnight deadline.
American negotiators worked overnight into this morning, poring over a Japanese proposal on liberalizing the $341 billion insurance market, the largest outside of the United States. The deal averts the threat of American trade sanctions and eliminates at least for now what had been a long-standing thorn in bilateral economic relations. 
 "Taken together, these measures represent fundamental change in the Japanese insurance market, making it more open and competitive," the United States Embassy said today in a statement.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has made deregulation and financial reform a centerpiece of his new administration. Though liberalizing the primary insurance market -- dealing mainly in life, auto, fire and other casualty insurance -- is likely to hurt some of the weaker Japanese companies, the move dovetails with Mr. Hashimoto's promises to the public.
"I feel relieved," Mr. Hashimoto told reporters after a basic agreement had been announced.
Although the two sides ended up striking a deal, the tensions between them were evident throughout the process. When Japan's Finance Minister announced a basic agreement on Saturday night, American officials, caught by surprise, insisted that talks were still under way.
[In Washington, the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, who had been in Tokyo on Saturday, said American negotiators had achieved their main objective: to put the deregulation of the Japanese insurance market on a rapid schedule that, for the first time, is spelled out in writing.
["I think the Japanese realized that we did not plan to give way," said Ms. Barshefsky, who was nominated by President Clinton as Trade Representative on Friday.]
Foreign insurers have captured only 3.58 percent of the Japanese insurance market, but most of that business is in the tiny "third sector" niche market, offering specialty products for accidents, cancer treatment, nursing home care and the like.
The primary insurance business is dominated by giant Japanese companies in a tightly regulated market where it is difficult for foreign companies to compete.
In particular, prices are essentially fixed by industry rating organizations. This makes it virtually impossible for foreign insurers to cut prices to lure away customers from Japanese companies.
In announcing the deal, the Japanese said that they would liberalize premium rates for automobiles, fire and other casualty insurance policies by July 1998.
[Ms. Barshefsky said today that this meant that, for the first time since the end of World War II, Japanese insurers would be able to charge variable rates. In auto insurance, for example, rates could be set by likelihood of accidents. Drivers in rural areas could be offered insurance that costs less than for drivers in urban areas, and age, gender and driving history could be considered in setting rates.
[She said the Japanese Government also agreed to deregulate the fire insurance market -- a major market in a country of crowded, earthquake-prone cities -- within two years. And the Government widened the categories of new insurance products that can be introduced with minimal review by the Japanese Finance Ministry.]
While American companies have not been able to compete effectively in the primary insurance market in Japan, they have fared well in the "third sector" from which the big Japanese insurers have been excluded. The latest trade dispute was set off partly by Japanese plans to open up this market to the Japanese insurance giants.
While this is, in a sense, the kind of deregulation and market opening that in general the United States favors, in this case it opposed the scheme.
Washington says those plans would violate a 1994 accord and would enable large Japanese companies to take back business from American insurers before opening up the primary market to foreigners. In the 1994 accord, Japan agreed to "avoid any radical change" in the business environment, until sufficient deregulation allowed foreign insurers to compete in the primary sectors.
Under today's agreement Japanese firms will not be allowed full entry into the "third sector" until two and a half years after the main sectors of the insurance market are fully opened to foreigners.

HEADLINE: The World That Awaits U.N. Envoy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Razali Ismail, who has represented Malaysia at the United Nations for more than eight years and is this year's president of the General Assembly, thought about how he would describe the environment into which Bill Richardson is about to step as the new United States envoy here.
"It's an ecosystem," he said, "an ecosystem of its own that you have to learn to live in." 
 This is an atmosphere in which appointed times are usually approximations and courtesies may be florid -- "I thank the distinguished gentleman for his kind words addressed to me." But those images often obscure the intensely complicated work going on not only in United Nations headquarters but also -- and usually more so -- in the missions of the 185 member nations and a host of foundations and research organizations devoted to foreign affairs.
Diplomacy is a quiet game, so in a city as busy and noisy as New York the United Nations is hardly noticed -- except when its diplomats fail to pay their parking tickets or rent. Yet New York is the most powerful diplomatic center in the world, and it is growing more so as nations use this base to conduct business with one other, often in secret, within the enabling orbit of the organization.
"Most countries, including a lot of small countries, send their very best people to the United Nations," said Thomas R. Pickering, who represented the United States here during the early years of the Bush Administration before serving as Ambassador to India and then Russia.
"As a result, they bring special skills -- and sometimes special capacities to make problems," he added. "Here it wasn't always the size of the country that counted, but in some cases the size of the ambassador and the size of the fight."
Mr. Pickering, who is now retired from the Foreign Service, is remembered here as a master of the complicated United Nations assignment. During his tenure, he had to organize backing for the war against Saddam Hussein of Iraq in 1991 while also monitoring the progress of peace efforts in El Salvador, a burgeoning international environmental movement and countless other issues.
"He could be totally preoccupied with Iraq and yet make the ambassador of a small third-world country feel that he was the most important person around," another diplomat said.
Mr. Pickering said that there were practical as well as diplomatic reasons for casting a nation's net wide.
"There is always a tendency on the part of big countries to overlook that fact that these international organizations are also voting bodies in some cases; that they operate the way legislatures do," he said. "The bulk of the countries in the United Nations have individuals representing them with nearly full powers with respect to votes."
Getting to know them personally could pay off "down the road," when important issues are decided, he added. Furthermore, not a few envoys return home to become government ministers.
He noted that the United Nations mission is the only diplomatic outpost of the United States to which several people with the rank of ambassador are assigned because there is a need for diplomats with plenipotentiary power on more than one issue at a time. This is also true of other major nations.
The head of a diplomatic delegation at the United Nations is known as the permanent representative. That "perm rep," in United Nations slang, invariably holds the rank of ambassador within his or her country's diplomatic service -- a civilian equivalent of a military rank that remains with its holder. Thus Madeleine K. Albright, the permanent representative of the United States and soon to be Secretary of State, holds the rank of Ambassador. Her deputy and the leading negotiator on Iraq and the Middle East, Edward W. Gnehm Jr., is also an Ambassador, as is Karl R. Inderfurth, who deals with African issues. A fourth Ambassador, Victor Marrero, handles social and economic issues.
With the Security Council now meeting almost every day year round, the workload for one envoy of a major country would be overwhelming. Much of the work gets wide public attention, unlike diplomacy in a distant capital.
"Multilateral diplomacy is a bit different from bilateral diplomacy," said Sir David Hannay, who retired last year after serving as Britain's permanent representative at the United Nations. "You have to have a reasonable spread of specializations. You now certainly have to have military advice. And on the development side, you have to have people who know something about the environment, who know something about population control, who know something about wider development policies."
Sir David said that Britain saw the United Nations as "a great clearing house for foreign policy."
"We talk to people here whom we don't talk to elsewhere because we have very fraught relations with them," he said. "Also, a lot of our foreign policy involvement is now heavily multilateralized. It works through organizations like the European Union and the U.N."
It is not only the United Nations assignment that is different, the envoys say. It is also New York.
"Your life in a capital is very much tied up in relations you have and your country has with the host country," Mr. Pickering said. "The life of New York is tied up, particularly for medium or small-size countries, with a whole series of ambassadors of common ilk on issues that are dealt with in a kind of international legislature."
Sir David said he relished the diversity: the theater, the museums, the opportunity to meet bankers or business leaders.
"New York has a life of its own, and it's basically a business and cultural life -- not a political life -- separate from the U.N.," he said. "That's a fascinating life.
"Washington is a company town, really," he said. "And the company is U.S. Inc."

HEADLINE: Denver Isn't Big Enough for Both of Them;
2 Newspapers Battle for Hearts, Minds and All Those Ad Dollars

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Some executives use the backs of their business cards to promote a product line, or to print their names in Japanese. Managers of The Denver Post hand out this message with theirs: "Return for a 30-Day Free Sample of Colorado's Only Statewide Newspaper."
Neither the 104-year-old Post nor its 138-year-old rival, The Rocky Mountain News, is missing an opportunity to grab another reader or sell another line of advertising in their struggle to come out on top in one of the country's last big-city newspaper wars, where two contrasting strategies of newspaper publishing are being thrashed out in one of the richest, trendiest and fastest-growing markets in the country. The competition is so fierce that each paper regularly attacks the other's circulation claims in its news columns, each reads victory over the other in the same set of circulation figures, and neither side will admit the possibility of defeat. 
 Neither side believes that Denver will support two newspapers forever, however many Californians, Texans and New Yorkers move here for the sunshine and the scenery. Each is a flagship publication, The Post for William Dean Singleton's Medianews Group, The News for the E. W. Scripps chain. The winner will command a youthful and prosperous market that attracted 60,000 new households last year and that continues to add acres of new homes each week; the death of the loser could threaten the health of its parent company.
The rest of the newspaper industry is also gripped by the Denver story, because the struggle amounts to a test case of two competing strategies that are at play within the newspaper business these days. The Post, for one, has steadfastly maintained the broadest possible circulation and home delivery area in the war, despite the added expense of distant deliveries to parts of Wyoming, New Mexico and Kansas. The Wall Street Journal, the two Detroit papers, The News and The Free Press, and The New York Times have all followed the same strategy, reasoning that despite the potential drag on profits of sending only a few papers to distant readers, having even a toehold in many communities offers the best chance of one day dominating the region.
The News, on the other hand, cut off deliveries to 25,000 readers beyond the Front Range cities, 6 percent of its circulation, to save the $30 a month it was losing on every paper it trucked hundreds of predawn miles over mountain passes.
The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald and dozens of other papers have also cut back outlying circulation in recent years, saying it was expensive and unhelpful to advertisers. But none had cut as radically as The News.
Rural readers were angry and people in the industry were astonished, but like a gasoline price war or an air fare war, this battle of the dailies is also making winners of newspaper readers and advertisers, who are taking advantage of rates that start out lower than at any similar paper -- before the usual discounts are added.
"What's happened to advertising rates?" Larry D. Strutton, the publisher of The News, was asked. "There aren't any," he said with a laugh.
Both sides agree that Denver will not always be big enough for both papers.
"All you've got to do is look at what's happened to two-newspaper markets all around the country, and it doesn't take much imagination to figure out what the future holds," said Mr. Singleton, president and part owner of The Post's parent company, Medianews Group. "New York will always support a couple of papers, Chicago will, maybe Boston. But Dallas did not; Houston did not; San Antonio did not. So it's hard to see a future where two newspapers survive in Denver."
Mr. Strutton of The News agreed. "When there is the next significant downturn in the economy and/or the next big increase in newsprint prices, Denver will probably be a one-paper town," he said.
The competition is only heightened by the difficulty posed for the parent companies in absorbing losses in Denver. The News is the flagship publication of E. W. Scripps's chain of 22 papers and, judging by circulation, source of the biggest share of its newspaper earnings.
Mr. Singleton and his partner, Richard Scudder, own 18 papers from Vermont to Southern California, but The Post represents a kind of last stand for him at publishing a major city daily. Record newsprint prices and dominant competition defeated his Dallas Times-Herald in 1991 and his Houston Post in 1994. As The Houston Post neared its death, Mr. Singleton moved his family from Houston to Colorado and to The Denver Post, which had been a failing paper when he bought it from Times Mirror in 1987.
"This is it," said the man who got his start in newspapers as a 15-year-old sports writer, and who bought his first paper before graduating from the University of Texas. "We ain't moving again."
Mr. Singleton considers The News's retreat from rural circulation the prelude to his ultimate victory. Yet on paper, at least, the move made sense. Home delivery is usually no more than a break-even proposition for papers with compact circulation areas.
Besides, Mr. Strutton contends that Denver is hardly a typical metropolitan area. It is instead a densely populated island in a sea of prairie and mountain, an area that contains 68 percent of Colorado's 3.5 million people and, Mr. Strutton asserted, accounted for 69 percent of the state's retail sales.
"How hard are we going to fight?" asked Alan M. Horton, senior vice president for newspapers at Scripps. "Damn hard. We may be a little contrarian with our Front Range strategy, but that strategy is based on a lot of research and a lot of logic, and we don't expect it to be an overnight success and we don't want it to be, because what comes in a day can go in a day."
Though The Post surged into the overall circulation lead over the summer because of The News's strategic retreat, The News holds the overall circulation lead in its Denver redoubt, Mr. Strutton went on. That, he said, is where the paper would make its final stand.
"The thing that I have always tried to preach here and everywhere I've worked is that you have got to protect your core market," Mr. Strutton said. "You concentrate on that, you entrench, you make yourself impregnable, and then you can worry about other things."
Historically, focusing on the core at the expense of the outlying area has posed problems. The Philadelphia Bulletin, The Dallas Times-Herald and The St. Louis Globe-Democrat were all dominant papers in their urban core but all fell to more broadly circulating, suburban-centered competitors.
Cutting back saved The News $10 million, Mr. Strutton said, roughly the amount it costs The Post to maintain its regionwide circulation.
"Sure, we could save $10 million a year and pull out of the rest of the state, but that's not what The Denver Post is," Mr. Singleton said. "Look what it says right on the front page -- it says 'Voice of the Rocky Mountain Empire.' It doesn't say, 'Voice of Colfax Avenue.' "
Reducing costs allowed Mr. Strutton to cut The News's advertising rates below The Post's, which nevertheless has a slight lead in overall advertising linage. What is clear, however, is that competition has made ad bargains of both papers.
"We think this situation is very good for us and I wouldn't change it for the world," said Fran Victor, vice president for marketing for Gart Brothers, a sporting goods chain with stores throughout the Rockies, which spends "several millions" a year to advertise in both papers.
"I have dealt with one-newspaper towns and, believe me, you don't have much leverage in dealing with them," Ms. Victor went on. "So I hope they both live long and healthy lives."
Here is an example of what Ms. Victor was talking about: An open column inch of ad space in The News weekday edition costs $213.50, and the same space in The Post is $211, according to Standard Rates and Data Systems, a nationwide clearinghouse for ad rates. The same space in The Kansas City Star, in a one-paper market that in other ways resembles Denver's, is $295.
The war has also benefited readers with some of the cheapest newspapers in the country. Last year, before The News pulled back, the two papers' combined daily circulation was 635,000, in a market that ranks 21st in population.
According to the most recent circulation figures, The News now leads The Post in circulation in the six-county Denver region, mostly on the strength of its lead in the core city region. The competition is closer in the surrounding suburban counties, however. Since The News's rollback, The Post leads in overall circulation, by 334,400 to 317,000 weekdays and by 462,000 to 406,000 on Sunday.
While they fight for the loyalty of the prosperous suburbanites drawn to the region's life style and jobs in high-technology industries, the two papers have moved closer in the way they cover the news. The News, which like most tabloids has a strong appeal to men, is still more likely to lead with crime and sports, but it has softened this approach by devoting the bottom of the front page to headlines beckoning readers to inside features, particularly life style stories.
The Post, by contrast, has been trying to loosen up under its new editor, Dennis A. Britton, a former editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He is changing movie reviewers because, he said, "we were writing about films, and our readers go to the movies, they don't go to films," and has begun to play down crime coverage in favor of making The Post a more upbeat paper.
"I am not dumbing-down the paper," Mr. Britton said in response to a question. "I am crime-ing it down and Pollyanna-ing it up, because I am looking for a positive spin on things -- because I want people to read every page of the paper."
Ultimately, the battle for Denver may be determined by the willingness of each paper's parent company to outspend the other in a slump, when advertisers pull back. The Scripps company has the deepest pockets in such a matchup, and its stock is strong following the sale of its cable subsidiary this year. But Scripps is a publicly traded company, subject to pressure from Wall Street to cut losses.
"My assumption is that The Post is economically more fragile than The News," said Mike Wirth, director of the School of Communications at the University of Denver, and an expert in media economics. "Ten years ago, The Post was almost dead, and what they have done to build the paper back up is remarkable, but even though they may be profitable, they are losing money on their out-of-area circulation while The News is taking their savings and putting it back into their paper in the counties around Denver."
Mr. Singleton predicted that eventually Scripps would have to walk away from any losses at The News. "It's O.K. for Scripps to spend money year after year on them," he said, "but one day there has to be a reckoning."
Mr. Strutton said, "I always like my opponents to underestimate me."

HEADLINE: As HUD Seeks to Avoid Cuts, Its Efforts for Homeless Are Praised

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
As he tries to fend off proposed cuts in his agency's budget, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros has released a study by Barnard and Columbia Universities praising HUD's programs to help the homeless.
The study, conducted by the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy, determined that the housing agency's annual budget for homeless programs had risen to $1.1 billion in 1995 from $404 million in 1992. The study also found that by shifting how the money was spent, HUD had served 14 times more people last year than it did in 1992. 
 The report praised the agency for creating incentives for local governments to work with the Federal Government and to leverage Federal funds with money raised from other public and private sources. In providing money to communities, the report said, HUD gave local officials the flexibility to design their own approaches to the homeless problem.
Ester Fuchs, one of the report's authors, said, "One of the major findings of this report, as surprising as it might be to people, is that in the context of homeless service delivery, HUD has actually created a program which has helped local governments and helped localities provide more efficient and less redundant services, and also to help them encourage the creation of a comprehensive program."
In releasing the report at a news conference on Friday, Mr. Cisneros said the study, sponsored by HUD, was an "independent analysis" and not a "self-serving" report. But the study was released at a time when the agency is in a public fight with the White House Office of Management and Budget over what level of financing Congress will be asked to provide in the budget for the 1998 fiscal year.
In a telephone interview today, however, Mr. Cisneros said he had received assurances from the budget office that it would not recommend major reductions in programs for the homeless.
Last week, The Wall Street Journal carried excerpts from a memorandum from Mr. Cisneros to Franklin D. Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, in which the housing secretary said that proposed reductions in financing for several of HUD's programs would be harmful.
"I sincerely believe these reductions go too far and would effectively destroy the hard-won reforms that are now being recognized and gaining momentum," Mr. Cisneros wrote.
At his news conference, Mr. Cisneros, who has already announced his intention to resign his position, declined to expand on his comments in the memorandum. But he did not deny making them, nor did he shy away from defending their intent.
"All I have wanted to do is to make sure that the future budgets, even in an era of very tight resources, and an era when a balancing will squeeze out some priorities, that those programs for poor people get a fair hearing," he said. "And that's been the nature of my intervention to date."

HEADLINE: THE PEOPLE;
A Sense of Well-Being Among Boeing Workers

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 15

 BODY:
More than a year ago, the fortunes of nearly 70,000 people at the world's largest airplane-manufacturing complex here seemed to have hit rock bottom. The Boeing Company was in a prolonged slump and was still laying off workers. And 30,000 machinists were on strike, trying to keep their jobs from being sent to overseas contractors.
Today, after hearing that Boeing will absorb the McDonnell Douglas Corporation -- the only other large American commercial airplane maker -- workers at the major Boeing plants in the Seattle area were feeling flush. 
 There was less certainty in St. Louis and Long Beach, Calif., where McDonnell Douglas has its major operations. At least for now, though, Boeing officials said that there would be no layoffs immediately and that the combined company would have a total work force of 200,000.
Even before today's announcement, Boeing had been on a hiring binge, adding 13,500 workers in Washington State this year, for a total of 85,000.
"This is the most secure I've ever felt," said Matt Dillon, an electrician who has been with the company for 20 years. "When the company feels confident enough that it can make that kind of purchase, it makes you feel confident that things are going well locally."
By contrast, McDonnell Douglas has been reeling. In recent weeks it had lost out in competition for contracts to make an advanced fighter jet for the Pentagon and commercial planes for several longtime customers. Today's news came as a surprise, and brought some hope.
"It knocks my socks off," said Leslie W. Robbins, a city Councilman in Long Beach, where McDonnell Douglas has 20,000 workers and is the city's largest private employer. "This may be a good thing, since Boeing is the unquestioned leader."
Today's announcement did not make it clear whether McDonnell's main commercial jetliners, the MD-80 and MD-90, would still be made or whether the factories would be converted to make Boeing models. "What's important is building planes and that they are in Long Beach," Mr. Robbins said.
Boeing, the nation's leading exporter, makes more than 60 percent of all the commercial airplanes in the world. By joining forces with McDonnell Douglas, company officials say they can focus on their sole chief competitor -- the Airbus Industrie consortium in Europe.
"I figure our main competitor is Airbus, and the U.S. companies have to get together to work together," Jim Rice, a maintenance electronic technician, said.
In announcing the deal, Boeing officials said the corporate office and main manufacturing plants would remain in the Seattle area, with operations in 26 states. Boeing's total work force now is 137,000, and McDonnell Douglas has 63,000.
"The greatest strength of this combination is our people," said Philip M. Condit, the president at Boeing. He called the $13.3 billion deal to buy McDonnell Douglas, "an historic moment in aviation and aerospace."
Boeing had slumped during the general downturn in commercial business throughout most of the 1990's. By late last year, after the machinists' strike was settled, orders for new planes began to pour in. Boeing has received orders for 618 planes worth $46 billion this year, almost twice as many orders as it received all last year.
"Compared to the last two years, when everything seemed to be on a downturn, it's good to see it looking up," said Brian Talley, a maintenance dispatcher at the company's plant in Everett, Wash., where Boeing makes the jumbo 747. "It sounds great."
Local officials are optimistic. Economists here use a rule of thumb saying that each Boeing job brings with it nearly three additional jobs, in the form of service workers, side contractors and retailers. Seattle's economy has already been heating up from hiring at the Microsoft Corporation.
In addition, retailers rely on Christmas bonuses and a weeklong holiday vacation that Boeing offers its workers at the end the year, allowing the airplane factories to come to a standstill.
Before today's announcement, Washington State officials had already said that because both Boeing and Microsoft were hiring, the state would grow by 400,000 people in the next four years.
Growth has long been considered a mixed blessing here. So today's announcment was greeted by skepticism in some quarters. "It will strengthen the local economy, but it means more traffic, and housing prices will continue to rise," Ed Hanson, the Mayor of Everett, said.

HEADLINE: THE AEROSPACE MERGER: THE DEAL;
BOEING OFFERING $13 BILLION TO BUY McDONNELL DOUGLAS, LAST U.S. COMMERCIAL RIVAL

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company announced yesterday that it planned to acquire the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in a $13.3 billion deal, the 10th-largest merger in American history and the largest ever in the aerospace industry.
The acquisition would make Boeing the only manufacturer of commercial jets in the United States while catapulting it ahead of the Lockheed Martin Corporation as the world's largest aerospace company and bolstering its status as the nation's leading exporter. 
 Boeing's proposed merger with the producer of aircraft like the MD-11 civilian airliner and the Navy F-18 fighter also underscores the growing importance of size in the aircraft and military businesses, which have little room left even for companies with the breadth and decades' worth of expertise of McDonnell Douglas.
Yesterday's announcement signals that aircraft manufacturing will increasingly be a competition among nations. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that sold its first jet in 1974, has grown to be a formidable competitor behind Boeing.
So far this year, by some measures, Boeing has won roughly 60 percent of new commercial aircraft orders and Airbus has won 35 percent, leaving McDonnell Douglas with about 5 percent of the new orders.
Executives at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, as well as industry experts, said the deal made sense. Boeing is predominantly a commercial aircraft builder that hopes to continue expanding its presence in military contracting while the bulk of McDonnell Douglas's business is already in the military field. With a rich history in commercial aircraft and substantial manufacturing capacity, McDonnell Douglas also can help Boeing meet increased worldwide demand for new planes.
Philip M. Condit, the chief executive of Boeing, described the merger as "an historic moment in aviation and aerospace."
At a news conference in Washington, executives of both companies referred on several occasions to the balance of military and civilian business that their merger will lend to the combined company, which will continue to be called the Boeing Company. Their emphasis clearly represented some advance salesmanship to regulators in Washington, who will be scrutinizing the merger for antitrust problems.
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which review such mergers, had no comment yesterday on the proposal. But company officials and analysts do not expect the proposed merger to face major regulatory obstacles.
The companies also sought to allay fears of layoffs in the communities where McDonnell Douglas's corporate presence is strongest, particularly in its headquarters city of St. Louis and in Southern California, where it employs a large plane-making work force.
Company executives said that their businesses were growing, not shrinking, and that the number of displaced workers would be minimal. McDonnell Douglas plans to continue making commercial airliners in California as long as customers keep ordering them.
Still, Boeing said it expected to save $1 billion in annual costs, although it did not specify how that would be achieved.
Industry analysts, who have often heard speculation about such a merger in recent years, said they were still struck by the sheer size of the combination now that it may become a reality.
"The merger creates this incredible powerhouse with massive technical, financial, manufacturing and marketing resources," said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst at BT Securities. "They've got it all."
Under terms of the proposed transaction, McDonnell Douglas shareholders would receive 0.65 share of Boeing stock for each share they currently own. The deal would need to be approved by Federal regulators, as well as shareholders of both companies.
Mr. Demisch said the only problem he foresaw for the merged company, which would have combined 1997 revenues of about $48 billion and very little debt, was where it would invest all the billions of free cash it is expected to generate in profits in coming years. Still, "it is a high-class problem to have," Mr. Demisch said.
Harry C. Stonecipher, the chief executive of McDonnell Douglas who will be president of the enlarged Boeing, said in a phone interview that the two companies agreed to merge on Tuesday. The deal was sealed in a meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seattle between Mr. Stonecipher and Mr. Condit, who will be the chairman of Boeing after the merger.
Mr. Stonecipher said that he flew to the meeting with parameters for a possible deal that were approved by his company's board and that he and Mr. Condit reached an accord in one hour, then spent two hours discussing broad points about how to merge the two companies.
Mr. Stonecipher said that shortly after he joined McDonnell Douglas in September 1994, he decided that if McDonnell Douglas were to merge with any other company, he wanted it to be Boeing. "This is the deal that we wanted," he said.
Executives for both companies said they had first broached the idea of a merger three years ago, and even held serious talks last year before realizing they could not agree on a price.
Since then, however, the long-term business prospects for McDonnell Douglas have dimmed significantly. Though the company has a strong backlog of orders, particularly on the military side of its business, it still became clear it was less likely to emerge as a technological leader among aerospace companies in the next century.
Last month, for example, McDonnell Douglas was knocked out of a competition for a contract to build the Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft to serve all branches of the United States military. The news was a tremendous blow to McDonnell Douglas, which now builds many fighters, and a huge victory for Boeing, which remains in competition with Lockheed Martin for the contract, potentially worth $750 billion or more.
This fall, McDonnell Douglas also said that rather than try to compete as a company with a full range of small to very large jets, it would become a specialized player in the commercial aircraft business, acknowledging what many in the industry had already known. Still, it was a remarkable concession because the airline business increasingly demands aircraft manufacturers with a global network of sales and service offices that can meet all the needs of airlines, particularly those in developing countries.
Airlines are also moving to simplify their fleets of aircraft, committing themselves to only one manufacturer. Most airlines today, in part as a result of mergers since the industry was deregulated in 1978, have a variety of jets, which adds to the cost of housing spare parts and training mechanics and pilots.
This fall, USAir said it planned to buy up to 400 Airbus jets. And American Airlines, a longtime customer of McDonnell Douglas, committed to Boeing recently as the sole supplier of its new jets for the next 20 years.
The consolidation of the military industry has also continued as a result of a shrinking Pentagon budget, leaving fewer possible merger partners for McDonnell Douglas.
The merger announcement was foreshadowed to some extent earlier this month when Boeing effectively hired McDonnell Douglas to provide help in developing larger jumbo jets.
The frequent mention of "balance" by company executives in extolling their proposed merger yesterday spoke volumes about the ambitions and strategy of Boeing, which sees enormous potential in transferring technological expertise back and forth between its commercial and military businesses. For example, it used the expertise it developed in composites while working on the B-2 bomber to build the composite tail wing of its new 777 jetliner, which it in turn used to help develop the advanced wing design of its Joint Strike Fighter proposal.
With McDonnell Douglas's expertise from years of building fighters like the F-18 and F-15 Eagle, Boeing inevitably becomes a stronger contender in competitions to build fighters. It has not built one since the 1930's.
"The merger strengthens our competitive position for the Joint Strike Fighter, it improves our position in space transportation, and it enhances our ability to provide the best products and services to our airline customers," Mr. Condit said.
The full effect of the proposed merger on employees, communities, competitors, customers and investors will not be known for months, maybe even years. Because the companies are merging at a time when they are relatively strong, executives of both companies said there probably would not be many layoffs although some workers would be relocated. With Boeing straining to meet demand for its jets, it has advertised in the New York area for workers to move to Seattle, where Boeing is based.
But news of the merger is also bittersweet for communities like St. Louis and Long Beach, Calif., that are home to the main operations of McDonnell Douglas. While the merger provides an added measure of long-term job security for workers, at least some of the deep roots of the company in those cities will be cut under the ownership of Boeing.
For the primary customers of the two companies -- the Pentagon and the airlines -- the effect is also unclear. Industry analysts said that airlines would likely wind up paying a bit more for new planes as a result, since they are more likely to get a lower bid from three main competitors than two. But as McDonnell Douglas has won a shrinking percentage of new orders, its absence may have already been felt in recent purchase negotiations.
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American Airlines, said the airline applauded the proposed merger because it will need ongoing support and service for the hundreds of McDonnell Douglas jets it plans to fly well into the next century. "Keeping Douglas's network viable and strengthening Boeing are wins for us," he said.
Although regulators declined to comment yesterday on the proposed merger, the Clinton Administration has long signaled its belief that the number of military companies needs to shrink to reflect declining procurement budgets and minimize the devastating impact on weapons manufacturers and their surrounding communities. Antitrust regulators, for example, approved a deal culminated last week in which Boeing acquired the military and aerospace units of the Rockwell International Corporation for $3.2 billion.
In evaluating the antitrust implications for the commercial business, regulators are expected to take note of how McDonnell Douglas has publicly scaled back its ambitions in the field.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas executives said they hope to complete their merger by mid-1997.

HEADLINE: THE AEROSPACE MERGER: THE NATIONAL POLICY;
A Swift Transformation

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15

 BODY:
With the Boeing Company's startling announcement today of a $13 billion merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, it signified the near-completion of one of the swiftest and most complete transformations ever of an industry -- as a matter of an explicit Government policy.
The lesson is that the Clinton Administration has largely succeeded in transforming the country's military contractors, during a span of just four years, into instruments of one of its most important goals: making the economy more competitive globally. 
 In this era of downsizing, in both the public and private sectors, the emphasis has been placed on efficiency, cost-cutting and exports -- in other words, commercial success in a Darwinian marketplace, rather than having the best weapons no matter the costs. The enemy is now perceived not as Communism but bloated office staffs and foreign weapons companies.
The announcement, one in a series of multibillion-dollar military mergers over four years, could never have taken place without a sharp change in policy initiated shortly after President Clinton took office.
Previously, the Government had prohibited most large combinations of weapons makers because it wanted to force them to compete with one another, even though that made production far more costly by duplicating research and development efforts and overhead.
But with military budgets declining sharply after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration decided to relax the antitrust guidelines and even encourage the huge mergers as a way of reducing weapons costs and, perhaps just as important, making American military and aerospace contractors focus on competing with other countries.
The country now has one major commercial aircraft producer, Boeing, which makes it a formidable competitor to Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium. The country also has, essentially, 3 major weapons contractors, rather than the 10 or so of a decade ago. Indeed, some major weapons, like tanks, nuclear submarines and armored vehicles, are essentially produced now by single companies, without any competition.
That is supposed to reduce costs for the Pentagon, and in many instances it clearly has. It also means the remaining companies are exporting a growing share of their fighter jets, guns, missiles and bombs. Also, the focus now is not just on the cost of building a weapon, but the costs of maintaining and operating it.
Not least, the small number of huge companies that remain are enjoying record levels of profits, a tribute to the efficiencies they have enjoyed after laying off tens of thousands of workers and eliminating redundant research efforts.
"You have one national aircraft company now," said Felix Rohatyn, an investment banker involved in some of the big mergers and a proponent of this kind of industrial policy. "It says that our policy is based on a definition of markets on a global basis. I believe that's very realistic. Ultimately, the marketplace would have demanded it, but the Clinton Administration really saw the need and responded."
Added Norman Augustine, who on Jan. 1 will become chairman of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, "You can have seven or eight half-full defense factories or two or three full ones. I think we're better off with the full ones."
Many analysts predicted that today's deal presaged a few more huge transactions, probably involving the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Electronics, the Northrop Grumman Corporation and perhaps the Raytheon Company. "The Administration realized it couldn't afford any more the artificially fragmented industry the Department of Defense had enforced for years," said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at BT Securities. "We don't have the money for that anymore."
Of course, there are also concerns that fewer companies will mean less innovation and that subcontractors and suppliers will be easily squeezed by the giant contractors.
The job loss has been very painful, too: The military industry work force has declined from about 3.9 million people in 1987 to about 2.6 million now, and the figure is likely to fall further.
But, as some experts point out, more innovation is taking place in the private sector now anyway, particularly in the fastest growing area of military procurement, electronics. About 45 percent of the Pentagon's procurement and research budgets are now devoted to electronics.
In addition, the creation of the huge contractors has eased a particularly tough burden that the Pentagon once had to bear, integrating all the devilishly complex components that go into modern weapons, and integrating different weapons systems so they work properly together.
This job involves heavy reliance on computers, electronics and advanced engineering. Systems integration, as these skills are known, can now be performed by the giant contractors, which may eventually allow the Pentagon to reduce further.
"The Pentagon specifically set out to do that when it changed its policies," said Mr. Augustine. "It concluded that the private sector does that a lot better. The Government has lost much of its ability to do systems integration now."
Said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs: "This allows the Pentagon to do a lot less micromanaging. The Pentagon can describe what it wants in less complex terms and let Boeing or Lockheed work it all out. The companies can now do everything except fight the wars. That lets the Pentagon focus on what presumably it does best."
That, for instance, was essentially the way the Pentagon approached the bidding for what is likely to be the most expensive weapons contract ever, the Joint Strike Fighter for the Navy, Marines and Air Force.
The Pentagon eventually chose to allow Boeing and Lockheed to produce prototypes of their designs, and then will let the companies demonstrate the technological and military capabilities of each.

HEADLINE: Tourists Flock to New York To Catch Its Holiday Glitter

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
The lights were twinkling, the carolers were warbling and war was erupting outside the glass-walled studio of the "Today" program in Rockefeller Center. Elbows jabbing and bodies slamming, hundreds of tourists pushed and shoved as they battled for a glimpse of Katie Couric. "All I got to see was the back of her coat," Sharon Bryars of Mobile, Ala., lamented.
Richard Altman, who flew in from Georgia hoping to see the stars of the Broadway musical "Chicago," only got to see the box office clerk, who told him the show was sold out for the entire month of December. 
 And Earl Edmundson, who trudged through the weekend's gloom and drizzle, found staggeringly long lines everywhere: at the Empire State Building, at Radio City Music Hall, even at the Harley-Davidson Cafe on 56th Street, where he tried to buy a burger for his son, 13.
"What is this?" grumbled Mr. Edmundson, a 40-year-old flight attendant from Jacksonville, Fla. "Is this New York or Disney World?"
Maybe it's both. Besides the jingling bells and crammed sidewalks, sold-out shows and Christmas sales, warm spirits and bad tempers, there are tourists. Millions of tourists.
Despite the lines to ogle diamonds at Tiffany's, the battles for blue jeans in Macy's, the rains that soak socks, and the drizzle that fogs eyeglasses, visitors are flocking to New York City's shops and sidewalks, looking for holiday magic. More than one million tourists are expected this month in what economists and city officials predict may be one of the busiest Decembers since 1979. And as a result, visitors and natives may find more misery than usual amid the merrymaking this year. Hotel rooms in Manhattan, which were virtually sold out this weekend, will also be scarce in coming days, particularly around New Year's Eve. Some of Broadway's biggest shows, including "Chicago" and "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," are booked solid for the month.
And city officials warn that midtown Manhattan's already treacherous traffic will only get worse this week as about 80,000 additional drivers a day are expected to pour into the city to shop and sightsee on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
The city is so busy that the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau has not even bothered to promote travel to New York City this month, focusing instead on the winter doldrums that usually follow in January. "The biggest question now is not whether the tourists will come in December, but where will we put them?" said Jason Bram, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
At the Plaza Hotel, which was completely booked this weekend, some tourists have already reserved rooms for next year's holidays. Others have given up on Manhattan, finding hotel rooms in New Jersey and the other boroughs. And Gil Slocum of Albany decided to forgo the hotel-hunting experience altogether. A white stretch limousine carried him and his wife in leather-seated luxury to Fifth Avenue for the day.
"Sure, we could complain about the crowds and the traffic," Mr. Slocum said as he watched the tourists gawking at a window display at Saks Fifth Avenue. "But we're going to Balducci's to load up on olives, bread, salads and custom coffees," he said. "Imagine the smells in the car on the way back home!"
The aromas aren't the half of it. All across the city, naked trees are blossoming with golden lights. Green wreaths with red bows cling to doorways. Shoppers shop in a frenzied hustle-bustle that astonishes outsiders accustomed to slower rhythms. And amid it all, there is the unforgettable cacophony of New York City sounds: the wailing fire engines and tinkling Salvation Army bells, the tinny carols and the clink-clink-clink of change falling into a beggar's cup.
"Ain't got nothing," sang a tuneless homeless man, who had positioned his wheelchair smack in the stream of tourist traffic on Fifth Avenue. And soon, his white mug was filling with quarters and dimes.
Heather Bernard, an engineer from Haverhill, Mass., delighted in the lights and the shows. Jo Rutledge, an accountant from Birmingham, Ala., loved the breathtaking rides in New York's taxis and the international chatter on the streets.
Mr. Edmundson's wife, Debra,marveled at the politeness of strangers who directed her to a bathroom in Grand Central Terminal.
"And the men!" Ms. Bryars sighed, citing her own New York favorite. "They look so good in those long wool coats!"
Some may call it cliche New York -- the trees, the shows, the lights -- but the traditional sights and sounds have been drawing more and more visitors and filling more and more hotel rooms.
In December 1991, tourists occupied 65.7 percent of the city's estimated 60,000 hotel rooms, according to statistics compiled by the Convention and Visitors Bureau. By last year, the December hotel occupancy rate had jumped to 80 percent. And economists, who say they believe the rate will increase slightly this year, say it would be even higher but for the slump around Christmas Day, when potential visitors choose to stay home with their families.
Economists attribute the surge in tourism to the lower value of the dollar, which has made New York relatively cheap for foreigners, and to publicity surrounding the recent drop in crime, which has convinced many visitors that the city is not as dangerous as they had imagined.
"Even those sitcoms on television, like 'Friends' and 'Seinfeld,' are helping to make New York an acceptable destination again," said John Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting, a hotel industry research firm.
"I think we'll have a new record this year," he said. "The city is going crazy, good crazy." But some New Yorkers say the city is going crazy, bad crazy. Gloria Richardson, a 21-year-old college student from the Bronx, who was struggling through midtown's crush of tourists and shoppers, said she was so weary of the Christmas frenzy that she has found it impossible to garner the energy to shop. "I go home at night," she said, "and I can't bear to think about it anymore."
And Hraklis Amnaatese, a 31-year-old pretzel salesman, worries that tourists have lost sight of the real New York bargains in their search for glitter and glamour. "What about pretzels?" he asked as he stood outside Rockefeller Center trying to interest the crowds in his shopping cart of steaming, twisted delicacies.
"New Yorkers buy pretzels," he said sadly, "but tourists don't know anything about them."
Many natives, however, still cherish the holiday thrill. Charles Smoot, a 27-year-old security guard at Radio City Music Hall, said he loves the Christmas season even though it means he must endure the relentless questions from the thousands of tourists who buy tickets for the Christmas show. ("Can I walk to the Statue of Liberty from here?" some ask.)
"You get a headache sometimes answering all the questions," Mr. Smoot said as he hustled some ticket scalpers away from the crowd. "But it still gets me in the spirit. I love New York. And especially at this time of year."

Democrats at Odds in Assembly
Despite the gains Democrats made in this year's elections, liberals in the State Assembly are finding themselves pushed to the margins as the Legislature prepares to confront a host of issues they consider dear. Though Republicans are leading the charge, there are growing signs that conservative and even moderate Democrats plan to assert themselves more vigorously against the Assembly's still sizable liberal wing in a struggle for control over the party's direction. [Page A1.]
In what appears to be an effort to placate abortion opponents, the Democratic Assembly is poised to raise the politically volatile issue of late-term abortions. After limited debate, the Assembly will probably vote no. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]

An Abuse Suspect's Life
When not working well after midnight on his doctoral studies at Columbia University, Oliver Jovanovic was refining a mythical domain he had helped to create. But plans for marketing his make-believe world have been set aside as Mr. Jovanovic grapples with criminal charges most real: accusations that his first date with a Barnard College student turned into a 20-hour session of torment during which he bound, gagged and sexually abused her. [B1.]
Support for OTB President
The Giuliani administration vigorously defended the president of the Offtrack Betting Corporation after an article in The Daily News suggested that City Hall had effectively stripped him of his powers. [B3.]
Pataki Proposals on Smoking
Answering criticism that his administration has done nothing to advance anti-smoking initiatives, Governor Pataki announced a $12.7 million package of television commercials, special programs and proposed legislation to try to reduce smoking by children and pregnant women in particular. [B5.]
A tentative agreement between 450 Roman Catholic high school teachers and the Archdiocese of New York has been abandoned. [B6.]

Rift at Safety Board Over Crash
A senior official of the National Transportation Safety Board, working in the hangar where the T.W.A.

After dredging the ocean floor for weeks, officials investigating the Flight 800 crash suspended the operation and said they had found no evidence of a missile. [B4.]
Memorials That Help Others
Like the heartache of loss, need in New York City never goes away. Perhaps that is why so many people send gifts to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in remembrance of lives gone by. For many, it is a mourner's ritual. The Neediest Cases. [B2.]

 Expanding Reach of Title IX
At Shore Regional High School in West Long Branch, the girls' field hockey team played its first night game under the lights on the football field.

HEADLINE: Rich Areas in Miami Talk Secession

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Struck with the kind of fiscal emergency that other cities have survived and most financial experts agree is manageable, Miami instead finds itself in the throes of an identity as well as a budget crisis.
As Florida and Miami officials brainstorm to save the city, disaffected residents from several corners can be heard calling for Miami to abolish itself and merge with the government of Dade County, the metropolitan area that more accurately represents what the world knows as Miami. They say they have gathered 20,000 signatures, enough to call a referendum on the question next year, although their petition still needs to be certified by election officials. 
 The anti-cityhood drive has been fueled by anger over a corruption scandal that recently snared three top Miami officials and a $68 million deficit uncovered shortly afterward. But its roots lie in a trend that has been in evidence for most of the decade. Since 1991, unincorporated, mostly affluent areas of Dade County have lined up to form into cities, three of them successfully, and assume control of their tax dollars. If Miami's government structure were abolished, wealthier sections of the city that have been itching to break away, like Coconut Grove, would suddenly be free to do the same.
Such fragmentation is seen across the urban landscape nationwide as growing areas have formed small communities, not unlike gated neighborhoods that wall themselves off seeking a safe haven, urban geography experts say. But if the higher-income areas splinter off, Dade County will have to share its resources and services with the remains of an already poor city. Miami, with a population of about 350,000, is the fourth poorest city in the country, according to U.S. Census figures.
About 1.1 million of Dade County's 2 million residents still live in unincorporated areas, with the rest scattered among 29 municipalities.
But at least five cityhood votes are pending or being proposed for approval by Dade County Commissioners by communities that sometimes pay more in taxes than they get back in services or want to control police protection, zoning and other key matters. "One of the big negatives here is that should Miami become part of Dade County, you'll see a tremendous intensification of the movement to try to secede from Dade," said Peter Muller, an urban geographer at the University of Miami in Coral Gables. "It's hard for me to see Miami would be much better off."
Max Castro, a sociologist with the University of Miami's North-South Center, said, "The proposal to abolish Miami is part of a larger trend toward class and ethnic vulcanization of urban space and economic polarization of American society." But while critics of abolition say it would leave poorer areas in worse shape than before, proponents of doing away with Miami, led by downtown property owners and homeowners associations and residents from Coconut Grove and other higher-income neighborhoods, say every Miami resident would benefit from a tax rate in Dade County that is half what they pay Miami now.
Gene Stearns, the lawyer who successfully led the incorporation drive of Key Biscayne and who said his firm is donating "thousands" of hours to the abolition effort, said there was no question that some sections of Miami would seek to incorporate if the city dissolved itself. But he said a way to help out those sections that cannot sustain themselves through taxes would be to require cities to contribute some revenue to a countywide fund.
"Whatever the source of funding, this county will have to come up with a revenue source to provide money to these areas," he said.
If the city disappears as a legal entity, what would happen to the name Miami? Mr. Stearns said Miami would continue to be the brand name for the metropolitan area that includes cities such as Miami Beach and Coral Gables. "The city of Miami gives Miami a bad name," Mr. Stearns said.
But others are not so sure. Opposition to dissolving the city is widespread. "Dade County can run into problems, any place can run into these problems if they're not careful what they do," said David Beckford, 45, a comptroller for a downtown business. He said he opposed abolition because "It's swapping one government for another."
Dade County's Mayor, Alex Penelas, said that a revenue-sharing program would be essential if the incorporation fever continues, but he said he was philosophically opposed to dissolving Miami because the county government should be a provider of regional services such as transportation, indigent health care and environmental regulation and not become a local service provider.
Mr. Penelas shares the view of many residents who say abolition is too drastic and uncertain a step. "It's somewhat extreme," he said of the abolition drive. "I think and hope that the city can survive."
So does Gov. Lawton Chiles, who last week appointed a state oversight board to help steer Miami, the state's second-largest city after Jacksonville, toward solvency. State officials say Miami's fiscal emergency has the potential to affect the bond ratings and interest rates paid by both the state and its other cities because the financial markets are paying close attention to how Florida deals with the crisis. Lieut. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who heads the oversight board, said Friday through a spokesman that the decision to abolish the city is up to the people of Miami but should be made independently of the financial problems.
Some who oppose splitting Dade County into little fiefs say Miami nevertheless is long overdue to vote itself out of the map. The city has intractable problems that have made it "drag along like a wounded snake for years," said Dan Paul, the Miami lawyer who drafted the county charter in 1957.
Although Miami officials attribute the financial crisis to previous mismanagement, Mr. Paul and others said that the city also has suffered from a tax base that is insufficient to meet its required services and debt obligations, giving it a structural deficit despite charging the highest property taxes in the county. Mr. Paul said Dade County's metropolitan government structure, which duplicates many of the city's functions, was created largely envisioning that Miami, hobbled by financial crises and corruption even then, would someday merge with it. "We're now running two metropolitan cities within blocks of each other," he said.
But Miami is a vastly changed city from what it was in the 1950's, when waves of Cuban exiles fled Fidel Castro's government. Census figures showed that by 1990 more than 62 percent of the city's then 358,548 residents were of Hispanic origin, most of them Cubans. Many find abolition unthinkable.
"If this city disappeared it would be party time for Fidel and the people over in Cuba," said Heliodoro Coro, owner of two Little Havana restaurants. "The whole world knows that Cubans have worked hard to make this city what it is, to build businesses here, to make a life for ourselves. For those of us who came here, Miami is very important."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 17, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a telephone dictation error, an article yesterday about Miami's financial turmoil rendered a word incorrectly in a quotation from Max Castro, a sociologist, about calls for the city to merge with the government of Dade County. Mr. Castro said, "The proposal to abolish Miami is part of a larger trend toward class and ethnic Balkanization of urban space and economic polarization of American society." (He did not say "vulcanization.")

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Selloff in Stocks and Bonds Helps Push the Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A rally by the dollar against the Japanese yen faded yesterday, hurt by strength in the German mark and a late selloff in the American stock and bond markets.
Traders attributed the mark's rise partly to a technical rebound from Friday, when the German currency fell against the dollar after European Union finance ministers reached a stability pact for the planned Euro currency. 
 The mark's partial recovery, combined with a decline on Wall Street late in the day, diminished the appetite for dollars. The Dow Jones average reversed a 50-point gain to end with a loss of 36.52 points.
"The market got a bit overbought on dollars, and I think we're just finding a more stable level," said John Hazelton, chief currency trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York. "I wouldn't want to put more into it than that."
In late New York trading, the dollar traded at 1.5455 marks, down from 1.5558 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 113.90 yen from 113.95 yen. The pound rose to $1.6669 from $1.6554.
The dollar initially strengthened to more than 114 yen following an agreement reached on Sunday by United States and Japanese negotiators that will open Japan's vast insurance market to foreign companies.
The deal was seen as a significant concession by Japan that could help improve trade relations between the world's two largest economies.
"Anytime there's a trade agreement there's always a sigh of relief it didn't turn into something unfriendly," said Ben Strauss, a currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. "There's always a bit of dollar buying on that."
The yen also weakened on the continued outflow of investment money from Japan, reflecting the search for higher-yielding opportunities elsewhere. Japan's record-low interest rates are not expected to rise anytime soon because the economic recovery there remains fragile.
"Japanese entities still have an appetite for foreign assets," said Dennis Pettit at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.'s New York branch.
But the dollar later faded as stocks and bonds retreated.

HEADLINE: An Aerospace Colossus

 BODY:
The proposed $13 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing would create an aerospace behemoth that, for all its size, would do little to stifle competition in the commercial and military aircraft industries. Instead the newly merged giant would simply become a more effective global competitor.
The reality is that McDonnell Douglas no longer wins contracts from many commercial airlines and thus was not effectively competing with Boeing in that realm anyway. Nor do the two manufacturers compete head-to-head for many military contracts. The merger, therefore, would not seriously dilute competition except in a few selected markets, like rocket launchers, for which there are ample remedies. 
 Yet the merger would make Boeing a more formidable competitor against Airbus Industrie, the European manufacturer, for commercial aircraft contracts and against Lockheed Martin for military contracts. On balance, the merger seems likely to do more good than harm.
McDonnell Douglas became an easier takeover target when its price dipped following two stunning blows last month. The company lost a potentially gigantic military contract for an advanced fighter plane, and lost a major civilian contract with American Airlines. McDonnell had previously decided that it would specialize in smaller airliners and forgo building larger planes. That decision did not fit the strategy of major commercial carriers to cut maintenance costs by relying on one manufacturer to supply planes of all sizes rather than fragmenting contracts among different manufacturers. Boeing, by contrast, has a huge backlog of unfilled orders for aircraft of all sizes.
Through merger, Boeing will not only tap McDonnell Douglas's unused production lines, it will also acquire skilled engineers and other experts who can make Boeing a magnet for future military orders. The combined company will employ about 200,000 workers and generate almost $50 billion in revenue each year -- more than many countries. Because of Boeing's backlog of orders for civilian aircraft and McDonnell Douglas's future jet and other military orders, the merger is not expected to produce sizable layoffs or plant closings.
The Boeing-McDonnell merger is the latest in a series of defense industry consolidations. Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta. Boeing took over Rockwell's defense businesses. Northrop merged with Grumman. Defense planners in the Clinton Administration welcome the trends. As defense procurement has shriveled in the aftermath of the cold war, contractors have been saddled with hugely expensive yet idle production lines. Ultimately the Defense Department covers these costs when it entertains bids for new weapons systems. The only way to reduce the costs is to wring out the excess capacity through consolidation.
The question is how far to go. At some point the savings from further consolidation will be outweighed by the stifled innovation and price hikes that accompany monopolization. The implicit answer that defense planners seem to have settled upon is that two major competitors in any line of military work are enough to keep costs low.
If the planners are right, then Boeing's purchase of McDonnell Douglas is good for the military. But the Defense Department must wonder whether the recent bidding for the advanced fighter jet would have been less vigorous and less innovative had McDonnell Douglas not been around to push the other two bidders, Boeing and Lockheed. Commercial airlines would surely prefer to keep McDonnell, perhaps aligned with an Asian partner, bidding to sell them aircraft rather than disappearing inside Boeing. But there is no Asian partner in sight. Boeing is there, and that is probably good enough.

Time Again For Old Idea: 51st State?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
SENATOR JOSEPH L. BRUNO took time the other day from the horses and swimming pool on his estate in Rensselaer County to visit New York City and inform the locals that their way of life would soon change.
It was nice of the State Senate majority leader to drop by, given how far he had to travel. Most of his district lies closer to Canada than Canarsie. Unfortunately, he came bearing not season's greetings but a threat. He and his fellow Republicans, he said, intend to eliminate rent regulations once and for all, a proposal of some importance to the city's many horseless and pool-less residents. 
 Whether rent control has become outdated is certainly a fair topic of debate. But when did the city become so bereft of ideas that it needed help from Rensselaer County? More to the point, some New Yorkers wonder how it is that their fate on almost every significant matter of governance lies with faraway lawmakers, many of whom treat the five boroughs as though they were Sodom and Gomorrah without the charm.
(Funny thing about those who sneer at the city as a crime-ridden horror. Many upstate politicians practically trip over one another in their scramble for state contracts to build prisons, which would largely house inmates from New York City. "Our crime is their economic development," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center.)
A few people here who are fed up with Albany's running their lives are ready to go to the ramparts carrying a banner that has not been raised in a while: statehood for New York City. We have nothing to lose, they say, but our pains. As things now stand, "we have the worst of all possible worlds," lamented Esther Fuchs, a political scientist at Barnard College. "We have the largest fiscal burden and the least control over policy."
WITH the Legislature reconvening today, it may be useful to recall how much upstaters dominate our affairs. When the city and its police union have a labor dispute, Albany intervenes. When the city tries to make all its employees live within its boundaries, the Legislature exempts uniformed workers and teachers. When the city wants to borrow reasonable sums to keep its bridges from falling down, it learns it may be stymied by an obscure provision of the State Constitution. When the city seeks to change how its schools are run, state lawmakers fancying themselves as modern Montessoris pretend that they know how to run a classroom.
How many New York City residents can name their own Assemblyman, let alone a North Country politician who probably thinks that "knish" is pronounced "nish"? That's how distant, socially and psychically, the upstate powers are from New York Harbor.
Who needs it?
The idea of New York City becoming "the 51st state" was popularized by Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin in the 1969 mayoral campaign. But counting on the Legislature to approve secession -- or on Congress to give the five boroughs two United States Senators to call their own -- is not realistic, Mr. Breslin says. He now leans more toward declaring New York an "international city" instead.
Over the years, the 51st-state proposal has enjoyed support from people spanning the political spectrum. For many, a central issue is whether the city, often derided by upstaters as a moocher, in fact keeps the state afloat, sending appreciably more in taxes to Albany than it gets back.
NO question it does, says Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. While not advocating statehood, the Mayor has cited a study by the Center for Governmental Research showing that the city runs a "balance of payments deficit" of $2.1 billion a year. More than once, he has said that the city would be in the black if only it could shake free of expensive state (not to mention Federal) mandates.
Apparently using a different set of calculations, the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, concludes that going independent would actually be a fiscal loser for the city. That's also the sense of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who prefers not statehood but legislation to expand "home rule" in the city.
O.K., the call for a 51st state may well be a weak one. But why not be prepared, just in case? The original New Amsterdam is a worthy name. The Norway maple, a hardy survivor on city streets, would make a fine state tree. For a state motto, we could try: "Yo! Check it out!"
As for the state bird, how about the pigeon? That, many would say, is what Albany takes us for anyway.

HEADLINE: Municipal Bond Dealers Face Scrutiny

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
In recent years, Wall Street's municipal bond operations have been rocked by one scandal after another: evidence of political payoffs; fallout from the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.; the conviction of one of the industry's leading advisers for concealing his role in steering business to one firm in return for a fee.
But in terms of money, these pale by comparison with allegations contained in a legal filing to be made today that if proved could end up requiring Wall Street firms that market municipal securities to pay back as much as $1 billion in illicit profits earned at the expense of the Treasury and municipal borrowers. 
 These new accusations, backed by extensive research into the pricing practices of securities firms, contend that Wall Street has frequently charged artificially high and potentially illegal prices for securities that were sold to local governments in complex bond deals. The extra markups in special municipal escrow accounts, according to experts in municipal finance, accounted for half or more of the firms' profits in the municipal bond market in the early 1990's.
The Public Securities Association, in an October letter to the Internal Revenue Service that reflected the views of many leaders of the securities industry, defended Wall Street's pricing practices for selling securities to these municipal escrow accounts. The price markups, it said, were not improper or illegal because they correctly reflected risks that firms took on when they pledged to provide securities to such accounts.
Under the longstanding practice, known in the industry as "yield burning," issuers buy a mixture of ordinary Treasury securities and special zero-interest or very-low-interest Treasury paper issued specifically for escrow accounts. But the securities firms were said to have frequently sold Treasuries to the accounts at artificially high prices, creating profit that would otherwise have gone to the Treasury.
The allegations are contained in detailed comments prepared for the Internal Revenue Service by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, one of the nation's leading public borrowers. The I.R.S. has been seeking to recover the lost tax revenue from municipal borrowers, the only group over which it has jurisdiction in the matter.
But the transportation authority, arguing that the real beneficiaries of the practice were the securities firms that arranged the deals rather than the municipalities themselves, is appealing to the Government to turn its attention to Wall Street instead. It is invoking the Justice Department's powers under the False Claims Act and the enforcement powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission to "recover damages directly from the wrongdoers."
"The False Claims Act provides the Department of Justice with an appropriate and powerful enforcement tool with which to pursue investment providers who have routinely overcharged municipal escrows and thus cheated the government out of as much as $1.15 billion in interest payments," the transportation authority will contend.
In the last couple of years, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department have shown increased interest in this aspect of the municipal bond market, prompted in part by accusations first raised last year by Michael R. Lissack, a former municipal bond executive at Smith Barney.
In a typical case, municipalities hold money in these special escrow accounts that they have raised from issuing securities but have not yet put to work on municipal projects. As interest rates declined in recent years, the funds in the escrow accounts soared as municipalities refunded existing securities to take advantage of lower borrowing costs. To prevent municipalities from simply borrowing at low tax-exempt rates and then earning a profit by lending the money in the open market, they were required to keep any excess funds in the special escrow accounts.
The county transportation authority's filing with the Internal Revenue Service was prepared by its lawyers, Phillips & Cohen of Washington, which hired the Michel/Shaked Group, a Boston economics consultancy, to examine Wall Street pricing practices. Steven P. Feinstein, an economist at Babson College, conducted the group's research, examining more than 100 cases to try to determine whether prices charged for the escrow accounts were fair.
It found, according to the submission to the Internal Revenue, that on average, escrows that were not submitted for competitive bids "were burdened with unjustified markups of about $4 for each $1,000 of a bond's par value."
Using that $4 markup, the researchers concluded that if 80 percent of advance refunding issues were affected, the combined liability would total nearly $1 billion, before taking account of interest owed to the Government.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Plunge As Factory Output Climbs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury prices dropped sharply yesterday after a stronger-than-expected manufacturing report, weak dollar and supply concerns discouraged many buyers.
The 30-year bond slid 22/32 in thin trading conditions to a price of 9813/32 to yield 6.62 percent, up from 6.57 percent on Friday. 
 Growth in industrial production during November worried investors, for if the economy is strengthening, they fear it could lead to quickening inflation and climbing interest rates in the future.
Yesterday the Government reported a nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in industrial production, or output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities. The increase was nearly double the consensus forecast of five-tenths of 1 percent, as auto production fully recovered from its sharp drop in October. But some economists contend that the output data overstated the strength, because of a weather-related 2.5 percent rise in utility output that added about two-tenths of a percentage point to the overall industrial production gain.
Other factors weighing on the market included oil prices, which jumped $1.30 a barrel, to $25.73 a barrel, on expectations of a cold front for much of the nation this week, and the wavering dollar, which depressed dollar-denominated investments like Government securities.
Not surprisingly, investors were cautious ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the 7 Fed board members and 5 of the 12 regional bank presidents. The meeting is the last of the year, and very few market participants expect the Federal Reserve to change monetary policy.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said neither he nor any of the other chief economists employed by the 37 major United States government securities dealers expected the Fed to change the current 5.25 percent Federal funds rate at the meeting. Sixty-two percent, or 23 of the 37, still expect some Fed tightening next year, but Mr. Harris does not.
"As it becomes more apparent that the Fed will not be tightening next year, we continue to believe that there should be a decline in the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yield into a mostly 6 percent to 6.5 percent trading range, or around a 6.3 percent calendar average for 1997," he said.
One reason the Fed will not need to tighten, Mr. Harris said, "is that banks already have been doing some tightening of consumer credit conditions, which is already moderating growth in consumer borrowing and spending."
Prices were also pressured by year-end portfolio adjustments by managers who are starting to close their books. The prospect of added supply this week gave investors the excuse they needed to move to the sidelines. The Treasury is preparing to sell $30.75 billion in two- and five-year notes tomorrow and Thursday; in when-issued trading ahead of these auctions, dealers were offering the two-year note at a price to yield 5.77 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.09 percent.
At yesterday's regular weekly sale of new three- and six-month bills, rates were mixed, with the average rate for a three-month bill down seven basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent), to 4.76 percent, with the rate for the six-month bill up two basis points, to 4.99 percent. Analysts conceded that the auction results were a bit sloppier than anticipated.
The following are the results of yesterday's regular Treasury auction of those new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.797	97.477	Discounted Rate	4.76%	4.99%	Coupon Yield	4.88%	5.19%	High Price	98.802	97.487	Discounted Rate	4.74%	4.97%	Coupon Yield	4.86%	5.17%	Low Price	98.794	97.477	Discounted Rate	4.77%	4.99%	Coupon Yield	4.90%	5.19%	Accepted at low price	25%	41%	Total applied for	$47,614,159	$42,363,695	Accepted	$13,006,259	$13,019,545	Noncompetitive	$1,434,852	$1,130,628	
 
Both issues are dated Dec. 19, 1996. The three-month bills mature on March 20, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on June 19, 1997.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Surges; Rise is Biggest in 9 Months

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
America's industrial production surged in November, showing the largest gain in nine months as strikes against the General Motors Corporation ended and causing a positive ripple effect through the economy, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Production at factories, mines and utilities increased by a larger-than-expected nine-tenths of a percent last month after falling by a revised two-tenths of a percent in October. Analysts had expected a rise of five-tenths of a percent in November. 
 Industries other than autos reported strength as well. Unusually cold weather led to a rise in utility output. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, production rose six-tenths of a percent in November, and many businesses continued to see orders stack up. "We in the steel industry can't complain," said F. Kenneth Iverson, chairman of the Nucor Corporation, in Charlotte, N. C. Demand for steel is especially strong in the tube, pipe and construction industries, Mr. Iverson said in an interview.
The Fed report suggests that economic growth could exceed 2 percent in the final quarter of the year, said Raymond Worseck, the chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc., a St. Louis investment firm. Many economists had expected growth to slow to less than that rate.
Before the revision, industrial output for October was reported to have fallen by five-tenths of a percent, depressed by local walkouts at G. M. plants in the United States and a wider strike in Canada. That crippled the manufacturer's supply chain and idled many North American assembly lines.
Though the Fed said that the end of the G. M. strikes accounted for about half the November gain, "no matter which way you look at the puzzle, it has strength," said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. "You strip away the G. M. strike and you still have solid gains in manufacturing."
In the report on production, the Fed said the plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, increased to 83.3 percent in November from a revised 82.9 percent during October. Previously, the October plant-use rate was reported as 82.7 percent.
Before today's report, analysts expected a November plant-use rate of 83 percent, a survey by Bloomberg Business News showed.
"Inventories have been brought in line with sales," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at the Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla.
The report also showed that manufacturing capacity was growing at a 4.4 percent annual rate. That is a 27-year high, according to Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.

The Bristol Hotel Company said yesterday that it would acquire 61 Holiday Inns from Bass P.L.C. of Britain for $659 million, in stock, cash and debt. The transaction, expected to close next spring, will make Bristol, which is based in Dallas, the world's biggest Holiday Inn franchisee, with 84 properties, and one of the biggest owner-operators of full-service hotels.
Bass, which operates or franchises more than 2,200 hotels that are part of the Holiday Inn system, will receive 9.37 million shares of Bristol stock, $91 million in cash and $300 million in loan repayments. Those Bristol shares will give Bass a 36.1 percent stake in the company, the same stake currently held by the Hampstead Group, Bristol's largest shareholder. Bass will also have two members on Bristol's nine-member board. 
 Bristol said it had commitments for $505 million in financing for the acquisition from a group of banks, led by the Bankers Trust Company.
Bristol stock rose $1.50 yesterday to close at $30.125.
The purchase will bring Bristol's portfolio to 100 hotels from its current 39. That includes 48 of the approximately 300 Holiday Inn hotels that have 250 rooms or more.
"The hotel industry has basically abandoned the full-service hotel," J. Peter Kline, Bristol's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. "They've either gone upscale or become economy properties, leaving the mid-market customer without much of a choice."
Having earmarked $150 million for renovation, or about $11,000 a room, Bristol expects to compete heavily in the corporate meetings market.
Formerly the Harvey Hotel Company, Bristol started in 1981 by building a hotel in Dallas. Its first 10 hotels were all in Texas; then two years ago it bought United Inns, which is based in Memphis and has Holiday Inn franchises in Georgia and Mississippi, as well as Texas. Most of Bristol's current properties are in Sun Belt states from California to Florida.
Bristol said the properties being acquired from Bass have an occupancy rate 7.3 percentage points above the industry average and a room rate $3.11 higher.
"It's a great acquisition," said Michael J. Rietbrock, a hotel analyst with Smith Barney. "The economics of the deal are favorable, and it also establishes Bristol as a major player in an industry that is expected to undergo a lot of consolidation over the next couple of years." He added that the sale would increase 1997 earnings.
Mr. Kline said that since Bristol was no longer a regional company but still had the same senior management it started with, he was confident it would "be around a long time." The deal, which was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, should create "a pipeline for us," he said, enabling Bristol to attract new offers and be more aggressive in acquisitions.

HEADLINE: THE AEROSPACE MERGER: THE WASHINGTON POWER;
A Giant in Jets and Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Long before it announced plans to acquire the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the Boeing Company was already one of the most influential corporate voices in American foreign policy. It is the country's largest exporter, occasionally a back-channel conduit to China's leaders and the impetus for the tension between Europe and the United States over the huge subsidies and political favors that have bolstered the fortunes of Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's archrival.
Now Boeing is on the brink of becoming an even bigger player on the global stage -- an American national champion whose business interests around the world will influence a broad range of policies. Officials in Washington today, even while saying they welcomed the merger, acknowledged that the deal would only intensify the difficulties for American foreign policy that Boeing's operations often raise. 
 First among the problems is whether the United States should accede to ever-increasing demands from China for advanced technology. Coming from the fastest-growing market for new aircraft, those demands are forcing Washington to choose between losing a deal and aiding Beijing's efforts to build both commercial aircraft and, in the view of some, long-range bombers.
"The question we will now have to ask is whether what's good for Boeing is good for America's interests around the world," a senior State Department official said today, amending the famous remark about General Motors that was made during another era in American economic history. "And usually, there's no easy answer."
In statistical terms alone, Boeing's influence would not seem to be greatly affected by its huge acquisition: McDonnell Douglas's sales of commercial aircraft have flagged in recent years, and by the time the company decided a merger was the only way out it commanded just 5 percent of commercial aircraft sales around the world.
But because Boeing now stands alone, it will be viewed by governments worldwide -- which ultimately make most of the choices about what aircraft to buy -- as a commercial extension of the Government.
"When Boeing comes to Washington to describe what it needs abroad, it will now be on much more powerful ground," said Jeffrey Garten, who departed a year ago as Under Secretary of Commerce responsible for pressing American industrial interests abroad to become dean of the School of Management at Yale. "It will now be supporting jobs in every state -- from California to Missouri. And so you have to think that its desires for the direction of American foreign policy will become more influential than ever."
Already, Boeing has a corporate foreign policy that ranks among the most subtle and sophisticated. But even as it continues to speak softly, it will carry a bigger stick.
From Capitol Hill to the State Department, Boeing has long been a voice urging quiet conciliation with China, which a few years ago purchased one of every seven airplanes Boeing built. (The figure has dropped in recent years, first because of a strike at Boeing, then because airlines elsewhere started expanding even as China -- sending a clear message about its unhappiness with Washington -- directed some large orders to Airbus.)
Earlier this year, in a unusual gesture, Boeing held a meeting of its board in Beijing. It has lobbied the Administration and Congress to end the annual review of China's trading rights, pressing for "permanent most-favored nation" status. The change would enable all sides to avoid the annual debate over whether the Administration's commercial engagement with China is actually improving that nation's performance on human rights.
When America angers China, Philip M. Condit, Boeing chief executive, said earlier this year, "We are the designated hostage."
Today, between visits to the Pentagon, NASA and other Washington agencies to explain the effects of absorbing McDonnell Douglas, Mr. Condit disagreed with those who say that the company's influence in Washington will be significantly magnified once it is the nation's sole maker of commercial aircraft.
"I hope they are right but I suspect that they are not," he said during a brief conversation this afternoon. "We try to make our arguments on a rational basis, and we've been the No. 1 manufacturer for a long time. I don't think that this significantly changes the landscape."
American officials say that in some foreign policy debates here, Boeing has argued against its own short-term business interests. Risking the wrath of China's leaders, for instance, a senior Boeing executive warned the Chinese earlier this year that it would be unwise for them to conduct a large nuclear weapons test. The Chinese detonated the weapon a few days later.
'It is always a careful balancing act," Lawrence W. Clarkson, the company's senior vice president for planning and international development -- and the closest thing it has to a corporate Secretary of State -- said earlier this year.
The most difficult foreign policy test is likely to center on demands from other countries to share in technology. As the price of entry into their emerging markets, savvy countries around the world insist upon commitments from Airbus or Boeing or other manufacturers to move assembly jobs and technology to their countries, often setting up bidding wars in which an offer to manufacture, say, a tail section is played off against another to train workers in assembling fuselages.
Airbus, eager to expand its market share around the world, has long been considered a particularly ripe target for such tactics, and so has McDonnell Douglas as it sought to bolster its dwindling commercial aircraft business.
Boeing has been the most resistant to such demands, but pressure keeps mounting. "The Chinese make linkages to other issues that they would decry if we made the same," Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said.
Whatever the outcome, Boeing's emergence as America's sole aircraft maker will undoubtedly heighten the tensions with Europe.
For years the United States has complained that Airbus, with support from its European sponsors, has been willing to sell at below its costs to insure its survival. The Europeans have responded that the United States subsidizes its industry, too, by having the Pentagon pick up the cost of research and development of technologies that soon find their way into commercial planes.
"I wouldn't be surprised if we redoubled our efforts to make sure Airbus prospers," one senior European official visiting Washington said a few hours after the Boeing-McDonnell deal was announced. "Now the American industry looks more like our own."

HEADLINE: NEEDY WHO LOSE PARENTAL RIGHTS GAIN IN TOP COURT

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that the parent-child relationship is so fundamental that a state cannot prevent poor people from appealing the termination of their parental rights simply because they lack the money to pay court costs.
Although confined to the narrow category of cases involving what the Court called the "awesome authority of the state" to cut off parental rights, the 6-to-3 decision was nonetheless an important statement of the Supreme Court's view of due process and equal protection, the two constitutional guarantees on which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg based her majority opinion. 
 With dissenting votes by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the decision was also a telling indicator of where the Justices are arrayed along the fault lines of current constitutional analysis.
The decision overturned a ruling last year by the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which barred a mother who could not afford more than $2,000 for a trial transcript from appealing a family court decision that freed her two young children for adoption by her former husband's new wife. Mississippi provides a right to appeal in such cases, but requires advance payment of all court costs, including preparation of a transcript of lower court proceedings.
Mississippi was in a minority of states to make such appeals dependent on the ability to pay. Twenty states, including Connecticut and New York, waive costs for indigent appellants in civil cases generally, and 10 others, including New Jersey, make special allowances for cases involving termination of parental rights.
In her opinion today, Justice Ginsburg noted that the Constitution does not require the Government to compensate for most of the disabilities of poverty. But "we place decrees forever terminating parental rights in the category of cases in which the State may not bolt the door to equal justice," she said.
That is a category that, until today, had been confined largely to criminal cases.
There is no general constitutional right to appellate review, in either civil or criminal cases. But in a 1956 case, Griffin v. Illinois, the Court held that if a state does provide an appeal in criminal cases, it cannot condition the right on the ability to pay required fees. In 1971, the Court extended that principle to appeals from convictions for minor offenses that carried only fines rather than prison sentences.
In that same year, in Boddie v. Connecticut, the Court applied the principle of equal justice in a civil case, ruling that the state could not make the right to obtain a divorce conditional on the ability to pay $60 in court costs. But in a separate line of cases, also in the 1970's, the Court refused to apply the principle to cases involving bankruptcy and welfare, reasoning that these did not involve the same fundamental rights as cases involving marriage and the family.
In surveying this complex history, Justice Ginsburg said today that the loss of a parent's relationship with her children was of such "magnitude and permanence" as to make it "barely distinguishable from criminal condemnation," and was therefore covered by the Court's precedents that removed financial barriers to criminal appeals.
Referring to Melissa L. Brooks, the mother in the case, Justice Ginsburg continued: "She is endeavoring to defend against the State's destruction of her family bonds, and to resist the brand associated with a parental unfitness adjudication. Like a defendant resisting criminal conviction, she seeks to be spared from the state's devastatingly adverse action."
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas said not only that the Court should not have relied on the precedents involving criminal appeals but also that the main precedent, Griffin v. Illinois, had been incorrectly decided and should be overruled. Justice Scalia joined the entirety of the dissenting opinion; Chief Justice Rehnquist did not join the section that called for overruling the 1956 precedent.
The three dissenting Justices said the principle established in Justice Ginsburg's opinion was broader than the majority was willing to acknowledge.
"The inevitable consequence," Justice Thomas said, "will be greater demands on the states to provide free assistance to would-be appellants in all manner of civil cases involving interests that cannot, based on the test established by the majority, be distinguished from the admittedly important interest at issue here."
In her opinion, Justice Ginsburg drew a distinction between termination of parental rights and loss of custody in a divorce situation, which she said "does not sever the parent-child bond."
Currently pending before the Court is an appeal in a custody case from the Supreme Court of Illinois, which did not permit a mother who could not pay more than $5,000 for the trial transcript to appeal a decision transferring custody of her 7-year-old child to her former husband. The Justices have not yet said whether they will hear that case, Pope v. Pope, No. 96-447; presumably, if all agree that the ruling today does not extend to custody cases, they will simply deny review without comment.
The most interesting passages in Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion today addressed how the Court, and the Constitution, should deal with the consequences of poverty. The Equal Protection Clause "is not a panacea for perceived social or economic inequity," Justice Thomas said in a section of his opinion that the two other dissenters joined. The Constitution prevents only purposeful discrimination, he added, while "any adverse impact that the transcript requirement has on any person seeking to appeal arises not out of the state's action, but out of factors entirely unrelated to it."
Justice Thomas said the Court had adopted, in Griffin v. Illinois and similar cases, "an equalizing notion of the Equal Protection Clause that would, I think, have startled the 14th Amendment's Framers."
Neither the decision today, M.L.B. v. S.L.J., No. 95-853, nor the lower court opinions provided many details about the dispute between former spouses that led to the termination of Ms. Brooks's rights to her two children. The father, Sammy Lee James, had sought the termination order so that his new wife could adopt the children, of whom he had custody under the divorce agreement. He claimed in court that his former wife had not visited the children, while she maintained that she had been prevented from visiting.
Justice Ginsburg's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion, in which he said he would have based the decision exclusively on the notion of due process, without reference to equal protection.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
 
Bible Club
Without comment, the Court turned down a Long Island public school district's appeal from a ruling that gave a student-run religious club the right to limit leadership positions in the club to "professed Christians."
The Roslyn Union Free School District had objected to students' proposal for the Walking on Water Club, on the ground that the district had a non-discrimination policy applicable to all activities. The students sued, and won a ruling last May from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which held that the leadership requirement was an inherent part of the club members' right to religious speech.
The students' lawsuit was based on a 1984 Federal law, the Equal Access Act, which provides that a school district that permits student groups to meet may not deny access to a group on the basis of the religious or political content of the speech at its meetings. The case was Roslyn School District v. Hsu, No. 96-583.
 
Indian Rights
Also without comment, the Court refused to hear an appeal by an Indian tribe in western New York, the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, from a ruling of the Second Circuit allowing a group of dissident tribal members to file a Federal lawsuit challenging their banishment from the reservation. The case, which now goes to trial in Federal District Court in Buffalo, was Tonawanda Band v. Poodry, No. 96-609.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu at Bay: Bloom Is Off His Promise

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 16

 BODY:
This week marks six months since Benjamin Netanyahu took office as Prime Minister of Israel, and the country is already a different place, though perhaps not in the ways he promised.
Progress toward peace with the Palestinians has come to a halt -- and not through any ideological resistance on the part of Mr. Netanyahu, but on the contrary because Yasir Arafat has no faith in the Israeli leader's intentions. The Americans, after a big push in October, have decided to sit back awhile. At the same time, Palestinian leaders and Israeli security officials are issuing stern warnings that pressure in the Palestinian territories is at the boiling point. 
 Hard-won relations with moderate Arab states range from frozen to tense. On Sunday, Mohammed Bassiouni, the veteran Ambassador from Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, said in an interview that he could well be called home. "It is impossible to know where the deterioration will stop," he said.
Criticism of the Prime Minister has become so shrill and constant that it is rare to hear a good word about him outside his narrow circle of embattled aides.
This week, for example, opened with another crisis in full bloom, this one over the Government's decision to restore economic incentives for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In a pattern that has become glumly familiar, tensions rose a notch, Palestinians and Arab neighbors warned of possible violence, Washington and Europe chastised Mr. Netanyahu, Israeli editorials lambasted him and security officials called crisis meetings.
From their tightly guarded offices in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers fought back with a combination of tough talk and soothing rationalizations. "We are under an attack aimed at us all," the Prime Minister thundered in one interview, evoking an image of Israel once again standing up to a hostile world and charging that Palestinian leaders were planning a wave of violence.
In other interviews and statements he explained that restoring the incentives for settlers was intended to equalize their benefits with those of other Israelis living in hardship areas and had nothing to do with the issue of peace with the Palestinians.
After Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, spoke on the telephone with Mr. Netanyahu late on Sunday, tensions seemed to subside, but the reproaches continued.
Criticism of the Prime Minister has flowed from all sides. The United States is now distancing itself from Mr. Netanyahu in public, while in private some officials are speaking of his actions with dismay.
President Clinton, for example, said that today Israel is at a juncture that is "full of tension, and full of frustration," and urged Israel not to raise the settlement issue.
The constant hints a month ago that agreement on an Israeli pullout from Hebron was imminent have been replaced by grim warnings. Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, spokeof a "time bomb," while Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader and architect of the peace agreements, charged that the Government was "unwittingly bringing Israel to the gates of war."
In the daily Yediot Ahronot, the popular columnist Nahum Barnea wrote, "Six months after its establishment, the Netanyahu Government has been shorn of all policy." In an editorial on the same theme, the daily Haaretz declared that six months was little time for the Government to show achievements in the fields of security, economy or society, "but long enough to cause severe damage in those areas."
Within the Government, Mr. Netanyahu managed to fall afoul of the powerful and respected intelligence and military establishments as each side leaked recriminations over who was to blame for the big crises of the fall -- the rioting set off by Israel's opening of a new tourist exit to an archeological tunnel near Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalem's Old City in September and the current flap over settler incentives.
Reports surfaced over the weekend that Ami Ayalon, the head of the internal security agency, Shin Bet, sternly warned Mr. Netanyahu during a meeting on Thursday against any decision to boost the settlements. The leaks reportedly led to angry exchanges at a meeting today between Mr. Netanyahu and the Defense and Security Committee of the Parliament.
Compounding Mr. Netanyahu's plight was the fact that the actions that provoked such criticism from one side gained him little praise from the other. Settlers, already suspicious of the Prime Minister over his readiness to withdraw from Hebron, denounced the decision giving them economic benefits as an insufficiently "Zionist" response to the shooting last week of a settler and her son and demanded approval to construct new settlements.
Even the conservative Jerusalem Post, once a staunch supporter of Mr. Netanyahu, now finds fault with him over the settlement issue for giving the Palestinian Authority "the ammunition it needs" to rally the world against Israel.
Crises have plagued Mr. Netanyahu's administration from the beginning.
He came to office as the youngest Prime Minister in Israeli history, a man who had risen on the strength of his youth, a studied mastery of television and a ruthless determination.
But they were skills, his critics say, that did not spell leadership. Once he took office, his plan to create an American-style executive branch crumpled under the realities of a fragmented coalition reluctant to relinquish a scrap of power. His dream of creating an Israeli Camelot with his wife and little sons fizzled in the heat of savage press reports and rumors. His promises to set the Israeli economy on a new, market-driven path have come up against vested interests, political expediency and an economy on the verge of recession.
The initial comparisons of the handsome young leader with John F. Kennedy waned, to be replaced by a detailed comparison to Richard M. Nixon, sketched by Hemi Shalev, a respected columnist at Maariv. Like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Shalev wrote, Mr. Netanyahu is a political outsider with a grudge against the establishment -- in the Israeli's case a Likud establishment that spurned his father; a perception of the press as invariably hostile; a conviction that he can set things right with the appropriate explanation, and a view of a world filled with enemies.
Like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Netanyahu brought in as his closest advisers a team of campaign workers whose main qualification apparently was their loyalty to him. The aides -- Dore Gold, an academic from the United States, on foreign affairs; David Bar-Illan, a right-wing former newspaper editor and pianist on communications; Danny Naveh, a young lawyer, as Cabinet Secretary, and Avigdor Lieberman, a tough immigrant from Moldova, on domestic politics -- have been roundly criticized for their lack of experience in government, which has been evident in many of Mr. Netanyahu's troubles.
In Israeli politics, however, it is dealing with the Arabs that a leader is judged by. And here, the right-wing ideologue who insisted that he knew how to strike a hard bargain with the Arabs quickly found himself stiffed and outmaneuvered by them. Syria responded to his tough talk by moving crack troops to the base of the Golan and reviving a war scare in Israel. Egypt mobilized pan-Arab support against him, and even King Hussein of Jordan, his strongest supporter in the region, castigated him.
"If King Hussein is speaking as he is about Netanyahu, we have apparently reached the hour of genuine crisis," Mr. Arafat declared in an interview with Yediot Ahronot published on Sunday. "Don't they understand where they are dragging the region?"
Mr. Netanyahu's defense to such charges comes in a characteristic but confusing blend of classic revisionist ideology -- in which he stands as the defender of an Israel on which the world is ready to pounce at the slightest provocation -- and the tough, snappy television style that initially gained him political attention as a young United Nations delegate.
The Arabs, he says, have to get used to the fact that a Labor Government whose motto was "give and give" has been replaced by one that says "give and take." In his view, the violence after the tunnel opening, the current tensions, and the delay in reaching agreement on Hebron, are all a deliberate ploy by Mr. Arafat to trigger international attacks on Israel.
At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu insists at every turn that he is committed to the Oslo peace agreements with the Palestinians and will achieve a "peace with security;" that he will make peace with Syria, and that he will forge qualitatively new relations with the Arabs.
Like Mr. Nixon with China, he is convinced that only he can make that peace.

HEADLINE: Bookstore Bounces Back With Mount Kisco's Help

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO, N.Y., Dec. 16

 BODY:
The folks at the Mount Kisco Book Company knew their store was well liked in the community, but it was not until something really bad happened that they got a glimpse of just how deeply the affection ran.
On Nov. 25, a blazing fire gutted the store, putting more than 20 full-time employees out of work and extinguishing a healthy business the very first week of the holiday selling season. It looked like it would be the second lousy December in a row for the staff, most of whom had worked for another book and music store, Fox & Sutherland, that had gone out of business last year after 43 years down the street on South Moger Avenue. 
 On Dec. 7, just 11 days after the fire, the store reopened. Ever since, it has been filled with customers offering congratulations, hugging employees, saying they saved their holiday shopping for the store's rebirth.
"This morning, I got three hugs," Helen Cranley, the manager of the gift department, said on Saturday.
After the fire, Irwin Hersch, the principal owner, began receiving sympathy notes, like the one from a longtime customer who wrote: "The store wasn't about CD's and gift items and books. It was about people and beauty and soul."
When the Chamber of Commerce announced a fund for out-of-work employees of the bookstore and several smaller shops that burned, local residents sent in $3,000, mostly in small sums.
"Hundreds of people expressed their regrets and said they were really upset by what happened," said Mr. Hersch, who is also an owner of Coliseum Books in Manhattan.
When he announced he would try to reopen before Christmas, the village jumped to his aid. Don Ford, a local furniture dealer, arranged for a crew -- his sons, basically -- to install 5,000 square feet of carpet in three days in a temporary space Mr. Hersch leased a few blocks away. A retired painter spent a day wielding a brush. A camera store employee pitched in after closing.
"We could have had 1,200 people here if we wanted," said Mr. Hersch, who with grizzled features and suspenders holding up his khakis looks more like a plumbing contractor than a bookseller.
"It's an amazing story," he said. "I'm from New York. My stores have always been in New York. I could never imagine this thing happening there."
The store's demise seemed to tap into the public's general affection for bookstores, for independent merchants in the age of megastores and for tough-luck Mount Kisco itself, a working-class village surrounded by more affluent communities that has struggled to nurture a fledgling retail revival.
The fire, which investigators have traced to a compressor in a Baskin-Robbins ice cream store, did almost $500,000 in damage to the bookstore, which was insured, Mr. Hersch said. It destroyed not only books -- about 40 percent of the inventory -- but also CD's, fountain pens and children's toys.
The American Booksellers Association, in an appeal faxed and E-mailed to stores two days after the fire, asked for donations of unused shelves. Stores from Massachusetts to Michigan responded. Publishers' sales representatives donated 15 boxes of books.
Chip Edmonston, the book department manager, said, "Everyone who walks in is saying, 'This is almost magical that this has been pulled off.' "
Michael Stone, a customer who had picked out a Mel Torme CD box set, said: "Their inventory is thin. I understand. But I believe in the survival of independent retailers. There should be something else in our chain-dominated society, and I like to see these folks rebuild and survive."
This is the second brush with unemployment for many involved: seventeen employees of the store had worked at the former Fox & Sutherland, which closed last December. Its longtime owner had shut the business when he decided to retire, and in the face of chain-store competition. During the liquidation sale, many longtime customers had been unable to face coming in to pick over the bones.
"It was an awful winter," said Mr. Edmonston, a 20-year Fox & Sutherland employee, who was out of work along with his wife, Lyn, a bookkeeper at the old store.
When Mr. Hersch opened in June, he hired all the former Fox & Sutherland employees who sought work and recreated that store's eclectic mix of departments. The new store had mahogany shelves and a children's reading nook with an eggplant carpet with yellow stars. It quickly became a retail anchor.
Then the fire struck.
That evening, when Mr. Hersch returned to his condominium in Chappaqua, he was greeted by his next-door neighbor, a casual acquaintance.
"He rang my doorbell, and there he was standing with tears rolling down his face," Mr. Hersch said. "I started crying, too. The two of us were standing there crying and I don't think we ever exchanged a word."
On Saturday, customers shopped for James Thurber anthologies and Pearl Jam CD's, for Mount Blanc pens and Crane stationary.
"I know it sounds silly, but we have a love affair with this store," said Walter Joyce, who was with his wife, Lisa, and their toddler, Caroline. "We loved Fox & Sutherland. We loved the Mount Kisco Book Company. We loved what the store did for Mount Kisco."
For many, the way the village rallied has brought a needed sense of pride to the community, which is surrounded by the estate country of Chappaqua, Bedford and Armonk, whose affluent residents sometimes look down on it.
"This town gets a lot of knocks," Mr. Joyce, a village resident, said. "It was nice to see the town come together. There was a real sense of unity."
This Saturday, the store plans to hold its first author reading, by Frank McCourt, of his book "Angela's Ashes."

HEADLINE: Employee Ownership

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Dec. 1 front-page article "Wealthy, Helped by Wall St., Find New Ways to Escape Tax on Profits" requires a response concerning the use of a Section 1042 transaction by a retiring business owner.
When I drafted Section 1042 of the tax code in 1984, I did it as a means for working men and women to realize the American dream of ownership. Section 1042 is meant to encourage business owners to sell the equity they built in their company to their employees, instead of an outside buyer, by offering a deferral of capital gains taxes. 
Without Section 1042, employees' fates would be uncertain when the owners of their companies retire. New owners could downsize the workforce or lay off long-term workers. There would also be a significant drop in employee ownership.
In times like these, we must continue to bridge the gaps that exist at our companies and in our economy through employee ownership. Section 1042 helps fortify that bridge.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Generals, Battlefields And What Raleigh Said

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

THE READER'S COMPANION TO MILITARY HISTORY
Edited by Robert Cowley and Geoffrey Parker
Illustrated. 573 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $45.
 In Volume 1 of his biography of Winston Churchill, William Manchester tells how Churchill and the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, toured a battlefield of World War I. A shell landed nearby; Clemenceau stopped a riderless horse that was streaming with blood. As the two turned reluctantly to leave the scene, Clemenceau observed in an undertone, "Quel moment delicieux!" What a delightful moment!
 That is one anecdote that Robert Cowley and Geoffrey Parker do not tell in their otherwise encyclopedic work, "The Reader's Companion to Military History." Countless other equally pregnant episodes in the history of war are told, however, episodes tending to justify Sir Walter Raleigh's observation, cited in the introduction, that "the ordinary theme and argument of all history is war." 
 Robert E. Lee once said, "It is well war is so terrible -- we would grow too fond of it," and while the editors and dozens of contributors to this book never say as much, one senses sympathy with that and Clemenceau's sensibility. Operating on the assumption that war is the truly universal pursuit, the editors have assembled a reference work whose purpose is to chronicle it factually and unemotionally across the centuries and continents.
Mr. Cowley and Mr. Parker inform readers early on that they followed two principles in choosing their entries. First, they have "privileged" Western matters, on the grounds that the Western way of war has become the global norm. Second, they put more stress on 20th-century events than on others. Still, their book, which begins with a short entry on Abd el-Krim (a Berber commander of the 1920's) and ends with a somewhat longer one on the Zulu wars, is marvelously inclusive, informative and, in its way, entertaining.
It does not offer deep explanations of anything -- the entry on World War II is a crisp five pages, for example. But it has copious cross-referencing, and its sheer coverage is enormous, including everything from the Persian Wars to Hannibal, the An Lu-shan rebellion in eighth-century China and the techniques of nighttime fighting (in an entry called "Darkness").
Explaining their approach, Mr. Cowley, the editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, and Mr. Parker, a teacher of history at Ohio State University, allow that the old "drums and bugles approach" to warfare is outdated. By this they seem to mean that matters like technology, economics and intelligence have to be given their due along with biographies of generals and descriptions of battlefield maneuvers.
There are entries on such issues as homosexuals in the military, psychological warfare, friendly fire, espionage, "ethnic cleansing," courage, desertion and peace (including Ambrose Bierce's definition: "the interval of cheating between two wars"). But the evidence of the hundreds of selections in "The Reader's Companion to Military History" is that the editors and contributors are traditionalist military historians whose primary interest is in battles, commanders, weaponry and tactics: that is, on actions and outcomes more than on the costs, the horrors, the terror of war, the absurdity, the tragedy, the stupendous waste.
The volume is organized alphabetically, with the author of each entry listed and, in many cases, suggestions for further reading indicated. Helpful maps are placed on pages where major battles are described. One doesn't so much read the book systematically as browse in it, or get pulled along a trail of cross-references. One might start with the entry, say, on theorists of land warfare, which would lead naturally to the entry on Sun Tzu, the famed Chinese strategist of deception and deceit. From there, for purposes of comparison, one might turn to the 19th-century Prussian Carl von Clausewitz and his blunt definition of war: "an act of violence to compel our enemy to do our will."
However one reads this book, its most signal characteristic is its breadth and consistency. Entries on the Battle of Megiddo in the 15th century B.C., and on the Muslim warrior and sultan Saladin two and a half millenniums later, are written with the same authority as those on the Persian Gulf war or the battle of Stalingrad or the British campaign in the Falklands. Entries often begin with a crisp statement of historical significance, like this one on the Battle of Hastings, written by W. Scott Jessee: "The most famous battle on English soil, Hastings changed the destiny of England, and its sheer drama still astounds." Or there is this succinct statement provided by Edward N. Luttwak on the gulf war: "Seldom have so many gathered for a war eventually fought by so few."
The scholarly sure-footedness of the volume is somewhat marred by the editors' inclusion of various lists of 10 -- the best and worst commanders in history, the most overlooked and underestimated commanders, even the 10 best war movies. The effort has a parlor game feeling to it, and some of it is certainly debatable: William Westmoreland's inclusion on the list of 10 worst commanders, for example.
Then again, one can always read each of the relevant entries. The one on General Westmoreland, commander of American forces in Vietnam for four years, is written by David Kaiser of the Naval War College. It provides a straightforward summary of the strategy that General Westmoreland adopted as well as its shortcomings, but its final statement, "Historians may eventually conclude that no American strategy was likely to succeed," seems to take some of the onus for the defeat away from the general. In any case, the volume leaves no doubt that any number of the undisputed geniuses of the battlefield -- including some on the editors' Top 10 hit parade -- lost the wars in which they were engaged, Hannibal and Napoleon among them.
The subject is endless, which is one of the many pleasures of this useful book. On the same page are succinct descriptions of the Battle of Chancellorsville, "Robert E. Lee's greatest defensive victory," and Chandragupta Maurya, the fourth-century-B.C. leader who was the first to unite northern India under one rule. It would be hard to imagine another single volume in which those two entries could be found so close together.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Improves With Stocks; 2 European Banks Trim Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended steady to mostly higher yesterday, deriving strength from a mild stock rebound and two interest-rate cuts in Europe.
The dollar's gains partly erased losses from Monday, when a late selloff in stocks helped drag the currency lower. But dealers said the dollar remained vulnerable to nervousness on Wall Street. "Without a doubt, dollar traders in particular are very focused on what's going on with the stock market and broader asset markets," said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York. "There's a lot of skittishness." 
 But the gains late yesterday bolstered the dollar.
"The dollar perked up in the afternoon when the stock market gave it the push," said Elliott Dix, assistant vice president for foreign exchange at Signet Bank in Richmond, adding that "the anticipation of a correction in the stock market is keeping the dollar a little bit in check."
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose yesterday to 1.5496 German marks from 1.5455 marks on Monday. The dollar was quoted at 113.88 Japanese yen, down marginally from 113.90 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6706 from $1.6669.
The dollar was also helped after the central banks of France and Sweden made small cuts in short-term interest rates, underscoring European economic weakness. The cuts came on a day that the Federal Reserve left interest rates in the United States unchanged.
And traders said it was still possible that Germany could nudge its short-term rates lower in coming months, even though the central bank there said in its monthly report that the level of rates and the mark's value were appropriate,
The yen weakened in Asian trading after Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's Management and Coordination Agency, said a lower yen was needed to deter manufacturers from moving production abroad to reduce costs. His comments helped lift the dollar past 114 yen before sellers pushed it back down, concluding that Mr. Muto was speaking only for himself.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Monday's, included 1.3253 Swiss francs, up from 1.3204; 5.2275 French francs, up from 5.2135, and 1,523.50 Italian lire, down from 1,524.00.

HEADLINE: Turning Colombia's Drug Plots Over to Peasant Plowshares

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 17

 BODY:
To get to her office, the director of the Colombian Government agency for land reform must wade through a living illustration of Government failure: peasants and their children making their homes on mattresses in the hall outside her office.
About 250 people chased off their plots of land at the behest of a nearby landowner are camping at Government agencies, seeking protection, after several of their number were killed and others threatened. 
 But Alba Ortilla Duenas, the Minister of Agrarian Reform, is hoping that a law passed by Congress last week authorizing the seizure of drug dealers' assets will ease the plight of landless peasants.
Either directly or through third parties, drug dealers are estimated to own about 9.9 million acres. Expecting that some share of that will be tied up in lengthy legal wrangles, Ms. Ortilla estimated that 3.7 million acres could be used to settle 120,000 families, which would give a three-year jump on a national timetable for land redistribution. The appropriation has the backing of the powerful Farmers Society of Colombia.
"Everybody wants it," said Ms. Ortilla. "People agree with whatever measures the Government takes to strike at the origin of this stigma."
Authorities estimate the combined assets of Colombia's 10 biggest drug dealers at $76 billion, which would rank them among the dozen largest companies in the world.
In the last two decades, drug dealers or their fronts have acquired land in 42 percent of all municipalities in Colombia, through generous offers that few farmers have had the courage to turn down.
Gabriel Martinez, an economist who is secretary general of the Farmers Society, said drug dealers had driven up the prices for land and for local labor. They have extended their political influence and turned the country's most fertile land into unproductive estates.
"They're not investing in agriculture," said Mr. Martinez. "They just need to launder their money."
The asset seizure law offers Colombia a tool to take back its economy. It allows the seizure of assets gained through drug dealing, kidnapping or extortion.
The law's passage on Dec. 12 essentially resurrected a bill that had been gutted earlier in the week, when the Congress voted 59-57 against seizing ill-gotten assets acquired before the 1991 Constitution was enacted.
Business leaders feared that a lenient asset-seizure law would have sealed Washington's decision to designate Colombia for a third time as a country that is not a serious partner in the fight against drug trafficking. That decision could lead to economic sanctions costing $300 million.
The business leaders mounted a lobbying effort to revisit the issue. President Ernesto Samper met with members of Parliament. The American Ambassador, Myles Frechette, warned that the United States would not take seriously any law that did not strike at assets gained before 1991. The new law, passed 103-4, covers assets acquired over the last 20 years.
In a statement after the Thursday night vote, Mr. Samper said the new law "defines a clear watershed in the history of the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime."
Others were less sure. They warned that if it was so difficult to garner the Congressional votes for a serious bill despite the damage drug wealth provokes in the country, it will undoubtedly be even harder to obtain judicial and political cooperation in actually seizing the ill-gained assets.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A high-technology initial public offering is a novelty in Japan.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AS initial public stock offerings go, a sale by ATL Systems Inc. would not at first appear to be one that would make investors drool. ATL, a five-year-old Japanese software company, recorded a loss of about $230,000 on sales of only $120,000 in its last fiscal year.
But shares of ATL, which makes software that runs on networks of Sun Microsystems and Apple computers and is used to manage business data, were snapped up yesterday as if the 10-employee company were the next Microsoft. Shares closed at 424,000 yen, or about $3,723, up 51 percent from the offering price of 280,000 yen. 
 That ATL is going public at all in Japan is remarkable. It is the first company to use a new over-the-counter market intended to allow technology companies that are still in the money-losing development stage to raise capital by selling shares to the public.
The so-called second over-the-counter market is aimed at remedying a big problem in Japan: the lack of high-technology entrepreneurs, who often take the lead in creating new products and industries.
In the United States, such entrepreneurs are often financed by venture capitalists, which realize a return on their investment when the start-up company goes public.
In Japan, it has been difficult for young companies to go public because they have had to meet certain profit and asset requirements. That difficulty, in turn, has stymied the development of venture capital in Japan. Indeed, Eric Forday, an analyst with SBC Warburg Japan Ltd., said that the companies that have gone public in the last year are 31 years old on average, hardly young growth companies.
In contrast, the Nasdaq market in the United States lists more than 5,000 companies, among them Amgen, Apple, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft and many others that went from zero to billions of dollars in sales in a matter of years.
Japan, on the other hand, has virtually no recent technology start-up companies with similar records, and the Japanese over-the-counter market lists only about 760 companies, mainly in service businesses. New issues in the last few weeks, for instance, have included an installer of air-conditioning equipment, a steel products wholesaler and a men's clothing chain.
The restrictions on initial public offerings were imposed by the Ministry of Finance, which feared that a flood of new issues would further depress a stock market that has been weak since the economic bubble of the 1980's collapsed. Through part of 1992, the ministry effectively blocked all initial offerings, then set limits on how many could occur each week.
But the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which wants to foster entrepreneurship, pressed for changes. The weekly limits on new offerings were scrapped in April 1995 and the second over-the-counter market, which has no requirements for company profitability, was established in July that year, though it has taken more than a year for any company to use it. While not strictly limited to high-technology companies, companies on the new market must devote an amount exceeding 3 percent of their sales to research and development.
No one expects the market to be an overnight success. Only one other company is scheduled to go public on the market -- A & CMOS Inc., a Tokyo designer of integrated circuits, which will be listed next week. Kaname Seki, vice chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, said he expected about 10 companies to be listed by next autumn.
Despite yesterday's enthusiastic reception for ATL, finding investors might be difficult. "Institutional investors don't invest in companies that are losing money," said Noriko Takahashi, who follows over-the-counter companies for UBS Securities in Tokyo.
To try to improve liquidity and attract investors, the second O-T-C market will use the market maker system, similar to that of Nasdaq, in which securities companies actively buy and sell shares rather than merely act as middlemen.
Even if the new market proves popular, no one expects that by itself it will lead to a burst of entrepreneurialism in Japan because there are other obstacles. Venture capital business is not well developed and many people prefer to work for big companies, which offer the most prestige and lifetime job security.
ATL, meanwhile, which raised about $2.7 million by selling 1,100 new shares, must fulfill its promise of becoming profitable this year to avoid souring investors. The company, which is based in Kofu, about 70 miles west of Tokyo, has so far sold just six software packages at about $85,000 each.
"We feel the weight of responsibility," Yasuhiro Sasaki, an ATL director, said. "We feel we must turn in profits."

Remember that Datsun 240Z you drove 25 years ago? Nissan hopes you will buy it again.

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THERE are used cars, and then there are used cars.
The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. has been buying up 1970 to 1972 models of its Z sports cars and restoring them to their former glory. The cars will be sold at 10 dealerships, starting in February. 
 To stimulate interest in the cars, TBWA Chiat/Day, the ad agency for Nissan, has started hawking them with advertisements in December issues of most automotive magazines.
The cars will be priced at more than $20,000, up from the $3,526 -- not adjusted for inflation, of course -- that a 1970 240Z originally fetched. While that might seem to be a steep price for a car that is about a quarter-century old, with the 1970's being all the rage, Nissan is saying, why not?
"Right now, retro is very hip, so I think it is a very interesting concept," said Rob R. Siltanen, creative director at the Venice, Calif., office of TBWA Chiat/Day, a unit of the Omnicom Group.
The three-page print ads hark back to a seemingly simpler time, promising readers: "No power mirrors. No cup holders. No lumbar supports. (First come, first served.)" The ads, expected to run through 1997, feature a flame yellow Datsun 240Z, circa 1972, in front of a cherry-colored background.
Nissan is spending less than $5 million for the ads because they will run only in "buff books" like Auto Week, Road & Track and Automobile magazine, said W. Thomas Orbe Jr., vice president for marketing at Nissan in Gardena, Calif.
The vintage Z ads are a small piece of the $200 million image campaign that Nissan began in the summer to remind customers of its roots. The Japanese company was known in the United States as Datsun until 1983.
"It fits in perfectly with the campaign," Mr. Siltanen said of the image effort, which carries the theme "Life is a journey. Enjoy the ride."
The yellow 240Z is also featured in a two-minute television commercial, titled "Dream Garage," that first ran during the closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in August. A toy version of the latest Z -- the 300Z -- is the centerpiece of the delightful 60-second commercial that shows a macho action toy coming to life as the Van Halen version of the rock tune "You Really Got Me" plays in the background. The spot ends as the tough toy, joined by a Barbie-like doll, drive away together in the sports car.
But Nissan has gone a step further, by selling a physical as well as a celluloid version of its heritage.
"We have a very strong brand in the Z car," Mr. Orbe said. Datsun sold about 71,000 of the automobiles from 1970 to 1972, when they were among the most popular sports cars.
"It would be a shame just to let this vehicle go by the wayside," he added.
So the company has chosen 10 of its top-selling dealerships to sell the restored 1970-72 Z cars as well as used Z's from the 1990 through 1996 model years that have been given checkups and warranty extensions.
Nissan expects to sell a total of one dozen to two dozen vintage sports cars monthly at the 10 dealerships and 100 to 150 of the younger used Z's monthly.
The vintage Z's are restored to mint 1970's condition but not updated. That means they are missing advanced safety devices like air bags. Their emissions systems are vintage, too -- polluting just as much as they would have when originally sold.
But the lack of updating may be part of the appeal. "The response we've gotten has been phenomenal," Mr. Orbe said. "Some dealers already have waiting lists." The special Z dealers are in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia.
If Nissan decides to add more "Z-stores," as the dealerships that sell the vintage and classic Z's are being called, Mr. Orbe said, one may be added in the New York area.
Nissan says it has done for cars what some watch makers have done for vintage timepieces: restored classic versions of their products to sell alongside new ones.
"Just like a real fine watch, a Rolex or a Patek Philippe, we'll give the public a chance to buy one of these classics," Mr. Orbe said. "Good things have a way of coming back."

HEADLINE: Goldman, Sachs Profit Up, Boding Well for Wall Street

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs, the nation's biggest investment banking partnership, said yesterday that its pretax earnings rose 69 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, as profit from investment banking, trading and sales led the firm to its second- best year.
The Goldman Sachs Group L.P. reported that earnings before taxes increased to $743 million in the three months that ended in November, from $440 million in the similar period a year earlier. It reported its profit to partners on Monday night and to other employees yesterday. 
 Pretax profit for the full year totaled $2.6 billion, just shy of the $2.7 billion in 1993, Goldman's best year.
The firm's fourth-quarter revenue totaled $1.54 billion; the total for the year was $6.14 billion.
The increase in profit comes as Wall Street is on track for record overall profit this year amid a boom in underwriting and in mergers and acquisitions driven by rising stocks and low interest rates.
"The market environment was singularly favorable to Goldman," said John Keefe, an independent securities analyst. "They had a great share of underwriting and lots of M. and A. activity."
Goldman is privately held and, unlike publicly traded securities firms, does not report its after-tax profit. But the strong earnings bode well for big securities firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Holdings, which report their quarterly profits after the first of the year, analysts suggested.
"I think Goldman's results could be representative of the industry," said Charles Vincent of the PNC Bank Asset Management Group in Philadelphia.
The rise in earnings is also good news for Goldman's 190 partners, who share in the profits. Partners will make about $7 million to $8 million each this year, according to people at the firm, though much of that will be reinvested in the firm until they retire or leave. A Goldman, Sachs spokesman said any discussion of partners' compensation was speculative, and declined to comment further.
Goldman was the leading American underwriter of common stocks, one of Wall Street's most lucrative businesses, so far in the fourth quarter and the full year, according to the Securities Data Company of Newark.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Falter On Strong Housing Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities dropped yesterday following a housing report that was stronger than expected, but the bonds partly erased some early losses and managed to end above the day's lows.
The Commerce Department reported that new housing starts in November rose 9.2 percent, to an annual rate of 1.514 million units -- a far larger gain than the gain of one-tenth of 1 percent economists had expected, and a stark reminder to market participants that the economy could still rebound strongly and increase inflationary pressures. 
 The housing data led to a selloff of securities that at one point pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up to 6.68 percent, the highest it has been since Nov. 1.
Then, after a partial recovery, the 30-year bond finished the session down 15/32 , to a price of 98; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.65 percent, from 6.62 percent on Monday.
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee concluded its final meeting for the year yesterday without taking action on short-term interest rates. But with the majority of market participants correctly expecting the Fed to keep monetary policy on hold, it had little effect on trading.
Discussing the increased housing starts, Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said: "It should be realized that the rise in starts in November merely indicates a stagnant housing sector going forward. The data should not be interpreted as suggesting a great deal of momentum going forward."
She said that housing starts so far during the fourth quarter, even with last month's advance of 9.2 percent, are still 2.7 percent below the average rate of starts seen in the third quarter.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "Just as the sharp drop in October seemed to be an overstatement of weakness, the surge in housing starts in November is likely an overstatement of strength, and averaging the levels for two months may well be a good approximation of the trend.
"However, housing does appear to be slowing, but at a very gradual rate," he said, "as the fourth-quarter averages for both starts and permits appear to be only slightly lower than the third, which were only moderately below the second."
Concerning the Fed, Mr. Fine predicted that it would "continue to adhere to an unchanged policy stance in an economic environment that is neither overheating nor slowing substantially, and producing little in the way of inflationary pressures."
The Fed's policy-making committee is next scheduled to meet for two days, starting Feb. 4.
The Fed has not adjusted short-term interest rates since Jan. 31, when it lowered the Federal funds rate -- which banks charge one another for overnight loans -- and the discount rate -- which the Fed charges banks -- both by a quarter of a percentage point.
The bond market took satisfaction from the weekly LJR Redbook chain-store sales index covering the first two weeks of December. That report showed sales increased six-tenths of 1 percent, below the rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent or even a full percent the market had expected. Earlier in the day, the weekly Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim index of chain-store sales showed a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent for the week ended Dec 14. According to that report, sales were near or at expectations for most retailers.
Elsewhere, dealers and traders prepared for today's $18.25 billion two-year note auction by the Treasury, which will also be selling $12.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow.
In when-issued trading, the two-year maturity was being offered at a price to yield 5.84 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.18 percent.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Yankees Lost More From Pitching Staff Than They Gained

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Pat Gillick, the Baltimore Orioles' general manager, was on the telephone asking about the status of the Yankees' negotiations with David Wells. Told the numbers they were discussing, he said, "I like my contract better than the one they're talking about."
A few hours later, the Yankees and Wells's agent, Greg Clifton, reached agreement on a three-year contract for a guaranteed $13.5 million. 
 If Wells, in each season of the contract, pitches as frequently as he did last season for Gillick's team, that package will inflate to $14.65 million, only $950,000 less than twice the $7.8 million the Orioles gave Jimmy Key for two years.
That's why Gillick liked his contract more. That's why, in retrospect, the Yankees may wish they had given Key the contract Gillick gave him.
Now that they finally have pieced together their pitching puzzle, the Yankees can step back and scrutinize the overall effect of their moves. They have swapped Key and the unbeatable bullpen tandem of John Wetteland and Mariano Rivera for David Wells and the untested bullpen alignment of Rivera and a committee that includes Mike Stanton, the staff's other new pitcher.
The Yankees did not sign Key, who wanted to stay, because they did not want to give him a second year. They did not sign Wetteland, who wanted to stay, because they did not want to spend the kind of money he wanted on each of two pitchers and they preferred giving it to a starter.
They tried to give Roger Clemens $8 million or more a year, but he opted for Canadian money, so they turned around and guaranteed Wells $4.5 million a year.
It's George Steinbrenner's money to spend, but he seemed to lose his sense of direction in his obsession to snare Clemens. He lost sight of his real goal.
The Yankees, in December 1996, are not looking ahead to 1999 and figuring out how to win the pennant that season.
In this era of hit-and-miss baseball, teams cannot live for the distant future unless they are starting from scratch, like the Pittsburgh Pirates have decided to do.
Teams of the caliber of the Yankees and the Orioles can think of the future with their younger players, like Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter, and make sure they keep their best prospects. But with division championships and pennants so elusive in the era of free agency, their priority first and foremost is to win now. In December 1996, that means 1997.
By signing Wells, the Yankees have not improved their 1996 pitching staff for 1997; they have not added a good veteran starter to their rotation.
By signing Wells, they have simply swapped left-handed starters with the Orioles. Just like the Yankees with Key, the Orioles did not run to re-sign Wells because they did not want to pay his price.
"We have never been in it," Gillick said. "We were out of it when it went past two years.
"Last summer, they told us they'd take $9 million for three years," Gillick added, referring to Wells and his agent. "We said no then. In this day and age, you've got to be flexible. You have to limit your exposure. Three, four-year contracts get you in trouble."
If the Yankees had kept their focus on 1997, they might have found more sense in giving Key a second year than in giving Wells three years.
But after refusing to pay Key's price, the Yankees paid for Wells, and he will cost them far more than the $7 million or $7.5 million Key would have accepted to stay in New York.
He also has cost them Wetteland. If they had given Key the second year at a lower annual salary than they gave Wells for three years, the Yanks wouldn't have faced the conflict of starter versus No. 1 reliever.
When Rivera and Wetteland pitched last season, they took care of one-third of the game, Rivera overwhelming hitters for two innings and Wetteland scaring the Yankees for one inning but getting the final out nevertheless. Rivera preceded Wetteland in 25 of Wetteland's 43 regular-season saves.
Gillick recalled a similar situation he had when he was the Toronto general manager, when the Blue Jays had Duane Ward and Tom Henke.
"Ward pitched to the team's toughest hitters in the seventh and eighth," Gillick said.
"Ward took the spirit out of those guys. When Henke came in, he didn't have as difficult a job. I think that's what happened with Rivera. He breaks the spirit of a team."
Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Graeme Lloyd have never been known for smashing spirits. Yet they will replace Rivera as the setup man to the closer, who will be Rivera. The Yankees sacrificed the unique weapon they had because Rivera comes cheaper than Wetteland. But Key would have been cheaper than Wells.
Evidently, in the face of the double-barreled economic weapon of luxury tax and revenue sharing, Steinbrenner no longer is prepared to win at any cost. That is understandable. But if the Yankees' pitching decisions cost them a chance to repeat, that outcome will be less easily comprehended.

HEADLINE: For Retailers, Weather Is Wild Card in Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
As the final week of the holiday selling season begins, retailers are finding their sales stuck between mediocre and decent, meaning that these last few days could be crucial to their success.
While many merchants told Wall Street early in the season that they planned to have sales increases of 4 to 9 percent this season, many are reporting weekly sales in the lower end of that range. November, except for the Thanksgiving weekend, was weak. 
 And, because that weekend was later than usual, there were five fewer shopping days this year than in 1995. To top it off, the weather may also be turning against retailers. After a relatively mild start to December, much of the central United States has been hit with harsh weather. Beginning on Monday, cold weather pushed south from Canada, with snow falling in the upper Midwest and as far south as Texas. Forecasters said yesterday that much of the nation east of the Rockies was due for more icy weather and that there would be more snow in parts of the Midwest. Rain has fallen in the Northeast for weeks, and more of it could be on the way.
Last year, bad weather, particularly in the Northeast, contributed to one of the poorest Christmas selling seasons in a decade. "You do not want sleet and ice," said Mark J. Schoifet, the spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. "Because that keeps people out of their cars, and that can be just deadly."
Neither rain nor sleet kept shoppers from their destinations last weekend. Mr. Schoifet's organization reported that for the holiday season so far, sales per square foot in 60 malls nationwide were up 21.5 percent from last year. But he warned that that number was significantly inflated because the period it covered, the first two weeks after Thanksgiving, was much closer to Christmas than the comparable two weeks last year.
"The selling season will end up with about 4 or 5 percent increases over all," Mr. Schoifet said.
Those numbers are fairly consistent with other sales data released this week. Telecheck Services, for example, a Houston-based check acceptance company, reported that the first 17 days of the shopping season resulted in a 5 percent sales gain over 1995. LJR Redbook Research reported that in the week ending on Dec. 14 sales were up 5.7 percent from a year earlier. Melissa Bane, the senior analyst at the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm, said that holiday sales over the Internet were running at four times the yearly average, compared with three times the average last year.
"Because of the shortened season this year," said William Ford, Telecheck's senior economic adviser, "we are not seeing the typical mid-season lull in holiday spending."
There seems little doubt that apparel will be the big winner this year. The strongest areas appear to be designer sportswear and casual clothing brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Polo by Ralph Lauren. "Fashion designers get a lot of press, but they are not that meaningful out there," said Jay Meltzer, managing director of LJR Redbook Research. "Active wear and casual wear continues to take market share from tailored clothing."
But even apparel stores' numbers are a bit suspect, because many specialty stores are now chock full of candles, bath oils and other personal care products. "The numbers are not as clean as you might think," said John Konarski, vice president of the I.C.S.C. "A lot of stores like Banana Republic are giving more and more square footage to home furnishing and cosmetics and that has to skew the sales numbers."
Analysts said that retailers were putting more goods on sale than they said they would at the beginning of the season, though retailers insisted that what was on sale was part of "planned promotions." That means that the stores went into the season planning to put a few goods on sale to attract traffic, but that price slashing on the scale of last year's is not being done this season.
Still, some retailers said they believed that shoppers were delaying purchases in part in the belief that prices would be cut as Christmas approaches.
"I think consumers are still waiting for Christmas Eve. They like to stick it out and see who blinks," said Coleman Nee, a spokesman for Bradlees, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection and depending on a good season to restore its creditors' faith.
Low inventory levels may help stores keep from cutting prices too much, but shoppers apparently will still keep sniffing for bargains. "November showed people that consumers are ready and willing to spend money but not at full price," said Melvyn Plotzker, first president of Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, which has many retail clients.
The Limited stores have had deep promotions since Thanksgiving, as have other mall stores like American Eagle Outfitters and Casual Corner. At Saks Holdings' Saks Fifth Avenue, executives have been boasting about strong cashmere sales for weeks. But there is still plenty of it around on Fifth Avenue, and at slashed prices.
Last year, about 30 retail bankruptcies resulted in rampant promoting and subsequent store closings. Fewer stores and fewer sales in stores that are dying have certainly helped the malls this year. "A few people are in trouble, but nowhere near last year," said James Rice, director of credit at Barnard Sands, the credit consultants. "Last year there were literally thousands of stores being liquidated, so this year it will be easier to keep gross margins."
But there are still too many stores to meet demand, he added. "I think people are getting lulled into a false sense of security because it has been a good year," Mr. Rice said. "But the overstored problem is not solved yet."
But the biggest problem for retailers, in this shortened season, could be unexpectedly bad weather. To try to gauge shopping patterns, one analyst said he was spending less time in mall parking lots and more in front of the television.
"I watch the Weather Channel at least three times a day now," said Walter Loeb, who runs his own retail consulting firm in New York.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Rises Unexpectedly

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose unexpectedly last month, the Government reported today. It was the first monthly increase in two years.
The Finance Ministry said that the November trade surplus edged up two-tenths of 1 percent, to 675.19 billion yen, or $5.92 billion, as a weaker yen bolstered Japanese exports, especially of cars. 
 The surplus with the United States, often a source of trade friction, surged 31.2 percent in November to 378.39 billion yen, or $3.31 billion, from last year, reflecting the increase in automotive exports.
Last month, Japan's surplus with the United States widened, compared with last year's levels, for the first time in 20 months.
Private economists had forecast a hefty drop of around 28 percent in the overall surplus, continuing the long-standing decline.
"It's quite a surprise," Richard Jerram, an analyst with ING Baring Securities, Tokyo, said. "Certainly, if anything, it shows the trade surplus is going to be turning around earlier than we expected."
A fall in the value of the yen from last year's record highs has steadily put the brakes on the drop in Japan's trade surplus, but economists had not been expecting to see an increase so soon.
A Finance Ministry official said the major reason for the rise in the trade surplus with the United States was a 45.7 percent surge in car exports to the United States. A drop in imports of aircraft also contributing to the increase in the overall surplus. But the official said the general downward trend in the trade surplus would continue.

HEADLINE: The Fed Holds Rates Steady; Housing Gains

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity.
The Fed's decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals. 
 Indeed, just before the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the Commerce Department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer.
Driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in November, the biggest monthly jump since July 1995, the department said. The increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in September and October.
Starts were 20.8 percent higher in the Midwest and 12 percent higher in the South, but flat in the West and down 2.2 percent in the Northeast.
The housing report unsettled the bond market, which saw the pickup in construction as possibly presaging inflation. With bond prices falling, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.65 percent from 6.62 percent in late trading.
Despite the weakness in the bond market, stocks had a more positive day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.98 points, to 6,308.33.
While economists had discerned nothing in the economic fundamentals to justify a rate increase by the Fed, investors had been keeping a close watch on today's policy meeting anyway because of comments about stock prices made earlier this month by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman.
Mr. Greenspan had questioned whether the steep rise in the stock market was a result of "irrational exuberance." Some analysts had seen the comments by Mr. Greenspan as a warning that he might raise rates, if not immediately then in the long run, to deflate stock prices.
The Fed, as usual, gave no explanation of its decision today. A synopsis of its deliberations will be released after its next monetary policy meeting, which will be held Feb. 4 and 5.
The Fed's last move was to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point in January, leaving the Federal funds target rate for overnight bank lending at 5.25 percent and the discount rate for short-term Fed loans to banks at 5 percent.
Since then the economy has alternately slowed and accelerated, albeit within a relatively narrow range, leaving both Fed officials and the markets off balance and making the search for clues to incipient inflation that much more difficult.
Although some economists believe the economy will slow enough next year that the Fed will feel compelled to reduce rates again to stimulate more growth, the predominant opinion among Fed watchers is that the next move in interest rates, whenever it comes, will be up.
"While we expect inflation to remain low, the risk of rising inflation far outweighs the risk of deflation," Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company, said.
The statistics on housing starts were the latest to indicate that the economy was again picking up momentum. On Monday, the Fed said that industrial output in November increased nine-tenths of 1 percent, its sharpest rise in nine months, and that the capacity utilization rate edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to 83.3 percent. Economists consider an 85 percent capacity utilization rate the point at which factories have trouble keeping up with orders, causing bottlenecks that can set off an upward inflationary spiral.
But analysts said the housing numbers were so strong that they probably represented a brief rebound in construction from a temporary downturn in the previous two months. Another indicator of housing construction, the number of building permits issued, rose a more moderate 3.9 percent in November.
"We don't expect a rise in starts activity at that level again next month," said Paul Taylor, an economist at America's Community Bankers, the trade group for savings and loan institutions.

HEADLINE: Balancing Quantity, Quality and Inflation;
How Should the Price Index Change When Consumers Pay More but Get More?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
As heart bypass operations are perfected, more people have them, extending their lives. But the operations raise health care costs. Is this inflation, as the Government's statisticians contend? Or is it simply fair value for the promise of longer, healthier lives, as a blue-ribbon panel of economists argues?
Or consider what happens when people shift from going out to the movies to bringing videos home. Watching "Independence Day" at the neighborhood theater costs, say, $7 a ticket while the video rental is $3.50, no matter how many people crowd around the television. Both prices have held steady for a while. Is that zero inflation, as the Government says? Or should the Consumer Price Index register a price decline for movies as people shift to a different movie experience that is less costly but comparable in quality, as the economists contend? 
 In the suddenly expanding debate over the accuracy of the C.P.I. -- which is used to set everything from Social Security pensions and union wage increases to individual tax brackets -- questions like these are crucial. Indeed, behind the controversy, which was set off when the Congressionally appointed panel of economists recently released its report, lie two fundamentally different ways of looking at the economy.
The blue-ribbon panel, led by Michael A. Boskin, President George Bush's chief economic adviser, concluded that the C.P.I. exaggerates the rate of inflation by slightly more than one percentage point a year. Defenders of the current way of measuring price changes -- a group that includes representatives of the elderly, labor unions and a number of economists as well -- contend that any error is much smaller.
If little were at stake, most people would be happy to leave it to the experts to argue over a few tenths of a percentage point one way or another. But much is at stake -- each tenth adds or subtracts billions of dollars in Government payments now pegged to the C.P.I. -- and so a struggle has developed for control of the Consumer Price Index.
Today, health care and movies are among the thousands of items purchased by Americans that are cranked into the calculation of America's standard inflation gauge. The C.P.I. essentially measures changes in the prices of a relatively static market basket of goods and services.
But if the measure of inflation is redefined to put more emphasis on what it takes to maintain a given standard of living, then subjective value judgments must play a much bigger role. Higher costs for open-heart surgery, instead of registering as inflation, might instead be counted as a qualitative improvement in the chances of living a better life.
Video rental and theater tickets are listed separately in the C.P.I. But with VCR's in so many homes now, a video today might be judged a reasonably satisfying alternative to a night at the movies. Shouldn't that be reflected somehow as a lower cost to purchase the same living standard?
So the debate intensifies, and as it does, very different views emerge on measuring human well-being.
"I don't think we know how to construct a cost-of-living index that would deal with all of the issues about quality of life to everyone's satisfaction," said Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The bureau, an independent agency within the Labor Department, is the keeper of the Consumer Price Index, calculating each month the price changes for a market basket of 71,000 items. But now the bureau is under pressure from the commission of five economists, appointed by the Senate Finance Committee, to recast the index so that the C.P.I. does more to quantify the values that people attach to what they buy.
"Such values are not chiseled in stone," said Zvi Griliches, a Harvard economist and a commission member. "They are squishy numbers, but they are better than a firm but wrong zero."
Adopting the commission's outlook would change the economic picture drawn by the Consumer Price Index, making American living standards look more solid. The C.P.I. is currently rising at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, but if the panel's estimates are accurate, the annual rate is really closer to 2.1 percent.
The report is already serving as a catalyst for action. With commission members setting the pace, discussions are under way among economists across the country in an attempt to develop a consensus behind reducing the growth rate of the C.P.I. by late next year. Rather than count on the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust its numbers, there is a move afoot, pushed by the Clinton Administration, for Congress to act.
"The bureau is a very important expert in this process," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, "but there are a lot of other experts as well. Congress, in acting, would have to reflect a broad-based agreement among these experts about changes in the C.P.I. that would cause it to better reflect inflation."
If such a consensus emerges, the Administration might back a bill that would leave the C.P.I. unchanged, but -- for purposes of determining Federal benefits and tax brackets -- would subtract four- or five-tenths of a percentage point from each published index figure. The billions of dollars saved would reduce the budget deficit, a goal of both major political parties.
But complicated value judgments must be incorporated into the Consumer Price Index to slice off that initial fraction. Mr. Boskin, now a Stanford professor, argues that the bureau could reach the goal "in the time frame of a year," by "expanding, improving and accelerating" studies it already has under way.
Ms. Abraham is not so sanguine. Although she accepts many of the commission's proposals in principle, she insists on moving cautiously. "There are a lot of issues associated with the measurement of the cost of living that I don't think we will solve in my lifetime," said Ms. Abraham, who is 42.
Her bureau is constantly studying changes, she says, that might make the C.P.I. more of a measure of the cost of maintaining one's standard of living. Changes adopted in the last two years have already reduced the level of the C.P.I. by 0.22 percentage point, she notes. And the bureau is considering others that the Boskin commission would applaud.
The huge market basket of goods on which the C.P.I. is based is to be updated more frequently to reflect shifts in the purchases that Americans actually make. And new products are to be added more quickly. The cell phone is one. It is still not calculated in the national index, although its falling price might dampen the inflation rate. "That was a mistake, not introducing cell phones sooner," Ms. Abraham said.
Still, in other ways, she and her lieutenants are digging in their heels. Shifting the C.P.I. to a standard-of-living index is not the goal, they say, accuracy is, and that rules out what some officials describe as "hip pocket guesswork" in trying to quantify how people value the goods and services they buy.
How, for example, do they feel about renting videos instead of going to the movies? Mr. Griliches, the Harvard economist, acknowledges that the two experiences are not interchangeable for everyone, but they are for enough people to drive down the price of maintaining this particular pleasure.
"I would not argue that the cost fell from the $7 ticket price to the $3.50 movie rental," Mr. Griliches said, "but it wasn't zero either. We are trying to make an estimate and this is where it goes ad hoc. I would try to base it on how many people shifted from one to the other. Or I would do a crude approximation and say half the difference in price is a real decline in the cost of experiences that are similar in quality."
But Patrick Jackman, chief of the division at the bureau that calculates each month's C.P.I., is not swayed. "You can get off cheaper by viewing the movie at home," he said, "but you may not get the same pleasure of an evening out away from the kids in a movie house, which can be a communal experience."
The commission and the bureau differ, too, over Zantac, the heartburn medicine. It is rapidly replacing Tagamet, which many doctors consider less effective. The bureau attributes the higher cost, about 60 cents a pill, to higher quality, not inflation. But the commission would go further, counting it as a price decline on the ground that the quality improvement exceeds the price increase.
Similarly, the bureau undervalues quality improvements in autos, says Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist who was also on the Boskin commission. Too many of the price increases in autos have been attributed to inflation, he says, rather than taking into account that cars are more durable and require less maintenance.
The classic example in this debate is meat versus chicken. Meat prices rise, so people shift to less expensive but nutritionally equal chicken. The C.P.I. registers an increase in inflation, because of the higher meat prices. But the panel calls this a decline in inflation: less cost to maintain the same standard of living. "The Consumer Price Index pretends that people are not free to shift to chicken when that is cheaper, or sweatshirts when sport shirts are too expensive," Mr. Gordon said.
But in judging these shifts, isn't the Boskin commission being too optimistic, often failing to recognize deteriorations in the quality of American life, too? That is the view of Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "If people perceive they are making a switch in response to a rising price," he said, "they can perceive a loss in the quality of their lives that may not be fully picked up by the Boskin commission's recommended price index."
That complicates the puzzle, and the commission recognizes this. To quantify the most difficult value judgments -- representing roughly six-tenths of a percentage point of the 1.1 points that the commission would shave off the C.P.I. -- the panel would establish a separate, parallel index. The second index would deal with such things as crime-fighting, where value judgments require measurements over a period of time.
"If I install a better alarm system," Mr. Griliches said, "that is an improvement in the quality of my life, and therefore a decline in inflation. But if the burglars learn how to trick this alarm system, that is a rise in price, because the quality advantage will be eroded. So one of the issues is that this whole notion of quality, of standard of living, is not a constant."
Such complexities give Ms. Abraham pause. But the panel contends that properly handled, they can be incorporated relatively soon, by means of the second index.
This parallel index would be adjusted, up or down, in hindsight over a one- or two-year period, to deepen understanding of living standards and the economy. The regular C.P.I., tracking each month's changes, cannot be adjusted; too many payments are tied to it.

A blue-ribbon commission of economists says the Consumer Price Index paints a misleading picture of economic life. By failing to account for some improvements in the quality of goods and services, the economists contend, the C.P.I. has overstated the growth in the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points. The panel found fault with how the Government tracks many key components of the C.P.I. and offered its own estimates of how much the inflation rate was overstated: Chart shows estimates by a blue-ribbon commission of economists of how much the inflation rate was overstated for selected goods.

HEADLINE: AS TORCH PASSES, U.N. CHIEF SCOLDS U.S. FOR ARREARS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 17

 BODY:
 Minutes before the General Assembly appointed his successor, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali used a reflective farewell speech today to scold the United States for failing in its obligations to the United Nations.
In an oblique but unmistakable swipe at the country that vetoed his reappointment, faulting him for failing to reform the United Nations bureaucracy, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations lacked the resources to do its job. 
 "It is not the result of mismanagement," he said. "It is the refusal to fulfill a treaty obligation." He was referring to the array of debts to the United Nations, with the largest unpaid balance being that of the United States.
The General Assembly hailed the outgoing leader with a standing ovation, then formally appointed Kofi Annan of the West African country of Ghana as his successor.
Mr. Annan, who will become the seventh Secretary General on Jan. 1, is the first person from sub-Saharan Africa to hold the job and the first career United Nations official to rise through the ranks to the highest office.
In a characteristic speech after his swearing-in, Mr. Annan, 58, dwelt on human themes, referring to economic development issues as affecting "real people with basic needs: food, clothing, shelter and medical care." [Excerpts from speeches, page A8.]
In contrast to the intellectual, analytical remarks of Mr. Boutros-Ghali, Mr. Annan said:
"I intend to stress not only our legal obligations, not only our fiscal limitations, not only our political and diplomatic considerations, but above all, the moral dimension of our work in this organization. In that spirit, let us embark on a time of healing: a healing of fractures and frictions between member states and this organization, which cannot function without their political and material support; and a healing of wounded morale and ideals within the Secretariat, whose dedicated staff deserve our thanks and encouragement."
"Alone I can do nothing," he concluded, after a brief address in English and some French, imploring a badly buffeted United Nations staff and quarreling member nations to get on the same team.
On Thursday, Mr. Annan plans to go home to Ghana for a brief celebratory visit. His 88-year-old mother, Victoria, lives in Accra, the Ghanaian capital. His late father, Henry, a businessman from a prominent family, served as regional Governor of Ashanti Province.
Mr. Annan, who began his education in Africa, has two American degrees, a bachelor's in economics from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., and a master's in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Daniel Abibi, the Congo's representative, spoke for all of the African countries in welcoming Mr. Annan.
"It is night in Africa," he said, "but from Algiers to Cape Town, from Praia to Mombasa, numerous are the Africans of all generations who follow with passion the unfolding of this event at the United Nations in New York. Since Friday, the great news has traversed our deserts, our savannas, our forests. This is a great day for the sons of Africa."
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, 74, an Egyptian diplomat and scholar, recalled in his speech how he had come to office in 1992 amid ambitious plans for a United Nations freed for the first time from the political shackles of the cold war, and how setbacks soon occurred and disillusion set in.
He chided member countries for their failure to deal with the massacres in Rwanda because they had become gun-shy after a bad experience in Somalia and for their refusal to make hard choices and allocate adequate resources for effective action in Bosnia.
In conversations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali shows deep bitterness and frustration at having gone to the Security Council time and time again to ask for a tougher response to fighting in Bosnia, only to be outmaneuvered by minimalist resolutions dictated by Washington, Paris and London, whose Governments and news organizations then blamed him for a failure to keep the peace and save lives.
For example, he requested more than 35,000 troops to protect the Security Council's safe havens in Srebrenica and other cities. He got fewer than 8,000. "The concept of peacekeeping was turned on its head, and worsened by the serious gap between mandates and resources," he said in his speech today.
Clearly addressing the United States, he turned to the organization's financial crisis, saying: "We know what causes it and what is needed to end it. It is not the result of mismanagement. It is the refusal to fulfill a treaty obligation. Now that a new Secretary General is being appointed, all arrears should be paid at once, as has been promised so often in the past few months."
The Clinton Administration, in deciding to veto a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, has said that only with a new leader will there be any hope of getting Congress to pay an overdue debt of about $1.3 billion, more than half of the total bill that the United Nations is owned in regular budget payments and peacekeeping assessments.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali also had pointed words about reform, saying it would occur within the United Nations system only when member governments were able to agree on what they wanted. Finally, he warned of pressures on the Secretary General by powerful nations, not naming the United States, but describing the situation in a way that left no doubt which country he had in mind.
"If one word above all is to characterize the role of the Secretary General, it is independence," he said. "The holder of this office must never be seen as acting out of fear or in an attempt to curry favor with one state or group of states. Should that happen, all prospects for the United Nations would be lost."
Before the day was over, Mr. Annan had announced a transition team to take over from Mr. Boutros-Ghali's cabinet. Most of the faces are familiar, drawn from Mr. Annan's close-knit colleagues in the peacekeeping department, where he served as Under Secretary General.
The team will be headed by Iqbal Riza, a Pakistani who is now the United Nations representative in Bosnia. Gillian Martin Sorensen, who was Mr. Boutros-Ghali's public affairs consultant during the 50th anniversary year, and Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for peacekeeping operations, will handle public relations.
On Monday, Sylvana Foa, whom Mr. Boutros-Ghali appointed spokesman for the United Nations last year, said she would leave at the end of this month.
Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru was present at today's Assembly sesssion, seated next to Mr. Boutros-Ghali's wife, Leia. Kurt Waldheim of Austria, the other living former Secretary General, has been barred from the United States because of documents linking him to war crimes during his service in the German Army during World War II.

HEADLINE: Clinton Made Political Appointments to Panel

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton expanded an advisory panel on trade with Pacific nations earlier this year so that it could include several political appointees, including an Arkansas businessman who several months later orchestrated more than $639,000 in questionable donations to the President's legal defense fund.
The name of the businessman, Charles Yah Lin Trie, was a last-minute addition to the list of commission members assembled by the White House last November. Four months later, Mr. Trie, who runs a small trading company called Daihatsu International, delivered the first batch of checks and money orders at the office of the Washington lawyer who directs the legal trust fund. Lawyers for the fund said the money raised by Mr. Trie has been returned because of questions about its origin. 
 When the White House office of personnel issued its final list of the committee's members and distributed it inside the Administration on Nov. 27, 1995, Mr. Trie's name appeared with the boldface notation: "Supported by White House. Democrat-Ar." Several people familiar with the compilation of the list, which took place over months, said Mr. Trie's name appeared for the first time just a few weeks before the final list was settled upon.
"This just showed up from the White House," one official involved in the process said today. "We had no idea who this guy was."
Soon after Mr. Trie's name was included on the internal list, several officials noticed that the White House had exceeded the limit of 15 members who could be appointed to the Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy. So on Jan. 31, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12987, a one-paragraph declaration that increased the size of the commission to "up to 20" members.
Mr. Trie has not been a very active member of the commission, which is preparing to issue its final report.
Another committee member, Ron Sims, now the county executive of King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, recalled today that he had seen Mr. Trie "once or twice" since the committee began actively meeting at mid-year.
Mr. Trie did not say much at those meetings, other members said, and his attendance has fallen off sharply in recent months.
The commission was created by Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat with a long interest in the United States' challenges in trading with Asia. Mr. Bingaman included language authorizing the commission in the bills that approved the worldwide trade accord that created the World Trade Organization.
But it took most of last year for the White House to organize the commission, and the appointment of the chairman, Kenneth Brody, a former head of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, was not announced until April 1996. The panel is charged with reporting to Mr. Clinton on steps the United States could take to "achieve a significant opening of Japan, China and other Asian and Pacific markets to U.S. business."
"I can't shed any light on the essential question of how the members were appointed," Mr. Bingaman said today from Santa Fe, N.M. "We made recommendations about who the members should be. I was happy that some we recommended were chosen. But I did not know some of the members, including Mr. Trie."
The commission is a curious mixture of academics, business executives and former officials with considerable knowledge of Asia and its markets, and some who appear to have only a cursory familiarity with those issues. Several officials involved in the group's creation expressed frustration over the last few months that the White House had included several political appointees in place of academics and others.
But commission members say dissatisfaction with an early draft of the final report has now been largely resolved.
The internal White House list, for example, includes the appointment of Jason Berman, the chairman of the Recording Industry Association and an active Democrat, with the notation "replaced Chalmers Johnson." Professor Johnson is the author of one of the leading studies of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but has also been highly critical of the Administration's trade policy.
Other commission members include Morton Bahr, the president of the Communication Workers of America, and Jack Tai, the former manager of J. P. Morgan Asia. The vice chairman is Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute, who served in the Commerce Department in the Reagan Administration.
Some officials suggested today that Mr. Trie might have hoped that his title as a member of a Presidential advisory commission could aid his status in Asia, where he has been trying to close several business deals.

HEADLINE: An Underdog Victor Savors the Limelight

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Wherever she goes now, from a shopping mall in California to an orientation for Congressional freshmen at Harvard, Representative-elect Loretta Sanchez encounters strangers who suddenly declare, "Thank you!" as if she had stamped out a social disorder.
What she actually did was score the most unexpected upset in the recent Congressional elections. As an absolute political unknown, she defeated Representative Robert K. Dornan, the aggressive California Republican known for his attacks on President Clinton, homosexuals and lesbians, and assorted other targets of his bare-knuckle commentary. 
 "Absolutely everywhere -- at the airport, in D.C. when I'm meeting legislators, back home at the mall -- they keep coming up, saying things like, 'Just thank you for what you did,' " Ms. Sanchez said.
The 36-year-old financial management consultant smiled as she tried to adjust to her sudden place in Washington political lore as Nemesis of the Mouth of the House: the silencer of the lawmaker who called the President "a sleazeball who can't keep his pants on," of the merciless orator who once outed a gay colleague on the House floor by berating him as having "a revolving door on his closet."
"Beating Bob Dornan has caught the attention of the people," Ms. Sanchez said with obvious satisfaction, having survived her own barrage of Dornan denunciation as a champion of homosexuals, a carpetbagger in her hometown and a "Catholic for abortion and sodomy rights."
She is a daughter of Mexican immigrants, a fiscally conservative Democrat who switched parties four years ago when, she said, she sensed anti-immigrant, anti-woman strategems emerging among Republicans. Even so, her door-to-door campaign against Mr. Dornan emphasized jobs and education more than his signature issues of opposition to abortion and homosexual rights.
Not that Mr. Dornan concedes he has been beaten.
The nine-term Congressman who garrulously ran for two offices this year, the Presidency and Congress, continues to deny Ms. Sanchez's 1,002-vote victory margin. With a recount strategy and a new round of fund-raising advertisements, he is accusing the opposition of having used illegal aliens to pack ballot boxes in the heavily Hispanic district. His cry of fraud includes assertions that pro-Sandinista communist interlopers organized motivation "troops" to prod Sanchez voters forth in low-turnout areas.
"Despite what the liberal media is telling you, Dornan has not lost yet," Mr. Dornan, an accomplished broadcaster who fills in for Rush Limbaugh, declared in one recent advertisement seeking a fresh infusion of contributions.
Thus Ms. Sanchez, while eager to get established here as the new, less confrontational voice of her constituents, has had to start raising more money to defend her victory even before she can savor it fully.
"He can raise as much as he wants, with no limits, no disclosure," she said, a newcomer sounding startled by the fund-raising laws of politics. "I have to hire lawyers and monitors to watch him."
Perhaps the crucial fact according to all the territorial laws of politics is that the Republican leadership is not keeping an office vacant for Mr. Dornan pending his challenge. In his lingering appetite for combat, Mr. Dornan is asserting in an advertisement that Ms. Sanchez's husband, Stephen S. Brixey 3d, "was arrested for destroying dozens of Bob Dornan's campaign posters."
Actually, the Congresswoman-elect said, her husband, a securities trader, was subjected to an unusual "citizen's arrest" by one of Mr. Dornan's grown sons who, she said, had been following him as he put up pro-Sanchez posters.
The contest's forced postscript only makes victory sweeter for the Sanchez campaign. Party professionals are reappraising the Hispanic businesswoman who came from nowhere to wrest the nomination from her own party machine by defeating two better-known, better-financed candidates in a primary in the blue-collar, suburban 46th Congressional District of Southern California.
"We recognized Dornan was vulnerable as an ineffective Congressman and not just as a crazy yahoo spewing right-wing extremism," said John Shallman, the 32-year-old director of the Sanchez campaign.
"The only thing better than beating Bob Dornan once is beating him a second time," Mr. Shallman added, contending that the recount campaign was mainly Mr. Dornan's effort to "maintain a public platform."
Ms. Sanchez is intent on rapidly reducing the Dornan legend to a memory, not extending his reputation for conflict.
"I went out every day door to door to beat this guy, discussing issues that unite people, not divide them," she said, citing district concerns about employment, education and crime as well as Mr. Dornan's votes against gun controls and a raise in the minimum wage. "I found people worrying about putting food on the table and whether their children are learning in school and will have a better future. Abortion, gay rights -- that really doesn't impact them on a day-to-day basis."
She ran as a hometown professional, one of seven children put through college by immigrant parents.
"I am a Head Start child," she emphasized, delighted now to have been appointed to the House committee on economic and educational opportunities.
As a candidate, she used her insurgent's status to stress her lack of "big money" support, although Mr. Dornan's attacks on homosexuals eventually sparked a fund-raising event sponsored by two lovers of incumbent Congressmen he had attacked. This led to a "gay caballeros" photo being brandished by anti-Sanchez supporters, with no evident effect among voters.
"What's relevant is that being virulently anti-gay didn't stop Dornan from losing," said Representative Barney Frank, a homosexual Massachusetts Democrat often attacked by Mr. Dornan and glad to bid good riddance to him from the Capitol.
In victory, Ms. Sanchez now finds she is a "sort of curiosity for the nation," particularly in doing what so many white male candidates had not been able to.
"But the news stories tend to say I won because I'm Latina or because Bob Dornan was extreme -- not because I was strategic or smart," she said, sensing that the upset will only cause fresh impetus to prove herself.
"I'm respected in my industry; I put together business deals for a living," emphasized the freshman, who sought public office only one other time, for a seat on the Anaheim City Council in 1994, and lost.
In that campaign, she ran under her married name, Loretta Sanchez Brixey, but not this time in the district that is one-third Hispanic.
"Dornan called me an Hispanic pretender," she said. "But this time people realized it was me, Loretta Sanchez, who lived there 30 years."
Ms. Sanchez is vowing to commute cross-country to her district every weekend.
"I ran to better my hometown," she said. "I didn't run to be the woman who beat Bob Dornan. I ran for love, not hate."

HEADLINE: Society, Not Science, Owns the Worry Gene

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "What, Me Not Worry?" (Op-Ed, Dec. 13), Adam Phillips calls genetics a "Supreme Fiction" and compares it to Marxist economics and Freudian psychology. Mr. Phillips concludes, after noting that a recent scientific report suggested that genetic makeup might affect one's tendency to worry: "If we can lop off the worry gene, what else might go with it? People without worries are people without self-doubt. And we know what people are capable of in states of ultimate conviction."
Mr. Phillips is confusing the pursuit of science with its application. The goal of science is to seek knowledge. It is the role of society to determine how that knowledge is applied. The "worry gene" is used by Mr. Phillips as a straw man to argue against scientific discovery. 
 We know of no scientist advocating genetic manipulation to insure a worry-free population. In fact, scientists themselves worry considerably, sometimes to great effect. Furthermore, Mr. Phillips's concept of a "worry gene" is highly misleading: even if genes can affect worry, such a finding would not imply that worry is determined simply by genes.
The answer to Mr. Phillips' worry is simple: It is the job of scientists to help us understand our world, and ourselves; it is the job of all of us to insure appropriate application of this knowledge.

HEADLINE: Bacall Still Walks and, Especially, Talks

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Dec. 18

 BODY:
She's 72, still glamorous and feisty, and looking for work.
"Suddenly I've finished three pictures, can you imagine?" said Lauren Bacall with a soft laugh. "But now I'm unemployed. I mean, I've had a lot of dry years. So these pictures will, I hope, bring attention to the fact that I am around, breathing, walking and talking at the same time." 
 She shrugged. "Whoever said it would be easy?"
Ms. Bacall lives in Manhattan but was visiting Los Angeles to promote her movies. One of them is "A Mirror Has Two Faces," in which she plays the vain and haughty mother of Barbra Streisand, who also directed. "I didn't always agree with her, but she's a good director, she helped me, and that's what a director is supposed to do," said Ms. Bacall.
She is in "My Fellow Americans," a comedy about two ex-Presidents, played by Jack Lemmon and James Garner, which opens tomorrow. "Frankly, I don't have much of a part in that, but I play Jack's wife, which is the reason I wanted to do it," she said. Then there is a French film, "Le Jour et Le Nuit," scheduled for release early in 1997.
"I'm a mystery woman in that one," she said, rolling her eyes.
Seated in a room at the Bel Air Hotel, less than a mile from the house in which she lived for years with Humphrey Bogart, Ms. Bacall talked about her career and life with the kind of candor that one somehow expects of an actress whose earliest role, in "To Have and Have Not" in 1944, stamped her image of sultriness and tough sophistication.
"I've managed O.K.," said Ms. Bacall, sipping a cup of tea. "I have no beefs. I've been lucky."
She has always been blunt. "I was brought up that way, except when I didn't tell Howard Hawks I was Jewish, because he was anti-Semitic and scared the hell out of me," said Ms. Bacall, referring to the director who discovered her. "He made me so nervous so I didn't say anything. I was cowardly, I must say. I was not proud of myself."
Ms. Bacall said she did not see herself as especially confident ("I've been scared all my life") or beautiful. "People think I'm a woman in control, or that I'm this glamorous creature that can only be cast in parts that are glamorous or grand or chic or whatever," she said. "It's not where my head is at all. I've never been crazy about my looks. I mean, I look the way I look, and there's not a hell of a lot I can do about that."
Ms. Bacall does not view her film career as especially successful, either. At 19 she was on the cover of Harper's Bazaar. At 20 she starred with Bogart in "To Have and Have Not." Shortly after that, they were married.
"I've had a lousy career in many ways," she said. "Very sparse, very up and down, in and out. I've had a lot of years when nobody offered me anything. But because I have a tremendous will, I've been able to continue."
In "To Have and Have Not" her smoky voice and beauty made her a star. "It was out of all proportion to any reality," she said. "I was this brilliant, wonderful, funny, sexy genius. Can you imagine? And then Jack Warner, who was not a creative genius, made me do this second movie called 'Confidential Agent,' in which I was cast as an English girl. Directed by Herman Shumlin, who was no help. It was the worst movie, a nightmare, and I was terrible in it. And as quickly as I had been placed on a pedestal, I fell off. My career was all but over. It took me years to kind of claw my way back again."
Had she not married Bogart, Ms. Bacall said, her career would probably have flourished. Not that she regretted the marriage. "I would not have had a better life, but a better career," she said.
"Howard Hawks was like a Svengali, he was molding me the way he wanted. I was his creation, and I would have had a great career had he been in control of it. But the minute Bogey was around, Hawks knew he couldn't control me, so he sold my contract to Warner Brothers. And that was the end. Hawks wanted to control me, and I think he may have had other things in mind, too. He thought I was a cute little thing." She laughed.
Bogart died of cancer in 1957, and she moved to New York the following year. "I had no life here," she said of Los Angeles. "To be a woman alone in this town is not a happy situation. It was an unnurturing atmosphere out here. My career was not thriving. I was just dismissed. I had my mother and relatives in New York, and I needed them."
Ms. Bacall won two Tony awards for her Broadway musical performances in "Applause" and "Woman of the Year." She also starred on Broadway in "Cactus Flower" and "Goodbye Charlie," and has appeared in London and Australia in "Sweet Bird of Youth." She has written two books, "Lauren Bacall by Myself" (Ballantine) a 1979 autobiography that won a National Book Award, and "Now" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994), a memoir of her later life. Recently, she has earned money lecturing to women's groups and appearing in television commercials for Carnival Cruise Lines.
After moving to New York, Ms. Bacall married and divorced the actor Jason Robards Jr. She has three children: Steven Bogart, a television producer; Leslie Bogart, a yoga teacher, and Sam Robards, an actor.
Ms. Bacall said she hoped that her current spate of film roles would lead to more parts. But she seemed to have few illusions about acting or jobs or just about anything else.
"If they don't know me by now, or don't want to use me, I mean, forget it," she said with a shrug. "You just learn to cope with whatever you have to cope with. I spent my childhood in New York, riding on subways and buses. And you know what you learn if you're a New Yorker? The world doesn't owe you a damn thing."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Politicized trade law: helping companies avoid market forces.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF free market economists wrote their own fair trade law from scratch, the little known Antidumping Act of 1916 would not be a bad model. The law, which is still on the books, provides antitrust protection against predatory pricing by foreigners, sanctioning importers who sell at low prices in America with the intent of putting American competitors out of business.
But free market types are hardly applauding a lawsuit brought by Geneva Steel of Utah contending that two importers of steel from Russia, China and Ukraine are violating the 1916 law. The still-murky tale, as first told in The Rushford Report, a newsletter on international trade published in Washington, makes all too clear that in the highly politicized world of trade, the game is to use the law to circumvent market forces -- not reinforce them. "The 1916 act could prove to be a great way to beat competitors into submission," cautions Ron Cass, a former member of the United States International Trade Commission who is now dean of Boston University's School of Law. 
 When Ford and General Motors duel for sales, virtually anything goes. But the Tariff Act of 1930 (updated numerous times since) sets a different standard for, say, Toyota or Volkswagen. Foreigners are not permitted to sell below cost in the American market, an act defined as "dumping." And with the Commerce Department acting as judge and jury in antidumping cases, domestic producers can count on a friend in high places. The department has used creative accounting to assess huge penalties against everything from Colombian roses to Chinese honey to bomb-grade Russian uranium.
By contrast, the 1916 act is a model of equal justice. Federal courts, not the flag wavers at the Commerce Department, administer it. And to win a case, notes Patrick McCrory, a trade lawyer in Washington, a plaintiff "must prove an intention of seriously injuring or destroying a U.S. industry" -- a standard so tough that it has never been met.
In 1983, the last time anyone tried, Zenith's case against Matsushita and other Japanese television makers was tossed out by the Supreme Court. The Court, in effect, demanded that Zenith offer a plausible explanation how the Japanese would be able to recoup their losses from low-ball pricing, once they drove Zenith into bankruptcy. Since plenty of other producers were likely to enter the television market if prices went up, the Court decided that predation was a nonstarter.
Geneva Steel, a 1987 spinoff from USX that has been losing money despite heavy investments in modernization, is following the tried-and-true antidumping route. The company is asking the Commerce Department to penalize steel from the offending exporters with tariffs ranging from 33 to 274 percent of the selling price. But it has piqued the curiosity of trade and antitrust specialists by also invoking the 1916 act against the two companies -- Ranger Steel Supply and Thyssen Steel -- that actually imported the metal.
Geneva's prospects of winning are apparently small. "It's absurd to imagine they can prove predatory intent," when dozens of producers, domestic and foreign, are ready to fill the market niche left by Geneva, argues Alfred E. Kahn, a former adviser to President Jimmy Carter on economic regulation. Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, is even less diplomatic: "It's Loony Tunes," he concludes.
What, then, is going on here? One plausible motive is intimidation. If the case gets as far as a jury in Geneva's home state of Utah, anything is possible -- including a verdict that costs the defendants $100 million or more. Indeed, while Ranger's lawyer, Butch Armsteadt of O'Melvany & Meyers, insists Ranger has no intention of yielding, he concedes that his client is "betting the company" in contesting rather than settling the case.
Nicholas Tolerico, executive vice president at Thyssen (a German company with much deeper pockets than Ranger), has a different theory. He speculates that Geneva is hoping the courts will lower the standard of proof of intent, making it unnecessary for plaintiffs to show how importers could eventually recoup their losses from predatory pricing. Should Geneva fail in court, he expects the company to ask Congress to make the 1916 act more user-friendly. After all, the argument goes, if the law does not shield American producers from foreign competition, it must not be working.
The real story here is how the antidumping laws have evolved from an extension of antitrust to a politicized weapon of special interests. The change is easy to understand: no longer protected by heavy tariffs or America's unchallenged technological dominance, domestic producers have looked for subtler barriers to imports. But the fact that consumers' interests in low prices have so little weight in the political equation is not easily forgivable.

HEADLINE: Boys Choir Is Scrambling, Again

BYLINE: By IRA ROSENBLUM 

 BODY:
It has sung before presidents and diplomats, at the United Nations, the Statue of Liberty and the 1992 World's Fair in Spain. Despite its high profile, however, the 28-year-old Boys Choir of Harlem has frequently had to scramble for money, and now, according to its director, faces a financial crisis that threatens to drastically diminish its voice.
Walter J. Turnbull, the choir's founder and director, said that if the organization did not raise half a million dollars to cover a shortfall in its budget, many of the tutoring and counseling programs offered at its school, the Choir Academy of Harlem, would be jeopardized. 
 "People don't realize that we are about much more than singing," Mr. Turnbull said in an interview at the school on East 127th Street last week. "What we're really doing is trying to save lives."
Most people think of the Boys Choir of Harlem as the 40 who make up the performing choir, he said, the one that is appearing Saturday at 3 P.M. at Avery Fisher Hall with members of the New York Philharmonic. In fact, the performing group, which gives some 120 concerts a year around the world, is one of seven training and concert choirs which are part of the daily curriculum for the 563 pupils -- boys and girls -- who study at the academy. Seventy-five percent of them come from single-parent households headed by women, many with incomes below poverty level. Some have parents with drug or alcohol problems. Mr. Turnbull said the tutoring and counseling services helped keep the students in class and off the streets.
The choir will continue to perform, he said. But without adequate counseling programs, its quality will be compromised, he added, since it will be harder to keep students interested in staying in school.
Though this is not the first time the choir has had financial problems, Mr. Turnbull said, the outlook had never seemed so grim. He cited cutbacks in state financing, cancellation of a French tour and a general ebb in corporate and foundation donations. Adding to the predicament, he said, "we have no endowment of note, no long-term security."
"When it comes to raising money, every year it's like starting from scratch," he said.
Less than half the choir's annual budget of $3.2 million is covered by receipts from its concerts and album sales. The rest comes from donations. In addition to counseling programs, which cost about $600,000 a year, the school spends about $1 million on music teachers, instruments and the music library, and $800,000 on tutors, computers, curriculum development and other academic services. The remainder of the budget is for administrative, fund-raising and other expenses. The pupils pay no tuition.
Horace H. Turnbull, who is in charge of operations and programs and is Walter Turnbull's brother, said that the choir just received a challenge grant of $250,000 from the Christian A. Johnson Endeavor Foundation; the foundation will match every dollar received. But the deadline for raising the money is Dec. 31. To date, he said, the choir has verbal commitments of about $100,000. "But until the checks come, there are no guarantees," he added.
Past corporate donors have included Citicorp, Time Warner, Xerox, I.B.M. and A.T.&T. The Texaco Foundation, a supporter since 1991, has promised the choir $80,000. When asked if he had any second thoughts about accepting money from Texaco after the recent charges of racial discrimination brought against some of the company's top executives, Mr. Turnbull emphatically answered "no."
"Texaco has been a friend of ours for years," said Mr. Turnbull, whose choir is mostly made up of black children. "Why should I look at everyone in Texaco as bad because you have an individual or individuals with an opinion that I find appalling? I can't paint everyone with the same broad brush. If I were to do that, it would teach the kids that nobody is worth anything."
The program on Saturday reflects the choir's versatility, with some Schubert, some Duke Ellington, some gospel. "We encompass all the music that is important to African-Americans," Walter Turnbull said, noting that the choir regularly commissions works from black composers.
A performing tenor himself, the 52-year-old Mr. Turnbull established the Boys Choir of Harlem in 1968 when he was a doctoral student at the Manhattan School of Music. Back then it was a small group of 20 based at the Ephesus Seventh Day Adventist Church in central Harlem. He said he never dreamed it would gain such renown. In addition to live performances throughout the United States, Europe and Asia, the choir has recorded the soundtracks for the movies "Glory" and "Malcolm X," had its own show on Broadway in 1993 and was the subject of an Emmy-award-winning documentary, "From Harlem to Haarlem: The Story of a Choirboy." It even has its own imprint, 127th Street Records, the result of a venture with the Unencumbered Entertainment Group.
But the choir's renown has its down side, Mr. Turnbull said. "People see 40 kids onstage who are poised, sounding good, looking good. So they think that everything is O.K., that we must have plenty of money."
Since 1993, through a special arrangement with the Board of Education, the Choir Academy of Harlem has been housed in a three-story school building at Madison Avenue and 127th Street surrounded by boarded-up tenements. Its 563 students range in age from 8 to 18. About 1,500 New York City children audition each year, hoping to be among the 100 who are accepted into the school, which encompasses grades 4 through 12. Members of the first graduating class received their diplomas last spring.
But the building is ill-equipped as a music school, Horace Turnbull said. The auditorium needs renovation. Better rehearsal spaces are needed for the seven choirs. There is no music-listening room. The list goes on. "We are so busy living day to day that we barely have time to work on the long-range plans," he said. Those include a dormitory, so that the school can accept children from other cities, and the establishment of a technology-learning center, with up-to-date computer equipment.
Dana Rogers, 15, and a choir member for four years, said that were it not for the academy, he might be out on the streets "doing things I have no business doing." He said the choir "teaches us how to be disciplined and well-trained, and that's what we're going to need in the real world if we want to survive."
Most members do more than just survive. Over the years, 98 percent have graduated from high school, Walter Turnbull said, an impressive statistic considering that more than half the neighborhood's teen-agers are high school dropouts. Many choir members have gone on to college, becoming doctors, lawyers and other professionals. Some have continued in music, as singers or teachers.
Whatever profession they ultimately choose, Mr. Turnbull said he hoped his students learned to be "solid citizens of the community." If they maintain a passion for music, so much the better.
For one alumnus, that has been the case. "Music is a great challenge; life is a challenge," said 29-year-old Gilbert Robinson, who now works on the school's counseling staff. "That's what we try to instill in the kids. If you can learn to do music, you can learn to do life."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Mark, But Falls vs. Yen and Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the mark yesterday after German money supply data suggested to traders that the Bundesbank would have room to lower interest rates. But the dollar fell against the yen and pound.
An unexpectedly large monthly rise in Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus pushed the dollar lower against the yen. In Britain, strong economic news increased speculation that interest rates there would soon rise, which helped start a broad rally in the pound. 
Traders said volume was light, exaggerating currency movements.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5518 marks from 1.5496 marks on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 113.69 yen from 113.88 yen. The pound rose to $1.6748 from $1.6706.
Some traders focused on the news that Germany's broadest measure of the money supply, known as M-3, fell to an 8 percent growth rate in November from 8.4 percent in October, a sign of diminished inflationary pressure in the German economy.
The data suggested the Bundesbank's central committee, which meets Thursday for the last time in 1996, might nudge short-term interest rates lower to stimulate economic growth. Lower rates hurt the mark.
"This gave room for people to speculate they would lower rates," said Roger Chapin, foreign-exchange director at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio. "It certainly gives the Bundesbank the ability to lower rates."
Others said they doubted the Bundesbank would lower rates, partly because the central bank said on Tuesday in a monthly report that rates and the mark's value were at appropriate levels. But they did not rule it out.
"It does increase the probability of a rate cut, even though it's probably not going to happen," said Robert Nelson, managing director of foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landes Bank in New York. Nonetheless, he said, "you can't predict what the Bundesbank will do."
The dollar also indirectly derived strength against the mark from the German currency's weakness against the pound, which strengthened after the British Government said retail sales surged in November and unemployment dropped by the largest monthly amount in 25 years.

HEADLINE: U.N. Says Iraq May Be Hiding More Missiles Than Suspected

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The leader of a United Nations team in charge of destroying Iraqi weapons told the Security Council today that he believes Baghdad may be hiding more operational missiles than monitors had suspected.
Until recently, inspectors had concluded that there might be as many as 16 Iraqi missiles unaccounted for. That number is now thought to be as high as 18 to 25 missiles. 
 "If they are operational, that's a missile force," a diplomat said in response to a report to the council by Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the special commission charged with disarming Iraq. He raised questions about whether President Saddam Hussein, who apparently continues to conceal biological, chemical and possibly nuclear components, may pose renewed threats to his neighbors.
The Iraqis appear to have removed key parts from missiles they said they had destroyed and buried as early as 1991, when the Persian Gulf war ended, Mr. Ekeus said.
Inspectors excavating sites where Iraq says missiles were buried after being crushed, have found two new, disturbing pieces of evidence, diplomats said. One is that turbo pumps had been removed from some missiles before they were destroyed.
Last year, Mr. Ekeus found that Iraq, which is still under an international embargo, had been trying to import gyroscopes. Turbo pumps and gyroscopes are two key missile pieces Iraq does not manufacture.
A shipment of Russian-made gyroscopes, apparently bought on the black market, was intercepted by Jordan. Based on a tip, Mr. Ekeus then called in divers who found other gyroscopes at the bottom of the Tigris canal in Baghdad, where they had been jettisoned.
The other major find was that not all of the missiles crushed and buried were from armories. Some seemed to have been training missiles placed there to dupe arms monitors.
Mr. Ekeus asked Iraq to allow him to remove some excavated weapons and send them abroad for examination. His request was rejected, with the vague promise that the issue could be reopened next year.
Mr. Ekeus has written to Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister and leading negotiator with the United Nations, to tell him that the latest disclosures indicate that Iraq is in violation of its 1991 cease-fire agreement, which set up the weapons destruction and inspection system.
Security Council members, led by the United States and Britain, have been eager to impress on President Hussein that economic sanctions will not be lifted until Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction and met other conditions.
Although Iraq has resumed limited oil sales under United Nations control, Security Council members emphasize that the plan to allow $2 billion of oil sales over six months is not the beginning of lifting sanctions.

HEADLINE: Calm Seas Roil Currency Markets;
Trading Ebbs as Technology Advances, Costing Jobs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
In the rough-and-tumble world of foreign exchange trading, where $1.2 trillion changes hands every day, Matthew S. Lifson fought his way through a string of small banks all the way to the big show -- a job at the Chase Manhattan Bank and the presidency of Forex USA, the industry association.
Mr. Lifson was no star, but he was solid, trading secondary currencies and dealing with smaller American banks. Then, on Aug. 20, his boss asked the Brooklyn College graduate to cancel a trip to Ohio. The next day, Mr. Lifson and three colleagues were laid off. That put him in the awkward role of being host for a Pan American foreign exchange conference in Washington in October and listening to predictions that by 2000, half of the traders in the business would be gone. 
 "It's a shame, but it is a factor of the market," Mr. Lifson said stoically.
The 43-year-old Mr. Lifson, and many traders like him are caught up not in the turmoil that used to be associated with the foreign exchange market, but in an eerie calm that has descended on it, at least for now.
Gone are the roller-coaster rides the dollar took for two decades on its way to record highs in 1985 and back down to record lows since. Gone too is the speculative fever that enabled the financier George Soros to make $1 billion in a single day in 1992 by betting against the British pound.
This lack of volatility -- driven by the narrowing of inflation rates around the globe, the end of the cold war and fast- approaching European monetary union -- is eating into banks' foreign exchange profits, spurring layoffs and forcing institutions to rethink their roles in the market.
As if that were not enough for traders to deal with, new technology has taken over a lot of the work they once did. Banks have embarked on margers and cost-cutting drives that further reduce their ranks. The convergence of these forces, so soon after the alluring profits of the early 1990's attracted new players to the market, "has shaken up the industry," said Guy Whittaker, global head of foreign exchange at Citibank, the world's No. 1 currency trader.
"The foreign exchange markets had some extremely profitable years in 1992 and 1993," Mr. Whittaker recalled, "and as a result of that new people came in thinking that was part of a brand-new, long-term sustainable position."
But it was not, particularly for business in New York, which lacks the London market's advantage of overlapping with trading in Tokyo and New York. The Big Apple's 16 percent share of the worldwide foreign exchange business has not grown since 1989, while London controls nearly one-third of the trading and its portion is rising, according to the latest survey by the Bank for International Settlements.
As a result, said James H. Hohorst, head of global trading at American Express Bank, "people are re-evaluating what they have dedicated to foreign exchange"
While nobody compiles figures on the industry's overall profits, Mr. Whittaker estimates they have declined in recent years, adding that Citibank's profits "are a little less this year." Although not a direct proxy for profits, foreign exchange revenue is down this year at many banks, including a drop of 27 percent at Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, and a slide of 18 percent at Chase Manhattan.
"The trend is in the numbers and the numbers are bad -- a downward trend in revenue," said Peter M. Mesrobian, head of global foreign exchange at First Chicago NBD Corporation, who laid off 25 traders in London and Chicago in October -- nearly 25 percent of the total.
To be sure, what is bad news for the banks is good news for the multinational corporations, trading companies, financial institutions and other customers that have to spend less on the currency trading and hedging that come with any kind of business abroad.
But the retrenchment has set off a race among the top banks in the business to corral an even greater share of the action. It has also forced a struggle for survival by second- and third-tier players. Bankers are reluctant to throw in the towel, because even with lower profits, the foreign exchange business remains an important component of any bank with global aspirations.
"I've got to reinvent my business," said Jamie K. Thorsen, the global head of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal. She reduced her staff by 7 percent this year in a reorganization of the bank's trading operations in Toronto and Chicago. "New technology has allowed us to shrink, and to have critical mass at the same time," she said.
No longer is it enough, she said, for a foreign exchange desk to try to make money on the ups and downs in the currency markets. Traders will have to continually upgrade their skills and be able to handle products that are important to a customer's business, like options and other derivatives. "The skill needed to be a foreign exchange trader is being elevated," Ms Thorsen said. "The people who were successful 10 years ago may not be successful now."
Strategy is also changing at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York. It now contracts out the trading it used to do with its own capital, enabling the company -- a unit of the First Empire State Corporation -- to cut its dealer ranks to three from seven.
The signs of the consolidation are everywhere.
Britain's HSBC Midland, one of the top foreign exchange operations, suddenly retreated this fall from its effort to build a major trading operation in New York. The man brought in to do the building, David S. Ogg, was let go less than a year and a half after his arrival from Lehman Brothers and more than 50 traders and support staff went with him.
"You've got to know what your business is because the day of trying to do everything is gone," said Anthony F. Rademeyer, treasurer Americas for HSBC Midland. That means using new technology to consolidate most of the bank's trading in London and leaving New York's emphasis on dealing with customers.
The Nationsbank Corporation, the fast-expanding American bank, has abandoned its effort to be a force in foreign exchange, laying off traders in London and Singapore.
CS Holding's Credit Suisse, which had made major hires to beef up its trading operations, is now merging them with those of CS First Boston, resulting in about 15 layoffs. Lehman Brothers has gotten out of most of its daily spot-trading business. Citibank has significantly reduced the number of its trading rooms and traders. And Chase Manhattan is scaling back its foreign-exchange operations in the wake of its mega-merger with Chemical Bank.
While precise statistics are not available, people in the industry estimate that the total number of traders has declined by 7 percent to 10 percent this year. And for the employed, salaries are coming down. Several managers said that they could now hire a talented trader for 30 percent less than several years ago.
Like sailors, traders do not like windless seas, and many of them yearn for the good old days of tempests and tidal waves. "Volatility has a very high correlation with profits," said Kenneth P. Gettinger, managing director for foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
Citibank notes this problem in describing the fall in its trading revenue in this year's third quarter, compared with 1995, "when volatile foreign exchange markets provided substantial revenue opportunities."
Market volatility could recede even further as the 15 nations of the European Union move toward the creation of a common currency by 1999. Chase Manhattan said its decline in foreign-exchange revenue in the first nine months of this year was caused in part "by the decrease in the level of cross-currency trading activity in the European markets in anticipation of the integration of the European Monetary System."
And prospects for the profession are, if anything, likely to get bleaker, because computers have become adept at doing things people used to do.
An entire class of traders known as voice brokers, for example, risks getting wiped out by an electronic substitute. Currency trading rooms are dotted with speakers that pipe in an unending stream of bid and offer quotes barked out by specialists distributing prices anonymously for their customers.
But two electronic brokering systems, one devised by a consortium of major foreign exchange banks called the EBS Partnership, and the other by Reuters Holdings P.L.C. of Britain, have invaded their turf, snapping up 29 percent of all spot voice-brokering business in three years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's 1995 foreign exchange market survey.
And to the surprise of the industry, the impact has gone beyond the voice brokering business. Banks that used to trade directly with each other have begun using the machines to make deals, enabling them to reduce their staffs further.
In the case of Mr. Lifson, the Chase Manhattan trader laid off in August, his regional desk began to lose business because the smaller banks it dealt with could use the electronic brokering systems instead of calling the bigger banks for prices. "I could see the business slowing down," Mr. Lifson said.
New technology has also had the perverse effect of cutting into banks' trading profits because the wider circulation of price quotes tends to reduce the gap between bid and offer prices.
In the scramble to adapt and survive, foreign exchange managers say they are focusing more on their customers. "How do I distinguish myself from the machine?" asked one foreign exchange executive at Chase Manhattan. "We have to focus on value-added services. We have to become better at things like research and the trading of exotic currencies" like the Polish zloty, Slovenian tolar and Indonesian rupiah.
Not everybody is cutting back. Goldman, Sachs & Company and Union Bank of Switzerland, among others, are taking advantage of the layoffs at competing banks and securities firms to hire seasoned traders. Mr. Gettinger at U.B.S. thinks that currency markets will come alive again and offer lots of new opportunities, including those in emerging markets. And Richard E. Witten, a managing director for foreign exchange at Goldman, said that the recent contraction was "just part of the boom-bust cycle of the Street."
"What is new is that the banking community is no longer willing to live through these periods with their high overhead," Mr. Witten said.
Even Mr. Lifson is optimistic. He has landed on his feet at the National Australia Bank in New York. "I can see the market continuing to consolidate," he said. "But if these new markets arise, there will be need for traders."

HEADLINE: Nafta's Impact on Employment Is Slight, Study Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Despite arguments from supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement that the pact would bring big employment gains to the United States and warnings from opponents that it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, the accord's net impact so far has been slight, according to an academic study to be released on Thursday.
The study by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles is one of the most comprehensive looks at the trade accord's effect on employment to date. It concluded that "the impact on trade-related employment during the first three years after Nafta is estimated to be, at the very least, a near zero net impact, and more likely, a moderately positive number." 
 Using a new model of how exports and imports influence jobs in various product categories and regions, the study estimated that the net job gain to the United States since the agreement took effect at the beginning of 1994 has been just 2,990 jobs.
The net figure, however, masked a much greater level of both job losses and gains among different companies. Increased imports to the United States killed an estimated 28,168 jobs the last three years, the study said, while increased exports supported creation of 31,158 jobs.
Organized labor, among other interest groups, continues to argue that the agreement is spurring a migration of jobs to Mexico, where wages are far lower than in the United States. And the U.C.L.A. study did not directly address the politically sensitive question of whether better-paying jobs were being lost to Mexico, leaving lower-wage jobs behind, as critics of the pact, like Ross Perot, had predicted.
But Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, the research director at U.C.L.A.'s North American Integration Development Center and the study's co-author, said that unpublished data clearly established that jobs that support exports from the United States to Mexico paid better than those that were shifted to Mexico.
And the long-term trend, he said, is that the United States will gain more jobs than it loses from the agreement.
If nothing else, the study is likely to stimulate new debate about the economic impact of free-trade agreements in general and the North American Free Trade Agreement in particular. The debate is certain to arise as a political issue again next year, when the Clinton Administration must report to Congress on the trade pact's effect on jobs.
Although the study took account of trade with Canada, its focus was on the economic relationship between the United States and Mexico, and its ultimate conclusion was that the main influence on trade-related employment was not the trade agreement, but Mexico's overall economic health.
"The lowering of tariffs through Nafta has not had a significant impact on the rate of growth of imports or exports between Mexico and the United States, or on the composition of trade between sectors recently liberalized by Nafta and those sectors still awaiting liberalization," the study said.
Instead, the study said, "the real issue with respect to U.S. employment levels concerns the development of policies that can achieve sustainable growth in Mexico."
The near-collapse of the Mexican economy in 1995 had a far greater effect on trade-related jobs in the United States than the trade agreement itself, the study found. A sharp drop in demand from Mexico for American goods last year led to a net loss of 20,000 jobs among American exporters to Mexico in 1995. With the Mexican economy now rebounding, the study projected that the number of jobs attributable to exports to Mexico will grow again this year by 15,000.
The study said that job losses could accelerate again as tariffs are reduced in coming years in more labor-intensive categories like agriculture and apparel that have yet to feel the full effects of the trade accord. Moreover, its conclusions do not take account of job losses in the United States because of plant relocations to Mexico -- more than 33,000 in the last three years by the Labor Department's count -- because the phenomenon was under way well before the agreement took effect and has continued at roughly the same pace.
The study said further research on the trade agreement's economic impact was needed and that its job loss and gain estimates were intended to be approximations rather than definitive counts.
Jeffrey J. Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, said the study was a valuable improvement on the "back of the envelope calculations that were the norm during the Nafta debate."
Mr. Schott and Gary C. Hufbauer of the institute had done a study in 1993 projecting that the North American Free Trade Agreement would create 170,000 jobs in the United States over five years. Mr. Schott said their primary conclusion had been that 170,000 jobs were insignificant in the huge American economy, but that the number had been seized on by proponents of the agreement as evidence of its benefits.
But Mark Anderson, an economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which had warned that the accord would cost the United States hundreds of thousands of jobs, said the last three years have confirmed the agreement's negative impact on American workers.
"Clearly the benefits, not so much of the agreement itself but of the economic relationship that the agreement solidified, went to corporate elites in the United States and Mexico," Mr. Anderson said. "From our perspective the job situation has been negative in the U.S. in terms of jobs lost or not created."

HEADLINE: Yield Climbs To 6.70% for 30-Year Bond

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities came under pressure in thin volume yesterday, after traders were disappointed that the response to the Government's auction of new two-year notes was only average.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32 , to 9715/32 , to yield 6.70 percent, up from 6.65 percent on Tuesday. It was the highest yield since Oct. 30, when it was also 6.70 percent. 
 With no economic news scheduled, the market focused on new supply. Some buyers at yesterday's $18.25 billion two-year-note auction appeared to be foreign investors, traders said. But with little economic news to justify buying the issue, buyers' reluctance was apparent.
Yesterday, the two-year note was awarded at a high yield of 5.874 percent, up from 5.662 percent last month and the highest since Oct. 22, when the yield was 5.930 percent.
Treasury securities were up in morning trading ahead of the note auction, with buying spurred by expectations of good demand, both in the United States and abroad. But as the auction deadline for bids drew near, traders began to worry.
Dealers fear being stuck with a large inventory of securities, which makes them vulnerable to losses if the market continues to drop while the securities are in their possession. They would like the market to be weaker going into the auction, so as yields rise the securities become more attractive to investors.
Part of the market's problem over the last weeks has been supply. With the heavy supply of corporate debt, some investors have been hedging Treasury securities for corporates, and with fewer foreign investors, the situation has taken a toll on the Treasury market.
Another concern is that after the supply is finally absorbed, market participants will probably take a long look at the holiday shopping season. If it is strong, the worry is that the Fed may begin to think about increasing rates. The market has already priced in an expected "on hold" Fed policy, so any rate rise would cause prices to decline.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, called the note auction lackluster. "There was not much enthusiasm, as the market dropped about three-quarters of point on the results," he said, adding, "People are now are pretty much focused on 1997 as they close their books on 1996."
Mr. Ablin expects to see more volatility on low volume in the next week or two. He said the $12.5 billion of five-year notes scheduled to be auctioned today would be a harder sell because of the lack of demand.
In when-issued trading, the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.22 percent, up about 7 basis points since dealers started offering the securities to customers last Wednesday.
The remaining economic data this week are a trade report, the Philadelphia Fed index, weekly claims for unemployment insurance and the final third-quarter gross domestic product; none is likely to bring buyers back into the market.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
