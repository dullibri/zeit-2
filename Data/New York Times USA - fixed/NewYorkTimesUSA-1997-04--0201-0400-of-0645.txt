HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Erring on the side of fighting inflation at the expense of jobs.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE latest labor market numbers have been widely greeted as fresh evidence that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has a direct line to the Oracle of Delphi. With data suggesting that the demand for workers is growing more rapidly than the working-age population, the Fed's pre-emptive strike against inflation last month seems to be one more sign that the Fed remains ahead of the game.
But not quite everyone is convinced that Mr. Greenspan's latest prognostication -- or for that matter, the unbroken economic expansion since 1991 -- proves that he has all the answers. For while a recession-free six years may have marginalized his critics, it has not really established that the Fed has found a golden mean between stable prices and economic growth. 
 For that exquisite balance, if it exists at all, depends as much on value judgments as technocratic insight. "Where was it written," asks Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., a Nobel laureate in economics, "that absolute security against inflation is worth sacrificing unknown quantities of national income?"
Moreover, this seems a particularly unfortunate moment to choose to err on the side of fighting inflation at the expense of higher unemployment -- and without even a whimper of debate. To make welfare reform work, there have to be jobs for those pushed off the rolls. Yet without tight labor markets, business will have little incentive to invest in the training needed to bring marginally competent workers into the mainstream.
No one disputes that Admiral Greenspan has kept the economy on an even keel since the recession of 1990-91. His performance seems all the more impressive when compared with that of German, French and Japanese policy makers, who have not been able to spring their economies from the doldrums. Today, unemployment is at 5.2 percent and the economy is growing at an annual rate well above 3 percent.
Indeed, even his critics are quick to praise Mr. Greenspan for flexibility in recent years, keeping interest rates steady as unemployment dipped below the level experience suggested would fuel wage-led inflation. "He deserves a lot of credit" for holding the line long after traditional conservatives were calling for a tougher stance, argues James Tobin of Yale, another Nobel laureate.
By the same token, most economists see the quarter-point interest rate increase last month as a sign of Mr. Greenspan's enlightened pragmatism and the best way to avoid a future recession brought on by painfully high interest rates. "By tightening a little now," suggests William Dudley of Goldman, Sachs, "he makes it less likely he'll have to tighten a lot later."
So what's left to argue about? Plenty. Mr. Tobin says that inflation is simply not a clear and present danger. A close reading of other bellwether statistics -- notably the proportion of the newly unemployed who were dismissed and the index of labor demand based on help-wanted ads -- is surprisingly benign. "The risks of inflation seem no greater today," he concludes, "than when unemployment was up at 6 percent."
For his part, Mr. Solow is unconvinced by the conventional wisdom that gradualism works best. Small increases in interest rates early on -- the pre-emptive strike -- may seem less traumatic. But by Mr. Solow's reading of the evidence, larger increases once signs of inflation are unambiguous are no more likely to generate overcorrections.
Economists are comfortable staying within the confines of this purely technical debate. A Greenspan-worshiping majority believes that unemployment is already below the rate that can be sustained without bringing on inflation, or that the economy's momentum will soon bring the rate into the inflationary range. An embattled minority suspects that fundamental changes in the economy -- globalization, de-unionization, downsizing -- have sharply lowered the level of unemployment that is compatible with stable prices.
But the debate can be confined only to the technical by ignoring its social dimension. No one really knows whether the magic "nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment" is 5.5 percent or 4.5 percent. So decisions about the target implicitly have as much to do with how one weighs the consequences of erring on the side of slow growth against the costs of inflation.
Fear of inflation has been an easy sell since the trauma of the oil shocks in the 1970's. Uncertainty about prices leads to economic inefficiency -- and, horror of horrors, lower stock prices. Besides, inflation breeds recessions because it eventually brings down the wrath of the monetary gods. But not to belabor the obvious, living with 5.2 percent unemployment if the economy is able to sustain 4.5 percent also has costs: every tenth of a percentage point represents at least 130,000 jobs.
It may be tidier to leave monetary policy in the hands of a benign despot. But it's also a little sad: if the 5 percent unemployment barrier cannot be tested when inflation is beyond the horizon and a Democrat is in the White House, when can it?

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Japan Stocks a Bit of a Bust for U.S. Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
From the viewpoint of an American investor, the Japanese stock market has plunged to a four-year low.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues, Japan's most prominent stock index, fell 318.33 points, or 1.77 percent, to 17,703.37 yesterday, even as the dollar was hitting its highest level against the yen in more than four years. 
 Put the two together, and an American investor in Japanese stocks is looking at the lowest level, in dollars, since the summer of 1992. And if prices keep falling -- or the dollar continues to rise -- the Japanese market will soon be at the lowest level, relatively speaking, since 1986, when Japan's bubble economy was still growing.
In Japan, the stock market situation does not look quite so bleak, with the Nikkei still 22 percent above its 1995 low of 14,507.17. But during the same period, the dollar has turned from weak sister to neighborhood bully. The result is that the plunging yen has left the Nikkei, measured in dollars, down 19 percent for that period. Any American investor who bought Japanese stocks then, and did not hedge the currency risk, would find that he now has more yen than he invested, but that those yen are worth fewer dollars.
From its peak, at the end of 1989, the Nikkei is down 55 percent in yen, and 48 percent in dollars. While the dollar has recovered sharply from its low of about 80 yen roughly two years ago, it remains well below the levels that prevailed in earlier years. When the Japanese stock market was peaking, the dollar was worth about 144 yen. Now it is valued at almost 127 yen.
The weakness in Japanese stocks has come, of course, as the American market has been soaring, at least until its recent stumble. The United States and Japan have the two largest stock markets in the world, and two of the most successful economies. But rarely have two countries' markets been more out of sync.
"With as much exuberance as there is here, there is depression there," said Charles Clough, the chief strategist of Merrill Lynch & Company. "The psychology is totally different. We are at the top of an earnings cycle. They are at the bottom."
Mr. Clough thinks it is likely that Japanese stocks will be a better investment during the next year than American ones, arguing that the Japanese economy is improving and that the stocks of nonfinancial companies, particularly those of major exporters whose businesses are benefiting from a weakening yen, are already moving up.
The argument that American stocks are expensive, and Japanese stocks cheaper, is harder to make if one looks at price-earnings ratios. Bulls on Japan, though, contend that for a variety of reasons Japanese earnings are understated and that cash flows look much better than earnings.
One factor that is now drawing money out of Japan, and into this country, is the sharp difference in interest rates. A 10-year Japanese Government bond now yields 2.29 percent, compared with 6.89 percent for a similar United States Treasury. Interest rates in Japan have been pushed down to low levels in part to help bail out the country's banks, which have severe problems with bad loans.
Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, argues that a buyer of such a Japanese bond, over the life of the bond, would do better than a Treasury buyer only if the dollar loses about half its value against the yen, falling to around 63 yen. That, he said, is highly unlikely, and Japanese investors know it. Japanese insurers have announced plans to step up purchases of foreign bonds, mostly American ones.
In this country, the bond and stock markets often move together, with prices in both rising concurrently while bond yields move in the opposite direction.
But in Japan, the opposite has been true. There, deflation has encouraged bond traders and scared stock traders, who fear that falling prices in the economy will hurt corporate profits. Mr. Barbera argues that the relationship could continue, with bond prices falling, pushing up yields, even as stock prices rise.

HEADLINE: Redefining German Citizenship

 BODY:
The key to German identity is found in the blood. A German is not someone born in Germany, but someone born to ethnic German parents anywhere in the world. Many other nations define citizenship the same way, but Germany's Nazi past gives the concept a different resonance. Now a remarkable new debate in Germany may change the German concept of citizenship.
Germany's Social Democrats and Free Democrats would like to grant citizenship to anyone born in Germany. Some would allow dual citizenship for those with foreign-born parents. Several members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats join them, but the proposal is opposed by most of his party, and by the Bavarian partner in his conservative coalition, the Christian Social Union. They argue that Germany, unlike America, is not a country of immigrants. Parties further to the right put it differently: Germany is an ethnic German state. 
 That, however, is no longer the reality. Eager to separate itself from its Nazi past, Germany has accepted twice as many asylum-seekers as all other nations in Europe combined. The influx slowed considerably with a harsh law limiting political asylum in 1993, but today 1 person in 12 living in Germany is a foreigner.
Germany's political culture has not caught up. While hundreds of thousands of Germans have demonstrated against neo-Nazi arson and the assaults and murders of foreigners, millions more treat foreigners as intruders. Recently, Germany has drawn world disapproval for deporting Bosnian child refugees. Neither the Government nor civic organizations have significant programs to help foreigners integrate. The country still has no law regulating immigration.
The debate about liberalizing Germany's citizenship laws is politically permissible because a new law would not admit new immigrants. It would apply only to people born in Germany. One in five new babies born there is not German. The largest group of foreigners, about two million, are ethnic Turks. Beginning in the 1960's, Germany invited what it called "guest workers" from Turkey to take undesirable low-paying jobs. But these guest workers' children, who pay taxes and often feel more German than Turkish, can become German citizens only with great difficulty. They cannot hold dual citizenship either, as Germany does not admit the concept.
The debate is all the more remarkable given the anti-immigrant mood gripping Europe and the United States. Germany, along with many other countries, has changed its laws to make immigration more difficult. Germany is also experiencing unemployment of more than 10 percent, the highest since World War II.
Redefining Germanness by birth instead of blood could help encourage Germans to accept foreigners. It would provide relief for millions of people who are now destined to live in a country where they will never fully belong. On a Continent where ethnic conflict is common, a statement that ethnicity is no measure of citizenship would be particularly welcome.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Canadian Cable TV Operators In Internet Deal With @Home

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
@Home Network, the high-profile provider of Internet service via cable networks, got a much-needed lift today when the two largest Canadian cable television companies said they would offer the service as well as acquire 5 percent of the two-year-old company. Terms were not disclosed.
The two Canadian companies -- Rogers Cable Systems, a subsidiary of Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto, and Shaw Communications Inc. of Calgary, Alberta -- control 45 percent of the Canadian cable market and reach a total of five million homes. They said they planned to name the new service WAVE@Home. It will deliver high-speed Internet services over @Home's national network and the cable companies' local network. 
 @Home, financed by the Silicon Valley venture firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers and the American cable companies Telecommunications Inc., the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications, has been counting on consumer demand for Internet service that is significantly faster than today's dial-up telephone connections. But the American cable industry has been slow to upgrade its infrastructure to permit two-way data over existing television networks.
To accelerate its business, @Home recently started several new businesses that will try to develop high-speed interactive data services for telecommuters.
The @Home cable system offers Internet service at speeds potentially as fast as the data rates of local area networks in offices. But telephone companies are also preparing to offer faster digital services.
Only about 19,000 homes in the United States now have two-way cable, according to a recent study by Kinetic Strategies Inc., a market research firm in Phoenix. The number is expected to rise to 200,000 by this time next year.
@Home executives said the deal announced today could permit @Home to be available to two million Canadian homes by the end of the year. The Canadian cable industry is acting more quickly than American companies in deploying new equipment that will permit cable users to send as well as receive data.
"These are two well-financed companies that have a significant commitment to rebuild their networks," said Dean Gilbert, senior vice president and general manager of @Home's residential service business. "This is a powerful alliance to accelerate the delivery of data service. We will have the best performance out there."
The company said that because of the expansion into the Canadian market it would become profitable earlier than expected, though it did not state a date for profitability.
Mr. Gilbert said analysts had been much too pessimistic about the rate at which the cable industry would offer digital services.
"You need to stay tuned," he said. "Having spent 17 years in the cable industry, I think the build-out plans are extraordinarily aggressive."
Analysts said that the new deal was significant for the company.
"This is critical for @Home," said Michael Harris, president of Kinetic Strategies. "If you look at the way they've ramped up, they need to achieve rapid revenue growth."
Kinetic's study shows that the United States cable infrastructure will be upgraded to 10 million by the end of the first quarter of 1998. But the infrastructure must first be upgraded in many cable systems, and further investment must be made to deploy data networking equipment.
@Home is available in Orange County and Fremont, Calif.; Hartford; Arlington Heights, Va.; Baltimore; Union County, N.J., and Sarasota, Fla. The company also expects to begin service soon in San Diego, Philadelphia and Phoenix.

HEADLINE: A New Author, 66, Finds a Voice;
McCourt Tells Students the Storytelling Power of a Life

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: BAY SHORE, L.I., April 9

 BODY:
A stretch limousine stopped in front of a Manhattan apartment building this morning to pick up a retired schoolteacher named Frank McCourt. It was a means of travel not to his taste, but such are the burdens of luxury for someone who has just won the Pulitzer Prize for biography.
Since the announcement of the award on Monday afternoon, Mr. McCourt has been toasted at a Champagne breakfast, received dozens of congratulatory letters and telegrams and appeared on both the "Today" program and "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." But the spare-no-expense celebrations have not kept him from maintaining his posture of wise detachment. After all, his award-winning memoir, "Angela's Ashes" (Scribner, 1996), centers on an Irish childhood of relentless poverty: of flea-infested mattresses and dying infant siblings, of a father who drank and a mother who endured. 
 Nor did all the hoopla prevent Mr. McCourt from keeping a longstanding commitment to go to Bay Shore High School and talk to students about the art of writing from experience. He climbed into the limousine -- who paid for it, he did not know -- and headed east toward Long Island.
A few hours later, and less than two days after having won the Pulitzer Prize, a man stepped up to a lectern in the high school's auditorium and presented himself as a 66-year-old, first-time author. His message to the hundreds of students: to understand, as he did, the storytelling power of your own life.
"I learned the significance of my own insignificant life," Mr. McCourt said.
That learning process took decades. For many years, Mr. McCourt associated with some of the celebrated writers and journalists of New York City, swapping tales at the Old Town Bar, singing Irish ballads at the Lion's Head. But he would often return home feeling as though he too should be writing; that he too should be learning from the English lessons he preached to his students at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.
He never doubted that he had a story to tell. When he was 4 years old, his Irish-born parents moved from Depression-ridden Brooklyn back to Ireland, where the family's conditions only worsened. In little more than a year, a pair of toddler twins and a weeks-old baby girl died. His father, Malachy, spun within the alcoholic's spiral: get a job, drink the wages, miss a day's work, get fired. His mother, Angela, held the family together by groveling for its food and clothing. Life for young Frank was a blur of begging, catching a schoolmaster's switch and shivering in the Limerick wetness.
In an interview before his speech, Mr. McCourt recalled that he had tried to write the book of his childhood almost 30 years ago, but wound up setting the 125-page manuscript aside. "I was going through my James Joyce period, studied and affected," he said. "I was still struggling to find my voice."
The years swept by. His mother died in 1981, his estranged father in 1985. He retired from schoolteaching in 1987, did some freelance writing, performed with his brother Malachy in a show called "A Couple of Blaguards." Frank McCourt knew that the point of permanent regret was approaching.
"All along, I wanted to do this book badly," he said. "I would have to do it or I would have died howling."
In November 1995, after a year of feverish writing, Mr. McCourt finished his manuscript about Angela and her lot. Completion brought him peace. "It's between the covers of the book now," he said. "It's captured."
The book has also brought him acclaim. In addition to the Pulitzer, which, he says, "I really didn't believe I was going to get, " "Angela's Ashes" won an award from the National Book Critics Circle, and has risen to No. 1 on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. It has also elevated him to a position in which he is called upon to expound an any Irish matter, "from agriculture to the decline in the consumption of claret in the west of Ireland."
He has accepted this mantle with good grace. But he said he has noticed a touch of stereotyping in the reviews of his book. Critics, he said, tend to describe his book -- and the books of other Irish authors, for that matter -- as "charming and lyrical." In fact, he said, he wanted his description of poverty to be lice-ridden and real.
"I didn't want it to be 'charming and lyrical,' " he said. "I wanted to get away from that Irish stuff. And I did."
When Mr. McCourt got out of the limousine, the teachers at Bay Shore High greeted him with a breakfast in the school superintendent's boardroom. Next to the muffins was a pile of copies of "Angela's Ashes," all waiting to be signed by the author. Against one wall hung a large sign: "Tis a Pulitzer."
Nina Wolff, the coordinator of the writing conference, which was called "The Ethnic Pen," admitted to worrying that the post-Pulitzer crush might force Mr. McCourt to cancel his visit. Although other accomplished authors were attending, he was scheduled to give the keynote address to students from 30 Long Island high schools.
"But he's first and foremost a teacher," she said. "He wouldn't do that to students."
The teachers and the special guest finished their coffee and headed to the auditorium. Appearing first on the stage was Keystone, a group of young musicians who sang about love and life on the challenging streets of the East New York section of Brooklyn. The band's lyrics, one speaker noted, were a form of urban literature. The band's heavy bass notes shook the old wooden walls and energized some students to clap and dance.
Then Mr. McCourt, slight and white-haired, took the stage. After 27 years as a teacher, he knew how to keep the attention of a student audience. But the power of his story alone would have done the job: of his drunken father waking him and his brothers in the middle of the night to make them vow to "die for Ireland"; of being so poor that he aspired to become an inmate in America. "My dream was purely economic," he said. "In prison everybody was warm and got three meals a day."
His message to the students, in a depressed community, was to work past their anger, recognize their self-worth and see the significance of their lives. When he finished, the teen-agers stomped their feet.
Afterward, Mr. McCourt sat in the school library to answer questions. "Do you think it was worth it now?" one student asked. "Your childhood?"
Mr. McCourt smiled a gentle and sad smile.
"Now, yes," he said. "But I wouldn't want to have to do it again."

HEADLINE: Logging Plan Alarms Environmentalists

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 9

 BODY:
Brushing aside the concerns of environmentalists, the Pataki administration is considering a plan that would make it easier for owners of private woodlands to conduct a certain type of clear-cutting inside the sprawling Adirondack State Park.
The plan involves a logging practice known as shelterwood cutting in which a relatively small number of trees are left standing in an area to provide seeds for stretches of woodland that has been partly cleared. Owners of property in the Adirondack State Park must now go through a stringent environmental review process and obtain a permit before they can remove the older trees within 10 years of the initial cutting. 
 But the state agency that oversees the six-million-acre park, the Adirondack Park Agency, proposes to replace the current review process with new guidelines making it easier for property owners to clear away the older trees in less than a decade.
The move could result in a major change in the state's land-use policy for private holdings inside the park, where timber companies have long complained that the current regulations are too cumbersome and that timely removal of older trees helps the growth of new ones.
But environmentalists adamantly oppose the proposal, saying that it could set the stage for allowing unscrupulous property owners to engage in full-blown clear-cutting in two stages instead of all at once. Much of the private land in the park is actively logged, but not by full-blown clear-cutting. Unlike shelterwood cutting, clear-cutting strips the land of every tree, eliminating wildlife habitat and causing erosion and runoff, which can damage streams and lakes.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said the Governor had not had a chance to review the proposal, which he stressed had been made by low-level staff members at the Adirondack State Park Agency. "We will have to take a look at it," Mr. McKeon said. "If it is not good for the Adirondacks, then the Governor will not support it."
The Adirondack State Park is a combination of 2.5 million acres of state forest preserve intermingled with 3.5 million acres of private land that includes 110 villages, towns and hamlets.
This is not the first time the administration's proposals for the Adirondacks have been sharply challenged by environmentalists. In 1995, environmental groups threatened to take the state to court when state environmental officials expressed an interest in hauling millions of trees downed by a storm to reduce the potential for wildfires.
But the administration eventually backed away from that plan last year, saying the trees would remain untouched, thereby allowing the 430,000 acres of storm-damaged wilderness to heal naturally.
Shelterwood cutting is a widely accepted practice that generally leaves as many as 20 mature trees standing per acre to provide shelter for animals, as well as seeds and shade to stimulate new tree growth.
In the Adirondacks, loggers now need a permit to remove the older trees if they try to do so within 10 years of the first round of tree clearing. The state provides the permit only if the logger can demonstrate that the second round of tree cutting does not among other things pollute nearby streams or disrupt animal habitats.
But under the new rules being proposed by the Adirondack Park Agency, a property owner could conduct a second round of cutting if the saplings in a newly cleared area had grown 18 inches or higher in case of softwoods like pine and four feet for hardwoods like oak.
The agency's board had been scheduled to vote on whether to enact interim regulations during a meeting on Thursday. But following an outcry from environmentalists, a spokesman for the agency, James Marrin, said today that the agency would consider enacting the new rules only after a lengthy public-review process.
Still, environmentalists and Democrats criticized the proposal, saying it reflected a pro-business leaning that has emerged in the agency's board after the Governor, a Republican, replaced its chairman and named new members.
"There are between one and two million acres of the park at stake," said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's Environmental Committee. "Unregulated clear-cutting of the Adirondacks would take us back to a time of devastation of the environmental and economic foundations of the park."
But lobbyists for the timber industry, including Muriel Karp, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Forest Products Association, said that the growth of new trees could be hurt if loggers were not permitted to remove older trees in a timely fashion -- typically far less than 10 years.

HEADLINE: Officials Question Unrestricted Ticket Pricing

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 9

 BODY:
Consumer Affairs officials said today that there was no proof that the experiment that freed New Jersey ticket brokers from price controls for 18 months had benefited sports fans and concertgoers.
"There is no persuasive evidence that suggests that the so-called free-market approach to ticket resales has lowered prices or made more tickets available to consumers," said a report by Mark S. Herr, director of Consumer Affairs. 
 The conclusion could be a serious setback for ticket brokers who have been pressing lawmakers to make the trial permanent.
In their report, officials with the Division of Consumer Affairs said they had not been able to do an independent study of ticket prices during the time when brokers were no longer limited to charging a maximum of 20 percent over the box office price. But the officials sided more with consumer advocates who have argued that the brokers significantly overcharged consumers during the experiment, which began in October 1995 and expired last week.
Mr. Herr said that prosecutors had found cases in which brokers were charging as much as 13 times the box office price of tickets in 1994 and 1995, before the experiment -- markups similar to those recently found by the consumer group Citizen Action.
Lawmakers sponsoring a bill that would make the experiment in free-market prices permanent said today that they would continue to push for passage. But a spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said the new report had raised questions about the bill.
"The Governor will keep the report in mind if the Legislature delivers something to her desk," said Pete McDonough, Mrs. Whitman's press secretary. "The director finds that a compelling case has not been made to remove the price controls."
The brokers have argued that the strict price limits had forced the brokers to go underground or out of state. They said that many consumers were then forced to pay more for tickets on the black market than to licenced brokers during the experiment.
Mrs. Whitman agreed to the experiment in 1995 on the condition that the Division of Consumer Affairs do a detailed study of whether the brokers' claims were true.
But Mr. Herr said that his office could not do that study because there was no information on what the scalpers had been charging on the black market when the price limits were in place. Mr. Herr said that he had asked the brokers to supply the information on those black market prices, but the brokers did not.
"Because the brokers cannot provide any data by which meaningful comparisons may be drawn, the division cannot substantiate the brokers' claims of lower prices," the report said.
The report was most critical of the brokers' claim that there were more tickets available to the public during the 18-month trial because dozens of brokers had set up offices in the state after the brokers were free to charge as much as they wanted.
Mr. Herr said that if the brokers had more tickets to resell to the public for sold-out events, it would mean that more tickets had been taken away from the public at the box office price, sometimes by unscrupulous and even illegal methods.
He said that consumer affairs officials had found in the past that some brokers hired so-called "diggers" to wait in line at box offices or ticket outlets and snap up tickets for the brokers to resell.
"The use of diggers and the hoarding of tickets has a significant impact on the public's opportunity to obtain tickets," the report said. "These artificial means of distorting the supply of tickets has a significant impact on prices."
A lobbyist for the brokers called the report flawed. "The report does a disservice to the citizens of New Jersey," said Barry E. Lefokowitz, executive director of the East Coast Ticket Brokers Association. He said that the brokers planned to ask lawmakers to extend the pricing experiment for a year and that they would pay for an independent study during that year.
The bill to extend the experiment overwhelmingly passed the state Assembly earlier this year. Senator Robert Singer, the bill's sponsor in the Senate, said that he would continue to push for its passage.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 45.32 as Rate Fear Halts Three-Day Recovery

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market, weighed down by fears of higher interest rates, slid yesterday, ending what had been a modest three-day recovery after last week's huge losses.
A selloff in financial and technology issues dragged down the market in sluggish trading. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 45.32 points, closing at 6,563.84. After being up 574 points, or about 9 percent, in the first six weeks of the year, the Dow now is up just 116 points, or 1.8 percent. 
 "While we've had a nice, moderate rally off the bottom of last week, there's still a lot of negative psychology out there over interest rates," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds. "The market just seemed to run out of steam."
Mr. Freedman said that until the market saw a "good string" of positive corporate earnings, stock prices could linger at current levels, partly because many investors feared that Federal Reserve officials would raise short-term interest rates again.
On March 25, the Fed raised the target on the Federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, and since then investors have worried that fresh signs of inflationary pressure could lead to further Fed actions.
Consequently, the bond market has weakened in recent weeks, and the falling prices have pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury to more than 7 percent for the first time in six months. Since then, stock prices have slid to January levels.
"People don't expect stocks to go straight back up from here because we're in between Fed tightenings," said Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Assets Management. "You can't be very bullish on the stock market in the middle of a tightening."
Two prominent analysts, Laszlo Birinyi and Abby Joseph Cohen, however, remain bullish.
Mr. Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn., said in a report this week that the recent market setback was not "unusual" and that money flows into stocks remained positive. Early in the year, Mr. Birinyi had written that an "8,000 Dow is not unreasonable, and look for another year of double-digit gains." He said he had not changed his mind.
Ms. Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, released a similarly bullish statement, reiterating her belief that operating profits of companies in the S.& P. 500 index would be healthy this year, up about 10 percent from last year, and that stock returns should rise by an equal amount. "Our fundamental views are little changed in recent months," she said.
But yesterday, two of the market sectors that have been most active this year -- financial services and technology -- were hit again, after rising significantly on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's financial index fell 1.3 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 7.94 points, to 1,249.43, ending a four-day streak in which it gained 4.7 percent.
Within the financial services industry, Nationsbank lost 1 3/8 a share, to 57 1/4; Citicorp fell 1 7/8, to 112 7/8, and Merrill Lynch dropped 2 1/8, to 88 7/8.
Technology stocks were hit even harder. Intel lost 4 23/64 a share, to 142 1/4; Cisco Systems fell 1 5/16, to 54 1/16, and BMC Software Inc., lost 3 1/8, to 44 5/8.
"We're now headed for a test of the low," said William LeFevre, a market analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "High tech has been hit the hardest, but a few outstanding earnings surprises and you could get a run-up in prices."
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, Merck was the worst performer yesterday, down 3 3/4 a share, to 81 1/2; analyst reports said that one of the company's leading drugs, which treats high cholesterol, would be challenged by a new treatment being introduced by Warner-Lambert, another leading pharmaceutical company, which gained 1 1/4, to 94 3/4.
I.B.M., after gaining 4 1/8 yesterday, also declined, falling 3 1/2, to 133 1/8. And J. P. Morgan fell with other financial stocks, off 3, to 98 3/8.
The big gainer in the Dow was Procter & Gamble, which rose 4, to 119 3/4, after the company said it would acquire Tambrands Inc., the maker of Tampax products, for $1.85 billion, or $50 a share. Shares of Tambrands rose 2, to 48 1/8.
Among the few indexes to gain yesterday was the Dow Jones transportation index, up 6.47, to 2,432.29. For the year, the index is up 7.8 percent, far outperforming the larger market. Yesterday the index was led by CSX, up 1 1/2, to 45 3/4.

HEADLINE: Landslide for Los Angeles Mayor, And a New Electoral Landscape

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 9

 BODY:
Angelenos overwhelmingly re-elected their popular Mayor, Richard J. Riordan, to a second term on Tuesday after a low-key election in which a record turnout among Hispanic voters reflected the shifting demographics and politics in the nation's second-largest city.
At the same time, residents voted to create a 15-member commission to recommend changes in the city's 72-year-old charter that could include expanding the powers of future mayors and increasing the size of the City Council as part of an effort to head off a drive for secession by voters in the suburban San Fernando Valley section. 
 "Now it's time for me to roll up my sleeves and get back to work," Mr. Riordan declared at a news conference this morning, celebrating his landslide victory over his Democratic challenger, State Senator Tom Hayden, the former 1960's radical who had sought to paint Mr. Riordan as insensitive to the city's minorities and too beholden to business.
With more than 98 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Riordan had 227,649 votes, or 61 percent, to Mr. Hayden's 128,824, or 34 percent, a record margin for a Republican in a city that remains 2-to-1 Democratic. Three minor candidates split the remainder of the vote.
Mr. Riordan, a 66-year-old lawyer and businessman, made his first run for elective office four years ago, when he projected a broad, bipartisan appeal in a city shaken by the 1992 riots. This year, he rode a rebounding economy and declining crime rates to re-election, backed by a team dominated by supporters of his Democratic predecessor, Tom Bradley, and of President Clinton, who has showered the city with Federal largesse.
Mr. Riordan failed to make inroads only among blackvoters, who supported Mr. Hayden by more than 3 to 1.
Hispanic voters overwhelmingly backed Mr. Riordan, according to a Los Angeles Times survey of voters leaving the polls, and for the first time, they edged out blacks as a share of the electorate, accounting for about 15 percent of the votes cast, according to the same survey. That signals an important shift in voting patterns that could profoundly alter the shape of the city in the next election, in 2001, when term limits will force Mr. Riordan to retire.
"By far the most important message coming out of this election is the surge in Latino population," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an analyst at the Center for Politics and Economics at the Claremont Graduate School. "It's a critical development."
One of every three adult Los Angeles residents is of Hispanic origin, a group that has historically lagged politically, accounting for only about 14 percent of registered voters and 8 percent to 10 percent of actual voters in typical municipal elections. By contrast, blacks constitute only about 13 percent of the city's adult population, yet account for 18 percent of registered voters.
On Tuesday, The Los Angeles Times survey, which had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, showed the turnout of the black electorate trailing that of the the Hispanic one at about 13 percent of the votes cast.
The Los Angeles Times survey showed that the most important element in fueling Hispanic turnout appeared to be a $2.4 billion bond measure to repair the city's schools. Nearly 70 percent of the children in the city school district are Hispanic, and the measure was strongly backed by liberals and organized labor. It passed on Tuesday.
Mr. Riordan, a Roman Catholic, made extensive efforts to court the heavily Catholic Hispanic vote, and news organizations that serve Hispanic audiences undertook voter registration drives in response to recent state ballot measures restricting immigrant services and affirmative action.
For all Mr. Riordan's success, the election was not an unalloyed triumph for him. Turnout appeared to reach a record or near-record low, with just 1 in 4 voters coming to the polls in a contest whose outcome had never been in serious doubt. A survey of local television news coverage in the weeks just before the election, conducted by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a news monitoring group, found that of 2,160 minutes of late-evening news coverage analyzed, only 23 minutes and 44 seconds concerned the election.
And while Mr. Riordan's proposal to create a citizens commission to revise the city charter won comfortably, most of the slate of candidates he fielded to fill it lost to candidates backed by labor unions and the City Council.
The commission is to draft changes that will automatically appear on the municipal ballot in 1999 and take effect two years later. It will compete with a commission already established by the City Council, whose recommendations will have to be approved by the Council before going to the voters.
Mr. Riordan was instrumental in raising more than $2 million to support the measure to rewrite the complex 680-page charter. He did so in part to head off efforts in the State Legislature to allow the largely affluent San Fernando Valley -- a Riordan stronghold whose residents complain that their concerns are often overlooked in city affairs -- to secede from the rest of Los Angeles.
In his ebullient victory speech and news conference this morning, Mr. Riordan went out of his way not to give any specific hints of the changes he would like the charter commission to recommend. He studiously avoided offering specific answers to a range of questions, including his views on the selection of a new police chief to succeed Willie L. Williams, whose contract was not renewed after quiet opposition by Mr. Riordan.
The Mayor expressed disappointment that overall turnout was not higher and that he had not won more support from blacks despite years of private philanthropy in inner-city schools and community groups and some more recent outreach efforts while in office.
"I'm a doer," he said in a familiar refrain. "I'm not good at political speech.
"I believe that people will more and more see what I've done."
Throughout this campaign, he was at some pains to gain a significant foothold even among the liberals, environmentalists and labor unions who should have been his natural base, but he pledged to continue "trying to visualize and dream a dream of a livable Los Angeles."

HEADLINE: A Wider Circle at White House Knew of Efforts to Help Hubbell

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
In the spring of 1995, a few months after his fraud conviction, former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell and his wife asked a recently retired White House aide whether the Riady family of Indonesia, which had already paid Mr. Hubbell $100,000, would be keeping him on its payroll even as he faced prison.
Over dinner at the Palm restaurant in Washington, the former aide, Mark Middleton, told the Hubbells to take their question to the Riady family or to John Huang, the Riadys' former top American executive, who was then a trade official at the Commerce Department, says Robert Luskin, Mr. Middleton's lawyer. 
 It is not known whether Mr. Hubbell ever followed up on Mr. Middleton's suggestion at the Palm. But the gathering, and other new details gleaned from interviews with current and former aides and their associates, indicate that Mr. Middleton was one of about a dozen or so senior Clinton Administration aides and advisers who found themselves drawn into Mr. Hubbell's plight in one way or another.
The White House, while acknowledging that some close advisers to the President sought to find work for Mr. Hubbell when he resigned from the Justice Department to face a rapidly unfolding criminal investigation, has said that the effort was not orchestrated and that many of its details -- notably the Riady payment -- were not known to President Clinton or the First Lady until they read about them in newspapers last year.
But the new interviews suggest that a wider circle of White House officials, at various levels, were intimately aware of the effort than has been previously known.
Mr. Middleton himself, for example, received reports from some of Mr. Hubbell's new employers, who, Administration officials say, may have been reporting back to the White House in an effort to curry favor there.
And other aides began in 1994 to monitor Mr. Hubbell's legal and personal situation, according to Administration advisers and White House documents. They watched his level of cooperation with investigators and tracked what reporters were asking his associates about his post-Government employment.
The interviews also show that a job hunt on Mr. Hubbell's behalf by Mr. Middleton's boss, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, led to at least four jobs, one more than has been previously known. And they show that the $100,000 payment from the Riadys, longtime political patrons of President Clinton, was speeded up, sent to Mr. Hubbell in a lump sum in the summer of 1994 by one of the family's companies.
That $100,000 was among more than $400,000 that Mr. Hubbell, after leaving the Justice Department on April 8, 1994, received from a dozen or so businesses and organizations, many controlled by friends of Mr. Clinton and leading supporters of the Democratic Party.
What the Clintons and other officials knew of these payments is now a focus of examination by Federal prosecutors and Congressional investigators, who are trying to determine whether the payments were legitimate compensation for work performed or were instead intended to discourage Mr. Hubbell from cooperating with Whitewater investigators.
Mr. Clinton has said that the effort to gain financial support for Mr. Hubbell, who had been a partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., was motivated solely by the compassion of friends and that "everybody thought" at the time that his legal problems were minimal, "some sort of billing dispute with his law firm."
Mr. Hubbell, who has said he misled the Clintons in 1994 about the true magnitude of his problems, declined to respond to questions today.
Mr. Hubbell's problems began to emerge in April 1993, three months after he arrived in Washington, when he first learned that the Rose Law Firm was questioning his billing practices there. Even then, he thought that "if they look into all this, it'll be the end," he told The Arkansas Times last month.
By early March 1994, as the firm continued to examine his billings, Mr. Hubbell was trying to make peace with his former partners. He proposed a settlement, although he did not specify what he was willing to pay. The firm turned him down and began to consider referring him to Arkansas legal ethics officials, according to lawyers familiar with the case.
On March 13, at a White House meeting to discuss Whitewater, Mr. McLarty, who was then the White House chief of staff, told Mrs. Clinton that Mr. Hubbell would be resigning from the Justice Department. He also told her that he intended to help find work for Mr. Hubbell, the White House has recently disclosed. Officials say Mrs. Clinton gave her approval or at least her acknowledgment.
Mr. Hubbell announced his resignation the next day.
A few weeks later, Mr. McLarty talked to Truman Arnold, a Texas businessman and old friend of Mr. Clinton, about hiring Mr. Hubbell. Mr. Arnold did so and, in turn, also helped persuade three other Texans to hire him: Bernard Rapoport, an insurance executive; Wayne Reaud, a lawyer, and C. W. Conn Jr., an appliance store owner.
White House officials have said Mr. Rapoport and Mr. Arnold may have told Mr. Clinton about their help. But, the officials say, this is the extent of what Mr. Clinton recalls knowing at the time about financial help for Mr. Hubbell.
In May 1994, as Federal investigators were steadily building a case against him, Mr. Hubbell made a last-ditch effort to settle his problems with the Rose Law Firm by offering to pay $150,000. But that offer, like his previous one, was rejected, lawyers familiar with the case say.
The next month James T. Riady came to Washington. Secret Service records show that he visited the White House every day from June 21 to June 25. He saw Mr. Clinton at least twice and was usually cleared into the complex by Mr. Middleton. On June 23, elsewhere in Washington, he also saw Mr. Hubbell twice.
On Monday, June 27, the first day of the new workweek after Mr. Riady had visited Mr. Clinton, a Riady company, Hongkong China Ltd., sent Mr. Hubbell $100,000.
Mr. Hubbell had initially been expecting four quarterly installments of $25,000, but for some reason the Riady company decided to accelerate the payment into a lump sum, according to people in the United States and Asia familiar with the arrangement.
The next weekend, the Fourth of July holiday, the President and the First Lady went to Camp David and asked Mr. Hubbell to join them. There, during a walk, Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Clinton discussed the problem with the Rose Law Firm. Mr. Hubbell told The Associated Press last week that the President "asked me if I'd done something wrong" and "I didn't tell him the truth."
On Tuesday, July 5, Mr. Hubbell wrote to one of Mr. Riady's top executives in Hong Kong, acknowledging the $100,000 he had received the previous week, according to those familiar with the payment.
Three weeks later, Marsha Scott, a high White House aide, arranged to have lunch with Mr. Hubbell, according to White House telephone logs.
Ms. Scott, a longtime Clinton friend, spent considerable time with Mr. Hubbell after he left the Administration. The Los Angeles Times has quoted an unidentified associate of hers as saying she took messages back and forth between Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Scott may also have learned about Mr. Hubbell's work for the Los Angeles Airport Commission, a lobbying job that put him in frequent contact with another top White House aide, John Emerson, according to White House officials and an inquiry by the Transportation Department's inspector general.
Mr. Middleton was invited to the lunch with Ms. Scott and Mr. Hubbell but did not attend, said Mr. Luskin, his lawyer. He learned of Mr. Hubbell's hiring by some of the employers in the course of their contacting him about a variety of matters, Mr. Luskin said. Those employers included Mr. Arnold, Mr. Reaud and also Mr. Rapoport, who, according to Mr. Luskin, arranged the 1995 dinner with the Hubbells at the Palm and was present there.
Mr. Middleton, Mr. Luskin said, was also told by Mr. Riady in the fall of 1994 that he was "helping out" Mr. Hubbell.
Mr. Middleton, who had been a lawyer in Little Rock before joining the Administration as special assistant to the President, left in February 1995 to enter private business. But he frequently visited the White House afterward, paying more than 30 visits there in the first six months alone, according to White House aides.
According to one former White House aide, some of the employers may have been telling Mr. Middleton that they were helping Mr. Hubbell to get the message through to the White House that they were willing to do favors for a friend of the President.
Mr. Middleton and his boss, Mr. McLarty, may not have been talking much together about what each knew of Mr. Hubbell's employment.According to Mr. Luskin, Mr. Middleton does not recall telling Mr. McLarty about the arrangement between the Riadys and Mr. Hubbell. But Mr. Middleton does recall one conversation, in June 1994, in which Mr. McLarty, after being told by Mr. Middleton about the Arnold and Rapoport arrangements, acknowledged trying to help Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Luskin said.
Lanny J. Davis, special White House counsel, said Mr. McLarty did not himself remember the conversation but thought it "certainly plausible it could have occurred."
Mr. Middleton may also have told others at the White House about some of Mr. Hubbell's employment: Mr. Luskin said Mr. Middleton might have informed Ms. Scott about the Riady arrangement.
The White House has stumbled over the issue of who knew about the arrangement between the Riadys and Mr. Hubbell. In December, the Presidential press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said no one at the White House was aware of it until press reports last year. Then he corrected himself, saying Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel and one of Mr. Clinton's most trusted aides, learned about it in the fall of 1994.
Last June, Mr. Lindsey told investigators for the Senate Whitewater committee that he had not told anybody else at the White House about the Riady arrangement and that he was not aware of any efforts by anyone associated with the Administration to get work for Mr. Hubbell.
In the fall of 1994, Mr. Lindsey, along with another top White House aide, John Podesta, worked to minimize contacts between the Riady family and Mr. Clinton at the Asian-Pacific economic summit in Jakarta, Indonesia, according to White House aides. Mr. Hubbell did not attend the summit, but he had been in Indonesia, courtesy of the Riady family, several weeks earlier.
Soon after the Jakarta conference, Mrs. Clinton talked to Mr. Hubbell. By then prosecutors had told him that they planned to seek his indictment soon. Mrs. Clinton "urged me to fight it," Mr. Hubbell told The Associated Press.
But Mr. Hubbell, after consulting with lawyers, pleaded guilty on Dec. 6, 1994, to tax and fraud counts stemming from his theft of almost $400,000 from his Rose partners and clients. One week later a White House lawyer, Jane Sherburne, compiled a 12-page list of tasks for herself and other lawyers that included the monitoring of Mr. Hubbell's cooperation with investigators.

HEADLINE: Andrews Joins Democratic Primary Race for Governor

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J., April 9

 BODY:
In the first of three stops on a bus tour across the state, United States Representative Robert E. Andrews officially began his Democratic campaign for governor here today, focusing on his plans to improve education and criticizing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman for "failing to use the power of her office to do the right thing."
Mr. Andrews, a four-term House member, chose to deliver his announcement speech far from his home base in southern New Jersey, where he represents the First Congressional District. Before the day was over, the candidate had made similar speeches in the central New Jersey town of Ewing and back in his native region, in Brooklawn in Camden County. 
 At a school here, nestled among the neat row houses that look across the Hudson River at New York City's skyscrapers, Mr. Andrews said he believed that he would win the Democratic primary on June 3 and face Mrs. Whitman in the general election because of what he called his "credible proven record."
Speaking in a gymnasium at Christopher Columbus Middle School filled with seventh and eighth graders who screamed and whistled at various points during his speech, Mr. Andrews said he would have an inauguration party after pulling off "the biggest upset in modern political history."
Issuing an invitation to the students, he said, "Join me in Trenton in January 1998."
But for Mr. Andrews, the 39-year-old son and grandson of Camden shipyard workers, the road to the State House in Trenton is lined with formidable roadblocks. To get to face Mrs. Whitman, who is running unopposed on the Republican ticket, Mr. Andrews must first defeat two contenders in the primary. The stronger of the two, James E. McGreevey, a State Senator and Mayor of the town of Woodbridge, made his candidacy official on Tuesday. The third candidate, Michael Murphy, the former Morris County Prosecutor, is expected to make his announcement later this week.
With education as a central issue in this year's race, Mr. Andrews noted that, as a member of the House, he had sponsored the Federal direct loan program, and he said that nearly 25 percent of the students at Rutgers University receive assistance through the program.
He said he would push for smaller classes in grade schools and for an expansion of preschool programs.
In an interview after the speech, Mr. Andrews said Ms. Whitman "tried to run for Vice President by pretending she was cutting taxes." He criticized the Governor's fiscal policies and her $2.9 billion pension bond proposal. And he charged that the Governor's administration had too many high-paying patronage positions, and that she had failed to properly prioritize her spending of the state's annual revenues of about $20 billion. "I don't believe Governor Whitman is giving us our $20 billion dollars worth," Mr. Andrews said.
Addressing the majority of his audience, who will not reach voting age for five years, Mr. Andrews warned them that, under Ms. Whitman's recent bond proposal, "by the time you are almost 50 you will be through paying back money that she wants to borrow today."
Mr. Andrews arrived at the school today looking like a political postcard. As he exited the bus, he carried his 2-year-old daughter, Josephine, in his arms while his wife, Camille Spinello Andrews, carried their other daughter, Jacquelyn, 4. During his speech, he referred to his wife, who is an instructor at the Rutgers University School of Law, as "the best lawyer I know."
Before being elected to replace former Gov. Jim Florio in Congress in 1990, Mr. Andrews was a lawyer, an adjunct professor at the Rutgers law school and a two-term freeholder. A graduate of Bucknell University and Cornell University law school, he commutes to Washington each day from his home in Haddon Heights.
Over the next several weeks, Mr. Andrews is likely to take some heat for supporting many of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's initiatives in Congress.
Black politicians, specifically, have questioned his voting record, and a group of black ministers earlier this week warned the Democratic candidates that none of them should take black voters for granted. Mr. Andrews said he was not counting on "any block of votes" to win the election. "I have to earn every vote" he told reporters.
Before delivering his speech, Mr. Andrews visited a class in the school's showcase computer lab, where he seemed amazed to find that eighth-grade students had chosen to read an interactive version of "Cyrano de Bergerac."
"I'm surprised they chose 'Cyrano,' " he said. "It's a very subtle and sophisticated piece of literature."
Mr. Andrews spent more than 15 minutes in the classroom, describing the technology as "incredible." Each student, he said, "is literally sitting at the doorstep of the Library of Congress."
Mr. Andrews introduced himself to the students as a candidate for governor, however the children seemed unimpressed by his presence, as most kept working, their eyes glued to their computer screens in the same classroom visited by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore last year. The classroom has also been shown in a videotape in which Microsoft chairman Bill Gates described his vision of education in the future.
Paul J. Byrne, an adviser to the Hudson County Executive, Robert C. Janiszewski, who was among supporters on the campaign swing, said he believed that the Governor, despite her widespread popularity, would rather not face Mr. Andrews in November.
"Andrews is 'it,' " Mr. Byrne said. "He's a good speaker. He's got the fire in the belly. He's got that right-in-your-face campaign style needed to beat her. Whitman fears him."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL: JACKIE ROBINSON -- 50 YEARS, A Baseball Celebration;
Color Issue Reaches People in Seats

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
The 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking of the color barrier in baseball will be greeted with all the appropriate ruffles and flourishes next Tuesday, no more so than at Shea Stadium, where the Mets and the Dodgers will be joined in their salute by President Clinton.
But the President won't be the only extraordinary participant. For high above the boxes decorated with red, white and blue bunting and baseball's best intentions will be thousands of children from the inner reaches of New York City. And among those thousands will probably be a good number of African-Americans. 
 These children have been invited by the Mets to see firsthand a part of baseball's history -- and their own. Yet if the African-American children among them were to attend a baseball game on any other day, they would become very aware of how that history -- and the role of blacks as a visible fan force -- has withered.
Fifty years after Robinson, the black presence at the ball park is all but an aberration, a stark turnaround for a black America that used to count baseball as its pastime, too, when blacks were confined to the Negro Leagues.
"I grew up in Harlem and used to see Satchel Paige, the Black Yankees, the Elite Giants and there were 20,000, 30,000 mostly black people in the stands, before Jackie," said Clifford Alexander, a Washington-based consultant who monitors baseball's equal employment initiatives.
That the Negro Leagues could draw caused baseball not only to open its clubhouses, but also to open wider its doors for the then vibrant black news media and especially the fans.
"Blacks came from all over to see him," Joe Black, a former pitcher who teamed with Robinson on the Brooklyn Dodgers, recalled. "Our people like having something to hold on to -- Joe Louis, Jesse Owens, Martin Luther King, and Jackie."
Alexander, then a day-camp counselor at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., said: "I used to take 30, 40 youngsters from Harlem out to Ebbets Field to see him. So the habit of going out to games was a clear one in our community. Now, though, I sit in the stands and they're not there."
Blacks haven't been there for some time. In 1987, a Simmons Market Research Bureau survey showed only 6.8 percent of baseball attendance was made up of black fans, compared with the 17 percent reported by the National Basketball Association and the 7.5 percent quoted by the National Football League.
Why?
Racist statements by Marge Schott and Al Campanis and lagging hiring practices by clubs have left negative impressions. And, contends Black, baseball never tried to sell the game to Robinson's followers.
"Just like business and industry, the civil rights movement opened the doors and put us in there, but then they didn't know what to do with us," said Black, a special consultant to the commissioner's office.
"Three things remain key in business: recognition, invitation and community involvement, but baseball never had to do that because emotions carried black folks in." .
Don Newcombe, another former Dodger pitcher and Robinson's roommate, knows of such emotions, for he saw them the day Robinson forced Sportsman's Park in St. Louis to integrate.
Robinson told Dodgers Manager Burt Shotton that neither he nor Newcombe nor Roy Campanella would play unless more than 15,000 black fans outside the park were accommodated, even though only one 3,000-seat bleacher section was set aside for "colored only."
Newcombe's anecdote underscored the economic clout of an entire community, a power still visible in other sports, but not in baseball.
The game has never been accused of marketing itself well. And it is only recovering from the debacle of the 1994-95 strike. So it may be asking a lot of clubs to market to an obviously uninterested sector.
Still, said the San Diego Padres' president, Larry Lucchino, "Lots of teams have been trying -- some trying more diligently than others."
The Padres, who have established an African-American Task Force on Baseball, refurbish inner-city ball fields. They have wooed minority vendors and community leaders. "What you do is make sure that the ball park environment is warm and hospitable and open to everybody," Lucchino said.
Such inclusion, contends National League President Len Coleman, reaches past good economics. "It's of strategic importance that baseball reach out to all communities. Jackie Robinson was about inclusiveness -- that should be our ideal."
It should also be a priority for the African-American major league ballplayer, who has yet to realize what Robinson knew: that's it's about more than a game.
Robinson empowered a race by assuring its inclusion in any seat its members wanted to buy. And he recruited the bodies to fill those seats, leading Campanella, Newcombe, Black and others to the black press and on barnstorming ventures far beyond Brooklyn and Harlem.
"People could see us, reach out and talk to us, in Memphis, Atlanta, everywhere," said Black. "But now you don't see the black press, you don't have players go into the neighborhood. Guys like Ken Griffey Jr., they're unknown entities. You see them in commercials, but you don't really see them."
What changed once can change again. The timing will never be better. As Lucchino said: "If ever there were a year that we can rekindle some of the memories and the interest, this is it."

Dollar Falters Against Yen After Reaching 4 1/2-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday for the first time in a week, tumbling from a four-and-a-half-year high against the Japanese yen, after three senior Japanese officials suggested that Japan might sell dollars to halt its rally.
The dollar fell further after Nikkei English News, quoting unidentified sources, said that the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan planned to sell dollars. 
 "The reports made traders apprehensive that there could be some kind of intervention," said Robert Hauck, a trader at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis. "That made the dollar come off pretty significantly."
The dollar pared some early losses after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin repeated in an interview on the CNBC cable channel that he supports a strong dollar, adding that the Government shared Japan's concern about the yen's weakness.
"Rubin's comments came one step closer to saying that a disorderly rise of the dollar is not something" the Government wants, said James McGroarty, chief currency manager at Potomac Babson.
In Asian trading, the dollar rose as high as 127.14 yen -- the highest since August 1992 -- before retreating. In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 125.65 yen, down from 126.77 yen on Wednesday.
The dollar also fell to 1.7178 German marks, from 1.7245 on Wednesday. The British pound rose to $1.6234 from $1.6194.
The dollar began its decline after Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka of Japan called the yen's decline against the dollar "excessive." His deputy, Tadashi Ogawa, and Eisuke Sakakibara, director of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, echoed Mr. Mitsuzuka's views.
"The officials didn't like the quick depreciation of the Japanese yen," said Tatsuya Enomoto, head of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank in New York. "After those comments, traders obviously sold dollars and the dollar was sold again in New York."
The dollar rose sharply earlier this week as Japanese investors continued to flock to higher United States interest rates, encouraged as well by signs that trade friction with Japan had eased following Mr. Rubin's visit there last week. Traders had bet that officials of both nations would not move to halt the recent rally.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Going Straight To Video Stores

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
LAST summer, months before Juliette Binoche won her Academy Award and years after William Hurt won his, I saw them in a quirky new film with much wry charm. In "A Couch in New York," she is a dancer fleeing a romantic mess in Paris and he is a harried Manhattan psychoanalyst. They trade apartments; she cures his patients, and eventually their love lines cross. The film's charm was a major shock, because "A Couch in New York" was having its premiere on a plane and I expected it would make me want to jump out the window. The film's sad reputation had preceded it. An unlikely romantic comedy by the avant-garde Belgian director Chantal Akerman, this film had not found anyone willing to release it in American theaters. It was one of those pathetic orphans headed straight to video.
"A Couch in New York" is, in fact, coming to home video in June without having landed in theaters. (A television screening on Showtime in the wee hours, and a few screenings at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens and a San Francisco theater hardly count.) And its situation is not unusual these days. Video stores and catalogues are loaded with films that never made it to a cineplex. 
 Some movies actually do this on purpose. "Honey We Shrunk Ourselves," the new best-selling sequel in the "Honey" series, is the first live-action feature Disney has made especially for video. Rick Moranis is the same unintentionally mad scientist and bumbling Dad he played in "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" and "Honey I Blew Up the Kids," which did well in theaters. In "Honey We Shrunk Ourselves," Dad shrinks himself and three other grown-ups to microscopic size, and an aging film series makes a seamless transition from theaters to video.
Disney latched onto a booming built-in audience several years ago when it made its "Aladdin" sequels especially for video. Kiddie videos make economic sense: they're faster and cheaper to produce than movies for theaters. They sell for about $20 and children watch each one about 4 million times (or maybe it just seems that way).
Movies for grown-ups go directly to video for more complicated reasons. Some, like two stunning compilations that pay homage to the Lumiere brothers and their invention of an early movie camera, are simply too esoteric to have a large commercial life. Others, like "A Couch in New York," have bad luck, bad timing or both. (The film was locked into a video release date before Ms. Binoche won her Oscar for "The English Patient," which might have helped push "Couch" into theaters.) And, let's face it, most straight-to-video movies are just plain bad.
Most films intended for home video are genre pieces, cheaply made and ready for the compost heap. They are loaded with killers, evil spirits and an amazing number of lethally vengeful scorned lovers. Direct-to-video is where fading stars go to pay the mortgage and avoid total oblivion. It's where you can keep up with the career of Mickey Rourke.
Things don't have to stay that way. Like cable television, video has not begun to fulfill its potential as an outlet for daring work. Meanwhile, there are a few hidden treasures to be found at the video store.
When video browsing, it helps to remember two harsh but realistic rules. First, never trust the advertising on the jacket. Stanley Tucci was brilliant as an actor, a director and a writer of "Big Night." Do not go near his straight-to-video "Sex and the Other Man," a painfully bad satire in which he is held hostage by a couple with an impotence problem. (The husband is Ron Eldard of "Men Behaving Badly"; don't let him sway you either.)
Second (and in spite of rule No. 1), we all know that expectations diminish when you watch a film at home. You can work with this. Think of it as the airplane principle: if the movie does not make you want to jump out the window, you're ahead of the game.
Here are the best of some recent films that have gone straight to video (or have taken the tiniest theatrical detour).
 
Kiddie Tapes
In August, Disney will release "Pooh's Grand Adventure," the first full-length Winnie the Pooh movie in 20 years. And "Toy Story II" will be made as a direct-to-video film, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as the voices of Woody and Buzz. If the two "Aladdin" sequels suggest anything, it is that the animation is not as dazzling as the Disney originals, but is much better than most direct-to-video movies. And there is no end in sight from Disney or anyone else.
 "HONEY WE SHRUNK OURSELVES." Like the earlier films in the series, this is a quiet family comedy with efficient computer effects, a good old reliable movie rather than a dazzling one. Here, the children are left alone to party while a particle-size Mom and Dad and Aunt and Uncle struggle to get big. In a funny set piece, the tiny adults take a wild ride in a Hot Wheels car. They are also dumped down a laundry chute as threatening as the Grand Canyon, and dwarfed by a Daddy Long Legs. This installment loses some of its child-appeal by making grown-ups the center of attention, but watching your parents feel small has satisfactions of its own.
"THE THIEF AND THE COBBLER." Video stores are full of cheap imitations, the generic versions of every Disney hit from "Snow White" to "Pocahontas." This is not one of them. Though it has the flavor of "Aladdin," it is a spectacular original with one of the harshest routes to video ever. Richard Williams (who went on to make "Who Framed Roger Rabbit") began this animated musical more than 20 years ago, struggling to finance and finish it. Finally, in 1995, the work in progress was stitched together with old and new voices and briefly dumped into a few theaters as "Arabian Knight." Matthew Broderick was brought in to play Tack, a poor cobbler's assistant in old Baghdad who falls in love with the beautiful Princess Yum-Yum (Jennifer Beals). Jonathan Winters provides the comic voice of a thief who tries to steal three golden balls from a minaret. Vincent Price, the voice of the evil sorcerer, Zigzag, had already been dead for two years when the film came out. For video, it has been restored to its original title. It is still visually gorgeous, with animation as vivid and sophisticated as any on screen. The songs are mostly unmemorable, except for a chorus of brigands singing, "We're what happens when you don't finish school." Still, "The Thief and the Cobbler" is a sweet, winning adventure.
"THE LAND BEFORE TIME IV: JOURNEY THROUGH THE MISTS" AND "THE LAND BEFORE TIME SING-ALONG SONGS." Universal Home Video has its own blockbuster kiddie franchise. "The Land Before Time," the 1988 animated feature about endearing, rambunctious young dinosaurs, has been followed by several colorful direct-to-video sequels. In the most recent, the hero, Littlefoot, and his prehistoric pals journey into a dangerous valley to get a plant that will save the life of his sick grandfather. In the tradition of "Bambi" and "The Lion King," this series seems determined to help children face death or be traumatized forever in the process. This time, there is a happy ending.
The first "Sing-Along" video in the series, featuring songs from all four films, is irresistibly cute, if not always as singable as it might be. Each song is preceded by a brief lesson about real dinosaurs; Littlefoot is a baby brontosaurus. "The Land Before Time V" will be released later this year and a sixth installment is in the works.
 
Orphans
None of these films were intended to go straight to video. They are the Oliver Twists of the movie world, struggling to survive in the cruel atmosphere of the video store, where movies without theatrical pedigrees still seem suspect. Some of these movies actually had brief runs in theaters. But even Hollywood blockbusters are fighting it out for screens today, so smaller films are forced out fast. For practical purposes, these are all obscure works that deserve a new life on video.
"A COUCH IN NEW YORK." William Hurt is wonderfully comfortable as Henry, the New Yorker who trades his glorious Fifth Avenue apartment for Beatrice's cramped atelier in Paris. As Beatrice, Juliette Binoche brings a skewed, European attitude to this comedy. Instead of flailing around with physical humor, she assumes an air of calm detachment (as if to say, "I'm French; I have to think about everything."). Chantal Akerman, the director, was recently the subject of a retrospective at the American Museum of the Moving Image, and her video installation "Bordering on Fiction" in now on view at the Jewish Museum. She has never made a purely commercial film, and despite its screwball trappings, "A Couch in New York" is no exception. It speaks to the madness of upscale urban life, a shared insanity that transcends the wickedly detailed differences between American and French sophisticates. (Henry's bathroom scale speaks to him with an electronic voice; Beatrice has a cleaning woman for the smallest garret in Paris.)
"SCORPION SPRING." This neat little thriller might have made it to theaters if it had found a big star for a lead, but "Scorpion Spring" works fine without one. Instead, it relies on a playful, updated use of the gangster-on-the-road genre. Alfred Molina plays a womanizing actor stranded by his girlfriend at a roadside diner near the Mexican border. He hooks up with a young man who has a car but no money and they head for Los Angeles. When they pick up a Mexican man and his sister, they discover that these two are not ordinary immigrants. The man, Angel (Esai Morales), is involved in drug dealing and a gang war, and the woman is not his sister. Ruben Blades plays the Border Patrol officer on their trail in this smoothly entertaining story. Caution: This is the very place to enforce video rule No. 1. Matthew McConaughey is among the actors featured on the video box for the film, which was made before he was proclaimed a matinee idol for "A Time to Kill." He appears for all of 10 minutes near the end, as a drug dealer called El Rojo.
"ANGEL DUST."This gripping, stylish Japanese murder mystery is a true gem. In the Tokyo subway, every Monday at evening rush hour, a woman is quietly killed in the crowd. Psychological suspense is at least as important as discovering the murderer here; in fact, psychology and the killings are thoroughly linked. Setsuko, a young doctor who analyzes criminal personalities, is called in to investigate, only to find her own sanity endangered. She interviews her former lover, who now runs a clinic that deprograms members of cults, including the first murder victim. What does he know about the killings? And is Setsuko's ability to intuit the thoughts of criminals (like television's "Profiler") taking her too far? Visually beautiful and eerie, the film moves from the neon city to the heroine's spooky dream of being inside a cave on Mount Fuji. English subtitles always limit the market for films, but this scarcely released movie is a real find.
"KASPAR HAUSER." There are countless versions of the story of Kaspar Hauser, the uncivilized young man found wandering in Nuremberg in the early 19th century. This German film, made in 1994, assumes that Kaspar was the Crown Prince of Baden. Though it depicts the ruthless way he was taken away as an infant and later locked in a dungeon for a dozen years, this film emphasizes the political intrigue at a decadent, ornately designed royal court. Andre Eisermann is a poignant Kaspar, especially after he is educated and brought into society, where he remains thoroughly misplaced and bereft. The director, Peter Sehr, has said that the treatment of Kaspar is a metaphor for 20th-century German evil. The film suggests the terrible way evil presses on one innocent individual. "Kaspar Hauser" won the equivalent of the German Oscar for best film, director and actor
". . . AND THE EARTH DID NOT SWALLOW HIM." This is a quiet, sentimental but compelling story of a migrant Mexican-American family in the 1950's. There is altogether too much voice-over narration in the tale, as the 12-year-old hero, Marcos, tells of his family's annual migration to pick crops. But the film accumulates its power through calm realism and small touches: the way Marcos's mother builds a small bedroom shrine and prays for his elder brother, lost in the Korean War; the way the nurse in a new school searches Marcos for lice and finds them. ("We couldn't help getting them from the chicken coop," he tells us.)
"LUMIERE AND COMPANY" AND "THE LUMIERE BROTHERS' FIRST FILMS." The Lumiere brothers' 1895 movie camera, the cinematograph, is a clunky box slightly larger than a cable box. Forty contemporary directors, as varied as Spike Lee and the Iranian film maker Abbas Kiarostami, were each handed one and asked to make a minutelong film. The new films shot with the cinematograph are in subdued black and white, with music but no dialogue. Most are pretty but not inventive, relying on easy juxtapositions of past and present. Among the most striking is Claude Lelouch's rapturous vision of romance in movie history: two lovers kiss and swirl in front of the stationary cinematograph while film crews, from silent days to the present, pass by filming them. But interspersed with the short films are brief interviews with the directors about the nature of film itself, and glimpses of original Lumiere works. "Lumiere and Company" turns into a wonderful and provocative package.
And its perfect complement is on the way. A collection of original Lumiere shorts, with narration by the director Bertrand Tavernier, is to be released in the fall. Among other things, the video store can be a treat for serious film lovers.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
In God They Trust

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Every day now Western politicians, diplomats and journalists, some well-meaning, some not very, announce that the only way to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace is for both sides to learn to trust each other. If that's true, forget peace, because they won't.
Trust Israelis? For a half-century, Palestinians have shown they believe that Israelis are interlopers carrying out criminal assault on the lives, religion and national hopes of the Palestinian people. 
 Trust Palestinians? For half a century Israelis have lived through unending Palestinian religious and political war against them, and the form of military war known as terrorism. They see no evidence it will end.
Sometimes Israelis try to deny all that. Palestinian leaders remind them. "Rabin understood the situation after paying a very steep price," said Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji recently. "After Netanyahu sees blood in the streets he will understand too."
 Peace through trust is fantasy, but peace is not. It will come if both sides decide it is in their critical national interest; if not, not.
For Israel, critical interest is the ability to survive all enemy attacks by putting a high cost on them. That will have to include Palestinian terrorist attacks, committed as a tactic to take Israeli lives or a strategy to drain Israel's life.
Israelis know Palestinian terrorism was committed during Labor and Likud governments -- before, during and after negotiations. They have seen Israeli concessions arm Palestinians and turn the West Bank into a virtual Palestinian state. They have received nothing but antiterrorism promises repeatedly broken.
Now, in even narrower borders and with increasing Palestinian hostility, accepting payment in promises is a self-destructive luxury Israel cannot afford. Israelis must see Palestinian antiterrorism proven as promised and before any more agreements are signed -- terrorist camps eliminated, Hamas and Islamic Jihad disarmed, their leaders arrested for real, not a week or two.
Palestinians have a choice of national interests. They can continue warfare, in understandable expectation that having won a three-quarters loaf for them it can deliver the heel. Or they can abandon the terrorist war, in realization that otherwise they will forfeit control of population and cities they have gained, and watch statehood crumble in their hands.
The choice will be decided not only by decisions of Palestinians, but of the U.S. America is a friend of Israel and Palestinians. But the Clinton Administration is stricken with what Newt Gingrich accurately called moral equivalence.
In Europe, that is a familiar Mideast-connected political perversion. It arrived in Washington during Bush-Baker.
Israel's existence and interests are considered morally equivalent to satisfying Palestinian territorial demands. Israel's exercise of its sovereignty in Jerusalem is considered the moral equivalent of Palestinian terrorism against that sovereignty.
Sixty people died in the crisis manufactured by Yasir Arafat over the opening of a second door in a Jerusalem archeological tunnel. Now Arab shopkeepers welcome tourists coming through the door. In ordinary minds incitement to murder is a crime. In moral equivalency it is an invitation to the White House.
In moral-equivalency-think, "trust" becomes indistinguishable from appeasement. Palestinians are allowed to make promises and cancel them without penalty. Israelis are allowed to give up land, security and sovereignty, permanently.
Nice; for Palestinians, a no-risk setup. But it's a fool's game for Israelis. If Palestinian police gun down Israeli soldiers again as they did during Mr. Arafat's door crisis, Israel forces may counterattack not just at the spot but against terrorist targets wherever known.
The dangers of war through terrorism are understood within the U.S. and Israeli Governments. So if the U.S. is to continue as a Mideast player it has to tell Mr. Arafat that failure to disarm terrorism will carry a price -- the end of American political and economic support of the Palestinian movement.
That will be a difficult decision for President Clinton. But so are all decisions to choose reality over fantasy.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The trend seems ominous. American Cybercast, the producer of the Web soap opera site The Spot, has filed for bankruptcy protection. Out.com, the on-line version of Out magazine, has shut down for lack of advertising revenue. Politics Now, a joint venture of ABC News, National Journal and The Washington Post, which was one of the Net's busiest sites during the 1996 campaign, no longer exists. And late last month Netguide Live, an on-line Web directory that had nearly 200 employees at its peak, announced it is pulling the plug.
But to look at these setbacks among prominent Web sites and conclude that the Internet is not living up to its promise is like inferring that the computer industry is in trouble because nobody's buying computers from Wang, Commodore or Kaypro. In an odd way, these Web casualties are an indication of the Internet's new maturity and profitability. 
 To understand the Web's growing pains, one must remember that many of the first developers of the sites were engineers, computer programmers and others from the high-tech industry. To them, the Web was an enticing fantasy, a chance to unleash a repressed artistic side. They hoped to take their furious E-mail rants and publish them as columns and to use their programming skills to make Web pages look cool.
Unfortunately, these engineers-turned-cultural-arbiters also brought with them the software industry's expectations for compensation: Trade 18 months of hard work at low pay for stock options, and soon enough you'll get rich or move on to something new. They neglected one reality of the industry providing the "content" for new and old media: Cultural arbiters -- most writers, editors and illustrators -- earn relatively little and rarely make a fast buck.
The engineers didn't understand that sites are more like magazines than software companies, and that a new magazine is considered a success if it turns a profit within five years. The Spot is a case in point. It had been modestly successful before TCI and Intel became big investors; they tried to morph it into a network of shows, watering down the content until even the core audience abandoned it.
Too many failed sites, like Netguide, tried to operate along Silicon Valley norms -- 8,000 square-foot offices and staffs so large that workers stop saying "hi" in the halls. Most companies that have succeeded on this scale -- like Yahoo, provider of a leading Internet search engine, and Netscape, maker of the most popular browser -- are really part of the Web's infrastructure. And even Yahoo, which has been around from the beginning, just turned its first profit in the final quarter of 1996.
With money not so easy to come by, Web sites are learning how to practice sustainable economics. The on-line magazine Salon, for example, has been building readership steadily for two years, yet doesn't expect profits until the fifth year. Some promising small sites are no longer even chasing advertisers, hooking up instead with a handful of long-term sponsors and even creating promotional events for them. Riotgrrl.com, a biweekly Webzine for young women, has partnerships with Squeeze Jeans, the on-line bookseller Bookzone and the computer store Cyberian Outpost.
The good news for the Web is that ad revenues are still growing, although advertisers are focusing on the top 100 or so sites (buying up lots of space on low-traffic spots was proving inefficient). And although many entertainment-based sites are closing, real-world companies like L. L. Bean are finding that a thriving business with on-line catalogues.
This competition will help the Web because it will punish complacency. The string of failures, far from being an omen of the Web's unprofitability, will likely spur innovation and, most important, frighten away those who are only in it for the quick buck.

HEADLINE: Evsey D. Domar, 82, Professor And Economic-Growth Theorist

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Evsey D. Domar, a leading theorist of economic growth and expert on comparative economic systems, died April 1 at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass., where he had lived for many years. He was 82.
The cause was myelodysplasia, a bone marrow disorder, said his wife, Carola R. Domar. 
 At the time of his death, Mr. Domar was professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Earlier, he was a developer of the Harrod-Domar model of economic growth, which predicts how much people must save and invest to keep an economy growing. He described the model, which was developed separately by Sir Roy F. Harrod of Oxford University, in his 1957 book, "Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth."
In later years, he focused on economic history, particularly slavery; in 1989, he published "Capitalism, Socialism and Serfdom: Essays."
He was also a popular and influential teacher. Robert Eisner, former president of the American Economics Association, attributed his choice of a career in part to Professor Domar. He "taught Keynes beautifully," Mr. Eisner said in 1988.
Born in Lodz, which was then in Russia but is now in Poland, Professor Domar and his family were in Manchuria, where his father had business, when World War I began, his wife said. He graduated from the State Faculty of Law in Harbin, Manchuria, before moving to the United States in 1936.
Shortening the family name of Domashevitsky, Mr. Domar attended the University of California at Los Angeles, earning a bachelor's degree in 1939. He also received a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, and a master's degree and doctorate in economics from Harvard University.
He taught at Oxford as a Fulbright Scholar in 1952 and 1953, and was a professor at Johns Hopkins University for 10 years before moving to M.I.T. in 1958. He retired in 1984.
In addition to his wife, Professor Domar is survived by two daughters, Erica D. Banderob of Milton, Mass., and Alice D. Domar of Sudbury, Mass., and three granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Helene Hanff, Wry Epistler Of '84 Charing,' Dies at 80

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX 

 BODY:
Helene Hanff, whose wittily acerbic 20-year correspondence with a London bookseller she never met won her a passionate following after it was published as the epistolary memoir "84, Charing Cross Road," died on Wednesday at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 80.
 Up to the book's publication in 1970, Ms. Hanff was a relatively unheralded freelance writer whose work centered mainly on television screenplays and children's books. But the letters she addressed to the antiquarian bookshop Marks & Co. from 1949 to 1969, with their shared confidences and affectionate needling along with orders for Jane Austen and Izaak Walton, brought her a small if unanticipated literary celebrity. 
 Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote: "Here is a charmer: a 19th-century book in a 20th-century world. It will beguile an hour of your time and put you in tune with mankind."
From the beginning of her correspondence, Ms. Hanff ignored the niceties of business letter writing. "WHAT KIND OF A PEPYS' DIARY DO YOU CALL THIS?," she bellowed in an eccentrically capitalized letter of Oct. 15, 1951, after receiving a Marks & Co. shipment. "this is not pepys' diary, this is some busybody editor's miserable collection of EXCERPTS from pepys' diary may he rot. i could just spit. where is jan. 12, 1668, where his wife chased him out of bed and round the bedroom with a red-hot poker?"
In his replies, Frank Doel, the shop's chief buyer and Ms. Hanff's principal correspondent, strove at first to maintain what she called his "proper British reserve." But little by little, Ms. Hanff wore him down, as she did the other members of the shop's staff. They sent her recipes for Yorkshire pudding. She sent them food parcels and nylon stockings in a one-woman crusade to ameliorate Britain's postwar shortages. And Ms. Hanff often tempered her trans-Atlantic crankiness with rhapsodic soliloquies over the orders that Marks & Co. managed to get right.
"The Newman arrived almost a week ago and I'm just beginning to recover," she wrote in 1950 after buying a first edition of John Henry Newman's "Idea of a University" (1852) for $6. "I feel vaguely guilty about owning it. All that gleaming leather and gold stamping and beautiful type belongs in the pine-paneled library of an English country home; it wants to be read by the fire in a gentleman's leather easy chair -- not on a secondhand studio couch in a one-room hovel in a broken-down brownstone front."
Despite her origins south of the Battery -- she was a native of Philadelphia -- Ms. Hanff was the Platonic New Yorker to her enchanted London correspondents. Her letters are a window on days spent picnicking in Central Park, rooting ardently for the Dodgers (and later the Mets) and wading into the fray of local politics (she was the first woman to serve as president of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club).
A constant undercurrent in Ms. Hanff's letters was the hand-to-mouth writing life she led, working at home in "moth-eaten sweaters" with an overflowing ashtray at her elbow and the gin bottle never far from reach. Despite repeated pleas from Marks & Company staff members to visit them in England (by the 1950's Frank Doel was offering her the use of his grown daughter's bedroom), Ms. Hanff's precarious finances never allowed her to make the trip until 1969, after Mr. Doel's sudden death from peritonitis.
Helene (pronounced heh-LAYNE) Hanff was born on April 15, 1916, in Philadelphia, the daughter of Arthur and Miriam Levy Hanff. She grew up in a theater-mad household (during the Depression, her father, a shirt salesman, took the family to the theater every week by slipping shirts to the box-office men in exchange for tickets), and all she ever wanted to be was a playwright.
Her career began auspiciously in 1938, when she won a fellowship from the Bureau of New Plays as a result of a nationwide competition. Soon afterward, she moved to Manhattan, where she became a protegee of Theresa Helburn, a co-producer of the Theater Guild. But although Ms. Hanff wrote 20 plays through the 1940's, none were ever produced. Her repeated attempts to succeed in New York theater are chronicled in her 1961 memoir, "Underfoot in Show Business."
"I wrote great dialogue, but I couldn't invent a story to save my neck," she told The New York Times in 1982. In the 1950's, Ms. Hanff supported herself by writing screenplays for television programs including "Playhouse 90," "The Adventures of Ellery Queen" and "Hallmark Hall of Fame."
A child of the Depression, Ms. Hanff could afford only a year of college, and throughout her life was an impassioned autodidact, educating herself by reading the great books, which she preferred to procure from London rather than dip into "Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies." One wall of her studio apartment on East 72d Street in Manhattan was filled from floor to ceiling with her Marks & Co. treasures, with their rich leather bindings and gleaming gold stamping. In front of the bookshelves hung the Marks & Co. sign, stolen for her by a devoted "84" reader from the shop after it closed, not long after Mr. Doel's death.
When Ms. Hanff decided to publish her correspondence with the shop as a memorial to Mr. Doel, the result brought her undreamed-of attention. "84, Charing Cross Road" was hugely popular in Britain, where it was adapted for the London stage by James Roose-Evans. (The play was less well-received on Broadway, where it ran in 1982 with Ellen Burstyn as Ms. Hanff and Joseph Maher as Mr. Doel.) In 1987 the book was made into a feature film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.
The book's success finally gave Ms. Hanff the wherewithal to travel to England, where she visited the boarded-up bookshop and met Mr. Doel's widow, Nora, a journey documented in "The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street" (1973). Ms. Hanff's other books include "Q's Legacy" (1986), "Apple of My Eye" (1977) and the children's titles "Movers and Shakers" (1969) and "Terrible Thomas" (1964).
"It's unreal to me, what the last 10 years have been like," Ms. Hanff said in 1982. "The fans -- people all over the world who regard me as a friend! And in London there is a brass plaque on the wall with my name on it, to mark the spot where the bookshop once stood, because I wrote letters to it. In your own mind you're still an uneducated writer who doesn't have much talent, and yet here you are with a plaque on the wall in London! You don't even dream about things like that."
But "84, Charing Cross Road" could not provide its author with the economic stability she sought throughout her life. "The one drawback about being a writer is that you never know in any month where the rent is coming from six months from then," Ms. Hanff told Publishers Weekly in 1985.
In her last years she was "broke," by her own account, living on royalties and Social Security and accepting a $5,000 grant from the Authors League Fund to help pay her hospital bills.
No immediate family members survive.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Under 320,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The number of United States workers filing for unemployment benefits remained below 320,000 last week for a ninth consecutive week, the longest stretch in more than eight years.
"The recent performance of claims paints the strongest portrayal of the labor market since early 1989," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
 New applications for unemployment insurance jumped by 6,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 318,000, the Labor Department reported today. Many analysts had expected a slight decline.
It was the largest number of first-time filings since 324,000 during the week ended Feb. 1. But it still marked the longest string of claims numbering below 320,000 since the 23-week period between September 1988 and February 1989.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims rose by 2,250, to 313,750, the highest since 317,500 during the period ended Feb. 15.

Grumman Cuts Jobs In Long Island Office

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The Northrop Grumman Corporation, which employed 25,000 people on Long Island in the mid-1980's, continued its inexorable retreat from the regional economy yesterday, with the announcement that 445 workers -- all of them at the company's former headquarters in Bethpage -- would be laid off or relocated. The latest round of job cuts, when completed by 1999, will bring Grumman's job total down to only 2,700 people in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
The company said that its military aircraft systems division, which does support services and engineering work on military planes made by the company in years past, would be moved to other company centers in Florida and Maryland. The unit has 420 workers -- 80 contract workers whose positions will end, and 340 full-time employees who will either move or lose their jobs. The company also said that 25 jobs in other divisions in Bethpage would be moved to Florida. 
 Northrop Grumman, now based in Los Angeles, announced earlier this year that its last production plant on Long Island -- an electronics assembly plant in Great River -- would close by the end of the year. About 450 employees are being affected by that closing. The plant's primary operations will be moved to other company sites in Illinois and Pennsylvania. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Experimental Price Index Offers Glimpse of a Lower-Cost Future

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Labor Department statisticians introduced an experimental version of the Consumer Price Index today that could shrink inflation readings and thus save the Government billions of dollars a year in payments to Social Security recipients and beneficiaries of other programs.
If adopted in full, probably in 1999, the experiment's methodology is estimated to reduce the rise of the price index by about one-quarter of a point, compared with the current method. Measured by the current method, inflation was 3.3 percent in 1996. 
 Most, but not all, specialists agree that the index substantially overstates inflation, and politicians of both parties want technicians to make it a more accurate barometer of the cost of living so they can avoid blame for trimming benefits and raising taxes. Income tax brackets, as well as more than half the $1.5 trillion of Federal spending, are adjusted annually for inflation.
The experiment to be conducted for the balance of 1997 addresses a major element in one type of upward bias in the price index -- the substitutions that shoppers make in response to price changes. Throughout its history, the Consumer Price Index has been constructed as if no substitution at all occurred. Thus, it gauged prices but not the actual cost of living.
It was not immediately clear whether the Clinton Administration and Republican negotiators in Congress would apply the altered price index to this year's budget, possibly bridging much of the financial gap as they negotiate an agreement. However, it is assumed that some adjustment of this type will be incorporated into any eventual budget package.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, brushed aside a question about the new gauge by saying the Bureau of Labor Statistics was "working very hard and very effectively" on the issue, and that "we'll see what happens."
For their part, the fiercely nonpolitical bureau staff stressed that the experimental index was being developed well before the overstatement issue came into public prominence with the appointment by the Senate Finance Committee of a five-member independent panel to study the accuracy of the index.
The Senate group, which was headed by Michael J. Boskin of Stanford University, said in its final report in early December that the overstatement amounted to about 1.1 percentage points a year. Remedies for about two-tenths of this have already been incorporated in the Consumer Price Index.
The new index will be reported initially on April 22, along with a version using current methodology but disregarding the recent improvements. The new index will employ what is known as the geometric means method to capture substitution.
The Experimental Consumer Price Index Using Geometric Means, which has been dubbed "Geomeans," is designed to adjust for substitution that occurs within categories of items, not between categories.
For example, researchers will find out this year with the help of scanner data from supermarkets how consumers respond to, for example, a rise in the price of romaine lettuce relative to iceberg lettuce, two products assumed to be reasonable alternatives.
The experiment does not, however, measure higher-level substitution that occurs, for example, when shoppers switch to chicken when the price of beef is climbing.
Even so, if geometric means should be found a worthy improvement for all lower-level pricings in the experiment -- 207 items in 44 geographic market baskets -- this would trim the price index by a quarter-point, enough if immediately installed to cut some $35 billion from the Federal budget deficit in 2006.
Officials noted, however, that it was highly unlikely that geometric means would be found appropriate for every item, since some things have no practical substitute. Diabetics, for example, have no choice but to pay more if the price of insulin rises.
Officials would not speculate as to how much an effect a partial adoption of geometric means methodology, as opposed to the arithmetic means currently employed, would have on the index.
The experimental index, CPI-U-XG, which is to follow the regular monthly report of the Consumer Price Index by a week, will not be adjusted for seasonal variation. It will be accompanied by a companion index that will facilitate historical comparisons. When the indexes are calculated in retrospect, the effect was about 37/100 of a point a year between December 1990 and December 1994, with the gap closing to 28/100 of a point between December 1994 and February 1997, the bureau found.

HEADLINE: A Bad Deal Is Worse Than None

 BODY:
Congressional and White House negotiators will meet again today to prepare for possible budget talks next week involving President Clinton. These talks are likely to determine not only what a future budget might look like, but even whether any budget deal at all will be struck this year. The pressure is on both sides to reach agreement and prove they know how to govern. But unless the concessions made by each side are right, the better outcome would be no deal at all.
Mr. Clinton's first task is to follow offers already made by his Republican rivals. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, has proposed that Mr. Clinton join him in appointing a commission that would pare back cost-of-living adjustments used to calculate benefit levels as well as tax brackets -- the best way to spread the pain of deficit reduction across the population. But Mr. Clinton let Mr. Lott's proposal die, no doubt fearing backlash from the elderly, whose Social Security benefits would be reduced, and other voters whose taxes would be slightly raised. Speaker Newt Gingrich angered his conservative backers by proposing that tax cuts be postponed until after a balanced budget is passed. A Democratic President should have seized this proposal in order to spare huge offsetting cuts to his spending initiatives. Instead Mr. Clinton reacted with reckless indifference. 
 Many presume that the President will eventually embrace these sensible ideas in the eleventh hour of negotiating. But the Republicans are already backing away. Besides, they do not trust that he will do what he might promise in private. The leaders need public declarations, and soon.
For the Republicans, the task is to admit that their vaunted welfare "reform" wrongly victimized legal immigrants and childless adults. The President has proposed reinstating disability payments and Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants who become disabled after they enter the United States and to the children of legal immigrants. He also proposes reinstating uninterrupted food-stamp benefits for adults who cannot find private- or public-sector work or a government-provided workfare slot. Some Republicans counter these socially responsible suggestions with offers to postpone some of these provisions, or turn over small blocks of money to states that bear the heaviest burdens of poor immigrants.
But these palliatives are much too small and badly targeted. The Republicans need to accept that their bill was, at least with respect to legal immigrants and childless adults, wrong in principle. The solution is a change in principle, as Mr. Clinton has proposed, not a pittance of temporary money.
Mr. Clinton wants to spend about $20 billion on legal immigrants and food stamps and about $50 billion on a variety of programs of much less importance. His first responsibility is to stand firm on the $20 billion to partially fix a welfare law he should never have signed. Only then can he push for spending more on the rest of his list.
If the appropriate concessions are not made by each side, with the President following Mr. Lott's lead on cost-of-living adjustments and Mr. Gingrich's lead on taxes while standing firm on welfare, then the best outcome would be budget impasse. That would suspend for one year any progress on deficit reduction -- but that is hardly threatening since the goal of zero deficit by the year 2002 is of little economic significance. Impasse would at least not make matters worse.

HEADLINE: House Banking Chief Wants Freddie Mac Bond Inquiry

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The chairman of the House Banking Committee called today for an investigation into the investment practices of Freddie Mac, the Congressional-chartered, shareholder-owned mortgage finance company, saying it had abused the preferential borrowing terms it enjoys through its ties to the Government.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said Freddie Mac -- short for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation -- had borrowed $125 million in the bond markets on Monday at 6.99 percent, an interest rate reflecting the market's belief that the Treasury had effectively guaranteed repayment. 
 Freddie Mac, whose charter calls for it to invest primarily in mortgages and mortgage securities, then used the $125 million to buy corporate bonds issued by the Philip Morris Companies with identical 10-year maturities yielding 7.68 percent.
Mr. Leach said that such an investment strategy might be legal, but that it was not appropriate. "Freddie Mac was established by an act of Congress for a specific purpose: to advance home ownership, not to facilitate tobacco sales," he said. "What Freddie Mac's action amounts to is taxpayer subsidization of corporate arbitrage and, implicitly, the tobacco industry."
Mr. Leach asked the General Accounting Office, the Congressional auditing and investigative agency, to examine Freddie Mac's purchases of non-mortgage securities, including the question of whether it routinely tries to profit on the spread between corporate bonds and its own, lower, costs of borrowing.
Freddie Mac declined to respond in detail to Mr. Leach. Asked whether it had made the investments that the House committee chairman outlined, a spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, Nancy Condon, said the company "is not in the practice of discussing specific investment strategies."
In a prepared statement, the company said: "Freddie Mac routinely deploys capital in a range of sound mortgage and non-mortgage investments that provide an attractive return and liquidity to help in the pursuit of our housing mission. If there is a formal review, Freddie Mac intends to provide information that explains our investment practices."
Republicans in Congress have questioned over the last several years whether Freddie Mac and its larger competitor, Fannie Mae -- the Federal National Mortgage Association -- should continue to receive an array of benefits from their close ties to the Government, including apparent Federal guarantees of their debt.
Although both companies are credited with creating a vibrant secondary market for mortgages, thereby helping reduce mortgage rates and making mortgage financing more available to home buyers, some Republicans have argued that the companies have become so big and strong that they should no longer profit from special consideration from the Government.
Mr. Leach has been among those who have questioned whether Congress should reassess the Government's relationship with the two companies. Financial industry executives said the questions about Freddie Mac's investments could focus new attention on the matter.
Freddie Mac was created by Congress in 1970 as part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and became a publicly traded company in 1989. Like Fannie Mae, which was created as a Federal agency in 1938 and turned over to shareholders in 1968, Freddie Mac has retained some explicit and implicit ties to the Federal Government.
The most important is an inferred Government guarantee of its debt -- the perception among many investors that debt issued by the company is essentially the same as debt issued by the Treasury, backed by the full faith and credit of the Government and therefore virtually risk-free.
A study last year by the Congressional Budget Office found that the presumed guarantee, and other benefits like exemption from state and local taxes, were worth $2.6 billion to Freddie Mac. The trade-off for the company has always been that it must live up to its charter, which requires it to focus on helping the nation's housing market by securitizing and investing in home loans.
It is unclear how common it is for Freddie Mac to acquire corporate securities or to arbitrage its debt against higher-yielding securities having nothing to do with mortgage finance.
Mr. Leach said Freddie Mac had purchased $340 million worth of Philip Morris bonds, including the $125 million that was matched up directly with its own securities.
Fannie Mae "invests in corporate notes and bonds as a very small component of its capital management program," a spokesman for that company, David Jeffers, said.
"We do not own any tobacco securities," he aaded, "or any securities in the 7-to-10-year range."

HEADLINE: Yanks Back at Stadium, With Steinbrenner on Deck

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Six months after the Yankees captured the hearts of New Yorkers with their World Series victory, they return to the stadium this afternoon, charging higher ticket prices and with a big unresolved question: How long will they remain in the Bronx?
The team's lease expires in 2000, and last year's Opening Day had been designated by George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, as his deadline for deciding whether to move the team to a proposed $1 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, remain at Yankee Stadium or cross the Hudson River to New Jersey. 
 But with the Yankees ready to reap the financial fruits of their new status as World Series champions, all parties in talks about the team's future home have lapsed into an almost-preternatural silence.
"There's no news, no meetings planned with the state and city," said David Sussman, the Yankees' executive vice president and general counsel. Spokeswomen for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, agreed with Mr. Sussman's statement.
The city and team have hired consultants to examine the feasibility of the New York sites, but they have not completed their reports. Mitchell Zietz, a senior management consultant for Public Financial Management, the city's consultant, does not believe Mr. Steinbrenner is awaiting the reports before deciding.
"We're waiting for George," Mr. Zietz said.
Mayor Giuliani's enthusiasm last year about the ease of financing a $1 billion ball park on the West Side has been publicly dampened after the plan was roundly criticized. In fact, the two people most likely to face him on Election Day this November -- the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, and the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, are vigorously opposed to spending $1 billion on a West Side stadium.
"Why make an issue of it?" asked a person close to the Mayor, suggesting the proposal was all but dead until after the election.
Mr. Ferrer said crucial negotiating time was being lost because of the city's failure to play hardball with Mr. Steinbrenner to keep him in the Bronx.
"The Mayor has read the polls, which show antipathy to wasting taxpayer money on a West Side stadium," he said. "There's no rationale for it. He knows it's a politically unpopular move. So now he's soft-pedaling it, which is congruent with George Steinbrenner's strategy to keep dragging this out."
A poll conducted last April by Quinnipiac College of Hamden, Conn., found that 70 percent of the respondents wanted the Yankees to stay in the Bronx and 14 percent backed a move. In addition, the survey found that 72 percent favored the current site and 17 percent the West Side location.
Mr. Ferrer said he expected the city to extend the Yankees' lease in the Bronx to give Mr. Giuliani more time to make the case for a West Side stadium.
Deirdra Picou, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said she knew nothing of a possible lease extension. But an extension might be needed if the city and Mr. Steinbrenner agree on the West Side site, to provide a place for the team to play during construction, which, given its complexity, would almost certainly go beyond 2000.
The New Jersey option is Mr. Steinbrenner's trump card, one he can look to if unsatisfied with his New York options. Still, no movement has been reported on that front. "Nothing has changed," said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
A new stadium is particularly attractive to the Yankees as they observe the riches created by the new ball parks of American League rivals like the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers.
Although advance ticket sales for the season have reached 1.4 million, up from almost 1.1 million a year earlier, Mr. Sussman of the Yankees said they would be even higher in a new stadium in another location. Sales of full-season ticket plans increased 12 percent this year but remain below 10,000, he said.
"We're very disappointed," Mr. Sussman said. "We're the world champions, but we've sold only 40 percent of what the Baltimore Orioles have sold, in a market that's, what, 10 times larger?"
While winning the World Series helped ticket sales "inch" higher, he said, they would have increased much more "if not for the issues surrounding the stadium and the location."
Those issues, including too much traffic and too little parking, have not changed, he said, adding, "It will take something much more to make a demonstrable change in our situation than winning the World Series."
A new stadium with five to six times the 19 luxury suites at Yankee Stadium is the team's goal.
"Fans don't always make the connection between what you can do with revenue from 19 suites and 120 suites and signing stars," Mr. Sussman said. "A new stadium changes team economics, making them very competitive."
Nonetheless, the Yankees have baseball's highest payroll, $63.4 million, which is bankrolled heavily by almost $50 million from their cable television contract with the MSG Network, which like their stadium lease expires in 2000.
The Yankees will also start the season as the beneficiary of a 10-year, $95 million sponsorship with Adidas, the largest such local deal in baseball.

A Prophet's Gospel: Faith, Hope and Seed Money

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
The Hale-Bopp comet glowed in the sky above Manila Bay, but the 50,000 ecstatic Christian followers of Brother Mike paid it no heed. Flying saucers were the last thing on their minds. Their reward was here and now: good jobs, good health, good marriages and, best of all, money.
At the high point of the rally on a vast fairground beside the bay, thousands of people lifted their open wallets and bank books to the heavens to receive financial blessings from the Philippines' most popular evangelist, Mariano Velarde, known as Brother Mike. 
 Some raised their passports in hopes of a job abroad.
"Do you believe that without documents you can go to the United States with the help of Brother Mike?" said a worshiper named Nene Arreliano. "I do."
Evangelical movements are sweeping this largely Roman Catholic nation, with its undercurrent of pre-Christian mysticism and ritual, but never has the Philippines seen a movement grow so fast and claim so many followers.
Founded a decade ago by Mr. Velarde, 57, a real-estate developer with a religious radio program, the movement known as El Shaddai -- a Hebrew name for God -- has a following estimated at five million.
It is a religion of its time, when the Philippines is just beginning to join the economic growth spurt of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
"Mike Velarde is a new kind of prophet, a prophet of financial capitalism," said Alex Magno, a political scientist. "This is a religion in the age of portfolio investment."
Its base, he said, is among the 700,000 overseas workers who are the nation's leading earners of foreign exchange, sending home $8 billion to $10 billion a year. El Shaddai has chapters in 30 countries where Filipinos work as maids, entertainers and construction workers.
It is a solid financial foundation for a religious movement that asks its followers not only to donate 10 percent of their earnings but also to offer "seed money" that will help them reap great financial returns.
"Remember this: whoever sows (gives) sparingly will also reap (receive) sparingly, and whoever sows (gives) generously will reap (receive) generously," an El Shaddai pamphlet says, paraphrasing the Bible.
The transactions are straightforward. Donation envelopes at the rally include a space on which a worshiper can describe the reward he hopes for.
"I call it transactional spirituality," said Randy David, a Philippine sociologist. "You get something for your spirituality: a visa, a job abroad. Or maybe you get cured of an illness, or you win your wife or your husband back if they are alienated."
It is a transaction that Mr. Velarde happily acknowledges he is engaged in himself. His literature tells and retells his personal story of real-estate investments that paid off, after a period of travail, thanks to his faith.
"He used to sell real estate," Mr. David said. "I think he has found it more lucrative to sell religion."
Like some American evangelists who collect large donations, Mr. Velarde has come under fire here for his financial dealings.
He has been criticized by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission for irregularities in stock offerings from companies he controls, and a former associate has accused him of embezzling millions of dollars in El Shaddai funds.
Mr. Velarde turns these setbacks into grist for his sermons, incorporating them into the personal narrative that is his central parable of hardships overcome.
It is a pattern he teaches to his followers. His rallies are punctuated by the "testimonies" of believers who say El Shaddai has changed their lives.
"I had a heart attack, I lost my business and my husband left me," said a member of the crowd, Cecilia Rene. "But the Lord took care of that. Now I have a good business, my husband is with me and I have a healthy body."
Kate Wiegele, an American anthropologist who has studied El Shaddai, said these narratives follow a pattern set by Mr. Velarde's own personal story and are at the heart of the movement's appeal.
"People learn to re-read their lives in terms of a 'before' and an 'after,' " she said. "When you analyze their stories, it is not clear whether their lives are actually better than before. Sometimes the narrative may not completely fit but they feel like it fits. It is a narrative of hope."
The popularity of the movement may also reflect a sluggishness in the established Catholic Church. El Shaddai claims allegiance to the church, and followers are encouraged to continue to attend Catholic services.
But in the huge crowd here, many people said they had come for a feeling of fellowship and spiritual excitement that was lacking in traditional services.
"I am still a churchgoer, but here, the word of God is more expanded," Mrs. Rene said. "People are more intimate with each other, and there is gladness and joy everywhere. In the church sometimes you feel people are silent and cold."
Like almost everything in this politically engaged nation, where campaign rallies often resemble revival meetings, El Shaddai has joined the political fray.
In the last presidential election, in 1992, its open-air services with their huge televised audiences became an obligatory stop on the campaign trail. At one point Fidel V. Ramos, who is now President, found himself shaking hands uncomfortably with the flamboyant former First Lady, Imelda Marcos, under the beaming gaze of Mr. Velarde.
Now with another election approaching next year, the inevitable question is being asked: Will Mr. Velarde himself run for President?
"Personally, I am not interested in it, but I cannot close any avenues," he said the other day, suggesting the possibility of a new chapter in his personal narrative. "Everybody is pushing me. As you know, only God knows the future."

HEADLINE: Aging A-Plant In New Jersey May Be Closed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., April 10

 BODY:
Owners of the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant, one of the nation's oldest, said today that they were exploring options to sell or close it by 2000.
Fred D. Hafer, president of General Public Utilities Corp., said the plant, in central New Jersey, was one of the least cost-efficient of the nation's nuclear plants and would be too expensive to operate once free-market competition begins for electrical customers in New Jersey in the next few years. 
 The announcement comes four months after the owners of the Connecticut Yankee plant decided to close it. Power industry experts have noted that changing economics and abundant power from non-nuclear sources have put older, smaller nuclear plants like Oyster Creek and Connecticut Yankee in peril.
Mr. Hafer said the company was publicly discussing its plans now, before making a final decision, to show the investment community that the company was taking aggressive and decisive steps before electricity prices were decontrolled.
The response was quick: G.P.U.'s stock rose 50 cents today in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $31.75.
Mr. Hafer said deregulation was the "driving force" behind the planning, and cautioned that a possible sale or a shutdown in 2000 -- nine years before Oyster Creek's operating license expires -- should not be interpreted as a negative view of the future of the nuclear power industry.
Currently, G.P.U. officials said, it costs 3.7 cents to generate each kilowatt-hour of electricity at Oyster Creek, while a kilowatt-hour fetches only 2.2 cents from retail customers. Costs for nuclear fuel and operations, including the plant's $45 million annual payroll, account for 3.2 of the 3.7 cents, a company spokesman, John Fidler, said. He said only about eight of the nation's other 100 nuclear power plants have higher operational and fuel costs.
Mr. Hafer said G.P.U., which has not ruled out continuing to operate Oyster Creek until its license expires in 2009, planned to make a decision by late summer or early fall. That is about the time the company must file the restructuring plan required by the Board of Public Utilities, the New Jersey regulatory agency overseeing the decontrol of electricity rates in the state.
Under current plans, deregulation is to start in October 1998, with 5 percent of the state's 3.3 million electricity customers to be allowed to shop for the cheapest rates. More customers are to be phased in over six-month intervals, until all are free to choose suppliers by April 2001.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a firm advocate of deregulation, has said she wants a 5 to 10 percent reduction in electricity rates under a free market. But Mr. Hafer and other G.P.U. officials said today that despite cost-saving measures in recent years, Oyster Creek remained too uneconomical to provide much of a reduction for the 200,000 customers it serves in central New Jersey.
Power generated by the plant has also been used in Pennsylvania and Maryland.
Mr. Fidler, the G.P.U. spokesman, said the company had been reducing costs for the last five years. "But we're just not able to do it quicker than the prices are falling," he said. "A buyer may have solutions we're not thinking of."
The plant, located in the hamlet of Forked River a few miles west of Barnegat Bay, was opened in 1969. At the time, it was the nation's third nuclear generating plant. Construction cost $90 million.
The company's asking price, if it opts to sell, would be $700 million, Mr. Hafer said. That figure, he said, represents G.P.U.'s net investment over the plant's 28-year life.
Much of the money was spent, Mr. Hafer said, for improved storage of radioactive wastes and for new equipment to enhance safety after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant 18 years ago. G.P.U. also owns Three Mile Island.
Mr. Hafer refused to speculate on the prospects of finding a buyer if a decision to sell was made. "We'll give it our best shot," he said.
But some industry experts said finding a buyer was unlikely. Dan Scotto, an analyst for Bear Stearns, said: "Who is going to buy a nuclear plant that is 30 years old?"
G.P.U. officials say Oyster Creek has two major drawbacks. It is small, with about 620 megawatts of generating capacity, and has no room to add a second reactor to increase capacity.
Other plants around the country have double Oyster Creek's capacity and are still able to satisfy staffing requirements of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the same size labor force -- 900 workers -- as Oyster Creek.
New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities must approve any plan for sale or closure. Philip Leary, a spokesman for the board, said a review would focus on two points: how G.P.U. planned to replace Oyster Creek's electricity and what the impact would be on jobs, customers' rates and the environment.
G.P.U. officials said today they had no plans to build any new generating plants in central New Jersey. But they said there was a possibility that other companies would build electrical plants powered by gas-fired turbines. Such plants have become common around the nation. If such a plant one day replaced Oyster Creek, G.P.U. could buy and distribute its electricity, Mr. Fidler said.
Some utility analysts said a possible sale or early closing made sense.
"It's better to close it now and have the impact on the financial condition at this point so that they can prepare themselves for competition," said Steve Fetter, an analyst for Fitch Research.
And Mr. Scotto said that while closing the plant -- a complicated, highly regulated affair -- would cost about $400 million, much of the money had already been put away.
The announcement also prompted criticism. In the New Jersey Assembly, John S. Wisniewski, Democrat of Middlesex County, called for a bar on sale or closure. "G.P.U. is ceasing to be a generating utility in new Jersey," he said. "It has abandoned its New Jersey employees. It has abandoned numerous communities. The utility has essentially become a broker of electricity, a power reseller."

HEADLINE: Housing Chief Says U.S. Waiver Won't Mean Rent Rises

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The chairman of the New York City Housing Authority said yesterday that if the authority were given much wider latitude by Federal officials to manage its properties, it would "absolutely" not use that new power to increase rents, evict tenants or demolish buildings.
The chairman, Ruben Franco, said the authority wanted a Federal waiver from most public housing regulations so it could experiment with policies that might help it weather sharp cuts in Federal subsidies. But he repeatedly emphasized that he would not use that flexibility to raise rents, even though such waivers are intended to give local officials more control over setting rents. 
 "This project, if we get selected, is going to be something positive for the residents of public housing, positive for the New York City Housing Authority, not negative," Mr. Franco said at a news conference.
The authority said on Wednesday that it would apply for the waiver, touching off opposition from some advocacy groups, which asserted that Federal officials needed to continue to supervise the authority closely to safeguard the rights of tenants. The groups also questioned whether a waiver would lead to sharp increases in rents.
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to grant waivers to up to 30 housing authorities across the nation, exempting them from longstanding rules that restrict how they can spend government subsidies, how much rent they can charge and what kind of people they must house.
Congress established the program to find creative strategies that would help the nation's public housing, which is poorly managed in many cities, though not New York. The city's authority is the nation's biggest and among its best regarded.
Much of the controversy over the authority's waiver application has swirled around an important Federal regulation, known as the Brooke Amendment, that limits rents in public housing to a maximum of 30 percent of tenants' incomes. H.U.D. officials say authorities that get waivers do not have to abide by the Brooke Amendment and that the only guideline is that rents be "reasonable."
But Mr. Franco said that in its application for a waiver, the authority would tell H.U.D. that it wanted to keep the 30 percent ceiling as part of the regulatory framework that it would establish to replace the Federal rules. No matter what, he said, tenants would not pay more than 30 percent of their incomes in rent.
Mr. Franco stressed that the waiver would help the authority serve tenants who are struggling with cuts in benefits mandated by the new Federal welfare law. Under existing rules, if tenants on welfare earn money from jobs, they often have to pay part of that income as extra rent. But with a waiver, the authority could let such tenants keep more of their income.
Mr. Franco acknowledged that the authority might try to generate more money for its budget by raising the rents of some tenants who are paying far less than the 30 percent, bringing them closer to the cap, though not exceeding it. The authority has the power to do that now even without a waiver.
Some advocacy groups said they were skeptical of Mr. Franco's promise to keep the 30 percent ceiling, contending that the authority had been so squeezed by Federal budget cuts in recent years that it might decide that it has no choice but to try to use the waiver to raise rents.
"What guarantees are there?" asked David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society. "What happens when the first recession hits in 18 months, and the city desperately needs more money?"

HEADLINE: Proud but Cornered, Mobutu Can Only Hope

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, April 10

 BODY:
By the time President Mobutu Sese Seko named a general this week to rule Zaire under a state of emergency, people here seemed to have lost count of the aging dictator's proliferating Governments. After all, the new Prime Minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, who was named late Wednesday to manage Mr. Mobutu's declining hold on power, is Zaire's third head of Government in less than a week.
What is worse for Mr. Mobutu, who was once all-powerful, few here now seem to accord him the discretion to do much more than decide in the coming days how he would like to end his 31-year rule, which, excluding the reigns of monarchs, exceeds that of any current head of state except Fidel Castro. 
 From around the world, statements declaring the Mobutu era over have been multiplying with startling speed in the last 24 hours, unleashed, it seems, by a declaration Wednesday by the White House press secretary that "Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history."
As if upping the ante, Zaire's former colonial power, Belgium, declared today that the Mobutu era had already been over for some time. And even in France, Mr. Mobutu's most devoted supporter in recent years, Prime Minister Alain Juppe called him "a tired dictator" tonight.
All the belated disavowals from countries that long supported Mr. Mobutu's rule pale, however, in comparison with the reality the Government faces on the ground.
Fresh from his capture of Zaire's second-largest city, Lubumbashi, Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader who has stripped half the country and the vast majority of its wealth from Government control, issued an ultimatum Wednesday that has every ring of seriousness about it: Surrender power within three days, or else.
And if that were not enough, Etienne Tshisekedi, the Prime Minister that Mr. Mobutu dismissed on Wednesday during a violent army crackdown on civilian opponents, today declared that Mr. Mobutu's latest Government and his state of emergency were illegal.
Mr. Tshisekedi threatened to start a campaign of civil disobedience and have the President tried on treason charges.
For Mr. Mobutu, the choices that lie ahead are agonizing, and can make a huge difference to the future of his country and help decide what little of his tattered reputation he can carry into history.
When Western ambassadors met with the new Prime Minister today to complain that General Likulia's Government represents little more than a desperate and illegal military coup d'etat, the self-justifying response that reportedly came back was that Mr. Kabila's invasion from Rwanda was itself illegal.
Mr. Tshisekedi, who is widely believed to be Zaire's most popular politician, has no power to enforce any judgment against the President, but enjoys legal legitimacy to go with his grass roots support.
General Likulia, for his part, enjoys the confidence of Mr. Mobutu and the qualified support of elements of the political class and of some Western diplomats, who are afraid of seeing either Mr. Tshisekedi or Mr. Kabila sweep Mr. Mobutu from office and assume power with few restraints.
Mr. Mobutu is said to be the prisoner of his immense pride and a self-serving entourage that is eager to hold on, to the bitter end, to whatever residual power there is in Kinshasa.
When French emissaries suggested late last month that Mr. Mobutu relinquish power, people in the Presidential entourage say their leader was so shocked that he appeared to suffer a heart attack.
For people in these circles, composed of Mr. Mobutu's northern ethnic kinsmen and other financial beneficiaries of his decades of corrupt rule, the cause is never lost, no matter how desperate it seems.
One of the die-hards, Mr. Mobutu's own son Kongulu, for example, strapped on a black bulletproof vest and led the crackdown on Mr. Tshisekedi's supporters in the streets of Kinshasa on Wednesday. The crackdown barred the man who is generally considered to be the legitimate Prime Minister from occupying his offices.
General Likulia, a respected academic and a stern law and order man, ruled out Mr. Mobutu's departure "until after elections," and in an interview published today compared the Government's battlefield position to that of the ultimately victorious Soviet Army in the face of Hitler's winter assault.
But realistically, the most Mr. Mobutu could hope to negotiate, diplomats here say, is to remain in the country, retire to his palatial home in the northern town of Gbadolite and be allowed to die in his country with assurances that his family will remain unharmed.
Mr. Mobutu was once considered the consummate politician, something of a Central African Machiavelli. But at each step in this crisis, by the time the aging and hesitant dictator came to an important decision, the context on the ground had shifted so radically as to render it meaningless.
Mr. Kabila, sensing his imminent victory and perhaps eager for good publicity, has made an offer along these lines to Mr. Mobutu. But with a race for power shaping up between the rebel leader and the just-ousted Mr. Tshisekedi, who is Mr. Mobutu's longest-standing political rival, these terms could easily be outstripped by events.
The worst risk, by virtually all accounts here, is that Mr. Mobutu and his most committed followers delude themselves into thinking that somehow they can prevail, or alternately, believing they must lose, that the country should go down in flames.
The historical rationale for Mr. Mobutu's rule and for much of its Western support has been that no one else has been capable of holding together Africa's third-largest and third most populous country -- a mosaic of 250 often competing ethnic groups.
Mr. Mobutu could very well decide to make this prophecy come true by holding a last stand in Kinshasa with loyalist troops of the Special Presidential Division and the Civil Guard, which are drawn from his own tribe.
If the past is any indicator, Kinshasa would then be set to relive the devastating pillages of 1991 and 1993 that took hundreds of lives and wiped out one quarter of the economy. But this time, with troops fighting with their backs to the wall, it could be far worse.
A member of a loyalist unit toured a downtown hotel here late Wednesday warning foreign journalists that precisely this scenario was in the works. "We are not going anywhere," he said. "We are going to battle it out until the last man."
Others around Mr. Mobutu see the sense in avoiding this kind of outcome, and yet seem powerless to avert it.
"I don't know what they want to fight for," said one army insider. "There is no dignity in destroying the country or having to flee. But no one knows how to tell that to the boss."

Chart: "WHO'S WHO: Four Faces of a Deadly Showdown"
 
The President and His General
 
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO, 66, has ruled Zaire since taking power in a 1965 military coup. His army is officially listed as having 100,000 troops, but years of widespread desertions, payroll fraud and, recently, losses to the rebels have reduced its strength to no more than 30,000.
Zaire has been largely deprived of international military assistance since 1990, and the Government forces, which were once trained by the United States, France, Israel, China and North Korea, are now incapable of mounting most field operations. In recent battles with the rebels, Mr. Mobutu's troops have fled cities one after another, looting them as they leave.
Mr. Mobutu's most reliable forces are the Special Presidential Division and the Civil Guard, two corps whose members are formed almost entirely from Mr. Mobutu's own Ngbandi ethnic group in Equatoria province.

GEN. LIKULIA BOLONGO LINGBANGI, 58, appointed extralegally this week by Mr. Mobutu as Prime Minister, was defense minister and deputy prime minister in the Government of prime minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo, which was ousted early this month.
A longtime Mobutu loyalist and native of the President's home region, General Likulia was involved in overseeing the disastrous war effort against rebels in the country's east. As political tension rises in the capital, one of his biggest challenges will be avoiding a repeat of the wholesale looting of Kinshasa by soldiers that has taken place in 1991 and 1993.

The Opposition Leader and the Rebel Leader
 
ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI, 64, whose appointment as Prime Minister a week ago was immediately disavowed by Mr. Mobutu, is the President's longest-standing civilian political opponent. He broke with the Mobutu dictatorship in 1980 and founded the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, which waged a long struggle for democratization before Mr. Mobutu was obliged, in 1990, to allow multiparty politics.
Mr. Tshisekedi was named prime minister before, after a 1991 accord that undertook to reform Zaire's political life, but each time he was removed after run-ins with Mr. Mobutu, whose authority he repeatedly challenged.
 Mr. Tshisekedi is from West Kasai Province, and has deep support in central Zaire and in Kinshasa. He is a member of the important Luba tribe.
 
LAURENT DESIRE KABILA, 56, the leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo, has gained control of nearly half of Zaire in the space of six months.
A lifelong revolutionary and Mobutu opponent, Mr. Kabila cut his political teeth as a follower of the nationalist leader Patrice Lumumba, who became the first prime minister of Zaire in 1960. For years, Mr. Kabila was a committed Marxist who waged a low-grade insurrection in the mountains of eastern Zaire.
He is a member of the Mulubakat, a Luba group from the northern part of Shaba province, but has quickly gained popularity wherever his movement has won control.
Today, Mr. Kabila's movement is believed to have as many as 30,000 members who are trained and often led by soldiers and officers from the armies of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. (The New York Times)(pg. A6)

HEADLINE: Wages May Be Heading Up, But Prices Hold Their Own

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The people who work at the Wal-Marts, J. C. Penneys and Nordstroms of America are doing better lately. They received pay increases over the last year averaging more than 4 percent -- the sort of raises that have Wall Street ablaze with talk of coming inflation. But rather than increase prices, the nation's big retailers are finding other ways to get the money for those wage gains.
They shifted to less expensive suppliers. They stockpiled fewer goods and developed more efficient ways of moving merchandise from warehouse to the selling floor. Through mergers, some cut back on duplicate staffing. And some stores encouraged shoppers to buy higher-priced goods, promoting brand-name labels that carry higher profit margins. 
 For all the fears of wage increases, there are no signs that they are going to translate anytime soon into the kind of inflationary pressures that cause American business to raise prices. Even as hourly wages have risen for some groups of workers, consumer inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index has remained at a fairly steady annual rate of 3 percent or so. More remarkable, the price index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, is trending downward, running at an annual rate of 2.5 percent this year.
American companies are driven mainly by fear that they will lose customers to competitors if they raise prices too much. One reason that can happen is that industry has kept adding capacity to meet growing demand at a much faster pace in the 1990's than it did over the last quarter-century, according to Government data. With more supply, customers can shop for low prices.
The hold-down on inflation has been so effective that Patrick Jackman, the chief of the Labor Department division that tabulates the Consumer Price Index, said in an interview this week that the current situation was unprecedented in modern memory. "Certainly since World War II, we have not seen inflation so well behaved this far along in an economic expansion," Mr. Jackman said. "I don't see price pressures anywhere."
Paradoxically, for the Federal Reserve and for Wall Street that is small comfort. It is even a bit inconvenient. By nature wary of the threat of inflation, the Federal Reserve and the markets normally react to an economy as thriving as this one by pushing interest rates up.
The idea is to slow the economy enough to force companies to restrain wage and price increases. In the past, they have generally had evidence of incipient inflation to justify their rate increases, which require justification because rate increases are designed to lead not only to slower economic growth but also to less job creation. This time, however, the Fed and the markets have had to fly blind, acting not so much on solid data as on a traditional assumption: that strong economic growth and low unemployment inevitably results in rising inflation, even if no one can see the inflation yet.
"I don't know where the point is that strong growth intersects with inflation," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant, "but at some point it must." Mr. Bernstein endorses the Fed's decision in March to raise short-term interest rates ahead of the expected increase in inflation. Indeed, the Fed must act ahead of any real signs of inflation, many investors say, if it is to avoid being caught flat-footed and forced to react more harshly later on in ways that are likely to push the economy into a recession.
Bond market traders, convinced that the Fed plans more rate increases, have pushed up long-term rates in their daily trading. And these higher rates will soon mean higher interest payments for business and consumer loans, mortgages and car loans.
The case for raising interest rates now, ahead of any signs of higher inflation, is built mainly on the fear that low unemployment will push up labor costs.
The unemployment rate has been less than 5.5 percent since last June. The last time it was this low for this long, in the late 1980's, labor shortages did indeed cause employers to bid up wages for scarce workers, and business raised prices to help meet higher payrolls. This time unemployment of less than 5.5 percent is turning out to be much more benign, prompting some experts to recommend that the Fed allow unemployment to fall further.
"If you experiment when the inflation rate is low, if it goes up a bit, you have not done violence," said Joel Popkin, an economic consultant.
The case for experimentation lies in the character of this expansion. The shortages that bring on inflation involve shortages of factory and office space, machinery, equipment and labor. But starting in 1994, productive capacity has been growing rapidly, matching a relatively brief spurt in the mid 1980's, and exceeding any other period since the mid-1960's. High levels of investment have contributed to this growth. And another Government measure, showing how much of the expanded capacity is now being used, is below the level that is typical so far into an expansion.
The labor supply -- the total number of people at work or seeking work -- has also expanded more than expected. It typically grows by little more than 1 percent a year, but recently the labor supply has been growing at a 2 percent annual rate.
The jump reflects several factors: immigration, welfare recipients moving more quickly to work, more older men working and a gain once again, after a period of no growth, in the percentage of working-age women seeking jobs. "Family income is growing very slowly," said Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton University, "and that is drawing more people into work."
Profits also play a role. By most measures, they have reached their highest levels since the 1960's. That might not last, but right now corporations have flexibility, economists say, to pay for some wage increases out of these higher profits.
"There is definitely wiggle room," said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Corporations have not passed on all their savings in health care costs. Some has gone to profits, and this can be shifted to wages if necessary."
And it might be. Worldwide, many industries can produce more than they can sell, and they sacrifice price increases in the struggle for market share. What's more, the prices of various commodities -- oil, chemicals, metals, paper -- have been falling lately after sharp gains the previous couple of years.
A stronger dollar also makes imports relatively less expensive. "Steel is coming into the United States from countries you never heard of," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a data gathering operation. "Almost every industry where capacity is a little tight, you can turn to imports for relief."
But it is not just foreign competition that helps hold down prices. When Rubbermaid tried to charge Wal-Mart more for plastic garbage cans, the nation's biggest retailer simply shifted to another, less expensive supplier.

HEADLINE: Parking Ticket Uproar at U.N.: For Now, Peace Has No Chance

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Faced with a storm of protest from United Nations diplomats over a plan to force them to pay their parking tickets, the State Department backed away from an agreement to remove the license plates of diplomatic scofflaws yesterday, igniting a verbal battle with the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over the value of the United Nations to New York City.
In a diplomatic opera that veered all day between high comedy and real furor, a matter as banal as an unpaid parking ticket escalated into a full-blown international incident. 
 A United Nations committee voted to convene the General Assembly later this month to consider the parking issue and possibly take it to the World Court. A Russian diplomat accused the city of towing away his mission's bus, complete with passengers and driver, from a diplomatic space yesterday afternoon on the Upper East Side of Manhattan (the police said the bus was hooked up to a tow truck, but eventually let go after negotiations).
Mayor Giuliani, who said the international body was on the verge of becoming a laughingstock, began talking half-seriously about the fancy hotels and apartment buildings that could be built on the site if United Nations members carried through on their threats to leave.
Speaking to a group of reporters in his office, he said: "They are making a little bit of a joke out of the U.N. by threatening to take a parking violations case to the World Court. It was not put together by treaty to argue out special-interest parking situations for diplomats."
Instead of settling wars and resolving human rights violations, he said, the institution was "defining diplomacy down" by arguing about parking tickets.
Mr. Giuliani was no kinder to the State Department, which just last month, in a public ceremony, signed an agreement with the city to force diplomats to pay their parking tickets on the threat of removing their plates. With State Department officials now seeking to remove the teeth from that agreement, the Mayor accused them of cowering to overblown United Nations threats to leave the United States over the parking rules, and said the diplomats' bluff should be called.
"If they'd like to leave New York over parking tickets, then we can find another use for that area of town," he said. "It happens to be just about the most valuable real estate in the world, not just in the United States. That is enormously valuable real estate, and with the vacancy rates that exist in the city of New York, can you imagine what we could do with that?"
In case anyone thought he was bluffing, he had city lawyers check the United Nations lease to determine who gets the riverfront property if the institution leaves town. (Answer: the Federal Government could use it; if it did not want it, the city would have next crack.)
State Department officials confirmed that the outrage of the diplomats had led them to reassess the agreement. At the time, the city was seeking some way to collect the millions of dollars annually in unpaid parking tickets from diplomats who park illegally or do not bother to put quarters in meters. The issue has been a perennial irritant, particularly for residents and businesses near the United Nations on the East Side, but it flared up anew in December when two diplomats from Russia and Belarus got into a scuffle with the police after parking at a hydrant.
Under the agreement, the city promised to provide 111 more parking spaces to United Nations missions, and the State Department pledged to rescind the license plates of diplomatic cars with tickets that were not paid within a year.
Within days, however, ambassadors and consuls were complaining that the plan violated their diplomatic immunity, and the United Nations legal office issued an opinion that said the agreement broke international law. Yesterday, Thomas E. Burns Jr., the State Department's deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Foreign Missions, said the United Nations might have a point, and said the department was asking the city to consider an adjustment in the signed agreement.
"I think the city will have to look at what their ultimate objectives are, and see how an adjustment based on an allegation will look in the context of that position," he said. "Our judgment is that we can work through these impediments and still meet both the needs of the city and international law."
But city officials said they had no intention of making any changes. Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, accused the State Department of reneging on a promise, and said the department had suggested instead that it merely try to persuade missions to pay their tickets rather than removing their plates. That, he said, would be tantamount to no plan at all.
Mr. Mastro fired off a strong letter insisting that the State Department stand by the agreement, and vowed to remove immediately the 111 extra parking spaces if the plan falls through. But both he and the Mayor acknowledged that the city has no way to force the State Department to honor the agreement.
"We're hopeful the State Department won't back down," the Mayor said. "I don't think they'll back down, because they'll lose a lot of credibility if they back down."
But the Clinton Administration is under a great deal of pressure from the United Nations. The Secretary General, Kofi Annan, appealed to the United States to consider the concerns expressed by the diplomats, said Victor Marrero, the American representative on the Committee on Relations with the Host Country. At the end of a three-hour meeting, the committee voted 13 to 1 yesterday to send the matter to the General Assembly, with Mr. Marrero's the sole negative vote. Britain abstained.
Mr. Marrero urged the committee not to invite ridicule by sending the matter to the 185-member General Assembly, which he said should be more concerned about such matters as the civil war in Zaire. That prompted Zaire's Acting Ambassador, Lukabu Khabouji, to suggest that the city should worry more about the safety of New Yorkers using public transportation.
Possibly unaware that crime in the subways has significantly decreased, Mr. Khabouji said that considering "all the incidents that take place daily in the subways and the buses, I myself would not take the risk" of using public transportation.
Several committee members said they had experienced a blitz of tickets since the agreement went into effect on April 1, though the city said the police are continuing normal enforcement efforts.
Mr. Giuliani can hardly lose on the issue among New York voters, who have seen so many parking abuses that many have little love for the United Nations, despite the $3 billion or so it contributes to the local economy. But for the first three years of his term, he seemed to bend over backward not to offend the institution, concerned when some smaller United Nations agencies began considering moves outside the city.
With an election approaching, that concern seems to be behind him.
"The consolation prize, should they leave, would be a windfall for the United States, a tremendously valuable property to New York City and state," he said. "In a fairly short period of time, it would start to become profit-making property, because it would be back on the tax rolls."
Then, as reporters were leaving his office, he let out a cackle.

HEADLINE: President Says the Government Will Hire 10,000 Off Welfare

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the Federal Government would hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients over the next four years -- including 6 at the White House -- to do his share in moving people from welfare to work.
Appearing with two government workers who formerly received welfare, Mr. Clinton announced the hiring goals and said that welfare rolls had been reduced by 20 percent, or 2.8 million people, during his first four years in office. The President said he expected an additional 2 million people to leave welfare in the next four years. 
 Most of them are expected to be accepted into entry-level jobs, including 4,000 in the Commerce Department, 1,600 in the Defense Department, 800 in the Department of Veterans Affairs and 600 in the Social Security Administration. The Commerce Department expects to meet its goal largely by hiring temporary workers to conduct the next census, in 2000.
Mr. Clinton said a study from the Council of Economic Advisers suggested that over 40 percent of the drop in the welfare rolls was attributed to improvement in the economy.
"About a third of the drop in the welfare rolls was due to specific welfare reform efforts," he added. "And a quarter of the drop was due to other efforts like the 50 percent increase in child support collections."
Among the more populous states, only California reported a rise in the number of welfare recipients over the last four years, to 2,474,689 this past January, from 2,425,121 in January 1993, an increase of 2 percent. The increase in California is ascribed to the state's population growth, recession and "larger number of U.S. citizens born to illegal immigrants," said Bruce N. Reed, a domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton
In the same period, New York reported a 9 percent drop in the number of welfare recipients, New Jersey a 27 percent decline and Connecticut a 3 percent decrease.

HEADLINE: BERLIN COURT SAYS TOP IRAN LEADERS ORDERED KILLINGS

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 10

 BODY:
A court concluded here today that the highest levels of Iran's "political leadership" ordered the September 1992 killing of exiled Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
After a three-year trial that included testimony by 166 witnesses, the presiding judge ruled that the killing of four dissidents at the Mykonos restaurant were orchestrated by a secretive "Committee for Special Operations" in Teheran whose members included the country's spiritual leader, the President, the Foreign Minister and high security officials. 
 The ruling reinforced the Clinton Administration's assertions that Iran's Islamic rulers sponsor terrorism and fueled demands by the United States for Germany and other European allies to end what they call their "critical dialogue" with Iran, a policy that permits flourishing trade with a land that Washington wants ostracized.
While the judge's opinion did not identify the top officials by name, German federal prosecutors during the trial directly accused Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of ordering and approving the killings.
"The Iranian political leadership ordered this crime," said the Judge, Frithjof Kubsch. "They made a decision to silence an uncomfortable voice. This is an official liquidation measure ordered without a verdict."
In today's ruling, the most far-reaching judicial condemnation of Iran's leadership made in Germany, two of the five men accused of involvement in the killing were given life sentences, one was acquitted and two were given jail terms of between 5 and 11 years.
The men were first indicted in May 1993, with prosecutors saying the killings had been the work of Vevak, the Iranian security service, which has been held responsible for a string of killings of exiled political figures and Kurdish dissidents in Paris, Rome, Geneva and Vienna. Until now, however, there has been no case of this magnitude that has implicated the highest level of leaders in Iran.
In Washington the State Department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, immediately seized on the verdict, saying it corroborated America's "long-held view that Iran's sponsorship of terrorism is authorized at senior levels of the Iranian Government."
Mr. Burns also chided the European allies for continuing to maintain ties and trade with Iran. "The 'critical dialogue' has not succeeded in moderating Iran's behavior," he said.
He called on "our European partners" to join the American economic sanctions against Teheran, but added that "the German authorities will now have to draw their own conclusions about how they wish to do business with Iran after this strong and unambiguous verdict."
The German Foreign Ministry said it would not participate "for the foreseeable future" in the policy of "critical dialogue" with Iran -- a formulation that fell short of suspending the policy altogether.
Mr. Burns said later that he was pleased with that decision, adding, "We hope that the European Union will join the United States in a realistic policy that is aimed at containing Iran and containing its ability to further destabilize the Middle East and to murder its own citizens abroad," he said.
Within hours of the ruling, the German Foreign Ministry said that it was recalling its Ambassador to Teheran and that four Iranian diplomats would be expelled. A Foreign Ministry spokesman also said European officials in Brussels were considering withdrawing their envoys and suspending the "critical dialogue."
Iran, for its part, withdrew its Ambassador in Bonn, Hossein Musavian, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Teheran called the ruling "baseless, malicious, one-sided and unfair."
Iranian security forces were deployed at the German Embassy and the German Ambassador's residence in Teheran, apparently to prevent a recurrence of protests.
In The Hague, a spokesman for the European Union said all 15 members of the body had been invited to recall their ambassadors from Teheran. The spokesman, Peter Mollema, also said in a statement that "no progress" could be made in Europe's relationship with Iran "while Iran flouts international norms and indulges in acts of terrorism."
Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner, but Iranian business accounts for only a tiny fraction of Germany's imports and exports, giving Germany huge potential leverage over Iran that Washington maintains should be employed to force political change.
German politicians from both the Government and opposition parties seemed reluctant today to call for an all-out breach in relations with Teheran.
"Breaking off diplomatic relations would be a serious mistake," said Gunter Verheugen, of the opposition Social Democrats. "But it would also be a serious mistake if we carried on as if nothing had happened."
Judge Kubsch said the "Committee for Special Operations" had entrusted Iran's Minister of Intelligence, Ali Fallahiyan, with the killings, in which two heavily armed men loosed a hail of gunfire on a Kurdish opposition leader, Sadiq Sarafkindi, and three colleagues, killing all four. One gunman escaped.
In March, 1996, Germany issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Fallahiyan.
In his ruling today, Judge Kubsch said: "After Fallahiyan reported to the Committee for Special Operations and the committee decided on the liquidation of Dr. Sarafkindi, the panel entrusted him with carrying out the subsequent operations.
"There was no religious background to this act. The reasons, which led to their cruel conclusion, were purely related to the politics of power. The fact that this was ordered by the Government of a state that calls itself a 'state of God' changes nothing. This religious embellishment does not hide the fact that the concern of the ruling regime in Iran was to eliminate opposition beyond its borders."
Iran has denied any involvement in the killings, as did the accused. Mahmud Mohamedi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Teheran, said after today's ruling, "We reject these conclusions, which are undocumented and influenced by political campaigns in anti-revolutionary and Zionist circles."
The court today supported prosecution allegations that Kazem Darabi, an Iranian who had worked in Berlin as a grocer, was an Iranian Government agent who planned the attack. The prosecution had also said that Abbas Rhayel, a Lebanese citizen, had been one of two gunmen who shot the Kurdish exiles to death. Both men were given life sentences today.
Two other Lebanese men were sentenced to between 5 and 11 years as accomplices.
The verdict drew wild cheers from hundreds of Iranian exiles who had demonstrated outside the courthouse to demand an end to Germany's relationship with Iran. Iranian Kurds also protested outside the Iranian Embassy in Bonn.
The trial opened on Oct. 28, 1993, three weeks after Mr. Fallahiyan appealed to the authorities to halt it. The hearings took a more dramatic turn in August, 1996, when Abdolhassan Bani Sadr, a former Iranian President, testified that the killings had been ordered by the highest authorities in Teheran.
His information came from conversations involving the allegations of an unidentified Iranian defector, known by German prosecutors as "Source C," who testified at closed hearings in October 1996.
One month later, as the prosecution began a three-day summation, orchestrated demonstrations broke out in Teheran outside the German Embassy, raising fears for the safety of the 500 German citizens living in Iran.
As today's verdict approached, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn advised Germans not to travel to Iran, despite an assurance by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati that "we support human values, and German nationals will have full security." The 15 European Union ambassadors were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Teheran today, Iranian officials said, and were assured of the safety of their citizens.
At the same time, though, Iran has already given a hint of part of its response. Two days ago, the official Iranian news agency reported that 1,000 relatives of Iranians killed in the Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988 would sue 24 German chemical companies accused of helping Iraq acquire chemical weapons.
Scores of Iranian exiles have been threatened, wounded or killed since the Government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi was overthrown in 1979. The most publicized case is the death sentence leveled against Salman Rushdie, the British author accused of blasphemy in 1989 for his book, "The Satanic Verses."
Several Iranian dissidents have been killed in Europe. In 1991, Shahpur Bakhtiar, the last Prime Minister under the Shah, was found with his throat slit at his villa in France. A French court linked his death to agents for Iran.In 1990 Kazem Rajavi, brother of the leader of an Iranian dissident group, was killed in Switzerland. Others have been killed in Asia and the Middle East.

Democrats on the Legislature's budget-writing committee today restored $400 million in cuts proposed by Gov. John G. Rowland and added several new welfare programs to soften the blow that is expected this fall when thousands of people begin to lose their welfare benefits.
Within minutes of the Appropriation Committee's vote, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, said he would veto the committee's budget if it was adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, and added that it left no room for a tax cut, a point the Democrats disputed. 
 The Governor also characterized the new spending plan as an attack on the hallmark of his administration: a state family welfare program that has imposed a 21-month limit on benefits, the nation's shortest. "They've tried to undo welfare reform," he said.
The budget is far from finished, and Mr. Rowland and the legislators agreed that today's vote simply set the next stage of negotiations. Legislators also said it was premature to talk about the budget's impact on the Governor's plans for a tax cut, as the state had not yet received updated revenue estimates for the coming fiscal year.
But the spending plan proposed today was a substantial departure from the two-year budget, starting July 1, that Mr. Rowland presented in February. While his proposal included a $365 million income tax cut and reductions in spending for education and public transportation, the committee added back much of that money and appeared to leave no room for an income tax cut.
Under the committee's plan, the state would spend about $20.9 billion over the next two years, about $395 million more than in Mr. Rowland's budget proposal.
The new plan was approved by a 33-to-18 vote this afternoon, breaking strictly along party lines.
The Democrats' plan increased spending by only about 2 percent over Mr. Rowland's proposal, with a substantial amount of the new money devoted to easing the transition from welfare to work.
One proposed $35 million program guaranteed "safety net" services, like rental assistance and emergency benefits, for people who lost benefits after 21 months and were found ineligible for an extension.
According to the state's plan, welfare recipients could continue to receive benefits if they were deemed unemployable or had failed to find a job that paid more than welfare after making a good-faith effort.
The Democrats also proposed a small monthly stipend after the 21 months expired for people who found work that paid more than welfare but left them below the poverty line. This would allow a family of three, which would lose its monthly welfare check of $543, to receive a supplemental check for another 15 months. The check would start at $200 and drop $10 each month.
While the Governor criticized these proposals as "subverting" the state's welfare plan, advocates for the poor argued that the Democrats had not gone far enough. "Instead of people falling off the cliff, they're rolling off," said Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for welfare advocacy groups.
Mr. Rowland also wanted to eliminate all welfare for single adults who are deemed employable, but Democrats said they should continue to receive Medicaid benefits. Those in homeless shelters and drug treatment programs would remain eligible for monthly checks of $200, down about $100 from the current level.
In addition, the Democrats rejected Mr. Rowland's plan to end railroad service on the Metro-North branch lines to Danbury and Waterbury and the Shoreline East line from New Haven to New London. Mr. Rowland's proposal to raise bus fares by a quarter was dropped, as was his plan to privatize some bus service in the Hartford area.
The single biggest change was in education. Aid to education from kindergarten through the 12th grade increased by about $70 million over the Governor's budget for the next two years, with substantial increases in early-childhood education programs and assistance to troubled urban school districts.
While Mr. Rowland had called for an across-the-board cut of 6 to 10 percent for the state's universities, the committee added back about three-fourths of that, as well as providing an additional $6 million each year for financial aid.
Although Republican lawmakers provided their own budget plan, which raised Mr. Rowland's spending proposal by 1 percent, they agreed with the Democrats' approach to the university systems.
"We saw your higher education proposal and thought it was better than ours," said State Senator Robert L. Genuario, a Norwalk Republican. "So we stole it."
Mr. Genuario added that the differences between the parties' budgets were significant, but not great. "The remarkable thing is not how far apart the committee budget and the minority caucus is, but rather how close it is," he said.

HEADLINE: Parties Inch Toward Budget Compromise

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Budget negotiators from the White House and Congress met today to lay out their differences on taxes, with Republicans pushing the Clinton Administration to accept bigger tax cuts and abandon some of its proposals for raising money to pay for them.
After their third consecutive afternoon of negotiations in a room in the basement of the Capitol, the two sides continued to inch toward compromise in their effort to eliminate the Federal deficit by the year 2002. But they said that they had not yet reached the point of making explicit deals on taxes or any of the other issues that divide them. 
 "We're moving in the right direction," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "But there are a lot of points of contention. Both sides have to give a lot to get where we want to go."
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the two sides were still in the "wince and grimace phase" as they listened to each other's priorities.
Republicans did not push the idea, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday, to eliminate entirely the capital gains tax and the estate tax, which are projected to generate more than $300 billion over the next five years. Mr. Gingrich made the proposal in a clear effort to shore up his credentials with his party's right wing, which had attacked him after he suggested last month that balancing the budget should be a higher priority than cutting taxes.
The negotiations are scheduled to continue on Friday and then next week, with both sides hoping they will lead to a meeting between President Clinton and the Republican Congressional leadership.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin presented participants at today's meeting with a rundown on the Administration's tax proposals, including breaks for families with children, college students and people selling homes. People in the meeting said the Administration did not offer any new initiatives or expand on its previous hints that it might be willing to consider a broad cut in the capital gains tax, a Republican priority.
The Administration plan calls for $98 billion in tax cuts, offset by $73 billion in revenue increases from closing tax loopholes, extending existing taxes and other measures.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pressed the Republican argument for deeper tax cuts than the Administration has offered, and said the Administration would have to drop many of its revenue-increasing measures because they amounted to tax increases.
In particular, Republicans said, Mr. Archer argued that there was little support in either party for three of the Administration's revenue increase proposals. These are an extension of a payroll tax that finances unemployment insurance, a recalculation of the way companies that export are taxed and a change in the way investors calculate the cost of stock and other assets when they sell them and face capital gains taxes.
Senator Roth and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader, support a package of $200 billion of tax cuts. But Republicans said today that they had tried to signal to the Administration that they would be willing to accept a lower figure.
Indeed, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken advocates of tax reduction, unveiled a compromise budget plan today that included net tax cuts of $98 billion, made up of about $140 billion in tax reductions offset by more than $40 billion in revenue increases, accounted for largely by an extension of a Federal tax on airline tickets that Congress has already approved this year.
In another sign of progress, Mr. Gramm, who heads the subcommittee on Medicare, said the Administration's latest proposal to reduce Medicare spending by $100 billion over the next five years was acceptable to him. Mr. Gramm has been among the most strident critics of the Administration's Medicare plans, and his support could lead to an accord on the contentious issue.

Welfare Cases Fall

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's welfare caseload fell more than 27 percent, to 256,000 from 350,000, in the last four years, according to a survey released yesterday.
Nationally, the caseload dropped 20 percent during those four years, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services reported.
A state jobs program is getting some 1,500 to 1,800 New Jersey residents off public assistance and into the work force each month, said Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Human Services. 
 But a strong economy is the main reason for the decline in the state's caseload, she said.

HEADLINE: A Revival In the Motor City;
U.S. Program Helps Return Industry to Depressed Area

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 10

 BODY:
For three generations, an enormous Cadillac factory stretched across eight blocks on the southwest side of the Motor City, providing a path to the middle class for tens of thousands of workers. It closed a decade ago, becoming a vast, derelict monument to the decay of a great manufacturing center. The surrounding neighborhood deteriorated almost as fast as the weeds grew up around the factory. The only high-paying job nearby was drug dealing.
But for the last two years, the inner city where the factory is situated -- an endless sprawl of blocks so bleak that rundown houses can sell for less than used cars -- has been a magnet for business. 
 Since 1994, when the Federal Government designated an 18.35-square-mile stretch of the city as one of six urban empowerment zones in the country, 29 companies have announced plans to spend $2.17 billion opening, expanding or relocating their operations in the Detroit zone. This week, the Chrysler Corporation pledged to increase its spending in the area, where it builds Jeep Grand Cherokees, to $1.65 billion from $750 million, making it by far the biggest investor.
Indeed, when Vice President Al Gore and redevelopment specialists come here for a conference next week, they are expected to give the empowerment zone, with its Federal development grants and tax breaks for businesses, much of the credit for beginning to bring back Detroit.
But city officials and business leaders say the picture is far more complex. The zone's role has chiefly been symbolic -- a catalyst for other, much more powerful forces at work in the area's economy. Foremost is the lure of lucrative contracts with Detroit's Big Three. With the auto industry not only on a roll but aggressively pursuing contracts with companies owned by members of minorities, the economic repercussions are rippling into the most poverty-stricken parts of Detroit.
Moreover, in sharp contrast to the 20-year reign of his predecessor, Detroit's new Mayor, Dennis W. Archer, is busily pursuing pro-business policies and working to narrow the divide between the mostly black city and the mostly white suburbs.
In this mix, what the empowerment zone designation accomplished, Mr. Archer said, was to herd representatives of businesses, community groups, banks and local government into the same room to help plan the city's development. The process, in other words, was more important than the $100 million in Federal grants and an estimated $250 million in tax breaks for Detroit businesses -- a Federal program described even by its Congressional backers as an urban policy on the cheap.
"The businesses are coming in not because of the tax breaks," Mr. Archer said. "They are finding it is a good place to do business."
The success of the program has certainly added to the sense that Detroit, after languishing for years as a symbol of urban decline in America, is coming back to life. For the city as a whole, the jobless rate has sunk to 9.1 percent from 17 percent in the 1992 recession, and crime has also fallen. The number of murders in Detroit declined from 513 in 1993 to 407 last year.
In some ways, Detroit's empowerment zone is set up like a giant shopping mall, with the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler instead of Macy's or Nordstrom as anchors to help attract other companies. At one end is the old Cadillac factory, which G.M. is turning into an industrial park. A half-hour's drive across town on the East side are two large Chrysler factories. At the northern tip of the zone is a new Cadillac factory, which G.M. built to replace the one it closed in 1987.
Nearly all the companies that have moved in or expanded sell their products to the auto industry. And when Detroit asked Washington for empowerment zone status, the Big Three American auto makers pledged to do business with the new companies and local banks pledged $1 billion in business and mortgage loans there over the 10-year life of the zone.
The 55-acre Cadillac factory is a good example of how the empowerment zone has worked. G.M. is turning it into an industrial park, and five auto supply companies have opened factories already. At least four more are on the way. Altogether the new businesses will create 1,000 jobs paying from $6 to $18 an hour.
For years, struggling with what to do with the giant eyesore, G.M. had been trying to find a way to "get this thing off of our books," William C. Brooks, the company's vice president for corporate affairs, said. No one would buy it. Meanwhile, G.M. was trying to do more business with minority suppliers, and simultaneously, some parts suppliers in the tight labor markets in Detroit's suburbs were running out of workers.
"Lo and behold, here comes the empowerment zone," Mr. Brooks said.
G.M. helped put together the following deal on one corner of the property: four auto parts companies with Hispanic owners would renovate a storage building on the old Cadillac complex, and banks would extend nontraditional loans to the companies. The four companies would buy the land from G.M. and hire workers for the new production lines. G.M. would then buy $50 million to $60 million in auto parts made by the small companies, which could each then point to the firm contracts with G.M. to assure the banks they would be able to pay back the loans.
In fact, all of the Big Three had already pledged to buy more supplies from minority-owned companies and have urged even their biggest suppliers to look to firms owned by minorities for at least 5 percent of their own purchases. While they set their goals years ago, their embrace of the empowerment zone underscored their commitment to a cause that has recently lost a great deal of popular and political support -- affirmative action.
And because the Big Three are so large, their purchases have the power to attract new businesses. The Ford Motor Company expects to spend $800 million buying auto parts in the empowerment zone the next five years. G.M. has awarded multiyear contracts worth $1.3 billion. Chrysler has about 20 minority-owned suppliers in the zone.
The promise of lucrative contracts with the Big Three has helped change attitudes about doing business in the inner city. "Companies have been jockeying for position" to be there, said Vinnie Johnson, a former Detroit Pistons basketball player and the president of Piston Packaging, a start-up company at another corner of the old Cadillac complex. G.M. said that the entire new industrial park was spoken for, even though ground had not yet been broken on the big stretch of gravel where the factory used to stand.
While these smaller companies pump in less money than do G.M. or Chrysler, the biggest investor in the zone, they usually hire more zone residents, providing jobs in a section of the city that has registered unemployment rates of more than 50 percent for as long as most people can remember.
Indeed, for the 101,000 residents of the zone's decaying neighborhoods, half of whom live below the official poverty level, the business influx is the first ray of hope in years. Brenda R. Globe, a 31-year-old mother of four, had been on welfare for 10 years when she got a job with Piston Packaging in August. She has already won a $2-an-hour raise and now earns $8 an hour hoisting 40-pound struts into plastic crates on the night shift, when her mother watches the children.
There are other signs of life in Detroit, as well. Efforts under way to revitalize the downtown have recently begun to bear fruit. In the last two years, plans have been announced to build three casinos and stadiums for Detroit's football and baseball teams. In addition, last year, General Motors bought the city's landmark business complex, the Renaissance Center, for its new headquarters.
Still, turning around inner cities doesn't happen overnight.
Sheila M. Cockrel, a member of the Detroit City Council, said, "$100 million is in one sense a drop in the bucket." Since the late 1960's, she added, "the migration of capital out of the city was huge."
Ms. Cockrel praises Washington's empowerment zone efforts. But she said, "There is more that can and should and must be done."
Federal officials said that empowerment zones are working and amount to a good combination of urban renewal ideas from Democrats and Republicans. "The point is to change the momentum," Andrew M. Cuomo, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary. "We have to be realistic about our expectations."
Some empowerment zones have worked better than others. Each of the six designated cities -- which besides Detroit include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York and a region that includes Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. -- was awarded the same set of grants and tax breaks. But progress in Camden and New York became mired in a bog of political squabbling, and Federal officials threatened to boot both from the program. New York has since moved back on track, but Camden may still be dropped. The Housing and Urban Development Department said in a report released last month that Detroit and Baltimore were the best performers of the six.
Of course, there are still plenty of obstacles to doing business in the empowerment zones. The City Council here generallly does not share the Mayor's pro-business stance, but the climate has improved.
One of the new tenants at the Cadillac site is Ideal Steel and Builders' Supplies Inc. Frank Venegas Jr. started the business in the Detroit suburbs in 1979 with $12,000 he got from selling a new gold Coupe DeVille d'Elegance -- built at the old Cadillac plant -- which he had won in a dinner-dance raffle. He expanded his business with a factory in the empowerment zone and hired 128 zone residents to build high-technology parking-lot guardrails.
Mr. Venegas feels good about bringing jobs to the inner city. "One of our guys recently had a baby," he said. "It was the first time in his family that someone had a baby and didn't have to pay for the delivery" because jobs at Ideal Steel come with health insurance. They are some of the best jobs in the area.
"I don't think it would've been done without the empowerment zone," added Mr. Venegas, whose company had $22.9 million in revenue last year. He plans to take advantage of the Federal tax benefits his company is eligible for here -- $3,000 for nearly every worker, since most live in the empowerment zone, and an equipment depreciation allowance worth about $20,000. But those benefits are "peanuts," said Mr. Venegas, not enough to inspire him to open a factory here.
Mr. Venegas said his motivation, instead, was bringing jobs back to the neighborhood where his father and his grandparents had lived. But with all the steady business he has won from the auto makers here, he stands to do well by doing good.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS: Market Place;
Auto Makers Draw a Yawn On Wall Street

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 10

 BODY:
The Big Three auto makers have been showing signs of renewed strength this month, but to Wall Street the industry seems to have reached a plateau. Even two bullish announcements today -- that the Chrysler Corporation had better-than-expected profits in the first quarter and that the Ford Motor Company would increase its dividend -- left analysts talking about auto stocks mostly as a safe bet if the stock market nose dives.
But the collective yawn from the market -- shares in General Motors and Chrysler were unchanged today while Ford's stock slid modestly -- comes for three very distinct reasons, according to analysts: Chrysler is such a well-managed company that it cannot get much better; Ford's stock has done so badly that it cannot get much worse, and there is light at the end of a lengthy tunnel for G.M.'s turnaround efforts. 
 G.M. is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Monday and Ford is expected to release its results on Wednesday.
Chrysler said today that it earned $1.03 billion, or $1.46 a share, during the first quarter, up 2.4 percent from $1.01 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.44 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call.
Ford said today that it would raise its dividend to 42 cents a share during the second quarter, up 3.5 cents. The 9 percent increase was the first in nine months.
But any celebrations were tempered by another reminder of the industry's Achilles' heel: poor labor relations. About 1,800 workers went on strike this morning at Chrysler's main engine factory here, forcing the company to plan a shutdown of four assembly plants by early Friday morning. Those factories rely on the engines to build Chrysler's highly profitable Jeep Grand Cherokees, pickup trucks and full-size vans.
And even auto executives concede it will be harder to make money. "The combination of a weak yen and new entries from Japan put considerable pressure on all of the domestic manufacturers," said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, which had revenues of $16.1 billion during the first quarter, an increase of 7.8 percent.
Since last year, Chrysler has been pleading with Wall Street to believe that things can get better. Today, Mr. Eaton continued his campaign. "We know we simply have to do more and more things better every single day to keep ahead of the market," he said.
Alas, according to the First Call Corporation, a Boston-based Wall Street research firm, most analysts believe that Ford and G.M. are better stock buys than Chrysler. First Call compiles a consensus of analysts ratings on a scale of one to five, with one being a "buy" recommendation, three being a "hold" recommendation, and five being a "sell" recommendation.
Chrysler merits a 2.3, just better than a hold. That's the average stock recommendation for stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, said Charles L. Hill, First Call's research director. Both G.M. and Ford rate a 1.8, "fairly bullish," Mr. Hill said.
Moreover, in the last two months, two analysts have raised their ratings on Ford to "buy" recommendations, while two analysts have lowered their ratings of Chrysler to a "hold."
"In a way, Chrysler is a victim of its own success," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Brothers. It is run so well that it has nowhere up to go, but analysts still wonder whether it can successfully weather the next recession. "Historically," he said, "if the economy caught a cold, Chrysler was considered a candidate for bankruptcy."
Some are more bullish. Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst with Lehman Brothers, has a "buy" recommendation on the stock. "They can stay up on a plateau for another year or two," he said. "We expect them to have better earnings this year than last year."
In a more immediate issue facing Chrysler, workers from U.A.W. local 51 went on strike this morning at the company's Mound Road factory in Detroit, which makes V6, V8 and V10 engines.
While Chrysler is shutting down immediately those assembly plants that use engines from the struck factory, other assembly plants might be affected later if they rely on small components from the engine factory -- a common problem in auto industry strikes.
Chrysler, Ford and G.M all reached three-year national labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers union last autumn. Each auto maker is now struggling to conclude factory-level agreements with local units of the U.A.W.
G.M. has already weathered two local strikes so far this year, and now faces a third strike that began last Saturday at a factory in Oklahoma City that assembles the new Chevrolet Malibu. The only auto maker without local union problems is Ford, which puts such a high priority on good labor relations that when workers at a seat supplier went on strike earlier this year, Ford refused to accept seats made by managers and replacement workers who had crossed picket lines.
The Big Three auto stocks now have extremely low price-to-earnings ration and strong dividend yields. Chrysler is trading at about six times earnings while its dividend yield is 5.3 percent. Ford is trading at roughly eight times earnings, with a dividend yield of about 5.1 percent. G.M. is trading at about seven times earnings with a dividend yield of 5.3 percent. The average dividend yield for the S.& P. 500 index is just 2.1 percent.
Chrysler's share price ended unchanged today, at $30. Ford shares fell 25 cents, to $32.625, and G.M. shares were unchanged at $54.50.
At the end of last month, Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company, raised his outlook on Ford to a "buy." "While we remain cautious over all on the auto stocks, for a variety of factors, given where Ford's stock is relative to its 52-week trading range, and the likelihood that any good news this year is likely to occur very soon, we are comfortable making a trading call at this time," he wrote.
Mr. Lobaccaro noted that the auto stocks showed resilience on the recent day the Dow dropped 140 points. "Perhaps we are now much closer to the point where the downside risk in the auto stocks is not significantly greater than the market over all since they have dramatically underperformed for so long," he wrote.

HEADLINE: Bonds Sag on Inflation Signs; Benchmark Yield Is at 7.16%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday as a strong first-quarter retail report and a sharper-than-expected jump in the core Producer Price Index for March gave investors their first real glimpse of inflation after months of anticipation.
The 30-year benchmark bond, by which many commercial and consumer loan rates are set, fell 21/32 , to a price of 9314/32 to yield 7.16 percent, up from 7.10 percent on Thursday and the highest yield since 7.18 percent last July 8. 
 For market participants, the latest data suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank will have to consider further credit tightening to rein in an economy that continues to expand too rapidly, threatening to accelerate inflation. Yesterday's numbers also gave market participants a reason to be concerned about the March consumer price report, due on Tuesday.
The overall Producer Price Index slipped by one-tenth of a percent, but the core rate, without the more volatile food and energy components, jumped four-tenths of a percent.
March retail sales were up two-tenths of a percent, and February data were revised to a 1.5 percent rise, from eight-tenths of a percent. January was revised to a gain of 1.7 percent, from 1.5 percent.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said the data implied a 6 percent first-quarter increase in consumption, which was bearish for the market, increasing the risks of further Fed tightening.
About the only positive spin to the selling in both the Treasury and stock market was that the short end of the Treasury market benefited some from the slide in stocks, as some equity money seeking a haven from the volatility in stocks found its way to the bill market.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said the combination of stronger-than-expected March retail sales and core producer price numbers, raised investor fears that the Fed would tighten monetary policy at least two more times. The Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting is on May 20.
"March retail sales showed a decent gain considering that it came on the heels of a very strong February reading after revision." Mr. Palash said. "This suggests the consumer is going to continue to provide good momentum to the economy in the spring. So over all, economic growth could stay too high and force the Fed to become more restrictive."
Mr. Palash added that the rise in the core Producer Price Index raised some inflation fears in the market "even though three-quarters of the rise was a result of one-time factors, a hike in tobacco prices and a spike in aircraft prices." Higher tobacco prices, he said, "should have an effect on next week's consumer price data, and that fact has exacerbated market concern that the C.P.I. will print high."
Besides the evidence of continuing strength in the economy, market participants in the next few weeks will also have to contend with a growing supply of securities. Next Wednesday the Treasury will announce the size of its note auctions of two- and five-year maturities, and a week after those auctions the Government will be into its quarterly refunding.
"It looks like the bond market will remain under pressure into the summer months." Mr. Palash said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark And Yen, but Falls vs. Pound

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar generally rose yesterday, after a Japanese official said efforts to bolster the yen by selling dollars would have little effect and a Bank of France council member raised concern that Europe's proposed single currency would be weaker than the mark.
The dollar pared its gains as stronger-than-expected reports on retail sales and in the core Producer Price Index sent stock and bond prices tumbling on fears that higher interest rates were inevitable. That in turn raised concern that foreign investors would sell the dollar. 
 Kabun Muto, head of Japan's Management and Coordination Agency, said dollar selling by the Bank of Japan would do little to stem its rise. However, Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said yesterday that the dollar's recent levels were "excessive" and that Japan would take measures to combat the dollar's strength at an "appropriate" time.
In New York the dollar settled at 126.03 yen, up from 125.65 yen Thursday. The dollar cost 1.7201 marks, up from 1.7178. But the dollar weakened slightly versus the pound, which rose to $1.6284 from $1.6234.
"People traded the dollar on the doom and gloom right now in the stock and bond markets," said Russ LaScala, manager of spot trading at Citibank. The Dow Jones average fell 148.36, to 6,391.69, while United States bonds dropped, sending yields to nine-month highs. That is an unusual currency market response. Typically, higher interest rates lift the dollar by increasing the allure of United States deposits and bonds.
"Higher interest rates in the longer term are a positive for the dollar," said Roger Chapin, manager of foreign exchange at the Banc One Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, who predicted it could reach 128 yen next week. "But in the short term they're a negative."
The dollar rose against the mark in European trading after Paul Marchelli, a member of France's central bank, was quoted by Reuters as saying it was "unimaginable" that monetary union would proceed without the inclusion of Italy, Spain and Portugal. Those nations' currencies have historically been weaker than the mark, and if they are included in the Euro, many investors expect the new currency will be more subject to swings in value than the mark.

Dow Plunges 148 Points; Market Loses Year's Gains
Stock prices plunged, wiping out all the gains scored earlier this year, as traders reacted to reports on producer prices and retail sales that showed evidence of inflation. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 148.36, to 6,391.69, leaving it just a few points away from its first 10 percent decline since this bull market phase began in October 1990. Technology and financial stocks were battered, slicing 28.87 points off the Nasdaq composite index; it closed at 1,206.90. [Page 1.]
 
Yields Climb for Treasury Securities
Prices of Treasury securities also tumbled, as traders took further credit tightening by the Federal Reserve as inevitable. The 30-year benchmark bond, by which many commercial and consumer loan rates are set, fell 21/32 , to a price of 9314/32 , pushing its yield up to 7.16 percent, from 7.10 percent on Thursday. [48.]
 
Agreement in Cuba Dispute
The European Union and the United States agreed on a plan to resolve a dispute over sanctions against Cuba that has troubled their relations. The talks could still fail because of Congressional opposition to a change in the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, which prescribes punishment for foreign companies that invest in properties confiscated from Americans after the Cuban revolution. [1.]
 
Harvard to Study Nonprofit Sector
Harvard University has received a $10 million gift to establish a center to study what has become one of the most dynamic parts of the American economy -- the fast-growing nonprofit sector, comprising 1.4 million charities, religious congregations, foundations, hospitals, educational and cultural groups, which provide a growing number of jobs. [7.]
 
Unlicensed Assayer in Gold Find
Delgratia Mining's report in late February of a big gold discovery in Nevada was based on laboratory tests conducted by an unlicensed gold assayer who was convicted of securities fraud in 1978. Delgratia described the assayer as "an outside, independent lab" that it declined to identify. Two consulting mining engineers hired last month by Delgratia said that the testing was conducted by Robert Harlan Gunnison in Phoenix. [37.]
 
Deal for AT&T Cable Unit
Tyco International, an industrial conglomerate, agreed to buy AT&T's underwater telecommunications cable business for $850 million, broadening its role in the growing market for fiber optic telecommunications cable. [37.]
 
Computer Sale Raises Privacy Issue
A Utah supermarket chain, Smith's Food and Drug Centers, has obtained a Federal court order to retrieve a personal computer from a Nevada woman who found thousands of pharmacy records on the machine's hard disk when she bought it in an Internet auction. She had gone to state officials to expose what she and legal experts called a growing threat to privacy in the computer age. [8.]
 
Du Pont May Halt Mining Plan
Du Pont "will not go forward" with plans to mine titanium just outside the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in southeast Georgia, a company executive said, if Government officials and environmental groups remain opposed. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has announced that he is unequivocally opposed. The swamp is home to alligators and hundreds of species of fish, reptiles and migratory birds like sandhill cranes. [8.]
 
Dollar Up Against Yen and Mark
The dollar rose, settling in New York at 126.03 yen, up from 125.65 yen Thursday, after a Japanese official said efforts to bolster the yen by selling dollars would have little effect. It reached 1.7201 marks, up from 1.7178, after a Bank of France council member raised concern that Europe's proposed single currency would be weaker than the mark. [38.]
 
Wheat futures prices surged to their highest level in four and a half months, closing at $4.0825 a bushel for July delivery. [38.]

HEADLINE: Retail Sales And Price Data Arouse Fears About Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Shoppers stepped up their spending in winter, and a gauge of inflation gave signs that price increases may be lurking beneath the surface of the economy, Government reports showed today.
The reports alarmed the stock and bond markets, which fell sharply. They also make it increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again, possibly before its policy meeting in late May, in an effort to slow the economy, some analysts said. 
 While retail sales climbed a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported, the increase came after the February gain in sales was found to be nearly double the initial estimate and the strong gain in January was also revised higher.
"The consumer is just going hog wild here," said Joshua N. Feinman, an economist at Bankers Trust. "The economy is not showing any signs of slowing."
In the other report, the Labor Department said prices at the producer level jumped four-tenths of 1 percent in March, the most in more than a year, once the erratic categories of food and energy were removed. Including food and energy, the Producer Price Index fell by one-tenth of 1 percent.
The combination of free-spending consumers and an apparent uptick in underlying inflation touched off a slide in the bond and stock markets, with the rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond surging to 7.16 percent from 7.10 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average falling 148 points.
The sales report was said by analysts to be the more worrisome of the two because the Fed had already pointed to "persistent strength in demand" when it raised rates on March 25 for the first time in more than two years. The central bank wants to restrain an economy that appears to be expanding more rapidly than the 2.25 percent growth rate widely regarded as the fastest that can be sustained without accelerating inflation.
Many economists now predict that economic growth in the January-March quarter will exceed the 3.8 percent annual rate posted for the final three months of 1996.
"We could be looking at 4 percent, even with an enormous trade drag," said James F. Smith, an economist and a professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. The trade drag reflects heavy purchases of foreign goods by Americans, accompanied by subdued American sales abroad. Both factors are tied to the rising value of the dollar, which makes imports more affordable relative to American goods.
Analysts said the economy's overall momentum suggested that the Fed might have little choice but to push rates higher. "The Fed is likely to tighten again in May," said Joel L. Naroff of First Union Bank in Philadelphia.
Michael J. Boskin, who served as top economic adviser to President George Bush, predicted at least one increase of a quarter-point in crucial interest rates in the months ahead. He said a rate increase could happen before the next scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, on May 20.
Other analysts, though, said they doubted that quick action would be necessary, contending that much of the jump in core producer prices was related to one-time factors.
"If we're going to have an inflation problem, it's not developing right now," said Gary R. Thayer, a senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Still, it was the retail sales report that most alarmed the markets. It showed that spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March, with the increase held down by lower sales at automobile dealers.
The February sales increase, however, was raised to 1.5 percent from the eight-tenths of 1 percent first estimated, and the January gain was raised to 1.7 percent from 1.5.
The early-year burst in spending, analysts said, was probably aided by weather that was warmer than usual, by income tax refunds that were early and large, and by a still-soaring stock market.
Sales at stores selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes have been especially strong of late, rising 1.6 percent in March, after a 2.2 percent February advance.
Furniture and other equipment for the home rose only slightly last month, however, after soaring 3.4 percent in February. Fractional percentage gains were posted by stores selling general merchandise, food, clothing and drugs. Sales eased slightly at restaurants and bars and at gasoline service stations, the latter reflecting lower prices.
The Labor Department's price report showed that prices of goods ready for sale to the final business or individual user plunged 3.4 percent. Food prices jumped by nine-tenths of 1 percent, though.
The increase in the core rate was the biggest since 1995. But this gain was magnified by unusually big increases for a few industries, mainly tobacco and civilian aircraft, each up more than 2 percent.
Prices of goods at the intermediate stage of production -- a bolt of cloth, for example -- fell six-tenths of 1 percent over all and were unchanged for the core. Crude goods, like raw cotton, dropped 6.9 percent over all, with the raw materials core up six-tenths of 1 percent, after increases of 1 percent in February and 2 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Anxious Days in Potatoland;
Competitive Forces Threaten to Knock Idaho From Top

BYLINE: By STEPHEN STUEBNER 

DATELINE: REXBURG, Idaho

 BODY:
David Beesley has been working around potatoes his whole life, but right now he cannot bear to look at his 10-ounce dimpled bakers piled 12 feet high in a storage shed.
That is because Mr. Beesley, a 50-year-old farmer, has to sell 4.5 million pounds of potatoes from last year's crop at a horrible loss. "You can't make enough money off 100 pounds of spuds right now to buy a large order of french fries," he says, squinting at the Grand Tetons on the eastern horizon with a wry grin. 
 The Idaho potato, long the king of the American market, is in danger of losing its throne as the world potato industry grows more competitive. A record 1996 crop created a huge glut in the United States, driving prices for fresh potatoes lower than the root cellar.
At the same time, two big Canadian potato processors, Cavendish Farms and McCain Foods Ltd., seized a bigger share of the $3 billion American french-fry market by exporting 450 million pounds of frozen fries at bargain prices -- prices Americans could not match.
French fries -- that is what today's potato market is all about. Growers' fortunes have soared as this basic building block of the fast-food meal has spread across the globe. But now, ironically, this very success has the potential to turn against the Idaho farmer. For as demand grows and competition sizzles, producers of french fries are aggressively seeking local sources for their raw material.
"We have a slogan: drink the local wine," says Harrison McCain, chairman of McCain Foods, the world's leading producer of frozen french fries, based in New Brunswick. "If we're in England, we're buying all of the potatoes we can buy in England."
Not that America, or Idaho, is about to be shut out of this boom. American exports of french fries more than doubled from $100 million in 1989 to $260 million in 1996, and they continue to rise. But exports could slow considerably, as new potato farms pop up around the world, predicts William Janis, a United States Agriculture Department expert on the $2.9 billion international french-fry industry. "As American products become popular," he says, "there is a lot of political and economic pressure to produce them locally."
Unsettling disruptions are occurring already, especially in Idaho. The Canadians' bargain-basement exports created a french-fry glut in the United States, prompting the nation's largest processors, Lamb-Weston Inc., a Conagra Inc. subsidiary, and the J. R. Simplot Company to cut production and lay off about 500 workers at plants in southern Idaho. To compete more effectively in Midwest and East Coast markets, Lamb-Weston and Simplot have invested heavily in Midwest processing plants, spawning the growth of new potato farms in the region and cutting into Idaho farmers' share of the french-fry market, where about 60 percent of the state crop is normally sold.
On the global stage, the trend is similar. Fueled by the booming fast-food business -- McDonald's boasts that it breaks ground on a new store outside the United States every four hours -- McCain, Lamb-Weston and Simplot have been building, expanding or buying french-fry plants in places like China, India, Australia and Argentina. In many cases, new plants have prompted local farmers to produce potatoes, with agricultural experts from McDonald's or Simplot sometimes even teaching farmers how to grow them.
As Idaho farmers prepare to plant this year's crop, people like Mr. Beesley will start off with heavy debts, hoping for better times ahead. Buoyed by solid profits from the 1995 crop, farmers from Washington to Nebraska planted more potatoes than ever last year. But while they typically count on frost, disease, pests or some other natural disaster to cut into the crop, conditions in 1996 were uniformly favorable.
The result: The crop was the largest in American history -- 48.8 billion pounds, enough to feed 355 million people with french fries, baked potatoes, and potato chips for a year. The glut sent the price of a 100-pound sack from about $8 in 1995 to $1.50 or $2 for the 1996 crop, or about a third of what it cost farmers to grow them.
Farmers will lose about $1,000 an acre on the 1996 crop, Mr. Beesley says. A farmer who grew potatoes on 500 acres -- a typical acreage here -- stands to lose a half-million dollars. "It's just a plain devastating situation," Mr. Beesley says.
If prices do not improve in 1997, bank officials predict trouble in this highly cyclical business. "If we have a repeat of this year, then we'll have some real problems," Bob Finkbohner, vice president of U.S. Bank in Boise, says. "Everyone is crossing their fingers, hoping that farmers cut production and prices go up."
Dismal potato prices also cut into Idaho state income tax receipts and hurt the sale of new farm equipment. In heavy potato farming areas in Idaho, local economies rise or fall with potato prices.
For Lamb-Weston and Simplot, the Canadian imports were an added blow. Taking advantage of a favorable exchange rate and locations closer to the heart of the American market, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms shipped from plants in Manitoba and eastern Canada.
The bulk of Lamb-Weston and Simplot's processing plants are 1,200 to 1,600 miles from the Midwest, in Idaho, Washington and Oregon -- close to Pacific Rim export markets, but too far from Eastern markets to match Canadian prices.
For Simplot, one consequence was its decision to lay off 370 workers at its plant in Caldwell, Idaho, 20 miles west of Boise, at the end of May. This was an emotional decision, for it was at that site, known as Plant 1, that Simplot food scientists perfected the frozen french fry in 1953. "It's a sobering moment," says Fred Zerza, director of corporate communications for Simplot.
Mr. Zerza notes that the United States french-fry market expands only about 3 percent a year, while the capacity of American and Canadian processing plants is growing faster. That means future competition for french-fry sales will be equally fierce.
Fast-food chains, in a competition of their own, are also pushing prices downward, trying to turn a profit on low-priced full meals. "Fast-food chains are focused on cost-cutting, and they've got their foot on the throat of the processor. They're the 2,000-pound gorilla," says Tom Lipetzky, director of international marketing for the National Potato Promotion Board, a nonprofit growers' organization in Denver.
To improve their competitive edge in the United States, Lamb-Weston and Simplot have been cranking up production at plants closer to the market, in the Midwest and on the East Coast. But Simplot announced on March 31 that it may cut back or cease production at its Grand Rapids, Mich., plant because of the glut in the market and the competition from the Canadians, costing 200 jobs.
"We're looking at all of our plants to remain cost-competitive," Mr. Zerza says.
There is a bright spot for Idaho and its neighbors, though. The expansion of United States french-fry exports has benefited Idaho, Oregon and Washington farmers because they grow potatoes close to Northwest processing companies and Pacific seaports. In the 1995-96 crop year, United States french-fry exports increased 7 percent, to a record 350,000 metric tons, accounting for 11 percent of domestic production. Because of poor potato-growing conditions in Russia and a paucity of land for growing potatoes in Japan, Mr. Janis predicts exports will continue to soar in those countries. Lamb-Weston and Simplot are well positioned to take advantage of that trend, operating a number of large plants in Washington and Oregon along the Columbia River, close to Pacific ports.
McCain's recent purchase of Ore-Ida Foods from H. J. Heinz may allow the Canadian french-fry giant to increase sales to the Pacific Rim. The Ore-Ida sale, if approved by McCain's board, would transfer ownership of two large Ore-Ida french-fry plants in the Northwest, one in Burley, Idaho, and one in Ontario, Ore., on the Idaho-Oregon border.
Meanwhile, in another part of the market -- baked potatoes for restaurant sales and bags for supermarket sales -- Idaho still turns out the pre-eminent product, most experts agree.
The Idaho potato, which even appears as a "Famous Potatoes" license plate slogan, has instant name recognition among 82 percent of the American public, a better rating than Florida citrus or Washington apples, according to a recent trade-publication survey. In most markets, the Idaho potato sells for a premium price, sometimes $2 more for a 100-pound sack.
For Idaho potato farmers' fortunes to increase in the long haul, though, growers must increase their share of the market for fresh potatoes and french fries.
Mr. Beesley has been talking frequently to his fellow farmers, urging them to engage in a cooperative effort to control supply and improve marketing. Mr. Beesley sees the best hope in forming a farmer-owned cooperative like Sunkist oranges or Treetop and Ocean Spray fruit juices.
As it is now, potato farmers regularly gamble that other farmers will have a short crop because of weather, frost, pests or some other natural disaster. There is no centralized control on planting or, ultimately, price. "Nobody knows what's going to be planted until after the fact," Mr. Beesley says. "We're always behind the gun."
But organizing the notoriously independent potato growers is difficult at best. Jeff Raybould, a fourth-generation Rexburg farmer, agrees that farmers could get a better price if they worked together. "But there's always someone out there who thinks they're smarter than everybody else," he says.
Mr. Beesley vows to keep trying. He watched his friends be hurt by inconsistent prices and exorbitant production costs -- like $120,000 tractors, $225,000 storage sheds and $40,000 potato trucks. "Every time you turn around, it's another $100,000," Mr. Beesley says. "It's kind of like slow death."
Mr. Raybould, on the other hand, is optimistic. "We got a good thing going in Idaho," he says. "We've got the best name recognition in the country, and we get a premium price for quality potatoes. You can't look at agriculture, particularly potatoes, as a snapshot in time. You have to roll the whole reel."

As the world potato market becomes more competitive, Idaho farmers are in danger of losing business; Mr. Beesley says Idaho farmers are losing about $1,000 an acre on the 1996 crop. "It's just a plain devastating situation." (Photographs by Glenn Oakley for The New York Times)
 
Chart: "Spud Race"
The United States remains one of the world's leading producers of potatoes and potato products, like frozen french fries. But other big potato producing countries are increasing their output, even more rapidly, a trend spurred in part by the construction of potato processing plants near markets where fast food consumption is growing.

HEADLINE: DOW DROPS 148.36 AS REPORTS SHOW SIGNS OF INFLATION

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply yesterday, reacting to two new reports signaling inflationary pressures that could lead to rising interest rates. The losses not only wiped out the last of the gains scored this year by the Dow Jones industrial average but also dropped it to within just a few points of its first 10 percent decline since 1990.
The Dow tumbled 148.36 points, or 2.27 percent, to close at 6,391.69 in one of its biggest losses of the year. Since peaking at 7,085.16 on March 11, the Dow has fallen 9.8 percent. 
 As a result, the stock market is now in its worst downturn since the bull market began in October 1990. And while analysts disagree about what a 10 percent decline portends, many regard it as a major benchmark.
Hugh Johnson, an investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation, said that a 10 percent drop could finally be enough to scare some investors out of the market. He noted that during other sharp, but smaller, downturns since 1990, investors seemed to see an opportunity to buy rather than an incentive to sell, a fact that had helped the market recover.
"If there's anything worrisome now," Mr. Johnson said, it is that "there's no longer a widespread optimism that borders on euphoria for investors."
Even so, few analysts believe that even a 10 percent decline will spell the end of what many analysts consider one of the greatest bull markets in history. One reason for this confidence is that they believe that few of the millions of investors who have bought into the mutual fund craze will panic.
To turn this bull market to a bear market -- which would mean much steeper declines -- analysts said the economy would have to worsen.
"You really need to have a recession, and no one thinks that's where we're going," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief equity strategist at Gruntal & Company.
The plunge in stock prices yesterday was touched off by reports suggesting that economic growth was accelerating, as the increase in February retail sales was revised up to a brisk 1.5 percent and the Producer Price Index, excluding volatile energy and food prices, jumped four-tenths of a percent in March -- the largest increase in more than an year.
After beginning the year with a euphoric run in prices that sent the Dow over the 7,000-point level for the first time in February, the stock market has been rattled by concerns about higher interest rates and fears that inflation, which has held around 3 percent for years, is on the rise.
If the economy is gaining steam, the Federal Reserve could react by raising short-term interest rates another notch to curtail inflation. Just two weeks ago, on March 25, the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target by a quarter percentage point. It was the first increase since 1995 and accelerated the current stock selloff.
Analysts said that yesterday's reports helped increase the likelihood of more Fed action later this year.
"One of the last bastions of the bulls -- never-ending disinflation -- is being assaulted here," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, who has long been bearish on the market. "The whole character of the market has changed, and the momentum investing craze is over."
In the month since the Dow peaked, the decline has been sharp. In fact, yesterday's selloff succeeded in finally dragging all the major stock market indexes below where they began the year.
While the Dow is now down nine-tenths of a percent on the year, the Nasdaq composite index is down 6.5 percent, and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is down 6.4 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off four-tenths of 1 percent.
Since the market downturn gathered strength, after the Fed raised rates two weeks ago, investors have been burdened by a consistent stream of bad news ranging from a surge in interest rates to reports that the average mutual fund lost about 2 percent in the first quarter of this year.
"The mood of the market is changing," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott. "We've gone from a period when we had the comfort of armchair investing to a time of seat-of-the-pants trading."
The market's difficulties this year come after two years of spectacular runs, with gains of 33.5 percent and 26 percent in the Dow. Never before has the stock market seen a third consecutive year of double-digit percent gains. And many market strategists predicted that this year would be no exception.
"The odds were against us from the beginning of the year," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "In the 20th century, this is the eighth time there have been two terrific years in a row. The general tendency for the third year, after two good ones, is for the market to suffer. This is just more nails in the coffin."
The stock market next week could end the longest streak without a 10 percent decline by falling just 15 points, to 6,376.64 -- which is 10 percent below the Dow's peak of 7,085.16 in March.
The last time the Dow saw a 10 percent correction was in the summer of 1990, as Iraq invaded Kuwait, which sent oil prices soaring.
In 1987, stock prices plunged even more, falling 508 points, or 22.6 percent, the steepest one-day decline in history.
Yesterday, the S.& P. 500 index fell 20.69 points, or 2.73 percent, to 737.65, and the Nasdaq index, plummeted 28.87 points, or 2.34 percent, to 1,206.90. On the New York Stock Exchange, more than five times as many stocks lost ground as gained.
Technology and financial stocks, which pulled the market higher before leading this decline, were battered again yesterday. For instance, shares of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, lost 6 3/4, to 130 1/2, while Citicorp, one of the nation's largest banks, lost 5 1/4, to 104 7/8.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 20 lost more than one point, led by J. P. Morgan, down 4 1/2, to 93 1/2, and General Electric, which tumbled 3 5/8, to 97 7/8.
After the Government issued its economic data yesterday, bond prices tumbled, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 7.16, from 7.10 Thursday and a nine-month high.
All the major stock market indexes opened down, with the Dow falling 80 points in early trading, partly because higher yields make bonds more attractive relative to stocks.

HEADLINE: How Much Gold Is a River Worth?

BYLINE: By David James Duncan; David James Duncan is the author of the novels "The Brothers K" and "The River Why."

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont.

 BODY:
Montana's Blackfoot River scene of the Norman Maclean novel and the movie "A River Runs Through It" -- is one of the most beautiful rivers on earth. Home to vast herds of elk, endangered grizzly bears, bighorn sheep and wild trout, this area draws tens of thousands of fly-fishing and nature-loving pilgrims every year.
But thanks to a new American gold rush, the Blackfoot is facing a grave threat. While mining corporations enjoy a bonanza, we taxpayers subsidize the industry and pay billions to clean up the mess left behind. 
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation of Arizona, in a joint venture with a Colorado company, Canyon Resources, wants to mine gold at McDonald Meadows, an eight-square-mile site on the upper Blackfoot. Phelps Dodge plans to use trainloads of explosives to turn a riverside butte where elk are now calving into a hole more than a mile in diameter and as deep as the World Trade Center is tall. The only comparable hole in America is the nearby Berkeley Pit in Butte, Mont. -- source of the Clark Fork River Superfund sites that are costing $1 billion and a once-legendary trout stream its life.
Phelps Dodge proposes to dry out the Blackfoot pit by lowering the water table of the upper Blackfoot Valley by 1,300 feet. Then it plans to extract millions of tons of rock to reach low-grade ore containing just one-fiftieth of an ounce of gold per ton. To glean tiny gold flecks from the ore, the company proposes stacking it twice the height of the Statue of Liberty over an area larger than New York's Central Park, and pouring billions of gallons of cyanide-laced water over it. This technique is known as cyanide heap-leach gold mining.
To protect the river, Phelps Dodge plans to line the base of this waste-heap with plastic the thickness of two pennies. When mining is done, the heap is abandoned. The company would also leave behind a 570-million ton mountain of rock from which heavy metals and sulfuric acid could leach into the watershed forever.
This plan is madness. No one in America has ever dug so huge a pit right beside a river. No one has ever safely dug up so much toxic and acidic rock. No one has safely used cyanide technology in this brutal climate, where temperatures can reach 69 degrees below zero. In Summitville, Colo., where the climate is similar, a now-bankrupt Canadian company, Galactic Resources Inc., opened a cyanide heap-leach gold mine in 1986. The plastic containment system ruptured, spewing millions of gallons of poison, killing all life in the Alamosa River and seriously damaging much of the upper Rio Grande. Cleanup has cost taxpayers $150 million and the Alamosa remains lifeless.
Phelps Dodge claims that the Blackfoot mine will create 390 jobs for 10 to 15 years. But many more jobs than that, as well as family farms and ranches downstream, will be threatened. The Blackfoot is the life's blood of the region and the economic heart of recreational tourism, the most lucrative and stable industry in the state.
Gold mining, by contrast, is of little economic benefit to the state. But it is of great benefit to mining companies, thanks to the 1872 Mining Law, under which companies can stake claims on Federal land for no more than $5 an acre. They also pay no royalties on the billions of dollars worth of minerals they mine each year. The Canadian-owned American Barrick Resources, for example, paid $9,765 for 1,949 acres in Elko, Nev., in 1994 and is expected to mine $10 billion worth of gold there.
Already, some 50 billion tons of waste from old mines are scattered around the country, and mining has ruined more than 12,000 miles of rivers and streams and 180,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs. Estimates of cleanup costs for our half million abandoned mine sites range from $33 billion to $71 billion.
State laws are at least as lax as Federal law. Montana, for instance, has never refused to grant a permit for mining on state land. Though the proposed Phelps Dodge mine would be on state land, the property borders national forests, and the company's long-range plans include huge expansions on Federal land. Phelps Dodge and other corporations hold hundreds of claims on Federal land in the Blackfoot watershed.
Last year's outcry over a proposed mine on the borders of Yellowstone Park inspired the Clinton Administration to propose a buyout of the claim held by Crown Butte, a subsidiary of the Canadian conglomerate Noranda Inc. Because of the 1872 law, President Clinton is scrambling to find $65 million worth of public property to give to the company. Yet there are another 6,000 mining claims on land in the Yellowstone ecosystem.
It's time for Congress and state lawmakers to ignore mining lobbyists and reform a corporate welfare program that devastates our land, water, wildlife and regional economies.

U.S. and Europe Agree To Agree on Cuba
The European Union and the United States agreed on a plan to resolve their dispute over sanctions against Cuba. A European complaint that was to have gone before the World Trade Organization on Monday will be suspended pending negotiations. The Clinton Administration agreed to seek a change in the Helms-Burton sanctions law; its prospects in Congress were unclear. 1
 
Iran Shunned, but Not by Russia
Russia warmly welcomed the head of Iran's parliament and vowed to improve ties with Iran. His visit came a day after a German court said the Iranian Government had ordered the assassination of exiled dissidents, a ruling that prompted most European Union countries to recall their ambassadors from Teheran. Russia's courting of Iran was seen as an effort to placate anti-Western Russian nationalists. 5 

Clinton Urges Broad U.S. Role
President Clinton urged Congress to approve a treaty banning chemical weapons and to give him broader authority to reach a trade agreement with Chile. In the first wide-ranging foreign policy address of his second term, Mr. Clinton said the United States should play a more active role. 5
 
Indian Government Falls
India's coalition Government was defeated in a parliamentary confidence vote, leaving three major political groups contending for power. If they fail to agree on a new Government within the next few days, a general election is likely to be held in the summer. Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda is likely to lose office under any outcome. 4
 
Japan Votes to Keep U.S. Bases
The lower house of Japan's Parliament voted overwhelmingly to let Japan continue to provide land for American military bases. Opposition to the bases has been strongest on Okinawa, where residents associate them with noise and crime. But Japan's Prime Minister sought the measure to bolster its alliance with the United States. 4
 
Moldova and Separatists Agree
The former Soviet republic of Moldova agreed on a peaceful settlement with the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Trans-Dniester, which is dominated by ethnic Slavs, will get a special status within the existing borders of Moldova, whose population is largely Romanian; details will be worked out later. The 5,000 Russian troops in Trans-Dniester are to be pulled out as part of the deal. (AP)
 
Croatians Celebrate Fascism
Five hundred black-shirted supporters of Croatia's neo-fascist Party of Rights gave stiff-armed salutes at a rally marking the 57th anniversary of the Nazi puppet regime that ruled Croatia during World War II. The party is a close ally of President Franjo Tudjman, who has sought to rehabilitate the wartime fighters as patriots and precursors of the modern Croatian state. 3

Mystified Air Force officials said a fighter pilot who disappeared during a training mission over the Arizona desert last week appeared to have been in control of the craft to the very end of its 90-minute, 800-mile flight. Everything about the flight appeared consistent with a deliberate, if irrational, act, they said. Pilot and plane remained missing. 1
 
Powerful Foes for Health Bill
Republican leaders in the Senate began pressuring supporters of a bipartisan bill that would provide health insurance for uninsured children by raising the tax on cigarettes. Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah, one of the original eight Republican backers of the measure, dropped his support. He said he had not read the bill carefully enough before endorsing it. 9

HEADLINE: Easier, Fairer Taxes

BYLINE: By William G. Gale; William G. Gale is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Tax season is upon us, and the President and the Republicans are talking about child tax credits, education tax credits, expanded I.R.A.'s and capital gains tax cuts. We've come a long way from last year's calls for a flat tax and other radical simplifications.
Yes, the tax code needs change. But there are alternatives to either junking the system, which is impractical, or endlessly tinkering at its margins. One option is to eliminate the deduction for itemized expenses -- for mortgage interest, large health expenditures, charity donations and state and local taxes -- and instead offer taxpayers a 15 percent tax credit for such costs. To offset this smaller deduction, the extra revenue generated by this reform could be put toward a modest across-the-board tax cut. 
 Besides not raising most people's taxes, this plan would make filing and enforcement easier: Many more people would be better off taking the standard deduction than itemizing, and those who would still itemize would have less incentive to finesse the system to maximize their deductions.
It would also make the system fairer, because itemized deductions are regressive. Only 28 percent of taxpayers itemize, but this includes 90 percent of households with income above $75,000 and less than 10 percent of those below $30,000. The higher the tax bracket, the more itemizing helps. A wealthy household has its taxes reduced by as much as 40 cents for every dollar of mortgage interest it pays, while a low-income household might save only 15 cents per dollar. Moreover, a homeowner can use a tax-deductible home equity loan to buy a car or take a vacation; a renter can't.
Some say that eliminating the mortgage-interest deduction would devastate real estate markets and home construction. But history shows that such claims are exaggerated. In 1980, when the top tax rate was 70 percent and mortgage interest rates were at 12.7 percent, the annual deduction was worth up to 8.9 percent of a loan. Now, with the top tax rate down to around 40 percent and mortgage rates closer to 8 percent, the deduction is worth, at most, 3.2 percent of the loan. Yet home ownership rates have changed little as the value of the deduction has plummeted.
If the deduction were converted to a 15 percent tax credit, this credit's value would be about 1.2 percent of a loan. Yes, this is smaller than under the current system -- but compared to the change over the last 15 years it isn't that dramatic a drop. And the Treasury would gain over $50 billion per year if all itemized deductions were converted into a 15 percent credit.
This new revenue could be used to reduce all marginal tax rates of those penalized by the loss of the itemized deductions -- those in the 28 percent bracket and higher -- by about 3 percentage points. We could also eliminate a handful of "hidden" taxes like the restrictions on personal exemptions that apply to high-income taxpayers.
Lower rates, fewer loopholes, fairer taxes, simpler filing -- who could ask for anything more for April 15?

HEADLINE: Harvard to Establish Center To Study Nonprofit Sector

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Harvard University has received a $10 million gift to establish a center to study the nation's fast-growing nonprofit sector, the 1.4 million charities, religious congregations, foundations, hospitals, educational and cultural groups that account for one of the most dynamic parts of the American economy.
University officials said Harvard would announce the creation of its new center on Tuesday at a conference on nonprofit organizations at its John F. Kennedy School of Government, where the center will be based. More than a third of Kennedy school graduates now work for nonprofit groups, as opposed to 20 years ago, when three-quarters of the school's graduates found jobs in the Federal Government or state and local agencies, said Holly T. Sargent, the Kennedy school's associate dean for external affairs. 
 "Nonprofits used to be a synonym for groups that had neither money nor power," said Sara L. Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, a nonprofit group in New York that documents trends in the nonprofit sector. "Increasingly this sector has both. If Harvard is opening a center on this scale, the nonprofit sector has clearly arrived."
The new Hauser Center for Nonprofit Institutions is being named for its lead donors, Rita E. Hauser and Gustave M. Hauser, New Yorkers who are both Harvard Law School graduates. Joseph S. Nye Jr., the dean of the Kennedy school, said the Hauser gift was among the largest the school has ever received. He called the center "one of our most ambitious undertakings."
In founding a center on nonprofit organizations, Harvard joins more than 30 other American universities that have opened schools, departments or major programs focused on these groups, which provide an ever-growing number of jobs for Americans.
Further testimony to the sector's growing economic and political influence is the conference on voluntarism that President Clinton is convening in Philadelphia later this month, which is expected to attract thousands of representatives from the nation's leading nonprofit organizations.
The nonprofit sector, often called the third sector, is the focus of renewed intellectual ferment.
Robert Kuttner, co-editor of American Prospect magazine, argues in a new book, "Everything for Sale" (Alfred A. Knopf and the 20th Century Fund), that after a decade of enthusiasm over the ability of capitalism's free markets to solve social as well as economic problems, a consensus is developing that the private sector alone cannot meet the nation's basic needs. Both Government and private nonprofit groups, he maintains, are vital to the nation's civil society as well as to the country's political and economic vitality.
As a result, he says, the role of nonprofit organizations, including how they should be treated by the Federal Government, is increasingly being debated on Capitol Hill and in American universities. "Conservatives have long argued that the nonprofits can fill the gaps left by the shrinking of the welfare state," Mr. Kuttner said. "But liberals like me -- a vanishing breed, it seems -- argue that the depth of the nation's problems shows they are wrong."
Aaron Heffron, assistant research director of the Independent Sector, a Washington group that represents more than 800 nonprofit groups, foundations and corporate-giving programs, says the nonprofit sector has grown faster than either government or business in the past 15 years.
In 1994, the most recent year for which data are available from the group, some 16.4 million people worked in or volunteered for some 1.4 million nonprofit groups, as opposed to 101.3 million people employed in some 23 million businesses, and 25 million people employed by 87,000 governmental organizations. Since 1982, the number of people employed in the nonprofit sector has grown by a third, as opposed to a 25 percent growth in the numbers employed by government or business.
If Harvard has its way, the quality as well as quantity of nonprofit sector employees will grow; a Hauser Center priority is to give professionals who already work in this sector advanced training. Drawing on the resources of other Harvard departments and professional schools, five faculty members, four of whom will be recruited this year, will offer Kennedy School graduate students courses in nonprofit policy issues and managerial training.
"What will distinguish the Hauser Center from other schools and departments," said Mr. Nye, "is its comprehensiveness. All of Harvard will be involved, from the law and business schools to the divinity school."
Pam Solo, founder and president of Institute for Civil Society, a nonprofit research and grant-making foundation just across the Charles River in Newton, Mass., said, "It is significant that Harvard is mobilizing its vast resources to become a training ground for what is an increasingly important sector of society."
As further evidence of the surge of interest in this area, in 1996 the private institute received a $35 million gift from a New England family that wishes to remain anonymous, the largest philanthropic gift given that year in this country.
Harvard is committed to raising $20 million to supplement the $10 million gift from the Hausers. The money, among other things, will finance 10 to 15 full-time fellowships, and many more partial scholarships, for the center's students.

HEADLINE: Trying to Salvage Savings Lost in Holocaust

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Samuel Klapholz was 30 years old and living at home with his widowed mother, Gusta, when he heard rumors that the Nazis were about to round up every Jew in his Polish town, Chryzanow. He asked a Christian who shopped at the family's hardware story to hold the family's financial documents: i.o.u.'s from customers, contracts and two insurance policies on his mother.
A few days later, on Feb. 17, 1943, when the Nazis came and took his mother to be shot, Mr. Klapholz fled. The customer, Piotr Oczkowski, let him spend the night in his dog's house, so that if the SS came, he could deny Mr. Klapholz was in his home. 
 Mr. Klapholz spent the rest of the war in hiding, and then made his way back to his hometown, where he collected the papers, which he presumed had little value, from Mr. Oczkowski.
Now, five decades later, Mr. Klapholz believes the documents may be worth something after all. He is one of what may become thousands of claimants seeking to collect on insurance policies expropriated by the Nazis when they seized Jewish property in Germany and the countries they occupied.
On Thursday a major German insurer pledged to investigate such claims, a move that puts pressure on other companies to do the same.
Mr. Klapholz and the niece he helped hide from the Nazis are now waiting to see if the two policies will pay even a small amount.
"I called my daughter and said that if this happens, it will be like a miracle," said his niece, Rose Silberberg Skier.
Mrs. Skier has her own harrowing story of survival. She hid for two years from the Nazis and heard the terrified pleas of her four-year-old sister as soldiers dragged her away to be shot. After the war, Mrs. Skier made her way to New York City, to Queens, where she struggled to raise a family on the meager income her husband received from a hat factory, a discount drug store and then a video rental business.
For years insurers resisted claims from her uncle and other Holocaust families, refusing to honor most of the policies.
Some insurers have insisted on death certificates, which the Nazis did not issue, although they did keep lists of their victims. Other companies have said their records were destroyed in the war. And at least two have said that since the Communists seized their Eastern European assets, any obligation has been transferred to those governments, all of which have been replaced in recent years.
Lawyers are seeking class action status for the lawsuit and expect that eventually more than $1 billion will be recovered, according to Larry Kill, a partner at Anderson Kill & Olick, a New York law firm that specializes in suits brought by policyholders. Most claimants are children or heirs of those who died in the Holocaust.
The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a growing array of efforts to win restitution for victims of the Holocaust whose property was systematically taken by the Nazis.
One of the insurers, Allianz A.G., said it intended to honor the claims, while others, notably Assicurazioni Generali, a giant Italian company, say the claims are without merit.
Generali said last month that since the Communists seized its Polish operations after the war, the Warsaw Government is responsible for paying claims. The company that said it would open its records for inspection, but that it would not accept liability.
"We are respectful of these requests but we feel that we have no legal obligation to pay," Armando Zimolo, the senior spokesman for Generali, said yesterday. "Certainly the people who placed claims were our clients, but in many Eastern European countries, Generali's property was expropriated and the new state insurance companies absorbed the commitment to pay. This has been known for the past 40 years. From a legal point of view, we are perfectly exempt from all responsibility to their heirs."
Mr. Zimolo said that if courts do order payment, the company will argue that it owes only the face amounts at the time the policies were issued, with no adjustment for interest or inflation.
Mr. Klapholz had tried to collect on the policies that his mother took out in 1924 and 1926 as investments that would mature in 1945 and 1947.
"I called the Polish consulate in the 1950's and they said that they had nothing to do with it," Mr. Klapholz recalled.
Samuel Hersly, another Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust and now lives in Queens, also tried to collect on a policy without success, and is now a plaintiff in the suit.
Mr. Hersly, who has never met Mr. Klapholz, said that while he does not have the original policy, he has an identical one owned by a friend. He also has the number of a policy his father, Joseph, who died in the Holocaust, took out in 1935 with Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta, an affiliate of Allianz. The policy was to be paid in currency worth 60 ounces of gold, about $2,000 then and about $20,000 today.
In 1952 a lawyer for Riunione wrote to Mr. Hersly acknowledging the policy, but stating that any liability was with the Polish Government.
"They did not even offer to return the premiums that had been paid," Mr. Hersly said.

HEADLINE: As West Shuns Iran, Russia Pulls Closer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 11

 BODY:
Russia vowed today to strengthen ties with Iran while Western European nations distanced themselves from Teheran after a German court blamed the Iranian Government for ordering the assassination of exiled dissidents.
"We have good, positive cooperation with Iran, which shows a tendency to grow," President Boris N. Yeltsin said today during talks with an Iranian visitor, Ali Akbar Nateq-Noori, the head of the Iranian Parliament. In a unusual bipartisan display, Mr. Yeltsin's warm words were echoed by Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament. 
 While Russia has long sought to improve its ties with Iran, the visit of Mr. Nateq-Noori took place at a particularly inauspicious moment. It occurred just after a German court ruled on Thursday that Iran had ordered the killing of four Iranian Kurds gunned down in a Berlin restaurant in 1992. It was the first time a European court has blamed the Iranian Government in any of the deaths of scores of its exiled citizens that have occurred since the previous Government was overthrown in 1979. Four men were sentenced to prison on Thursday for carrying out the 1992 killing.
The court decision, which did not name Iranian leaders but clearly identified them, prompted Germany to expel four Iranian diplomats and suspend a policy known as "critical dialogue" with Iran. Germany is Iran's largest Western trading partner, and the policy has provided a means of maintaining good economic relations. Washington has maintained that Germany should use its trade relationship to influence Iran's behavior.
Backing the German move, the European Union invited its members to recall their ambassadors from Teheran in a demonstration of disapproval. All of the Union members except Greece indicated that they would do so.
The United States has long been critical of Western European countries for trading with Iran, despite evidence that the Government is a sponsor of terrorists.
But even as the West was beginning to close ranks, Russia's political establishment was busy courting the Iranians. "There is no court in the world which has the authority to pass sentence on a whole nation," Mr. Seleznyov said, mocking the German court decision.
Iran, for its part, used the Moscow meetings to ridicule Western efforts at isolation. Mr. Nateq-Noori was greeted with full honors and spoke before Russia's Parliament. He was interviewed on the popular "Hero of the Day" television program on the NTV independent television network. In a joint press conference with Mr. Seleznyov he condemned "the West's intrigue against the East."
Russia's motivation in cozying up to Iran is both economic and political.
To help its cash-strapped military and nuclear establishment, Russia has sold submarines and other weapons to Iran. It has also signed a contract with Iran to construct a nuclear reactor, despite Western warnings that the project will help Teheran's program to develop nuclear weapons.
Politically, close ties with Iran are also a way for the Yeltsin Government to placate Russian nationalists by demonstrating Moscow's independence from the West.
Since NATO's decision to take in new Eastern European members, Russian hard-liners have urged the Government to respond by forming new alliances with Iran and other non-Western nations.
Moscow's largely symbolic treaty for closer cooperation with the former Soviet republic of Belarus also reflects the Kremlin's efforts to placate nationalist public opinion.
"Russia turns to Oriental states to countervail NATO expansion," said the newspaper Kommersant Daily.
Further, both Iran and Russia have interests in the development of oil in the Caspian Sea region.
But there are real limits on Russia's cooperation with Iran and other "Oriental nations." Many analysts here see Iran and Iraq as weak counterweights to the West and view talk of a strategic alliance as more posturing than substance.
Indeed, Moscow has sought to assure Washington that it will limit its military cooperation with Iran. Moscow, for example, will not provide Iran with more submarines once its contract has expired.
But Moscow's effort to balance its American and Middle Eastern diplomacy does not mean the Kremlin is prepared to join in the condemnation of Iran.
Mr. Nateq-Noori, for his part, appeared to be enjoying the moment -- and the deference his nation was receiving on the diplomatic stage.
"Our policy is strengthening and widening relations with all countries of the world except the United States and Israel," Mr. Nateq-Noori said in his "Hero of the Day" interview.

HEADLINE: The Mob and the Markets

 BODY:
The dramatic decline in street crime has been applauded throughout New York City. No less impressive, however, has been the city's progress in combating organized crime in the Fulton Fish Market, the commercial garbage-collection industry and other mob-influenced places of business. The next step is for the City Council to adopt legislation to expand the city's ability to remove corrupt businesses and unions from all the big produce, meat and fish markets where kickbacks and extortion are endemic. Unfortunately, some labor leaders are opposing the legislation or trying to water it down. Council members should resist those efforts and pass the bill.
For decades it was believed that removing organized crime from certain parts of New York City's infrastructure was beyond the reach of government. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the City Council leadership have shown otherwise. Their actions have lowered the cost of fish, garbage collection and doing business at the Javits Convention Center. They have also sent a signal that businesses and consumers no longer have to accept the mob as a fact of life. 
Under current law, the city's Department of Business Services may regulate only the Fulton Fish Market, where it can require background and fingerprint checks on merchants and employees and can deny licenses to businesses that have associations with criminal figures. The legislation before the Council would expand these powers to cover the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, the Gansevoort Meat Market in Manhattan, the Brooklyn Terminal Market and the Brooklyn Wholesale Meat Market. The bill, sponsored by Councilman Kenneth Fisher of Brooklyn, would also expand the city's authority at the Fulton Fish Market and elsewhere to remove mob-connected union leaders, who in the past have been able to call wildcat strikes and take other actions to shut down the markets.
In recent weeks, the Central Labor Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has mounted a campaign to kill or weaken the bill, arguing that it lacks sufficient due process for the removal of labor officials. But the legislation is modeled after other bills that have worked successfully in monitoring unions and businesses in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. It is restricted carefully to those few unions directly involved in the food industry, and it would allow the unions to challenge any action in court.
By threatening to withhold political support from Council members, the Central Labor Council has succeeded in scaring off several early backers of the legislation. Organized labor has done itself a disservice, however, by belittling the problem at a time when some leaders of the relevant unions have been found by the Department of Investigation to have close links to the mob. Due process for unions and businesses is a serious concern, but the city has so far gone after only cases where there was clear cause, and safeguards in the bill would prevent abuses in the future. The Council's Economic Development Committee is to vote on the legislation next week. This is no time to let up on the drive against organized crime.

HEADLINE: CARE Defended

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Raymond Bonner's review of "The Road to Hell," by Michael Maren (March 23), correctly points out that it is "not a balanced book." Unfortunately, Mr. Bonner then uncritically accepts some of Mr. Maren's diatribe rather than delivering the evenhanded analysis that an informed discussion of humanitarian aid warrants. 
 Mr. Bonner notes Mr. Maren's criticism of CARE (of which I am president) for receiving $16 million for programs in Somalia from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Why is this "damning"? The reviewer does not explain that CARE received the funds over two years for managing a massive logistics operation, involving the receipt and delivery of 100,000 tons of food each year for 36 camps feeding hundreds of thousands of refugees. CARE was asked by the High Commissioner to improve the management of the delivery of refugee relief in Somalia, and this is what we did.
To blame humanitarian assistance for Somalia's problems in the 1980's, including the perpetuation of refugee camps, is to ignore the larger cold war context in which those efforts were undertaken. For example, the reviewer does not tell us that the United States alone spent $622 million on military aid to Somalia during the 1980's, while providing only one-fifth that amount in economic assistance.
Many of the crises to which agencies like CARE respond are complex and dangerous. Somalia was no exception. CARE's guiding principle is to save lives, relieve suffering and promote recovery. We are proud of our record in achieving those objectives. As Mr. Bonner points out, Mr. Maren's book "largely ignores the good that aid does" and "even Mr. Maren says that 100,000 lives were saved in Somalia."
We agree with Mr. Bonner that this book will not be the last word on humanitarian aid. The most capable and courageous fieldworkers cannot substitute for the failure of governments to support long-term economic and social development, or of political and diplomatic leaders to settle violent conflicts and find lasting solutions for massive refugee movements. We hope that CARE and other aid organizations can be part of an urgent exploration of how the world should collectively respond to complex emergencies.

THE BEGGAR AND
 THE PROFESSOR
 A Sixteenth-Century Family Saga.
 By Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.
 Translated by Arthur Goldhammer.
 Illustrated. 407 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $29.95. 
 Thomas Platter (1499-1582) was born in the Swiss mountains, in the days of Machiavelli and Michelangelo. A much younger son, fathered when Platter was 75, died in the early 17th century, the age of Cardinal Richelieu and the Three Musketeers. Three generations of Platters -- the father, a son and the younger son -- straddle three centuries; their correspondence and memoirs add life and color to Renaissance and Reformation. An erudite and elegant chronicler of early modern times, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has mined their output (long available to scholars) to paint a realistic likeness of the 16th century from the bottom up. Now available in Arthur Goldhammer's sensitive translation, "The Beggar and the Professor," Mr. Le Roy Ladurie's kaleidoscope should prove profitable to students and fun for nonspecialists.
Poor, undernourished and more or less abandoned by a mother encumbered by too many children (see Hansel and Gretel), little Thomas makes ends meet as best he can, working for other highlanders; he then joins a gang of boys who panhandle, pilfer and prey their way across central Europe all the way to Poland and back to Switzerland. For him and some of his contemporaries, begging and learning could go hand in hand. By his 20's, the lad had learned a trade, rope making, and picked up the equipment of a Renaissance humanist: Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
Learning, a rare commodity, commanded respect and profit. In 1529, Thomas inherited a donkey and some household linen, got married, opened a school in Basel (where Holbein painted Erasmus at the time), sold wine and apples to pupils who adored him, and became a man of modest substance. The Platters now drank wine at meals, and washed more frequently.
God helps those who help themselves. In uncertain times, a man must turn his hand to everything. Platter became a printer. In an age of inflation, investment is wise: "On the advice of God and several other worthy people," Platter went into debt to buy houses and a farm. Overwork induced dizzy spells that bloodletting, enemas and concoctions of ginger failed to relieve, so Platter learned the rudiments of medicine. When he was not teaching, printing, plaiting rope, dabbling in real estate, practicing medicine or farming, he lent and borrowed money, took in boarders who ate the produce of his farm and helped bind the books he printed, and navigated the treacherous waters of multiple religious reforms.
Much ice had melted on Swiss glaciers since Luther launched his revolution in 1517. Thomas had studied in part-Protestant Alsace and wholly Protestant Zurich, where hired killers riding horses with padded hooves prowled the city in search of Zwingli, the heretic. He had watched reformist iconoclasts destroying papist idols, but not before removing the gold that gilded them. He had served in a war between Protestant and Roman Catholic Swiss cantons, and he would print the first edition of Calvin's "Institutes." Hebrew went with biblical fanaticism and iconoclasm, Greek with Hellenic humanism. The Platter temper, like that of Basel, where they lived, inclined them to the benevolent religion of Erasmus and to the skepticism of another contemporary, Francois Rabelais, who sneered at evangelical demonizers and "papimaniacs" alike. So the shepherd, goatherd, cowherd, beggar, street singer, nomad, who had once aspired to be a priest, became a headmaster instead and a true Renaissance man.
The success story is not unrelieved. Pestilence, war and famine ruled the land, and the first was particularly obtrusive. Plague struck, killed, subsided and returned, only to ebb once more. Born in 1536, the year his father printed Calvin's "Institutes," Felix, Thomas's only son by his first wife, survived, while his three sisters died of the plague. Smallpox and measles, too, were killing millions, but Felix lived through them, and learned to play lute, clavichord and spinet. When he died in 1614, he owned 42 musical instruments. But his life would be dedicated to medicine.
Felix was 16 when he left Basel for six years of medical study in Montpellier. In French lands, he discovered a new world, where beds were not covered with eiderdowns the German way but tucked in at the edges; where riders risked running into hanged men dangling from gibbets; where dangerous gangs haunted forests, taverns and approaches to towns; where city walls meant to keep out vagrants, robbers and wolves would soon be put to more martial use in wars of religion.
Reformation was the illegitimate offspring of Renaissance humanism, and Protestant students, like other heretics, ran the risk of being burned alive. Riding to Lyons, Felix had passed a "Christian in a shirt," with a bundle of straw tied to his back to fuel the fire in which he would shortly die. By then, many of those who were burned at the stake might first be strangled in deference to new humanitarian sensibilities. But Felix kept his head well down.
Arriving in Montpellier, Felix, still short of French, addressed his innkeeper in Latin. Within a few years, the servant maid who took off his boots was hanged in the city square for killing the infant fathered on her by a priest and throwing it in a latrine. The medical school got her body for dissection. Anatomists snatched corpses from gallows and graves, and Felix dissected dogs or dug up newly buried bodies, while his tutor dissected his own wife, his sister-in-law and his stillborn son. Modern medicine meant practice, but also reference to Greek sources rediscovered: antiquity ruled now, not the "Arabic garbage" of earlier generations.
From his Marrano tutor, a Protestant sympathizer who kept kosher, Felix learned how to mix pomades, carminatives that banished gas, cinnamon-and-ginger potions that reduced it, antidotes to plague made of powdered viper. He also, obviously, became an excellent doctor before returning home. Mr. Le Roy Ladurie accompanies him -- and us -- on the way north and east, avoiding highwaymen and meeting professional pilgrims trudging to Compostela to expiate the sins of those willing to pay to avoid the perils of the road.
Horses go lame, boats capsize; ferrywomen hold you hostage; inns collapse, killing their patrons (nobody sues!); forests teem with peril (as Little Red Riding Hood knew). But "voyagism," just coming into vogue, was a Protestant and humanist counterpilgrimage, in which salvation comes from education and edification. There are Roman ruins, and more recent ones, to visit; bookshops to explore; castles to admire -- not least, at Lusignan, that of the fairy Melusine, a great builder, also responsible for importing green beans from America. The New World is represented by more than fairy enterprise: exotic turkeys, red wood from Brazil, cod from Newfoundland; and there is syphilis, a novel ("French") disease to treat.
Vineyards are everywhere, especially when Felix approaches Paris, the most populous city in Christendom -- and the most bibulous too, since lousy local wine had to be drunk before it turned sour in a few months. Felix (echoed later in the century by his brother) notes the ring of windmills round the capital, the wealth of tennis courts, the cemeteries stinking to high heaven, the splendor of Notre Dame (its choir full of pimps and madams, its bays sheltering foundlings) and endless, irritating processions of priestlings and monks. Then he hurries home to pass his doctorate (a costly proposition), marry (some hazardous moments there too) and embark on 57 years of distinguished practice.
Mr. Le Roy Ladurie's commentary places all this in context; it relates private concerns to public doings, explains society, economy, production, consumption, learning, law, trade, travel, taxes and tax revolts, warfare and courting. It suggests how death from plague and other causes increased opportunities for survivors; how riots and risings often achieved their ends even when their leaders had been put to death; how chronic insecurity went with chronic fear: of portents and haunted nights, of horses surprisingly frequent in bad dreams, of stepmothers who mistreat the children of earlier marriages (hence Cinderella), of snow and rushing rivers and violence and hunger and the rest. The author does not tell a story; he turns about the stories that the Platters tell and swathes their observations in his own. He hunts down perceptions: those of his characters, those of contemporary chroniclers and those of later scholars like him. Almost everything you may want to know about the 16th century is in these pages. A lot of it is with us still, for better or, mostly, for worse.

 BODY:

THE SONG OF THE DODO: Island Biogeography
 in an Age of Extinctions
 By David Quammen.
 Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $17.
Selected as one of the best books of 1996 by the editors of the Book Review, this work shows that life on an island can be as hard for animals as it is for castaways. With few others of their kind to absorb evolutionary blows, species tend to vanish. The problem, the author explains, is that man is turning all of nature into islands. This is the "richly elaborated work of a literary craftsman," Robert Kanigel said here.
 
A LONG FATAL LOVE CHASE
By Louisa May Alcott. Dell, $6.99.
The author of "Little Women" also the author of a novel of murder, suicide and sexual obsession? Believe it now, because this book was never published in Alcott's own era. After all, her heroine, Rosamond, unwittingly marries a manipulative man who already has a wife. In 1995 our reviewer, Stephen King, called the book "a wonderful entertainment" that "tends to confirm Alcott's position as the country's most articulate 19th-century feminist." More of the gentle author's dark side is revealed in BEHIND A MASK: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott, edited by Madeleine Stern (Quill/ Morrow, $12). In the title tale, a seemingly sweet young governess proves to be a clever and rapacious gold digger. It is "a brilliant and mordantly funny take on a woman's ability to twist men around the ends of her delicate fingers," Mr. King wrote in the same review.
 
THE CLOISTER WALK
By Kathleen Norris. Riverhead, $12.50.
A poet, a Presbyterian and a married woman, the author is also a Benedictine oblate. Here she describes how her sojourns at a monastery in Minnesota taught her that the renunciation of individuality can also be a profound embrace of community. "She is one of history's writing pilgrims but also a contemporary American one," Robert Coles said in these pages in 1996.
 
JOHN'S WIFE
By Robert Coover. Scribner Paperback, $13.
She doesn't have a name, but she has inspired love and lust in every man in the small town where she lives -- except, perhaps, her husband. Fashioning a universe of motley characters, "Mr. Coover plunges in with considerable gusto," Brad Leithauser wrote in the Book Review last year. The author's 1991 novel, PINOCCHIO IN VENICE (Grove, $12), has also been reissued. In this retelling, Pinocchio is neither puppet nor boy but a 100-year-old art historian called Professor Pinenut. "This is one of those books that, like Thomas Pynchon's 'V.,' will not yield to the Reader's Digest peptic juices," Anthony Burgess said here.
 
THE CHALLENGER LAUNCH DECISION: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA
By Diane Vaughan. University of Chicago, $14.95.
The devastating error in judgment that led to the destruction of the Challenger was a product of NASA culture, which minimized individual responsibility and encouraged de-emphasizing risks, says a sociologist. "One by one she unravels the conclusions of the Rogers Commission," our reviewer, Alex Roland, wrote last year.
 
A FROZEN WOMAN
By Annie Ernaux. Translated by Linda Coverdale.
Seven Stories, $9.95.
This autobiographical novel, published in France in 1981, concerns a young woman's search for freedom, first from her provincial roots in Normandy and later from the confines of a middle-class marriage. There are "plenty of women readers for whom its bitter, sad, intelligent story of enclosure will ring true," Hermione Lee said in these pages in 1995.
 
THE DEMON-HAUNTED WORLD: Science as a Candle
in the Dark
By Carl Sagan. Ballantine, $14.
According to the author, there is a real monster -- ignorance -- in every tabloid headline. In his last book Carl Sagan makes an impassioned case against false science and superstition, from creationism to alien abductions. "He is seldom wrong" and "he always writes clearly," James Gorman wrote in the Book Review last year.
 
LILY WHITE
By Susan Isaacs. Harper Paperbacks, $6.99.
Lee White, born Lily, is a criminal defense attorney whose life has often been messy -- and now her career might become so too. She's taken on a high-profile murder case in this "big, fat, happy feast of a book," Jon Katz said here in 1996.
 
IN DEFENSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
By Barbara R. Bergmann.
A New Republic Book/Basic Books, $13.
An economist argues that affirmative action has boosted American productivity and is necessary to right the injustices inherent in many of the nation's institutions. Last year our reviewer, Paul Berman, wrote that Ms. Bergmann "makes sound practical sense." ENDING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: The Case for Colorblind Justice, by Terry Eastland (Basic Books, $13), takes the opposite view. Mr. Eastland, a journalist, feels that the idea of America as a strict meritocracy goes back to the Founding Fathers. In the same review, Mr. Berman said that the author "conducts a useful tour" of the other side's arguments. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
A One-Price Jaunt To Jamaica

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
JUST east of Ocho Rios, about a half dozen resorts line the north shore of Jamaica like beached cruise ships. Each has its own manicured grounds, activity board, perfect scallop of sand, guarded front gate and perfumy name -- Ciboney, Sandals, Sans Souci. Many sprang up after Hurricane Gilbert ravaged Jamaica's gold coast in 1988, and specialize in a kind of Caribbean vacation I've long wanted to try: the all-inclusive package, providing round-trip plane tickets, van transfers from the airport in Montego Bay to Ocho Rios (taking about two hours each way), accommodations, meals, drinks from the bar, water sports, tips and tax. At some, you can even get a free wedding if you bring the right person and check in for at least five days.
In March, when my mother and I took an all-inclusive three-night vacation at the 78-room Plantation Inn, we didn't need a cake or bouquet. But we were intent on getting absolutely everything else included in the package. She kept charge of the list: welcome cocktails and fruit basket, half-hour massage, glass-bottom boat ride -- tick, tick, tick. She also chose Jamaica, which she knew and loved from two earlier visits, the first during the late 70's, when political turmoil on the island kept most vacationers away. Prices had risen and sun worshipers had flocked back by the time she and my father returned 10 years ago. On that trip they discovered Ocho Rios, which appealed to them because it seemed less touristy than the island's other top resort spot, Montego Bay. This time, my father didn't feel like coming along, but my 73-year-old mom went out and bought a new bathing suit for the trip. 
 In February I started hunting through a confounding array of newspaper ads for the right package. It was the Caribbean high season (which runs from December to April), but even so the prices offered by travel agencies and airline tour companies for three-night Jamaican holidays started as low as $500 a person, based on double occupancy.
To gauge the value of the advertised deals, I checked the airlines for the price of a round-trip ticket to Jamaica. At the time, a looming pilots' strike at American Airlines had generated a sale, and Air Jamaica countered. This brought the average fare down from about $350 to $275, departing from BWI Airport in Baltimore, near my parents' home. (The fare from Kennedy International Airport in New York was roughly the same.)
Then I called tour companies like American Airlines Fly Away Vacations and Air Jamaica Vacations, and visited a number of travel agencies in my neighborhood -- each of which offered its own list of resorts in Ocho Rios, at a variety of prices. The rates differed even for the same resort, depending on whom I talked to.
I was getting nowhere until I contacted a company called Tourscan. Over the last decade this Connecticut-based travel agency has been amassing data on three- and seven-night Caribbean packages offered by resort chains and tour companies. For a single hotel, they consider as many as 50 different deals, running them through a computer and coming up with the lowest-priced option for each resort. The results are published twice a year in a catalogue that can be extremely helpful to comparison shoppers.
I was looking for the best resort value as opposed to a rock-bottom price, which meant that I needed to know what the resorts were like. For descriptions, I turned to the "Jamaica Handbook," published by Moon Travel, and found myself most interested in four places: the little Hibiscus Lodge on the cliffs in downtown Ocho Rios (where the rack rate for doubles was $76, including breakfast only); the lovely old Jamaica Inn, beloved by Winston Churchill and Noel Coward (with $425 rooms for two, a night, all-inclusive); the Enchanted Garden, which sits in the hills south of town ($330 a night for two, all-inclusive); and the Plantation Inn (with all-inclusive doubles for $389, and a special free third-night offer, which brought the actual rate down to $259).
Theoretically, my mother and I could have purchased a package for any of these through Tourscan or one of the other travel agencies and tour companies I contacted. But the economical Hibiscus Lodge was sold out, and the Jamaica Inn was just too pricey. Air Jamaica offered us three nights at the Enchanted Garden for $771 each; American Airlines found a room there at $678, and Tourscan quoted a price of $621. The lowest price for the Plantation Inn was also from Tourscan, at $658. I went with Tourscan, of course, but chose the Plantation Inn, because it is right on the beach.
Then I spent the next several weeks wondering whether I'd made the right decision. My mother put individually wrapped spaghetti dinners into the freezer for my dad and told me to stop spinning my wheels.
Finally, on a blustery Monday morning we boarded an Air Jamaica Boeing 747 for the flight to Montego Bay, arriving at about noon. The return flight left on Thursday at 5 P.M., giving us three and a half full days in the Jamaican sunshine. We didn't fly Lovebird First Class, but were still served rum punch and champagne with the hot lunch.
On the ground at Sangster International Airport, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our van, which cruised east on the treacherous two-lane highway that runs between Montego Bay and Ocho Rios. Brightly painted craft shops, uniformed schoolchildren and stray goats lined the road, with green mountains on the right and the blue Caribbean on the left, separating the island from Cuba, its nearest neighbor to the north. Like a seasoned tour guide, my mother pointed out Discovery Bay, where Columbus is thought to have landed in 1494, and Jamaica's top attraction, Dunn's River Falls. But Ocho Rios surprised her because it is much more developed than it used to be, bypassed by a new section of highway and surrounded by shopping centers.
As it turned out, this hardly mattered because the Plantation Inn (which lies on the highway about two miles east of town) is an utterly self-contained place, offering guests every inducement to stay put. Set in a garden where workmen sweep up a litter of spent hibiscus blooms every morning, the 36-year-old resort has a grandly columned entrance facing two tennis courts and bearing an emblem that proclaims "Carpe Diem." The foyer yields to a wide patio restaurant for dancing and dining beneath a towering fig tree, banked by two multistoried wings of rooms that all have balconies and ocean views.
The little swimming pool is just below the patio, and two long flights of steps lead down to the beach, bisected by a pier, with a swimming platform bobbing in the warm, clear water. Beyond, the cove was alive with all kinds of aquatic conveyances -- jet skiers from Sandals next door, a parasailer, windsurfers, sunfish, plastic kayaks and the inn's own rather tired looking glass-bottom skiff.
The bellboy who took us to our third floor room didn't even look as if he wanted a tip, and the chamber was roomy, with a spotless tile floor, louvered windows, an air-conditioning unit and a ceiling fan, a big walk-in closet, private bath, king-sized bed, TV and, of course, the piece de resistance, a balcony. The decor was spartan Caribbean traditional -- comfortable, but characterless. If I'd wanted tasteful style and a four poster plantation bed I should have sprung for the Jamaica Inn, as I discovered on a jog there the next morning. Meanwhile, mom and I unpacked at the Plantation.
I was feeling a little stunned -- unsure whether to take the free tennis clinic, play bingo in the game room or head down to the beach. But when another bellboy appeared at the door with two glasses of rum punch, my mother knew just what to do. She ticked "welcome cocktail" off her list and sat me down on the balcony to drink. Then we filled out orders for room service breakfast the next morning, took naps, did laps, popped open the bottle of French sparkling wine that arrived shortly before dinner, dressed for dinner, and eventually made our appearance on the patio.
There we found a band playing a Musak-y sort of reggae, a peacock on the dance floor, only a handful of other diners and a handsome waiter who asked us what we wanted in a wonderful, sing-song Jamaican way. Each evening's menu included at least one Jamaican specialty, like goat stewed in curry sauce. But mom and I generally chose more familiar dishes -- salad, mild pumpkin soup, fish in papaya sauce and French pastry. None of the dishes we sampled were truly distinctive, and my mother didn't have much of an appetite. Still, I kept telling her that it behooved us to order freely because the meals were all paid for.
We liked the breakfast buffet on the patio best, with eggs made to order and heaping platters of tropical fruit. Afterward my mother would stake out a chaise longue at the pool and I'd descend to the beach to kayak around the cove, body surf or join the morning snorkeling trip to the reef. Later we'd meet for lunch or tea or a walk in the garden. And so the days would have passed, were it not for the fact that we couldn't forget we were in Jamaica. Perhaps we have low thresholds for boredom or aren't really all-inclusive sorts of people -- but we both kept wanting to breach the front gate.
The shoulderless road outside the resort was too dangerous for walking. So on Tuesday afternoon we caught a shuttle that stops at the entrance a few times a day, charging $2 for a ride into town, where we strolled through the open-air craft market. Later, I stopped in the Hibiscus Lodge, which has modest but nicely appointed rooms, and booked a car for the next day at a rental firm on Main Street (for $45).
 JAMAICA has enough sights to keep a tourist busy for weeks. But our time was limited, and there was one thing we both dearly wanted to do: visit the home of Noel Coward, called Firefly Hill, about 20 miles east of Ocho Rios. The English playwright, performer and bon vivant built the house overlooking Blue Harbor in 1953, and it is now a beautifully maintained Jamaica Heritage Trust property that can be toured for $10 (including a fruit cocktail). It is a small, modern and utterly charming two-story building, with exquisite coast views, a painting studio lined by photos of Coward's famous friends (like Gertrude Lawrence, Peter Ustinov and Charlie Chaplin), a music room containing two grand pianos, and a changing room still stocked with Coward's own tropical print shirts.
After touring Firefly Hill, we shopped for souvenirs at a gallery in an old plantation house about five miles east of Ocho Rios, called Harmony Hall; wandered through Shaw Park Gardens (admission $4) right above town; lunched on salads and Bloody Marys (for about $12 each) at the Ruins Restaurant, beneath a 40-foot waterfall, and stopped to look at the Enchanted Garden resort, which has lush grounds, a big pool, hot tub and spacious modern rooms. But we weren't sorry we'd chosen the Plantation Inn. In fact, we were growing a bit eager to get back to the beach.
Just before we left the next afternoon, mom noted that we had yet to claim one last item included in the package -- a "Plantation gift," which turned out to be a little box with a picture of the resort on the lid. You could only get one per couple, but we didn't fight for it. By rights, it went to the list keeper.
 
Bottom line
 In addition to the price we paid for our Plantation Inn package, we spent about $50 each on tips to van drivers, gas, admissions, lunch at the Ruins and Jamaican departure tax ($15).

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
It's All in the Family and Keeps Growing

BYLINE: By RICHARD J. SCHOLEM

 BODY:
BRYANT and Cooper in Roslyn is arguably the best steakhouse on Long Island. Riverbay Seafood Bar and Grill in Williston Park could well be Nassau-Suffolk's No. 1 seafood restaurant. The three Poll brothers -- Dean, Gillis and George -- own both of these upscale, successful spots.
Not content with the success of their luxury restaurants four years ago, they made a decision to court patrons interested in economical dining as well. They opened Majors, an affordable, value-oriented steakhouse in East Meadow, featuring a 24-ounce, boneless rib-eye steak for $10.95. The 145-seat East Meadow Majors was followed by a 180-seat operation on the Jericho Turnpike in Woodbury. Majors recently invaded Florida with a 230-seat spot in Boca Raton and a soon-to-open 206-seat restaurant in Fort Lauderdale. 
 The Polls plan to open four more Majors a year for the next two years. After they have six units in Florida and others in Queens, Boston and Connecticut, they will decide on still further expansion. Even without the 37,000-square-foot, Fort Lauderdale branch, which is expected to feed 3,000 people a week, the Polls five restaurants now serve 15,000 meals a week.
That makes their growing empire the second largest Island based restaurant group to start out here and spread elsewhere. Sbarros, the now-huge, worldwide fast-food chain, is first. The Polls, whose restaurant roots date back to the 1940's, and Pappas, their family-owned seafood house in Sheepshead Bay, have made two recent changes at Majors. The showcase $10.95 steak is now $12.95 and Majors Steak Houses will soon become Majors Grill Houses. The decision to change the restaurant's name came when Floridians ordered more fish than 24-ounce steaks (12 percent to 4 percent). The former steakhouse responded by adding more swordfish, tuna and salmon to their menu
The reasons Majors has already doubled in size vary. The enthusiastic public response to the quality and price it offers is apparent. Less obvious is the monthly bonus system that not only rewards managers, but gives them a sense of ownership. Finally the Poll brothers do not attempt to build expensive new from-the-ground-up operations. Instead, they purchase the premises of failed chain restaurants (Bennigan's in Boca Raton, Dalt's in Fort Lauderdale) and make only modest alterations before re-opening them.

Openings
Ted Kopoulos, the owner of the soon-to-open Cafe on Main in Amagansett, says, "If you're in downtown Amagansett at 10 to 5, you have to go a mile to get a glass of water." His new 60-seat restaurant, with a counter and eight stools, will change that.
Mr. Kopoulos, who over the last 14 years has worked at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, Cato's in Bridgehampton and the Palm in East Hampton, plans to open his combination restaurant and specialty food market at 195 Main Street (267-2200) by mid-May.
It will offer everything from burgers and sandwiches to three-pound lobster dinners at entree prices that range from $5 to $45. Seafood and vegetables will be barbecued on a kitchen grill in the restaurant while 12 or 15 diners can choose self-service, salads and rotisserie fare and eat at high tables in the market. The Cafe on Main will be open daily from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M.

Chef's Corner
Gurney's Inn Resort and Spa, at 290 Old Montauk Highway in Montauk (668-2660), has hired a new executive chef, Frank J. Monahan. Mr. Monahan has previously held executive chef positions at the Mount Haven Resort in the Poconos and most recently at Serafino Cucina Italiano in Bayside.

Wine Tastings
The Mill River Inn in Oyster Bay (922-7768) and Lauber Imports are presenting a tasting of the champagnes of Krug on May 19. The five-course, $125 dinner includes an entree of roast loin of rabbit with a potato leek tart, pancetta and savory accompanied by Krug champagne.
Merlots of the World is the name of a $60 wine tasting dinner to be served at Aldo's of Greenport (298-1403) at 6 P.M. on April 20. Chateau St. Michelle, Rabbit Ridge, Eventum, Paumanok, Chateau Franc Mayne and Lenz wines will be poured at the dinner that will be prepared by Aldo Maiorana, the chef and owner.
The California Cafe at Roosevelt Field will hold a wine tasting dinner and silent auction to benefit WLIW-TV, Channel 21, on Wednesday at 6:30 P.M. The silent auction will feature premium wine donated by leading California wineries that include some limited releases, commemorative etched bottles and bottles signed by the wine maker. Among the dishes to be served is Kobe beef and porcini raviolo with a white truffle cream sauce.
Tickets cost $30 and can be ordered by calling Linda Sohn at 367-2100, Ext. 3017.

Potpourri
Montgomery's Restaurant in Roslyn (625-5553) is going back to its roots with a Brooklyn reunion night on Thursday at 5 P.M.
The evening will begin with a happy hour from 5 to 7 P.M. that will include specials on Schnapps and a Brooklyn-style hot dog stand offering complimentary franks and knishes. The menu will feature matzoh ball soup, kielbasi, mallow rolls, Charlotte Russe and egg creams with old-fashioned seltzer bottles on every table. The idea for the evening originated from the restaurant owners, who named it after Montgomery Street in Brooklyn where several of them grew up.
Ben's Kosher Delicatessen, Restaurant and Caterers (933-8400) is offering a Passover holiday dinner for 10 that includes an appetizer, matzoh soup, a choice of entree and five side dishes for $149.95. Customers who order by Thursday will also receive a buy one, get one free, gift booklet worth more than $40.
The Maidstone Arms, 207 Main Street, East Hampton (324-5006), is presenting a food and wine experience on April 15, 16 and 17. Throughout the three days guests will venture into the kitchen and experience a series of demonstrations by William Valentine, the chef, and Nina Friscia, the pastry chef.
The price for the entire three-day food and wine experience is $625. It includes a room at the inn for three nigths.
The Single Gourmet (6784-6186) is holding a musical cuisine brunch and concert. It features an all-you-can-eat brunch with unlimited mimosas and champagne followed by a Bach, Vivaldi and Marcello concert performed by the Seacliff Chamber Players. The event will be held at Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay.

HEADLINE: ART;
Out of Africa: Sayville Artist's Photographs Compiled on CD

BYLINE: By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
WHEN Esther Lidstrom was a child in Nassau County, she would creep through the bushes of the Whitney estate on Post Road in Old Westbury and climb on the split-rail fence to pet Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney's horses. She would then go home and with pencils and crayons paint the magnificent creatures she had just seen.
Years later, at an auction to benefit Friends of Conservation, a not-for-profit organization concerned about Africa's wildlife, Mrs. Whitney would pay $2,500 for an Esther Lidstrom painting of a leopard. 
 "Little did I know when I saw that leopard in Tanzania, that it would end up looking at the roast beef on her dining room table," said Ms. Lidstrom, a wildlife artist and photographer who lives in Sayville on Long Island's South Shore.
Using her artwork created from her many trips to Africa, Ms. Lidstrom is spreading the message on preserving the ecosystem and habitat of the animals in Africa.
Her paintings, many of which she has donated to benefit Africa's wildlife, have won recognition from such notables as Prince Charles; Richard Leakey, the anthropologist, and Guy Coheleach, the American wildlife artist. In her latest venture, Ms. Lidstrom's photographs will appear in a CD-ROM, "On Safari," to be released next month.
Using the approach called "ecotourism," the project educates people traveling to Africa in ways that would have the least impact on the environment. About $200,000 has been invested in the three-hour compact disk, along with its accompanying website, said its producer, David Anderson of Santa Barbara, Calif., whose safari company is backing the project financially. Two years ago, carrying 20 pounds of photographic equipment and one bag of clothes, Ms. Lidstrom joined Mr. Anderson's group of photographers in South Africa, spending a month in the bush, tracking and photographing animals for the project.
"The only hope for Africa's wildlife is sustainable responsible tourism," said Mr. Anderson. "The wildlife will not remain unless it benefits the local people economically."
With the population more than doubling in many African countries, the competition for living and farm space has put animals like the cheetah, rhinoceros, gorilla and elephant in danger of extinction. Viewing wildlife as an economic resource, Friends of Conservation educates African people to co-exist with the wildlife and habitat in ways that benefit all three, said the organization's president, Reute Butler. The group, which has headquarters in Chicago and London, works with a combined budget of $400,000 with most of its revenue coming from private and corporate donors. Two major fund-raising events are held annually in the United States. Both have auctions that include works donated by prominent wildlife artists.
"Esther is most faithful, she keeps coming back to give us work each year," Ms. Butler said. "She's very committed. She's the big repeater." Ms. Butler added that Ms. Lidstrom's pieces have raised several thousand dollars a year for Friends of Conservation.
A versatile artist who has exhibited at major museums including the Boston Museum of Science, Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the Witte Museum in San Antonio, Ms. Lidstrom chooses strong subjects, treating them in a gentle manner. Her works range from a portrait of a male lion done in the fine technical linework of scratchboard to a narrow horizontal stipple of nine zebra, their legs fading into empty space representing high grass. Some of her larger pieces, likethe two cheetahs that peer at visitors from over her fireplace, are done realistically in pastel. But it is her delicate yet strong impressionistic works, where the animals appear and then disappear in and out of colored washes touched with detailed penciled areas, that are most in demand.
"Esther is so good with color, she scares me," said Bill Bennett, owner of Bicato, a framing and art gallery in Jericho, who frames and sells Ms. Lidstrom's work.
Her acrylic wash prints sell from $30 for an unframed open edition piece to $170 for one matted in earth tones with a natural wood frame. "Her work is very well received," Mr. Bennett said. "I have people coming in asking when her next piece will be available." Mr. Bennett also exhibits works by other artists promoting conservation.
Although occasionally she is commissioned to create a painting for a donor, Ms. Lidstrom often donates a painting or print outright to benefit wildlife conservation. In 1990, she met Prince Charles when her framed, limited edition print, "Giraffes on the Run," which she donated, was auctioned for $1,000 at the Rolex-Prince of Wales Cup Polo Tournament to benefit Friends of Conservation and Friends of Masai Mara. Ms. Lidstrom twice attended events in Florida held in the presence of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, royal patron of Friends of Conservation.
During the 1991 auction to benefit Dr. Leakey's efforts to protect the elephants in East Africa, her donation of "Elephants at Mzima" earned $2,000. The winning bidder offered an extra $200 if Dr. Leakey, then director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, would sign his name next to Ms. Lidstrom's.
"He said, 'I never signed my name to someone else's work before,' and I replied, 'Well, no one's ever put their name on my work until today but that's fine because it's extra funds for the animals,' " Ms. Lidstrom said.
The elephants depicted in the painting had been observed by Ms. Lidstrom in 1982 at Tsavo in southern Kenya, where the heaviest poaching occurred before elephant ivory was banned from trade by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
"There is an excellent possibility that the elephants I painted there were poached and killed," she said.
The first of this year's Friends of Conservation events, "Breakfast at Tiffany's," will be sponsored by Tiffany & Company and held at its store in Oak Brook, Ill., in the spring. A painting by Ms. Lidstrom will be included in the auction. She has received a commission from C.I.D. Group Inc. in Blaisdale, N.Y., for a painting it will donate to the auction.
"Being it's an auction, I feel obliged to give them something for a wider audience," she said. "I am considering doing a gorilla mother and her baby that I remember from a tender scene I observed in Zaire." But, she said, she's not sure if the subject would be popular enough to benefit an auction. Elephants and big cats are usually the most popular subject.
"I can't reach in my pocket and take out $2,000, so I have to try and make a good choice," she said.
When she is not painting or visiting Africa, Ms. Lidstrom is teaching art at Sayville High School or presenting her 27-minute program to community organizations and special interest groups like the Audubon Society. Through the dramatic slide presentation of her photographs, a gentle and gracious homage to wildlife accompanied by musical segments from the soundtrack of the movie "Out of Africa," Ms. Lidstrom puts forth her message. She speaks only in the brief opening while the room is in darkness, urging her audience to relax and let the presentation "carry you gently on visual images and musical notes." She asks that once the presentation is over "you recall all the wondrous things you saw and imagine them gone forever."
The slides begin with early morning along Botswana's Chobe River, impalas standing black against a rosy dawn. The viewer is then taken from Namibia's Etosha Pan, across the Kalahari Desert of Botswana to Zimbabwe, through Tanzania's Serengeti plain, across the varied landscape of Kenya and into the forests of Zaire. There is a spotted leopard camouflaged in a lichen-encrusted tree, a lion family at play, a closeup of a curled elephant's trunk holding a bouquet of weeds and another of a serval cat with the reflection in his eye of Ms. Lidstrom taking the photograph.
Her love of animals took her to Africa six times in 12 years. It is from these safaris, where she stayed anywhere from a $550 a night luxury camp to a pup tent in the desert, that she draws the subject matter for the program.
She talks easily of watching five lions in a "feeding frenzy," as they devoured a large waterbuck 75 feet from where she sat eating soup.
"I don't like brutal things," she said. "But, I accept the fact that some have to die so others can live."
Her first trip was to Kenya in 1982. The next year she went to Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, crossing the Kalahari and pitching her own pup tent, which was soon surrounded by marauding hyenas. Here along the banks of the Chobe River in Botswana, she saw 83 elephants, "the most at one time." It was while she was in Zimbabwe near Victoria Falls that she found the "feisty" elephant she would eventually portray in pencil and gray acrylic washes and that would bring her recognition as an artist. Entitled "Elephant Charge," the piece figured significantly in her election to membership in the International Society of Animal Artists and recipient of its 1988 Award of Excellence with a special introduction by Guy Coheleach.
Three years later, in 1986, she went to Kenya and Tanzania where she witnessed the migration of about three million wildebeests and a half-million zebra on the Serengeti plain.
"It was incredible, the sheer numbers of animals as far as the eye could see," she said. "I sat surrounded amid the sound of all that munching. And when they suddenly began to run, the dust enfolded us and they just kept coming, more and more of them running past us on all sides. I thought that here was a sight seen by generations past and which must be seen by generations to come."
The experience sent her to the East Africa Wildlife Society headquarters in Nairobi, where she offered her help. This year, Ms. Lidstrom donated a shipment of 125 limited prints of cheetahs that sell for $96 each. Her donated prints, as well as ordered items, are for sale in the society's Nairobi gift shop as well as a shop in Kitch Tembo in Kenya's Masai Mara Game Reserve. They have brought letters to her from people around the world who purchased her works while traveling in Africa.
In 1991, she went to Kenya and Tanzania and this time was accompanied by two friends, Paul and Nancy Young. On a side trip, in search of gorillas, she crossed Rwanda into Zaire, climbing on foot to an outpost near the base of Kahuzi Biega, a mountain inhabited by gorillas. After tracking for more than three hours under leafy canopies and through wild orchids and thick vines, the small group found the elusive furry, black apes.
"Babies were swinging from vines, just like in the cartoons," Ms. Lidstrom said. "At one point, a large gorilla suddenly appeared with its jaws wide open, then, just as suddenly it was swallowed up by the vegetation."
From this experience came several slides for her presentation, including one of a mother gorilla cradling her infant, both bathed in the brilliant sunlight coming through a canopy of leaves; and a closeup of a curious, bright-eyed baby nicknamed "Bandit" because he had lost a hand in a fight.
The gorillas are in danger because people are cutting down the forests so the farmland can go higher, Ms. Lidstrom said. "The gorillas on one mountain top can't come down to go to another mountain so there is much concern about inbreeding among them and problems with genetic diversity."
While in the Serengeti, she made sketches of a leopard standing on a leafy tree branch "looking very elegant." Back home, she did a pastel from the sketches, "Leopard and Lace," which she sold for $2,000 to the C.I.D. Group, which donated it to the Friends of Conservation auction. It was sold for $2,500 to Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, who placed it in her hunting lodge in the Adirondack Mountains, redecorating her dining room to match the colors of the painting.
In 1993, Ms. Lidstrom went back to Zimbabwe, hoping to find her "special" elephant, the subject of "Elephant Charge," with the identifying two holes in his ear that had been punctured by branches. Although she didn't find him, she did find another elephant that inspired her to paint several more pieces. Future plans include returning to Botswana to visit Abu's camp, "where one can ride elephantback in the bush," and escorting a trip to Africa.
As she sketches and takes photographs of her subjects, Ms. Lidstrom also takes notes. At Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, where she searched for her elephant, she wrote in her notebook:
"Raising his head high, ears fully fanned, he paused holding himself proudly in a mighty stance," and then, "with a last twist of the head, the elephant gracefully wheeled his great bulk around and seconds later was swallowed by the grays and greens of thornscrub and mopane."
In conclusion, she wrote, "How long will there be a child, who like myself, would dream of elephants and other creatures living wild and free and to one day bear witness, as I have done, to the oneness of man and wildlife, without which the void would be too great to bear."

HEADLINE: New Organization Promotes Growth Of Black Business

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
THE spirit of entrepreneurship is very much alive in the growing but tempered economy of Westchester and Rockland Counties, as evidenced in the recent formation of the African-American Chamber of Commerce of Westchester and Rockland Counties.
Fifty or so black businessmen and women gathered recently in the banquet room of Grace Baptist Church here. During that get-acquainted breakfast, participants listened to executive officers from the Carver Federal Savings Bank, the Harlem-based financial institution that is planning to open a loan-and-mortgage center here later this spring. The event was the first sponsored by the African-American Chamber of Commerce and marked the founding of the organization. 
 Robin L. Douglas, president of the African-American Chamber of Commerce, said the idea for a black chamber of commerce came from a friend. "About five years ago, a friend of mine who works for the Minority Business Development Administration in the Governors' Office in New York noted that for some years I have given out a lot of free information about business development and economic development," Ms. Douglas said, sitting in the four-room suite in a downtown office building that also serves as headquarters for the new chamber of commerce and for Unforgettable Moments, an events and promotions company she heads.
Ms. Douglas added that she was also motivated by presentations made at a minority entrepreneur development conference in Washington that she attended about a year ago. "That's where I happened to meet Commerce Secretary Ron Brown," she said. "At his reception, during a quick conversation, I told him about my idea, and he said that it is a wonderful idea that was needed."
Shortly after that meeting, incorporation papers for the chamber were drawn up, said Lydon Williams, a Mount Vernon City Councilman.
The chamber's primary objective is to promote and coordinate commerce and industry that will strengthen a "sound and healthy climate in the Westchester and Rockland County areas."
Ms. Douglas, a lifelong resident here, said, "A chamber is supposed to promote business, but a chamber is also supposed to promote community relations and act as a welcome wagon to a community."
Other aims are to sponsor small-business seminars, find solutions to problems involving planning and zoning and to introduce members to companies and organizations interested in doing business in the region. Ms. Douglas said she believed that black entrepreneurs have special needs in establishing businesses.
Based on the latest census information, there about 3,400 black-owned businesses in Westchester County and just under 900 in Rockland County. Ms. Douglas said most of these companies specialize in retail and professional services.
"We seem to be doing well in our retail stores and professional services, things like lawyers, accountants and consulting types of services," she said. "We also seem to be doing very well in real estate. These areas seem to be our niche -- anything that does not require us to participate in the procurement process."
Though she expressed pleasure at the number of black-owned businesses, she said she felt there were large areas within the regional economy that blacks are not taking part in.
"The next level that we should be participating in is in corporate procurement and accounting procurement," she said, adding that she felt minorities were at a disadvantage in the fields of competitive bidding for government and corporate contracts.
The recent settlement by Texaco of its racial-discrimination case in White Plains is considered another reason for establishing the African-American Chamber. Dr. James W. Russell, associate dean and director of undergraduate programs at the Joseph I. Lubin School of Business at Pace University in Pleasantville, said that the history of racial discrimination has been a major hindrance to blacks gaining entry into the business world.
"Due to the history of discrimination, African-Americans have been unable to amass large amounts of wealth to establish businesses, but as corporations are making the managerial ranks more open, we should see an increase in women and minorities owning and managing their own companies," he said. "In the meantime, all the support minorities can get would be very helpful." Dr. Russell also said that an organization like the chamber, which has about 100 members, can provide opportunities in networking, professional training and acquiring knowledge about new technology.
The chamber has conducted a financial planning seminar for small business owners, sponsored by Chase Bank, and Marleen Y. Dandridge, treasurer of the local chamber, which is affiliated with the National African-American Chamber of Commerce, is planning to offer its members group rates on insurance.
Ms. Dandridge said she also hoped soon to sponsor a workshop on minority contracting procedures.
The Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, pastor of the Grace Baptist Church here, said of the new chamber: "It is good for the whole county, not just for black people. Westchester County has got this black population, and it must be brought to the table of business opportunity and economic opportunity. We have something to offer. And we ought to have access."
Robin Douglas, a life member of the National Council of Negro Women, knows firsthand the tribulations of owning and managing a small business. She and her mother operated Phases of Beauty Hair Salon/ Boutique here for more than seven years, but it closed a few years ago because of a changing economy. Commenting on that, Ms. Douglas said: "People are being downsized out of their jobs, and as you get downsized or right-sized out, that means that your disposable income is also right-sized, right out of circulation. We have always had our own plight within the economic system, but when things are very tight like they are now, we are forced to join together."
From Dr. Russell's viewpoint, the current economic climate is conducive for small independent companies. He also attributes the recent upswing in entrepreneurship to the advent of corporate downsizing.
He also said that a chamber of commerce is comparable to the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association. "Chambers of commerce are set up to help and elevate business owners and entrepreneurs," he said. "There are benefits that make it worthwhile, not only to businesses but the community as well."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Hyundai Tiburon FX;
Peppy, Plucky And, Yes, Hyundai

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
THINK Hyundai and, chances are, what comes to mind is a Japanese-like econocar without Japanese reliability. But the giant South Korean auto maker is fighting back with the Tiburon, an affordable little sports coupe that's all curves and swoops and punk colors like black-purple. While the Tiburon -- Spanish for "shark" -- may not turn around Hyundai's second-class image overnight, it will certainly give drivers an opportunity to connect again with the inner teen-ager who dwells in us all.
Actually, there are two Tiburons. The $13,914 base model comes with the 130-horsepower, 16-valve, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine used to power the compact Hyundai Elantra sedan, along with a decent package of comfort and convenience features: stereo cassette player, power windows, halogen headlights, split fold-down rear seats, tilt steering wheel. The $15,314 Tiburon FX offers a variant of the same engine with increased displacement to produce 10 more horsepower; it also offers fog lights, aluminum alloy wheels, four-wheel disk brakes and a decorative rear spoiler. Anti-skid brakes, power sunroof, 15-inch wheels (instead of 14-inch) and a four-speed automatic (what a waste!) are options. A Tiberon convertible has been shown as a concept car, but there are now no plans to produce it. 
 My test car was an FX, which turned a lot of heads with its hard-case looks. Better yet, it handled exceptionally well for a car in its class -- or, for that matter, just about any class. The engine is a raspy little striver, eager to rev up to 4,000 r.p.m., where it delivers very pleasing acceleration. The five-speed manual transmission feels a little rubbery but does what it's told, moving up and down the gears without a miss. Too bad there's no sixth gear for cruising, since the buzz of the engine turning over near 3,000 r.p.m is fatiguing. But, then, the Tiburon wasn't really built for chewing up miles on the interstates.
It was, however, designed for excitement on twisting roads. The Tiburon's light weight (2,600 pounds), quick steering, gas-filled shocks and taut, four-wheel independent suspension make it a car that asks to be driven aggressively. And the power-assisted disk brakes are more than up to the task of stopping what the engine longs to start.
The surprises don't end here: in many ways this is a practical little car. There is a lot of storage space under the coupe's hatchback, and even more when the rear seats are folded down. The projector-beam halogen headlamps are among the best I've ever seen, creating a bright, neatly defined pool of light that doesn't seem to irritate oncoming traffic. The air-conditioning is powerful and relatively quiet. And the optional premium sound system transforms the small cabin into a miniature concert hall.
The downside to the Tiburon, and to almost every inexpensive car built primarily for looks and performance, is ergonomics. The relatively narrow front bucket seats are comfortable enough, but are a challenge to get into because they are deeply scalloped and very low. While the rear is fairly accessible thanks to a nicely designed one-touch mechanism that slides the front seats forward, the back seats are meant only for the legs of children or double-jointed adults. Indeed, the auto show circuit "concept car" on which the Tiburon was based didn't even bother trying to fit two in the rear: it offered space for one person riding side-saddle.
Probably the most significant space limitation, though, is headroom. Those over 5 feet 10 inches tall would be well advised to forgo the optional sunroof, which cuts a few precious inches from the ceiling.
The target market for the Tiburon is obviously 20-somethings who aren't ready to settle for the workaday charms of, say, a Honda Civic or a Mazda Protege. But unfortunately for Hyundai, this is far from an empty niche. The Dodge and Plymouth Neon Coupes are cheaper and have more room in the back. The Nissan 200SX SE-R is better finished and offers a quieter, more refined engine. And for several thousand dollars more, the VW Golf GTI VR6 provides V6 power and awesome acceleration.
Equally worrisome from Hyundai's perspective, the whole low-end sports coupe category is under siege from mini-sport utilities, notably the Toyota RAV4. Seems that it's not easy to hold, much less woo, younger buyers who see cars more as fashion statements than as sophisticated transportation.
Still, it's nice to see the conservative South Korean car maker breaking out of the mold. Today the Tiburon; tomorrow, perhaps, a real sports car?

INSIDE TRACK: Fun, fun, fun -- and, besides, Daddy will hate it.

HEADLINE: New Haven Works On a 'Living Wage'

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
AN ordinance calling for a "living wage" for those doing work under contracts with New Haven was greeted enthusiastically by a coalition of civic, religious and labor groups at a city hall hearing last month.
The proposed wage, $8.92 an hour plus $5.28 for health benefits, would amount to a hefty increase over what those workers make now: $5 to $6.25 with no benefits for most. 
 Even Mayor John DeStefano Jr. and the city Controller, Gregory Brown, supported a living wage in principle -- though not if it would lead to a tax increase for city residents. Even if the health care coverage was reduced to $2 an hour, Mr. Brown estimated that the ordinance would cost the city about $2.7 million, and would result in an increase of $100 in property taxes on a $150,000 home.
The Rev. Kevan Hitch is pastor of First and Summerfield Methodist Church on the New Haven green and a member of Elm City Congregations Organized, an ecumenical coalition of two dozen urban and suburban congregations known by its acronym, Ecco. The coalition strongly supported the proposed ordinance and put forth an amendment that would extend coverage to workers at any company having five or more employees and getting $25,000 or more in tax relief from the city. "We felt that the living wage issue was so crucial, we made it one of our goals at our convention last year," said Mr. Hitch.
Strong support also came from Locals 34 and 35 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, representing the 3,500 workers at Yale University who finally settled on a new contract just before Christmas, after more than a year of acrimonious struggle. Mayor DeStefano is largely credited with breaking the yearlong stalemate by urging Yale to give its workers fair compensation.
"One of the major issues we were facing at Yale was the subcontracting of some of the work there," said Andrea Cole, a representative for the unions. "While we gave the university the right to subcontract, we did not want to see a whole new class of workers introduced who would be paid poverty wages," she said. "We were able to get an agreement that in the limited subcontracting the university does, it will not employ a contractor unless the contractor pays a living wage, defined as $7 per hour with no medical benefits."
Ms. Cole added that the $8.92 plus health benefits was obviously a point from which to begin bargaining.
The coalition supporting the original proposal also includes the N.A.A.C.P., Christian Community Action, Centro San Jose, Mothers for Justice, We the People and the Central Labor Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Living wage ordinances -- which vary widely in the amount of hourly pay and the kinds and numbers of workers covered -- have been passed in Baltimore, St. Paul, Milwaukee, New York City, Jersey City, San Jose and Portland, Ore., and have been proposed in several other cities.
In Connecticut, living wage legislation was approved by the General Assembly's labor committee in late March. That bill sets the living wage at 60 percent of the average production wage, or the maximum hourly unemployment benefit. Christopher Donovan, a Democrat of Meriden and a chairman of the labor committee, says that such an hourly wage comes to about $8.80 plus health coverage and pension payments. The bill covers employers with 100 or more workers, as well as any corporations that receive state tax breaks.
Supporters of the New Haven ordinance invited the testimony of a public policy consultant who had researched the impact of Baltimore's ordinance after the first year.
At the hearing, Scott Nova of the Preamble Center in Washington, D.C., said, "We tried to look at the specific concerns raised by the opposition: that the living wage would cause contract costs to rise, thus costing taxpayers more; that there would be job loss; that it would be expensive to administer; that it would result in fewer contractors bidding on contracts, and most of all, that it would create an overall drop in the quality of life, and send a 'bad signal' to business."
"None of that happened in Baltimore," Mr. Nova concluded. In his testimony he also criticized both the numbers and the methodology that the state's Controller, Mr. Brown, used to arrive at his prediction of a tax increase. Mr. Brown, he said, had relied exclusively on the opinion of the contractors in determining costs.
Mr. Brown, however, stood by his numbers and his methodology, saying that since the city is not privy to the contractors' books, he had to rely on what they told him. He pointed out that the living wage ordinance in Baltimore raised hourly wages to $6.10 from $5.50 the first year (and to $6.60 the second year), and with that level of increase, "you can shave costs and not have a tax increase."
Mr. Brown also criticized the proposal for not clearly defining whether only subcontracted workers would be covered or whether some city workers -- most of them seasonal or temporary -- would also be included.
The disagreements and ambiguities sent the parties back to the drawing board. In late March, just before the municipal services committee of the Board of Aldermen met to consider the proposal, the Mayor and the Aldermen sponsors set a compromise: starting July 1, hourly wages of those working on a city service contract will rise to $7.49, rising to $8.92 in five years. No health coverage is included.
Mayor DeStefano called the compromise "a positive sign that the City of New Haven stands ready to support its economy and its working families."
The compromise clarifies who is not covered: those in the professional trades and employees covered by existing collective bargaining agreements, as well as employees who work directly for the city.
Subcontracted maintenance workers, security guards, school bus drivers and temporary clerical workers are examples of those who are covered. The Mayor's office estimates the proposal will cost the city $139,000 in direct costs, a number that could be absorbed without a tax increase.
Alderman Josh Civin, who originally introduced the bill along with his colleagues Philip Voight and David Moakley, said, "We got something we could all live with as a first step." The bill was passed almost unanimously by the municipal services committee on March 24 and will be voted on by the entire board at the end of this month.
Mr. Civin says it stands "a good chance of passage."
"It's important," he said, "that the mayor and the chairman of the Democratic Party have said publicly that this is a good thing." (New Haven vote Democratic overwhelmingly.)
Supporters wanted to add a section to the ordinance requiring contractors to hire a certain percentage of city residents, but were advised that such a requirement might be unconstitutional. Instead, the bill calls for setting up community hiring halls in city neighborhoods, and requires contractors to give first priority to new hires who come through them. "The workers can be from anywhere," Mr. Civin says, "but since the hiring halls are community based, most workers will be from New Haven."
He says the health care provision will be looked at in future years, but that supporters dropped it for now partly because a Federal law may make it illegal to require employers to offer health coverage.
Mr. Civin predicts that 50 to 100 workers will be covered in the first year, but that the number will rise to at least 300 within five years because, "as the wage gets higher, it affects more people."
Ecco released a statement before the vote that it "reluctlantly and with reservations" supported the compromise bill as "an adequate first step."
The statement went on to say that the two points that must still be addressed are "the long-term consequences of minimum-wage and low-wage work on our families and the long-term benefits of attracting developers and businesses with public money, without a corresponding moral obligation on their part to provide guarantees that they will not run away and they will provide family-friendly wages and benefits."

A companion exhibition, "The Visionary Company: Blake's Contemporaries and Followers," features drawings, watercolors and engravings by Henry Fuseli, John Flaxman, James Barry, Samuel Palmer, John Linnell and others who found inspiration in Blake's apocalyptic vision. During his life he was quite isolated from the art and artists of his time, and largely ignored by the public.
In conjunction with the exhibition a program of Blake's poetry set to music will be presented today by Michael Lankester, director of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. The concert begins at 2 P.M. in the lecture hall of the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street. Admission is free.
The Yale Center for British Art is at 1080 Chapel Street, open free of charge from Tuesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from noon to 5. The number to call for more information is 203-432-2800.

JACK KEMP
"America on the Eve of the 21st Century" will be the subject of a lecture by Jack Kemp on Tuesday at 4 P.M. in the Yale Law School auditorium, 127 Wall Street in New Haven. Admission is free and the lecture is open to the public. Mr. Kemp is a director, with William Bennett and Jeane Kirkpatrick, of Empower America, a four-year-old public policy and advocacy organization that describes itself as dedicated to empowering individuals rather than government entities and encouraging economic growth and entrepreneurship.

MOVIES FROM ASIA
Real Art Ways and Central Connecticut State University will hold an Asian-Pacific Film Festival from Thursday through Saturday at RAW, 56 Arbor Street in Hartford.
Films from Korea, China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Thailand will be shown. The Korean film, to be seen on Thursday at 6:45 P.M. and Friday at 4:30 was directed by Yim Soon-Rye, one of Korea's few female directors. "Dark Night of the Soul," from Sri Lanka, is based on the Tolstoy novel and will be shown on Friday at 8:45 and Saturday at 2.
Admission is $6, or $5 for students and people 65 and older. The number to call for a complete schedule is 860-232-1006. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/City Hall Station;
Old Subway Stop to Be a Museum

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
IT will be one museum where you don't have to whisper. Indeed, you may not be able to hear yourself think. The new branch of the New York City Transit Museum will be an entire subway stop, the spectacular 1904 City Hall Station, closed in 1946. The opening won't be for a year or two, but the dedicated can get in on private tours -- or peep in through its roof from City Hall Park.
By the 1890's streetcars and elevated trains were having trouble moving New Yorkers between the business district and newly built housing farther north, and in 1894 New York State passed the Rapid Transit Act, which authorized the city to permit a private firm to build and operate New York's first subway system. In 1899 the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, backed by the financier August Belmont, got the contract. 
 The IRT's first route ran from City Hall up to Grand Central, over to Times Square, and then up Broadway to the Bronx. Most of the construction was cut and cover, more economical than deep tunneling. The modest headroom of such a system meant that most stations were simple, low-roofed affairs. By contrast, the more recent Metro system in Washington has dramatic vaulted stations.
But at the City Hall stop, in front and to the west of City Hall, the engineers made an exception, calling for a domed entry area and a 240-foot-long vaulted train platform. It was at this point in 1900 that Mayor Robert Van Wyck turned the first earth for the project, putting some dirt in his top hat to distribute as souvenirs.
City Hall Park was torn up for several years. In 1901 Thomas Lyons, 35, a rigger, was killed as a derrick boom broke loose in the construction pit in front of City Hall, but otherwise construction on the station proceeded without incident until Oct. 27, 1904.
On that date, at 2:35 P.M., the next Mayor, George McClellan, pushed a silver control handle on the first train and transported dignitaries and officials from the City Hall station until he gave up his post at 137th Street. The system opened to the public at 7 that night, with trains again starting at City Hall, and 7,100 patrons passed through the station before midnight; in comparison, 7,000 used Times Square and 17,800 used the Brooklyn Bridge stop.
For most New Yorkers, the point of reference was the older elevated system, built in the 1870's. By 1904 the Victorian elegance of the el stations seemed cheap and flimsy; in comparison, the new subway system was steel and masonry, with whitewashed tunnels and tiled stations, designed by Heins & Lafarge.
The City Hall station was designed as a broad curve -- very different from the usual corridor space -- so southbound trains could turn around and head north. The vaulted ceilings and green, ivory and brown tiles gave the station a distinctly ceremonial air. Along the platform, 12 chandeliers lit the space, along with nine fanciful leaded glass skylights, which brought light down from panels of vault lights above, a luxury of the early subway that originally extended systemwide. House & Garden magazine called the station an "apotheosis of curves."
Even with its ceremonial character, the station was not spared when the IRT began exercising its privilege to sell advertising in the subway, and early photographs show large placards for patent medicines and other products. Despite civic outrage, courts found that the company was within its rights.
EXPRESS subway service was soon extended south on the IRT, bypassing the City Hall station, but it remained in service as a local stop, even though its decorative street-level kiosks in front of City Hall were barely 400 feet from the Brooklyn Bridge stop. But at the end of 1945 the Transit Authority closed the stop -- it had 255,000 fares that year, whereas Brooklyn Bridge had over 14 million. The two kiosks were destroyed, the entrances were cemented over, and the stop became a legend. In the 1960's the Transit Authority considered making the station into the New York City Transit Museum, but in 1976 chose instead the unused former IND Court Street station in Brooklyn. .
In the last several years New York City Transit has raised about $2 million in Federal, city and private funds to open the City Hall Station as an annex to the Transit Museum. Gabrielle Schubert, the museum's director, expects the final design problems to be worked out this year. These include ventilation, access and especially noise -- the screech of steel wheels on the No. 6 trains that still traverse the tight curve of the rails running through station, about 150 feet in radius, is fearsome.
The Transit Museum has 100,000 visitors a year, and Ms. Schubert expects the City Hall station, even with limited exhibition space, to draw twice that number.
There is no decision yet whether to open it as soon as the minimum work is done, or to wait for a full soup-to-nuts job that could approach $10 million, according to Anthony D'Amico, chief budget officer of the capital program at New York City Transit.
Either way, the ultimate goal is to have a spiffed up City Hall station, which is why those who like some rough edges on their history will especially appreciate it now. Although 11 of the 12 chandeliers survive, the low-wattage bulbs still give a dusty, tomblike sensibility to the platform, and the periodic No. 6 trains that pass by contribute an unearthly screech.
Unlike the rest of the early stations in the system, the City Hall stop was never lengthened, upgraded or anything else. It is in mint condition, but dusty, like a great piece of furniture discovered under a tarp at the back of a barn. Only the curved skylights are damaged -- perhaps half the panes are knocked out.
If things go as planned, the City Hall subway stop won't open until 1998 at the earliest, but the Transit Museum has several tours a year of the space. The next one is June 22; $15 tickets will be available to the general public on May 5 for those who call (718) 243-8601. Ms. Schubert cautions that museum members get first crack, so there are often only a few tickets left.
But anyone can venture into City Hall Park, just southwest of City Hall, to one of the original vault light panels. Many of the round glass insets have been knocked out, and little shafts of daylight reach down to the top of the curved leaded glass skylights, as the shiny trains screech past underneath.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
A Burst of New Office Space Foreseen in Fairfield

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
BROKERS here say that some 2 million square feet of office space could rise within two and a half years on five prime sites that are either near development or under negotiation for development.
This would raise the city's total office space to 19.9 million square feet, including Swiss Bank's 1.2-million-square-foot headquarters, now in its first phase of construction. 
 "The same thing is happening now as happened in the mid-80's except that this is not a speculative office boom," said John H. Rostenberg, president of the New England region of Insignia/ESG, which was formerly the Rostenberg-Doern Company. "It is user-driven, caused principally by the constraints of financing speculative office building."
Edward Tonnessen, executive vice president of Albert B. Ashforth Inc., corporate real estate brokers in Stamford, is optimistic about the market. "Existing inventory has been substantially reduced over the last several years, resulting in a real diminution of large blocks of space," he said. "That's a classic scenario in which development becomes viable."
Both men said that annual rents in new high-end buildings rose 15 percent in the last year, to the high $20's per square foot, and Mr. Tonnessen projected $35 or more for new construction. "We are seeing signs of a landlord market, with concessions diminishing steadily and multiple interest in the same space driving up rents," he said.
Most advanced among the developments is the Hines Interests L.P. proposal for a 480,000-square-foot office tower designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to be built at 425 Atlantic Street at the corner of Tresser Boulevard. It received zoning board approval last month, and a site plan will be submitted for consideration late this spring.
"Our decision to move forward is very much with a view toward the successful completion and occupancy of Swiss Bank," said Thomas M. Craig, senior vice president of the Houston-based Hines company, which was a development and construction consultant for Swiss Bank. "We think they clearly provide tangible evidence of the renewal of the city, and this particular part of Stamford specifically," he said, referring to the area off Exits 7 and 8 of Interstate 95.
Hines will receive a bonus of 100,000 square feet if, in acquiring an acre of the adjacent Postal Service property, it preserves the 1916 Atlantic Street portion, a designated national and state historic landmark; creates a pedestrian walkway to the railroad station; allows public use of its parking during off hours, and assists St. John's Towers, a 360-unit, HUD-subsidized moderate-income housing project abutting the Hines site, in making repairs by purchasing two acres of its land for an as-yet-undetermined figure.
"Construction is not anticipated until the end of this year, with another 18 to 24 months to completion," Mr. Craig said. "We need a sufficient level of preleasing to move forward, and we are looking for a major user in excess of 100,000 square feet."
Plans for the headquarters of CUC International on Long Ridge Road were received by the planning board last month. Up to 489,000 square feet could be built on the 28-acre parcel owned and to be developed by the Fieber Group of Stamford. If the planners approve a change in the master plan designation to commercial from residential, the project will go to the zoning board later this month. CUC is a consumer services provider based in Stamford.
Among the remaining possibilities for development is Parcel 38, a vacant four-acre tract behind the Stamford Town Center Mall acquired from the F.D. Rich Company by Citicorp. Up to 440,000 square feet could be built by the company that has an option to buy it, Toombs Development Company of New Canaan. Scott Toombs, the company's principal, said the developer was "making progress" on signing a major tenant before closing on the property.
A fourth site, on which some 240,000 square feet could be built, is opposite the new University of Connecticut branch being built on Broad Street in the old Bloomingdale's building.
A DISAGREEMENT between the owner, 33 Broad Street Associates, of which Tom Rich -- the son of Robert Rich, president of the F.D. Rich company -- is a principal, and the Urban Renewal Corporation of Stamford, which has oversight, concerns the amount of permissible retail space. Broad Street Associates wants a maximum of 45,000 square feet, while the U.R.C. wants up to 75,000 square feet. The dispute will go to arbitration in June. Meanwhile, the site is being aggressively marketed by the Riches.
Outside Stamford, a major addition to Fairfield County's reviving commercial real estate market has been approved by Norwalk. Two buildings will be constructed at the 46-acre Merritt 7 Office Park on Route 7, bringing the total number there to seven. The office complex is a few hundred yards from Exit 40B of the Merritt Parkway.
Between 1979 and 1989, in a location that other developers shunned, Albert D. Phelps put up five buildings with a total of 1.2 million square feet of space. Occupancy has never dropped below 93 percent.
To compensate for its remote location far from any downtown business center, Mr. Phelps, who is now semi-retired, spent $1.2 million widening a mile of Route 7 to four lanes from two, easing traffic flow into the complex.
Mr. Phelps paid $750,000 to build a small railroad station where Metro-North agreed to make commuter stops. And he showered his tenants with amenities like van service from the station to the offices, banking services, laundry and dry-cleaning services, a restaurant, a barbershop, catering, porters, limousine and car rentals, a flower shop, a travel agency, a newsstand, a clothing store and a jewelry repair service.
"We are still on-site managers, and we still keep our tenants happy," said John P. Crosby, chief executive of Merritt 7. With the current buildings now 99 percent leased, Mr. Crosby said, "we feel the vacancy rate is such that there will be a tremendous demand for Class A office space."
"We will not go ahead," he added, "without a minimum of 50 percent leased." He hopes to be in the ground before fall with a 255,000-square-foot building and one of 170,000 square feet, both to be completed within 18 months.
In spite of high occupancy rates, the park has had difficulties. Rents plummeted in the early 90's and are still below Stamford minimums in the low $20's. Mr. Phelps is now a minority owner with the New York State Teachers Retirement Fund. Building 201 is owned by the Union Carbide Pension Fund, and area brokers say it is for sale at more than $30 million.
Without immediate prospects for development, David Friedman, vice president of the Louis Dreyfus Property Group in Manhattan, would not speculate on what his company might do at the fifth Stamford site, a group of parcels comprising up to four acres on Washington Boulevard, across from Swiss Bank.
"There are a couple of existing buildings and a surface parking lot there now," said Christopher Bergstrom, the city's Director of Economic Development. "It could support 400,000 square feet of offices, housing or both." It would be the first Dreyfus venture in Stamford.
The generally rosy atmosphere has not obscured Mr. Rostenberg's view that "the only negatives are: 'Where is the housing and can you get to work?' "

HEADLINE: The Tax Man Cometh

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: SOMERSET

 BODY:
FOR a man whose business is fantasy, Jim Johnston is having a surprisingly hard time getting his mind around the scenario unfolding before him.
"I don't have that kind of money on me," he tells the mild-mannered man and woman with clipboards deliberately standing off to the side so as not to block customers' views of the 15th Century Transylvanian Mercenary ($25), the Snake Goddess ($40) or the 1/ 9th scale model of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman ($32). "I don't have that kind of money, period." 
 "I'm sorry," Andrew Walachy says, "but if you don't pay by 11 we're going to have to seize your inventory."
It is 10 A.M. at a military toy and model show at the Ukrainian Cultural Center, and Mr. Johnston, proprietor of Fort Duquesne Military Miniatures of Pittsburgh, is the latest casualty in what the New Jersey Division of Taxation unapologetically calls its "war on the cash economy." By the calculation of Mr. Walachy, a tax investigator, Mr. Johnston owes $410 in sales tax based on the business he is likely to do at this show, plus what he failed to collect at several other shows in New Jersey at which he has been spotted.
He has an hour to come up with the money, and the state does not take checks.
"You're not going to shut me down at this show," says Mr. Johnston, his voice rising. "No way."
Mr. Walachy and his partner, Samantha Leach, look at him patiently.
'I'm going to have to go borrow some money from people," says Mr. Johnston, a burly man with a close-trimmed red beard. "I'm going to have to get down on my knees and borrow some money.
"Hey Terry," he calls out to the man in the cowboy hat at the next table, "you got $410 you can lend me?"
Terry's wife answers. "We're scrambling to come up with 290 ourselves."
The Division of Taxation has had a new slogan since Richard D. Gardiner came in as Governor Whitman's tax director in 1994: "Tax Cuts, Tax Compliance." Most people know by now what the first half of the slogan is about. More and more, Mr. Gardiner said, are finding out about the second half, often to their considerable chagrin.
Tax compliance, in brief, is about reeling in the hundreds of millions -- if not billions -- of dollars that residents and businesses neglect, forget or refuse to turn over to the state each year.
The Whitman administration has invested heavily in the effort, hiring 130 new auditors and investigators and increasing the taxation division's budget (now $93.2 million) by 13.4 percent, while the overall state budget has grown by only 3.9 percent.
And the results, so far, have been impressive. Revenue forcibly extracted from taxpayers -- whether through audits, investigations or legal action -- grew from $352 million in 1993 to $400 million in 1994 to $452 million in 1995. (An enormous increase in 1996 -- to $792 million -- was due largely to a 90-day tax amnesty that netted $359 million, much of which the state had been trying to collect for years.) Personal income tax remitted under duress, notwithstanding the Governor's tax cuts, doubled from 1993 to 1995, from $53 million to $105 million, while sales tax revenue grew from $152 million in 1993 to $209 million in 1995.
Compliance revenue, as it's called, still accounts for only about 3 percent of the $14-billion-plus the state collects each year. But the heightened enforcement helps fill the state's coffers in other ways, Mr. Gardiner said: those who have been forced to pay once are more likely to pay voluntarily in the future, and they are telling friends that the tax man (and woman) mean business.
"There's been a dramatic increase in revenues above and beyond what the economy would indicate," he said, "and we think that's because we've gotten a lot better at beating the bushes. We've gotten more people to get religion."

Going After the Rich And the Licensed
 The state's methods of evangelism are many. One has been to go after professions that seem like profitable targets, either because they make a lot of money (athletes, entertainers, dentists), seem likely to shirk their taxes (gamblers) or have state licenses that can be threatened with suspension (accountants, lawyers).
"What we're doing," said Robert K. Thompson, the deputy director in charge of audits, "is really just traipsing through segments of the economy that, based on test audits, seem to be out of compliance."
And one audit often leads to another. In following up recently on a dentist who did not pay his taxes, investigators discovered that neither his cleaning service nor the man who mowed his lawn did either. The division also set up a toll-free hot line last year to report tax cheats. Estranged spouses and girlfriends account for a lot of the calls, officials said, but regular citizens often phone in tips, too.
But what really gets the tax folks excited these days is the war on cash businesses. According to the Internal Revenue Service, 84 percent of the unpaid tax in this country is generated by places like stores, restaurants, and, particularly, it turns out, bars. In 1995, the New Jersey tax division began systematically auditing the state's 10,000 liquor-license holders. Of the 2,000 audited so far, 92 percent were found to owe sales or business tax, a total of $78 million worth. The average bar owner has been hit with a tax bill of nearly $40,000.
While the crackdown on transient vendors at hundreds of trade shows, flea markets and fairs has brought in only a few million dollars since it began last May, it offers perhaps the most impressive display.
Here is taxation at its most visceral, stripped of bureaucratic niceties, open threats instantly yielding stacks of hundred-dollar bills that are stuffed into actual manila envelopes and driven down to Trenton. Though the investigators are always professional and courteous, even sympathetic, their methods are admittedly blunt and arbitrary.
The investigator approaches a table, adds up the value of the merchandise, asks the vendor what he expects to make at the show and settles on a figure somewhere between the two estimates. She multiplies that figure by the number of shows that the state's records show the vendor has been at and returns a few minutes later with a bill for 6 percent of the total. If the vendor cannot pay in full, in cash, the state seizes his goods until the day when he can. If he wishes to appeal the assessment, he may -- after he pays.
Such a process may seem to fly in the face of the Constitution (the 14th Amendment frowns on the state depriving anyone of property without due process of law) and innocent-till-proven-guilty, but it is, the state insists, entirely legal. It's called jeopardy assessment, and despite the position in which it puts the vendor, the jeopardy referred to is the state's: When the state has reason to believe that someone (say, a model-maker who lives 500 miles away and exhibits in New Jersey two or three times a year) might disappear without paying taxes, it can levy and collect them on the spot.
And that, Harry Fox, Deputy Director in charge of compliance, said between confrontations in the kitchen of the cultural center last Saturday, is a very good thing.
"It's important to realize," said Mr. Fox, whose tough talk and linen sports jacket gave him a Miami Vice air, "that these people are like leeches on society."
For years, Mr. Fox said, the state gave out tax registration packets at shows and fairs, only to find them littering the ground at the end. Rather than curse the government, Mr. Fox said, Mr. Johnston -- along with the 30 other vendors (nearly half of the total) who either failed to register 15 days before the show or registered at past shows but never bothered to collect and send in sales tax -- should be glad he's not in jail.
"The ones that aren't registered are already guilty of a crime of the fourth degree," he said. "The second they open for business and they're not registered, they're guilty."
Mr. Johnston eventually borrowed the money and paid his debt. He swore, though, that he owed closer to $40 than $410 and vowed to appeal. But to do so, he will have to submit three years of Federal tax returns, among other records, a prospect that Senior Investigator Don Smith said is enough to discourage most appeals. "When you do these assessments the funny thing about it is you never hear from a lot of these people again," Mr. Smith said. "You've got a lot of invisible men out there who want to stay invisible."
Nor will Mr. Johnston's obligations to the state end when he returns to Pittsburgh. Simply by making a sale on New Jersey turf, he established a beachhead here that allows the state a piece of his mail-order business. From now on, his order forms must contain the line, "N.J. residents add 6 percent sales tax." While this, too, may seem arbitrary, tax officials point out that people are supposed to pay tax on out of state purchases, and that given the near-impossibility of collecting from the consumer (the state loses an estimated $140 million a year in unpaid use tax), they will take their money any way they can get it.
"When they start filing year-round, that's when you start to get the tens of millions a year you're missing," Mr. Fox said. "You just have to convince them that it's more trouble not to file than it is to file."

How the Investigators Follow the Money Trail
 Out among the figurines, not filing was proving to be a lot of trouble for many vendors as Mr. Fox's troops made their rounds, passing over the tables where law-abiding vendors flew their tax certificates like white flags.
A woman in a red sweater with little soldiers on it told friends "I may not be coming back" as she was summoned into the hallway. Across the room, a man with expensive merchandise -- a seven-knight battle scene on a little cherry-wood pedestal for $930 -- was presented with a bill for $2,000, plus a $200 collection fee ("Would you want the innocent taxpayer to foot the bill for our having to do this?" Mr. Fox asked.)
Out in the darkened hallway, where three chairs were set up in a tight circle, another woman was crying.
"You will not do this to me," the woman sobbed. "This is America."
The veteran investigators, George Sipars and Anne Francemore, worked her over with kid gloves.
"Don't be angry," Mr. Sipars said soothingly. "This is a business transaction. How can you be angry? No one is passing any moral judgment on you."
The woman, a recent widow who lost family in the Holocaust, was having a flashback.
"My people went willingly and I will never go willingly," she said. "I would never do this to another human being."
Mr. Sipars gently reassured the woman that the tax people were not Nazis. Ms. Francemore offered support.
"I understand that with the loss of your husband that this just makes your problems worse," Ms. Francemore said, "that this is just another aggravating factor for you.
"Now go back out there and do some business. That'll do you good."
Mr. Johnston surveyed the carnage around him. "They're just doing their job and I understand that," he said, "but it's very painful."
But making sure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes is not just a job, and it is sometimes painful for the tax collector, too. From the director down to the field investigator, the tax chasers profess a profound sense of mission and emotional investment.
"We are the only guardians of the taxpaying public that there are," Mr. Fox said, his voice nearly catching. "We represent you."
Cheryl Fulmer, the chief of investigations and compliance, took the claim a step further. "We keep democracy going," she said. "Think about the anarchy in Russia. it's all due to their inability to get people to pay their taxes to run the government."
To keep democracy afloat, tax investigators will work long hours, inventory a junkyard in the freezing rain, wash dishes to help health inspectors lock up a seized restaurant, and endure endless abuse from those they are trying to help straighten out their tax problems.
"The nastiest ones are the ones who have not told their spouses or their children that they have problems," said Michael Nolan, a supervising investigator in the Camden office, "And if we have to seize a business it can get very stressful because besides having a taxpayer you also have employees who might be losing their jobs."
"It's emotionally very difficult for us," Ms. Fulmer said. "We're human beings, we have families and we do not enjoy having to watch other people put in these very difficult situations."
Occasionally, investigators will encounter one of the 70 people on the state's "dangerous taxpayer list." Mr. Nolan has had a knife pulled on him.
Sometimes, taxpayers appreciate the effort. "I've had people that I've closed thank me six or seven months later," Mr. Nolan said, "saying 'It was the best thing in the world for me, now I'm working 8 to 5 fixing cars and I can sleep at night'."
By and large, though, it's a thankless job, so when people flout the law, tax officials can take it personally.
The crackdown on bars, said Mr. Thompson, the deputy director for audits, "has been terribly productive for us, almost to the point that it's been hurtful to deal with. When you dedicate your life to trying to get everyone in tax compliance, and then you find that a big segment of the economy is abusing the system, it's very troubling."
Not so troubling, of course, thate Mr. Thompson is ever tempted to throw up his hands, unfortunately for Perry Belfiore.
Mr. Belfiore, the former owner of a popular Hoboken bar, Ditto's, is one of the several hundred bar owners whose have closed their doors since the state audits began, the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association estimates. He had the misfortune of unwittingly buying a bar that it turned out had shorted the state more than $50,000, and he owed the state $18,000 himself on top of that.
"I still think of it and my eye twitches occasionally," Mr. Belfiore said.
Mr. Belfiore has since left the bar business, where records from wholesale liquor distributors make it relatively easy for the state to calculate sales, and is now helping some friends open a chain of pizzerias.
This summer, Mr. Thompson said, the division will begin a systematic audit of the state's 3,000 pizza parlors.

"Compliance revenue" -- money that the New Jersey Division of Taxation extracts from taxpayers through audits or enforcement -- has increased dramatically since the Whitman Administration arrived in 1994.

As Camden's Woes Grow, the State Assumes a Bigger Role

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH SEYMOUR 

 BODY:
This is how bad it has become in Camden: police officers had to take rolls of toilet paper to work after the department ran out last month. For two weeks, the police were told there was no money in the budget for paper supplies.
That is because there is no budget. The city's elected officials have yet to approve a spending plan, 10 months after the fiscal year began last July 1. So the city has been managing its fiscal affairs with temporary measures, creating confusion and havoc at agencies. Authorization for purchases is difficult to obtain, making such basic supplies as toilet paper and paper towels scarce. 
 In a city that acquired the reputation as the murder capital of the state, Camden's Police Department says it needs to focus the efforts of its 340 members on battling drugs, not carrying toilet paper to work. Violent crime is so rampant that the state police were called in a few years ago to augment the local police.
"We shouldn't have to worry about toilet paper and fax paper," said Pete Dolly, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 1. "These are the bare essentials of life."
Patrick J. Keating, the city's business administrator, said he expects that the City Council will finally adopt a $100 million budget for the current fiscal year on Wednesday. He said the delay was caused by the city's inability to eliminate an $11 million deficit.
Budget troubles in Camden have not eluded the notice of state officials. Since a January 1996 state audit condemned the financial practices in Camden City Hall, the state has been taking an interest in the operation of Camden. The latest move was an announcement two weeks ago by Governor Whitman that she would introduce legislation to create a new fiscal board, which would have the final say on spending, to oversee the city's finances. She said she wants the board in place when the next fiscal year begins this July 1.
In the past, Camden officials, including Mayor Arnold W. Webster, have resisted state intervention. But the extent of the city's fiscal problems has prompted some to accept help. "It is a necessary step," Mr. Keating said of the oversight board.
Mayor Webster did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment about Camden's fiscal problems. Last year, he declined to attend a meeting requested by the Governor to discuss Camden. Instead, he sent an aide with no official standing in city government.
But Mr. Webster, a Democrat, has said that a fiscal oversight board could be a positive step for the city.
The Mayor's softer stance comes as he faces a campaign for re-election. Four other names will be on the June 13 ballot to challenge the Mayor for what would be his second four-year term. They include Rosemary R. Jackson, a member of the Camden Board of Education; Milton Milan, the City Council president; Frank J. Fulbrook, a longtime concerned citizen in Camden, and Dhamiri Council, the dean of the city campus of Camden County College.
To some state officials, Camden's problems are so big and of such long standing that an election is of little consequence.
"I'm not particularly interested in who the mayor is," said Commissioner Jane M. Kenny of the State Department of Community Affairs, "as long as he's a partner with us."
The city's its economic outlook is grim. In the last 20 years, the tax base has disintegrated. This year, just $21 million was collected in municipal taxes. To balance the $100 million budget, city officials received $50 million in state aid. The state also recently gave Camden another $8.3 million. Fees and grants make up the rest of the revenue package.
Some fiscal practices have generated skepticism. The state audit found dozens of instances of misuse of funds, allegations of unethical business relationships and evidence of a political patronage system that has hindered efficiency in City Hall.
Even correcting those issues would not solve Camden's budget problems, said Mark M. Murphy, the executive director of the Fund for New Jersey, a private foundation.
"People think if Camden cleaned up its bad practices, negotiated better contracts, then it would be a viable city," he said. "That is dead wrong. If they practiced the very best fiscal management in the United States, it would still not be viable."
Instead, Mr. Murphy said, the once-vibrant port has become "a ward of the state." During the last 12 years, the state has given Camden nearly $4 billion in aid. Commissioner Kenny would like to see that figure decline.
Four months after the audit was released, the state hired Robert Law as a fiscal monitor to work with city officials. Since last June, Mr. Law has put into effect some of the audit's recommendations and has overseen the installation of computers in many city agencies.
But state officials think more help is needed. They said they thought the budget process was nearing an end in February, but at the last minute Mayor Webster balked at a plan to lay off 67 workers to balance the budget. That was the last straw, Governor Whitman said later.
"The solution needed to be much broader, to look at some long-term problems and have some controls on expenses," Ms. Kenny said.
The fiscal oversight board would have control over all spending, including purchasing, the awarding of contracts and hiring. There would be as many as six board members, including Commissioner Kenny and Camden's mayor. Two members would be appointed by the Governor and two others would be selected by state lawmakers. The proposed legislation is being reviewed by the Governor's aides and is expected to be introduced early next month, Ms. Kenny said.

HEADLINE: Speaking Out About Adoption, Diversity and Nuclear Fuel;
What's Worth More, A Baby or a Dinette Set?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is quite a lot of misguided talk about the decision by Judge Helen Hoens returning Baby D to his biological and lawful father. 
 Isn't anyone outraged that an infant can be turned over to total strangers without anyone telling the father?
Isn't anyone upset that foster parents can use the courts to keep a baby from his parents for years of a precious new life (no legal adoption took place in the Baby D case)?
Isn't anyone angry that the New Jersey Legislature gives more legal rights to signers of contracts to buy dinette sets than to new mothers?
I remember the roots of the adoption system in America: the Orphan Trains that carried tens of thousands of children to homes in the West.
Child labor laws did not exist. Children were removed from their families among "the dangerous classes of New York," to quote Charles Loring Brace, by his organization, the Children's Aid Society, and others, including the Catholic Sisters of Charity. It was "in the best interests" of these children to remove them from their Italian, Irish and Jewish homes and send them west to work. A frontier kept them apart from their families.
The last Orphan Train left for Texas in 1939. New Jersey sealed adoption records in 1940. A legal frontier would now separate families.
Is the public aware that when a birth mother signs relinquishment letters as early as three days after childbirth, she is given no legal representation and no independent counseling? No one will tell her what most birth mothers experience after relinquishing a child. She is given no hearing. Her parental rights are terminated, even if no one every adopts her child. She is never informed if her child is ever adopted, or even if the child is alive or dead.
As an attorney I know that a contract signed by a minor is voidable -- if it's a contract to buy my dinette set. But a minor may sign away an infant without counseling or representation, without a parent's co-signature. And that decision, involving her own child, may not be voided.
As an attorney I cannot represent a mortgage company without making sure that the borrower has his or her own legal counsel. I cannot put a mere mortgage on someone's home without independent counsel explaining the process and protecting their rights. Isn't anyone outraged that I can take away someone's flesh and blood forever, with a single signature, without insuring that modest amount of protection?
No parental relinquishment should be legal without independent legal representation. Babies are more important than home equity loans and dinette sets.
As an adoptee, I know first-hand what is it like to be turned over to strangers, to lose both parents, medical history, extended family, cultural and genealogical heritage. Under the closed records system, this loss is mandated to be forever. Do any of you know that pain? Neither of my parents had the fortitude to do what Baby D's father is doing, though our 18-year separation through adoption caused a great deal of pain to us and rippled through our families.
As a mother of three, I fear a system that takes children away from their families because other people may believe they would be better parents. If a parent is in difficult social or economic circumstances, please help the family. Don't take children away, like boxes of soap whose owner can pay the freight. Young lives are not commodities.
The Rev. Paul Rack and his wife, Valerie, who want to keep Baby D, chose to ignore the genetic and legal bond between a parent and legal child. From the time Baby D was 10 months old, the Racks, whose application to adopt had not yet been ruled on, have engaged in court battles that have robbed this child of years with his legal family.
There are children who have no parents and who would benefit from adoption. That is not this case.

HEADLINE: For a Widow, a Crash Course in Diversification

SERIES: FRESH START: A periodic look at the crossroads of personal finance.

BYLINE: By LARRY DIGNAN 

 BODY:
FOR nearly 25 years, Gary and Angie Mally split their domestic lives along traditional lines.
But when Mr. Mally, an executive at a bank, died last April at age 52, after a 10-month battle with cancer, Mrs. Mally was lost amid the financial web he left behind. 
 "We had a perfect division of labor," said Mrs. Mally, 46, of Columbus, Ohio. "He handled the checkbook and the bills, and I raised the kids. But when Gary died, I was clueless about the finances."
Handling money matters at a time of grief can be daunting and dangerous, experts say. Advice from relatives may not be in the person's best interest, and there is the possibility of a hasty decision, like cashing in a 401(k) plan prematurely despite the hefty tax penalties.
According to Christopher L. Hayes, director of the National Center for Women and Retirement Research at Southampton College at Long Island University, Mrs. Mally falls into a group of middle-aged widows who are at big risk of making financial mistakes.
"The level of financial illiteracy is extremely high in this group," Mr. Hayes said.
Alexandra Armstrong, a Washington-based planner who wrote "On Your Own: A Widow's Passage to Emotional and Financial Well-Being" (Dearborn Financial Publishing, 1993), agreed that widows of Mrs. Mally's age typically do not have investment experience.
But Ms. Armstrong said they were ready learners. "It's not a matter of knowing the answers, but knowing the questions to ask," she said.
In many respects, Mrs. Mally is lucky because her husband was aggressive in saving for retirement, even though their portfolio was not diversified. Mr. Mally, who was making $55,000 a year when he died, left behind a six-figure 401(k) for retirement -- all invested in his company's stock -- and a company pension. He also left two life insurance policies, one of which converted at his death into a trust that spins off income to Mrs. Mally but names their children, Emily, 21, and Brian, 24, as the ultimate beneficiaries.
Proceeds from the other policy, currently invested in a money market account, also provide income to Mrs. Mally and are being used to pay Emily's remaining expenses at Ohio University, where she is a junior. (Brian graduated last May from the University of Cincinnati and is financially independent.)
In addition, Mrs. Mally has income of about $12,000 a year from her part-time job as an assistant to an oral surgeon, a job she started two months before her husband discovered he was sick.
Although the funds were there, Mrs. Mally knew she needed help.
"When everything's happening, you can get yourself into a lot of trouble," she said. "You have to have somebody helping you that is not on the emotional roller coaster you are."
Mrs. Mally is more than a decade from making withdrawals from Gary's former 401(k) -- which was converted at his death into an individual retirement account -- so she must have enough income now to live comfortably without touching the retirement funds.
She has a big advantage, however, as she starts her planning: The mortgage on the family's two-story, three-bedroom house in Columbus, valued at about $140,000, was paid off two months after Mr. Mally's death.
Mrs. Mally's estate lawyer referred her to Jill Gianola, a planner in Columbus who charges a flat fee and no commission. After a few introductory sessions, Mrs. Mally and Ms. Gianola began putting together a diversification plan last summer.
Mrs. Mally says that she is amazed at all she has learned, and that she is happy with Ms. Gianola as a planner. "Jill's being a woman my age helps," she said.
The two are now focusing on budgeting and converting the I.R.A. into a diversified portfolio of no-load mutual funds -- a process they expect to complete sometime this summer.
The 401(k) left by Mr. Mally was all invested in Huntington Bancshares Inc., the regional bank holding company where he had worked since 1964 and was a vice president at his death. That money needed to be diversified to reduce the risk of one big loss, and the trust and life insurance money had to be invested to produce immediate income.
Deciding to sell Huntington shares, however, has been difficult for Mrs. Mally. The Mallys met while working at Huntington, and Mrs. Mally strongly associates the stock with her husband.
"I will always hold shares of Huntington," said Mrs. Mally, who says she sits in with Ms. Gianola as Huntington shares are swapped for mutual fund shares. "I know why we have to diversify, but I want to do it a little at a time. It was hard the first time we did it."
She and Ms. Gianola have decided to keep 10 percent of the I.R.A. portfolio in Huntington shares. That is still a little heavy, but workable, Ms. Gianola said. Luckily, Huntington is a solid stock; it closed Friday at $26.25, up from its 10-year low in 1990 of just over $4.
Ms. Armstrong, the Washington planner, said that Mrs. Mally's emotional tie to her husband's employer was common among widows, and that the transfer process should be gradual.
"It's best to take it slow, and the attachment is fine as long as it's a good stock," Ms. Armstrong said.
Ms. Gianola is moving Huntington shares into a portfolio of mutual funds that will be split 80 percent in growth funds and 20 percent in fixed-income funds, since Mrs. Mally will not touch the funds until she is 59 1/2 and thus has more than a dozen years to watch her portfolio grow. Ms. Gianola says the growth component is also important for maximizing the portfolio in case Mrs. Mally has to withdraw money early to cover an emergency.
THE stock funds in Mrs. Mally's I.R.A. portfolio will be the Schwab S.& P. 500 fund (20 percent of her total portfolio), Mutual Qualified (10 percent), the Brandywine fund (10 percent), Schwab Small Cap Index (10 percent), Vanguard Total International (15 percent) and T. Rowe Price New Era (5 percent). The bond funds will be Vanguard Total Bond Index (10 percent) and T. Rowe Price International Bond (5 percent). The final 5 percent, after the Huntington shares, will be in a money market fund, as a cushion for emergencies.
Ms. Gianola said the funds were chosen to provide growth with minimal risk. A former economist for the Treasury Department, Ms. Gianola likes index funds because of their low expenses and recent strong returns, though they are not without risk. Mrs. Mally "has a long time horizon, so the I.R.A. is invested for growth," Ms. Gianola said.
The portfolio is expected to produce a minimum return of 8 percent a year and provide Mrs. Mally with at least $36,000 a year in today's dollars until she is 90. So far, the portfolio is returning a bit more than 8 percent. "The returns don't sound like much, given the performance of the market in the last couple years," Ms. Gianola said. "But a return of 8 percent is in the ball park historically."
Getting to retirement is the key for Mrs. Mally, who does not expect to be able to contribute any more funds to her nest egg. For her to cover her expenses before she can begin tapping the I.R.A. without penalty requires a crash course in budgeting.
"The budget is one of the most important things," Ms. Gianola said. When Mrs. Mally's husband was alive, she said, "Angie was basically told how much she could spend and didn't know how much was spent in the household."
Her newfound budgeting knowledge, however, has helped Mrs. Mally clear some hurdles as she plans for her future.
"I went from being taken care of at my parents' house and never being on my own, or going to college, to having Gary take care of me and raising a family," Mrs. Mally said. "This is a whole new life for me."
Ms. Gianola had Mrs. Mally keep a diary of her spending for two months and used tax returns from previous years to construct a preliminary budget. Mrs. Mally's monthly budget is now about $3,000.
In meeting that budget, Mrs. Mally gets about equal portions of her income from the trust, the second life insurance policy and her job as a dental assistant.
TO help Mrs. Mally reap income, Ms. Gianola has invested 60 percent of the trust portfolio in bond mutual funds and 40 percent in stock funds. The bond funds are all from Vanguard: Short-Term Corporate (20 percent of the total portfolio), GNMA (20 percent), Long-Term Corporate (15 percent) and High-Yield Corporate (5 percent). The stock portion is spread among the Vanguard Index 500 (20 percent), Mutual Qualified (10 percent), Vanguard Index Small Cap (5 percent) and Vanguard International Growth (5 percent).
"The trust is currently skewed for income, but we'd like to boost it for stocks once she doesn't need the income and is drawing from the I.R.A.," Ms. Gianola said.
The cash from the second insurance policy is being used largely to pay for Emily's tuition, room and board, which is about $8,000 a year, and it will run out in two to three years. Once that happens, however, Mrs. Mally will be eligible to collect her husband's pension from Huntington.
Income from the trust is automatically deposited into Mrs. Mally's checking account, from which she pays her routine bills and other expenses. She supplements this with savings in the money market account. The budget, a work in progress, is altered almost monthly, depending on Mrs. Mally's spending habits, which are beginning to settle into a pattern.
Ms. Armstrong said a widow's budget generally fluctuates widely for about six months after her husband's death.
Mrs. Mally's spending was somewhat typical. "At first I bought a lot of things, mainly clothes," Mrs. Mally said. "I was buying a lot for myself to be happy and feel better. I've kind of backed off that now. I think it's part of grieving; you want to be happy, even if it's just for an hour."
And any budget can be thrown off by unexpected or extraordinary expenses. Mrs. Mally recently had to replace a gas line in her home, at a cost of $900, and will eventually have to replace her 1988 Oldsmobile. Ms. Gianola has set up a separate money market account for her client with about three to six months' worth of funds to cover such contingencies.
Mrs. Mally said all of her financial planning had given her the confidence to handle life's little -- and big -- surprises.
"The days are getting easier." she said. "I'm learning that I'm a lot stronger than I thought. I think Gary would be proud of me."

6 Islands, 7 Days, 48 Monthly Payments

BYLINE: By LAURA KOSS-FEDER 

 BODY:
IF you are dreaming of a vacation on the high seas but can't afford it, Princess Cruises has a new way to pull you on board: it will help you borrow the money.
The cruise line has teamed up with MBNA America Bank of Wilmington, Del., to offer what Princess calls the Love Boat Loan. After applying by telephone, those who qualify receive lines of credit that they can use to pay not only for cruise tickets but also for expenses incurred on the trip or for other expenses altogether. Borrowers have two to four years to pay off the loans, and interest rates run from 14.99 percent to an eye-popping 26.99 percent. 
 "You can buy bedroom furniture or a big-screen TV with a store line of credit," said Richard James, the senior vice president of sales and corporate relations at Princess. "Now, the same is true with a cruise."
Except that the interest rate for the cruise may be far higher. Shoppers can buy furniture at Ethan Allen Interiors, for example, at an interest rate of 17.52 percent, or a big-screen television at Nobody Beats the Wiz at 21 percent. Consumers may also find better rates if they borrowed their vacation money from a bank. Citibank, for example, will charge 11.25 to 17.65 percent for an unsecured consumer loan.
Even credit cards, which have been criticized for years for charging high rates, may be a better deal. According to RAM Research Group, which specializes in the credit card industry, the average rate on cards is now 17.84 percent.
And while many loans made by retailers don't require consumers to make a payment for a few months, the first payment on the Princess loan is due two months before the ship sails.
Mr. James said Princess created the loan program with MBNA to give consumers a payment option beyond credit cards or cash.
"People may not want to pay with a credit card and use up their whole credit limit in this way, since they need their credit cards for other purchases," Mr. James said.
He said Princess also wanted to help consumers get past the perception that cruises were too expensive -- one reason that only 7 percent of North Americans have ever gone on a cruise, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
The interest rate is based on the customer's payment terms, credit history and credit worthiness, Mr. James said. And the line of credit can be used for any purchase, even one that has nothing to do with a cruise.
Neither Princess nor MBNA would provide additional details on the program, including how much consumers can borrow, who would qualify for loans or how many people had applied since the program was introduced in March. MBNA is the nation's largest issuer of affinity credit cards, or cards issued in bulk for special-interest groups, and analysts said the Princess program was an offshoot of that business.
"This fits right up their alley," said Gary Gordon, a managing director and analyst at Paine Webber in New York. "They like to lend money to people in defined groups."
 The average price at Princess for a seven-day Caribbean or Alaskan cruise is $3,000 a couple (or, for a 10-day cruise, $4,000). About 80 percent of the cruise line's 500,000 annual passengers put their trips on charge cards.
For a couple using the program for a three-year, $3,480 loan for the Alaskan cruise, monthly payments would be $118 at the 14.99 percent interest rate and $138 at 26.99 percent. Those payments would total $4,248 and $4,968, respectively, over the life of the loan.
Consultants who work with the cruise industry question whether such promotions can succeed.
"If you can't get a credit card on your own and then you're going on a cruise for $3,000, will you then be able to handle these payments?" asked Murray Markin, president of Strategic Decisions, a consulting and marketing research company in Boca Raton, Fla., that specializes in travel and transportation. "It will be interesting to see the amount of defaults in this program."
Consumer advocates say that for people who are already in debt, it can be dangerous to take out a vacation loan.
"Since this is a cruise, it would not fall in the lines of a necessity," said Jack Girgenti, vice president at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of East Hartford, Conn. "It is more of a luxury. You have to put a budget together before making such a purchase."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Eighty percent of cruise passenger pay with credit cards anyhow, so Princess Cruises has decided to offer another option: a loan. It works in much the same way as a store's line of credit. But take note: cruise loan interest rates can reach 26.99 percent.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Seeking the Software Stars of the Future

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
RUTHANN QUINDLEN is a rarity on Sand Hill Road: she's a woman. Here, in Menlo Park, Calif., where the male-dominated venture-capital firms of Silicon Valley cluster, she has served as a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners since 1994.
Ms. Quindlen, who has been active in the software industry since the late 1970's, focuses on start-up companies in markets including decision-support software, Intranet and Internet software and entertainment software. Now 42, she has a bachelor's degree in economics from Georgetown and an M.B.A. from Wharton. Before joining I.V.P., she was a managing director at Alex. Brown & Sons, where she helped to take public many leading software companies, including Microsoft and Broderbund. 
 I.V.P. manages $735 million in venture capital and has taken 56 of its companies public since 1980. Those companies, combined, now employ 100,000 people, generate annual revenue of more than $10 billion and have a market capitalization of more than $20 billion.
In an interview, Ms. Quindlen discussed her work and her industry, from the prospects for Internet gaming companies to Larry Ellison's possible bid for Apple Computer.
Q. What is your investing strategy?
A. We look at two types of situations. One we call Faster Better Cheaper and the other Brave New World. With Brave New World, the risk is in the field: it's not a technology risk, it's a market risk. These companies tend to fail late, and take more money because they fail late.
Q. Where do you invest your money?
A. The bulk of our investments fall into Faster Better Cheaper -- 80 percent. But I'd say all the consumer Internet investments, like Mpath, the Internet gaming company, fall in Brave New World. We also have a golf Web investment and one in the semiconductor area, in a futuristic chip-packaging company.
Q. What company is that?
A. I can't talk about it. But in a year we're going to talk about it, and it will blow your socks off. We're also investing in the communications area, where the interesting technologies tend to be XDSL, which will bring Internet data into the home, or the cable modem stuff.
The Brave New World category is like dominoes, from an investment viewpoint. A number of things have to fall in place to be successful.
Q. Do all your partners focus on information technologies?
A. No. Three partners focus on information technology: Jeff Yang in communications, Pete Thomas in semiconductors, and I focus on software. The others are in life sciences, and then we have a late stage/public market group that we just started, in our most recent fund, about nine months, a year ago. We come in and buy when the stocks are down. Sometimes those are better investments than new ones.
Q. How unusual is it for a firm like yours to invest in public companies?
A. Very. The fund has always had the capability to invest 25 percent in public companies and we always did a little. But now we've made a concerted effort simply because there are so many companies now where the evaluations have been hit for some reason and you know it's a great company.
Q. Can you name some?
A. I.V.P. was the sole venture investor in Atmel, made a lot of money and fully distributed the stock several years ago. Recently, I.V.P. came back into the public market and acquired Atmel stock. We believe the company has good fundamentals and good prospects for growth despite some softening in semiconductors.
Q. Are your investors similar to the rest of Sand Hill's?
A. Our investor base has hardly changed in the last 20 years, which is really unusual. They've been very loyal. I think there's only been two or three changes since the early 70's.
Second, on the whole they are endowments, although we do have some nonendowment money. We like endowments because they tend to have very long time horizons. And right now they have a lot of money to invest -- universities like Stanford and Harvard and Princeton.
Q. We are in the midst of great growth in Silicon Valley. Do you think there is any hope the Valley will move away from its historical boom-and-bust cycle?
A. I think the Valley is moving away from a component industry like semiconductors to a finished-goods industry where you have computer systems and software and communications equipment. And those latter industries have not had as much of a cyclical pattern.
The venture-capital economy is somewhat related to these forces, but I think it is more related to stock market performance. If it's really good then we get to invest a lot of money, like last year. Our limited partners are flush and they want to invest that money.
So as long as there's opportunity to absorb that investment, the whole thing continues to go up. When you get to the point where, like in the early 80's, you had 10 disk-drive companies, and one or two were going to be successful, then you have a problem. Right now, we don't have that problem because there are so many burgeoning opportunities.
Q. There is much more market skepticism about Internet stocks now than there was two years ago. Do you think this is an inevitable process?
A. Yes. I think it's a pendulum. Having lived through the microcomputer boom as a Wall Street analyst, I'll tell you what happened. From '81 to '83, it was golden. Just huge opportunity, a mecca. If a company went public, the market just snapped it up. In '84 it was like a light switch turned off. Companies were terrible. Software companies had multiples of eight times forward earnings. I would mention the industry in a room and the investors would run screaming. And that lasted till '86 -- about the time of the Microsoft initial public offering.
After that, the whole thing stabilized and they became real businesses. In other words, they didn't run screaming from the room, but they didn't just buy it because it had the word "micro" in it. And that's pretty much what the Internet stuff has gone through.
Q.Could you make any guess about when the Internet will mature?
A. I think the times are being cut in half. The mainframe computer industry was kind of a 20-year phenomenon, the 60's to the 80's. The personal computer industry was from the early 80's to the late 80's, about 10 years. The Internet happened in three years, and so probably in the next two years we ought to arrive at some kind of stability.
Q. Each generation of computing displaced or engulfed the previous generation. Why should the personal-computer industry be any different?
A. The PC is changing dramatically. Unlike the other technologies, which were more fixed, you have a lot of extensions in the PC world. You see everyone with Pilots [hand-held organizers] now, which is a mobile peripheral. You have network computers, and mobile computers have become a phenomenon. Everybody has a second PC. So it's not standing still. The industry has become evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary.
Q. Strategically, how do you deal with Microsoft?
A. Are they going to continue to have the influence they've had? I think absolutely they are. What is difficult is you're trying either to operate in the margins of what they do or trying to do what they can't. One thing they don't have is a direct sales force. So anything that requires a direct sales force is somewhat protected from them. And they can't move to that model because they don't believe in it. They've made their money selling to manufacturers and they've made their money in retail.
Q. You mentioned Mpath, an Internet game company. Will the Internet entertainment companies succeed?
A. It's weird. We all have high hopes. But it's not a mass medium right now. My husband, David Liddle [the longtime industry executive], calls it PBS for geeks. These companies fall directly into the Brave New World category. It's going to be another three to five years before you really know what you've got.
Q. So you are going to have to stick with it for the long haul?
A. Yes. One guy left standing.
Q. How much money is needed to create an Internet software company?
A. Brave New World companies take $30 million to $50 million -- a lot of money and strategic partners. With the Faster Better Cheaper companies, you're probably talking $11 million to $15 million, sometimes less.
Q. How rare is it for a woman to be on Sand Hill Road?
A. It's unique. Well, we actually have another woman partner here, Mary Jane Elmore, who has been here since 1982. She's been part time for the last couple of years.
You notice the lack of women. But you don't notice it much when you deal with companies. All they care about is: Do you know a lot about what I do and can you help me? They couldn't care less if you're a Martian with purple spots.
Q. So why aren't there more women in the field?
A. I think traditionally women haven't had engineering degrees and technical degrees. And they have not been in senior positions in companies, which is a large draw for the venture-capital community.
Q. What is Larry Ellison, the chairman of the Oracle Corporation, up to with his recent announcement that he was considering a takeover bid for Apple?
A. I think Larry has one goal: to create diversity. He needs a strong independent alternative out there to the Windows-Intel monopoly. And he's trying to do that any way he can. His comments, I think, are a trial balloon to see if he can draw in other investors besides himself.
Q. What kind of marks do you give Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman for the last year?
A. It's kind of early for a turnaround. I think Apple has a great consumer franchise that you can't kill, even though they've tried to kill it. They've ignored it; it hasn't been their focus for the last couple of years. But what they have to do is figure out if they can get on a cost curve that's competitive with the other companies in the industry, the Dells and the Compaqs. If they can't, they're gone. The key with him is how much he's moving them down that cost curve without blowing away the consumer franchise.
Q. He's not a Mr. Outside.
A. Not a Mr. Charisma, but then cost-cutting is an inside job.
Q. What do you think about Eric Schmidt's decision last month to leave Sun Microsystems and take the top job at Novell?
A. I think the world of Eric. I mean I think he's very bright, very good technically -- and, on top of it, a great marketer. He was on a panel of mine last year and he told a story of the "roach motel" Microsoft product: you go in, but you can't get out. He's just a very funny guy. But I don't believe that Novell has any advantages left. So what they have is a bunch of guys writing code. And there is a bunch of smart guys writing code everywhere.
They also are very disconnected from Silicon Valley, which I think he will help by his close ties to the Valley. But it's been a long time since Novell has really had close relationships with companies here that are able to drive them forward.
Q. Are you on one side or the other in the battle between the cable industry and the telephone industry over selling Internet access?
A. We're not, officially, but our investments have tracked the telephone companies more than the cable industry.
Q. Some people say the venture community has a herd mentality. How do you think outside the box?
A. It is easy to get trapped. The kind of people who are in our companies recycle on to other companies, so it's very easy to breathe your own air. How do you think outside the box? You try to see new technologies. You watch people use peripherals -- or whatever it is they use -- to do this stuff. You talk to your grandmother and people like that to try and get a perspective that's not what you have. And you do a lot of reading.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
Inexplicably, New Worker at Botanical Garden Fit in Well

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
When In Soo Song began doing some part-time work at the Queens Botanical Garden in February 1996, Patricia Cook was not sure why he was so good. Mr. Song does not speak much English, and so Ms. Cook, who is one of two head gardeners, could judge him only by his work.
"If I asked him to weed the roses," she said, "he would also lay out a line and edge the area. He made it look good." 
 At first, Mr. Song, 58, did not have the words to tell Ms. Cook that he had received a bachelor's degree in horticulture in his native South Korea, but eventually he did get it across. Last week he was hired, full time, as a garden maintenance worker.
On a recent day, Mr. Song seemed content as he weeded a sun-dappled row of oaks in the 39-acre garden. Never mind that he is an educated man whose duties now include collecting the trash. Never mind that it takes him two hours to commute each way from his apartment in upper Manhattan to the garden, in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
"This job is good for my health and my mind," Mr. Song said. "And hopefully the garden will be happy too."
The garden is happy. Its director, Susan Lacerte, said that Mr. Song got the job "on the merits," when another worker quit, but that Mr. Song's background is also a bonus. Around 90,000 Koreans live near the garden and many visit each year. In recognition of this, a new formal Korean garden will be planted, she said, a task for which "Mr. Song will be invaluable."
Mr. Song said he came to America in 1978, looking for an easier life for his four children. Today, his son is a doctor, one daughter is a nurse, one an accountant and one a college student. But Mr. Song, who had taught horticulture in the city of Inchon, did not fare as well.
First he ran a grocery, but after he was pistol-whipped by a robber in 1982, he said, he closed the store. Then he worked in a warehouse, but the company folded in 1989, leaving him unemployed for seven years.
"I decided to immigrate," he says with a shrug. "I had to expect a little hardship."
Finally Mr. Song enrolled in an employment program for older people at Korean Community Services of Woodside, Queens. By chance Patricia Hong, who runs the program, had an agreement to place people at the botanical garden.
"I said, 'My God, do I have a job for you,' " Ms. Hong said.
Mr. Song says he would like to remain at the garden until he retires. Ms. Lacerte says if his English improves, he might be promoted. Even without a fancy title, he is a figure who is respected. "I still call him Mr. Song," said his boss, Ms. Cook. "Now that he's hired, I'm going to talk to him about using his first name."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Residents Want to Trade Methadone Clinics for More Business

BYLINE: BY JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
For nearly 30 years, the methadone clinics run by Beth Israel Hospital on 125th Street near Park Avenue have served tens of thousands of addicts. But almost since the day the clinics opened, residents have viewed them as a source of trouble and have fought to have them relocated.
Now, as residents and businesses gear up for the expansion of the 125th Street Business Improvement District into East Harlem, there is a renewed effort to move the clinics. "They come in during the morning and hang around the neighborhood all day," said Richard Toussaint, chairman of the public safety committee of Community Board 11. 
 Police officers and merchants nearby also say some of the clients have peddled methadone on the street.
Mr. Toussaint said the neighborhood cannot handle the large number of people who come to the area for methadone and social services. In addition to the clinic, which serves nearly 2,000 people daily, the area is also home to about 1,500 clients from the Charles H. Gay Shelter on Wards Island and from the nearby Emmaus House, a shelter on 124th Street. He said people from those shelters deter businesses from coming into the area.
"We don't want people coming from the Bronx to come here and get their methadone," Mr. Toussaint said.
But a spokesman for Beth Israel, Jim Mandler, said most of the clients visiting the four clinics were residents of Harlem. He said that employees patrolled the streets to discourage clients from loitering and that anyone caught selling the medicine could lose certain privileges or be barred from future services. He said the clinics would not move.
"This population is a population that, if not in treatment, they would be causing much more concern for the community," he said.
Two years ago, residents of the community suggested that the clinic be moved to Wards Island. But the space eventually went to the Department of Homeless Services, Mr. Toussaint said.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Hard Lessons in Creating a School

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
CONFRONTED with some of the most pressing problems of public education, city school officials in recent years have turned to community groups to help resuscitate failing schools, teach music and arts, and rehabilitate the most troubled youngsters.
But the efforts of two community groups to seize the initiative and create new schools in Brooklyn and Manhattan bring into sharp relief how educational ambition can be thwarted by bureaucracy and local politics. 
 The Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner Academy, proposed two years ago and named after three civil rights workers slain in Mississippi in 1964, was envisioned as a way to promote better understanding between black and Jewish youngsters. But finding a place to put the school has been like losing a game of musical chairs: its proponents have unsuccessfully sought a home in two Brooklyn school districts.
Another proposed school, the Shuang Wen Academy, which would be the city's first English-Mandarin dual-language school, is in a similar bind. Its proponents have been looking for a home without success in the city's most underpopulated school district, District 1 on the Lower East Side.
Beth Lief, the president of New Visions for Public Schools, which has helped community organizations establish nearly two dozen schools, said both examples point to the challenges of selling a new school to local officials. Beyond the educational merits, advocates must contend with other, unforeseen factors, like a lame-duck superintendent or a politically divided board.
"We have a ways to go to where the agenda is solely about the best way to improve education," Ms. Lief said.
The Chaney school, for grades 6 through 12, was to have opened in a neighborhood that had become a symbol of enmity between blacks and Jews: Crown Heights. Last spring, the proposal received a green light from Chancellor Rudy Crew.
But that was not enough to bring the school to life. Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the superintendent of School District 17, who supported the idea, left last year and was replaced by an interim chief with little influence. Moreover, the proposed school became enmeshed in a power struggle within the District 17 board, which had been taken over by the Chancellor last year and was split between its elected members and the Chancellor's appointees. A chief architect of the proposed school, Don Murphy, said it became clear that the academy would not find a home in District 17. Board members did not return numerous phone calls last week.
Late last fall, Mr. Murphy's group went shopping for a new home. They were optimistic that District 15, with its progressive school board, would be sympathetic to their plan. Besides, they thought, District 15, which stretches from Sunset Park to Cobble Hill, faced a shortage of junior high schools; the Chaney Academy was ready to start with sixth and seventh graders this fall.
But District 15 board members have said they cannot consider the Chaney proposal for this fall because they must solicit proposals for new junior high schools more widely. "I think you need some kind of process," said a board member, Margaret Kelly. "We're doing this as fast as we can."
In recent months, 200 parents and civic leaders have written to the board in support of the school, Mr. Murphy said, but the board has not yet responded to the group's requests for a meeting. Like District 17, District 15 is searching for a superintendent to replace William Casey, who was ousted in a bitter fight last November.
The backers of the Chaney school have not given up on District 15. But they have also begun talks with the board of District 21 in Coney Island and are prepared to amend their proposal by turning it into a high school and later adding the lower grades.
"If we are at fault here," said Esther Kaplan, the director of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and a driving force behind the school, "it is that we weren't being cynical and savvy enough to know how political it is."
Like the Chaney school, the proposed Shuang Wen Academy was to open this fall. And like Ms. Kaplan's group, its backers had expected a smoother road. After all, said Larry Lee, co-chairman of the school committee, they were looking for classrooms in the city's most sparsely populated district. But to his surprise, the District 1 board voted last month not to approve its request to be housed at Public School 134 on the Lower East Side. "I was quite, quite stunned," Mr. Lee said. "When we first started out the process, I thought the district office had decided this was a terrific space for us."
Officials at P.S. 134, it turned out, did not think it was such a terrific idea. Phyllis Levy, a P.S. 134 teacher, said the school did not want to turn over its classrooms to an outside group, which would then expand into more and more classrooms. "We wanted to keep our school and enhance our school," Ms. Levy said. "A lot of programs do grow."
But June Makela, a District 1 board member who voted for housing the academy, argued that anti-Chinese bias, not space, was the issue. Underused schools, like P.S. 134, had turned unused classrooms into parents rooms or computer labs, Ms. Makela said. Some opponents, she recalled, contended that the school should teach "American culture" instead of Chinese. "Comments made at public meetings, to my mind, were racist," she said.
Ms. Lief said the district had approved two New Visions schools in the past. The Shuang Wen proposal calls for classes to be conducted in English and Mandarin to promote bilingualism.
"I think we have a ways to go in some parts of this city on what kinds of things you need to do with limited English-speaking students," Ms. Lief added. "The failure to welcome this school is an example."
District 1, with one of the most fractious boards in the city, is also selecting a new superintendent. The five-member board majority, closely allied with the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, voted not to renew the contract of Superintendent Dori Collazo-Baker in January. Shuang Wen's backers say they still hope to find space at another school in District 1. But like their Brooklyn counterparts, they are not keeping their eggs in one basket: they have already approached officials in neighboring District 2.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Dow Jones Braces for a Shareholder Showdown on Telerate

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN the senior managers of Dow Jones & Company face shareholders at the annual meeting in New York on Wednesday, they may get one of the most hostile receptions in years.
Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large investors, is urging stockholders to pass a resolution opposed by management that would require independent directors to review the compensation of Peter R. Kann, the company's chief executive. It is also asking shareholders not to re-elect David K. P. Li, a Hong Kong financier and Kann ally, to the board because he attended only about half of its meetings last year. 
 But these are just expressions of displeasure. The real issue is an uproar over management's decision in January to spend up to $650 million to overhaul the ailing Telerate financial data business, which it has renamed Dow Jones Markets.
A vocal group of shareholders, including a few members of the Bancroft family, which owns a controlling interest in the company, and Michael F. Price, who runs Franklin Mutual Fund Advisers, believe that the best way for Dow Jones to lift its depressed stock, which closed Friday at $38.625, would be to dump Telerate. Then, they say, the company could focus on its more successful assets, like its financial news services and The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Kann and his team have rejected this view, arguing that to be a global information provider, Dow Jones must be in the electronic information business. They vow that Telerate will once again earn big profits for Dow Jones, and will do so by 2000. Toward that goal, last week the company announced a technology and marketing alliance with Microsoft.
And, most important, management has the support of most of the Bancroft family, so it would appear that the case is closed.
Or is it? Last year, Chase Manhattan dismissed Mr. Price's ideas for raising Chase's stock price, but eventually it was driven to do what he wished, and merged with Chemical Bank Inc.
Often overlooked in the Dow Jones debate is what exactly it would mean to dump Telerate. For one thing, losing the business could wipe out much of the net worth Dow Jones has accumulated since it was founded 115 years ago. That is a shocking prospect for a company that makes its bread and butter by criticizing the balance sheets of other companies.
"Dow Jones has always been a company that has been fairly conservative," said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst in Spencerville, Md. "It wasn't too long ago that Dow Jones wouldn't take on debt for anything."
The company's caution was one reason that it strung out the purchase of Telerate over several years instead of buying it in a single gulp in the 1980's. The total purchase price was $1.6 billion. That's about equal to Dow Jones's net worth, or the value of its assets minus its liabilities, at the end of last year.
About $200 million of Telerate's purchase price has been written down by Dow Jones, so closing it would force Dow Jones to take a write-off that would eliminate virtually all its net worth, or shareholder equity.
That could create trouble with the company's lenders.
Of course, it is unlikely that Dow Jones would shut Telerate. The unit, which provides up-to-the-minute data to traders, had revenues of about $830 million last year and cash flow of about $200 million.
But there are widely diverging estimates about how much Dow Jones could get if it sold the business. Some observers believe that the division, which is losing market share to Bloomberg L.P. and Reuters Holdings P.L.C. and is behind the technological curve, holds little value. But Knight-Ridder sold its ailing financial data service last year for $275 million, or 12 times cash flow. At that valuation, Dow Jones could get more than $1 billion for Telerate, said Lanny Baker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, who estimated that Telerate's cash flow would decline to about $125 million this year. Even at a sales price of $1 billion, it would still have to take a substantial write-off.
Such talk frustrates many Wall Streeters, who say that net worth is an accounting concept that means little in the real world.
"It's a nonissue," said one Dow Jones investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "There will be a write-off when they sell it, but that write-off has no economic consequence."
A recent example is Quaker Oats, which effectively wiped out its net worth after it sold its Snapple beverage unit, taking a charge of $1.4 billion. When the sale and charge were announced, Quaker's stock price went up because investors were pleased that Snapple would no longer be a drain on the company's earnings.
Many investors argue that the same thing would happen to Dow Jones's stock, which fell sharply after the company's decision to invest the $650 million in Telerate. They also say that jettisoning Telerate would improve the company's credit rating, which was lowered by Standard & Poor's out of concern that the investment would strain the company's finances.
An analyst at Standard & Poor's who follows Dow Jones and spoke on condition of anonymity agreed. Net worth "really is not meaningful," he said. "We tend to rely more on cash flow and profitability than equity, especially when everything gets distorted through accounting."
Indeed, many companies that have relatively small amounts of shareholder equity are valued highly by investors. Coca-Cola, for example, has a net worth of $6.2 billion, but its market value is nearly $140 billion. And Philip Morris has a market value of $93.8 billion, but its net worth is just $14.2 billion.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RIVERDALE;
Chasing Those Car Thieves

BYLINE: By ANDREA K. WALKER 

 BODY:
Tales of grisly murders and gruesome rapes are rare in Riverdale. But almost everyone has a story to tell about car theft.
Take Saul Scheinbach, who has lived in the neighborhood for 18 years. He made news in the 70's when he clung to the hood of his Toyota Corolla as would-be thieves sped down the highway trying to buck him off. The Toyota stalled, and one thief fled. The other was caught. Since then three other of his cars were stolen and his insurance company dropped him. 
 None of the other thieves was ever caught. "If, God forbid, I forget where I parked my car, I panic," said Mr. Scheinbach, the chairman of the Riverdale Community Association's anti-car theft committee. "I think, 'What if it has been stolen?' "
For the last six months the association has run a program intended to encourage judges to get tougher by setting bail for car theft suspects instead of releasing them on their own recognizance and sentencing convicted thieves to jail instead of community service or fines.
The monitors have no empirical evidence that their strategies are working, but the deputy chief of the arson economic crimes bureau in the Bronx, Karen Rischert, said more thieves are getting time in jail. Since another program, Focus Auto Crime Effort, was set up by City Councilwoman June M. Eisland last August, the District Attorney's office and the 50th Precinct, which includes Riverdale, have had daily interaction, giving prosecutors more time and resources to research the backgrounds of suspected car thieves. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz and State Senator Guy J. Velella have introduced bills to strengthen current laws regarding car thieves .
Citywide car thefts have been dropping. In the 50th Precinct thefts are down 20 percent from last year. Some say the various community efforts are partially responsible for the drop. "I don't know if we'll ever know the full impact," said the precinct captain, Richard Romaine, "but it certainly represents a part of the 20 percent decrease, there's no doubt in my mind." Car theft has long been a problem for residents of Riverdale, an affluent neighborhood where many expensive late-model vehicles are parked outside the comfortable houses and apartment buildings. Two major highways, the Henry Hudson Parkway and the Major Deegan Expressway, serve as quick, getaway routes, the police said, making car thieves hard to catch. When they are caught, residents say, many receive light punishment. Prosecutors, community leaders and public officials complain that judges don't always take car theft seriously.
"At one time the whole judicial system used to treat it like spitting on a sidewalk," Mr. Scheinbach said. The association's co-president, Laura Spalter, added, "What we found out is that the thieves were caught, but they were out the next day back up in Riverdale with their burglary tools."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
For Stock Values, a Yardstick With a Difference

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH 

 BODY:
MANY investors treat the stock market like a flea market, poking through overpriced merchandise to find a real bargain. But rather than studying furniture styles or the history of glass making in the search for that low-priced deal, investors use statistical tools.
The price-earnings ratio, which compares a stock price with the company's profits per share, may be the most common measure. Other bargain hunters look at a stock's price relative to the company's book value per share. 
 Some, however, turn to a lesser-known instrument: the price-sales ratio. This measure compares the stock price with the company's sales per share, revealing how many invested dollars are needed to buy one dollar of revenue. At Disney, for example, the price-sales ratio is 2.31, derived by dividing the current share price ($72.375) by the sales per share ($31.38). Sales per share are calculated by dividing total sales ($21.18 billion) by the number of shares outstanding (675 million).
The average price-sales ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 1.60. Value seekers typically focus on companies with low-priced stocks -- those with a ratio of less than 1.
Investors who look to the price-sales ratio say it has several advantages. Although sales figures can be manipulated, they are not subject to all the stratagems that companies can use to embellish earnings or distort book value. "Revenue is one of the things that is least fiddled with," said Kenneth L. Fisher, who runs Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif.
The price-sales ratio can also be a window on a company's near-term potential. A low price-earnings ratio -- signifying a cheap stock -- can simply mean the company has little revenue, and therefore little profit. Its shareholders are taking a leap of faith that the company can ring the cash register a lot more in the future than it has in the past. But a low price-sales ratio often applies to a company that already has significant sales; its costs just eat up much of its profits. In that case, all the company may need is an economizing program that widens the gap between what it takes in and what it keeps.
"The price-sales ratio captures your imagination," said Edward Bousa, portfolio manager of the Putnam Equity Income fund. "It gives you an idea of what an underperforming company could be worth if it got its margins up."
In "What Works on Wall Street" (McGraw-Hill, 1996), James P. O'Shaughnessy, a money manager in Greenwich, Conn., found that from 1952 to 1994 companies with low price-sales ratios often sharply outperformed the market. In one calculation, involving the more than 10,000 companies with at least $150 million in market capitalization, Mr. O'Shaughnessy found that the 50 stocks with the lowest price-sales ratios had an average annual return of 15.42 percent over those 43 years, compared with 12.45 percent for the entire group.
To study the price-sales ratio, The New York Times asked Compustat, a unit of Standard & Poor's, to rank all the nonfinancial companies in the S.& P. 500 by the measure.
Of the 432 companies in the survey, which was conducted on Wednesday, Microsoft had the highest price-sales ratio, at 12.5, while the Fleming Companies, one of the nation's largest food wholesalers and distributors, had the lowest ratio, at 0.04. A total of 179 companies might draw the immediate attention of bargain hunters: they all had ratios of less than 1.
But one of the first lessons of the price-sales ratio, Mr. O'Shaughnessy and others said, is that a low ratio by itself does not necessarily signal a good investment.
For example, many companies in the survey have low price-sales ratios because they are in inherently low-margin businesses -- discount retailers, say, like Woolworth and Walgreen, which had ratios of 0.37 and 0.84, respectively. (When profit margins are so narrow that only a few cents land on the bottom line, investors pay less for a dollar of sales.) Generally, improving the margins of companies in such industries is not as easy as in other sectors.
Other enterprises with low price-sales ratios belong to out-of-favor industries like paper and forest products, which are under pressure from lower-cost foreign producers and hurt by the strong dollar, according to Mr. Bousa. This group includes Boise Cascade (0.28), the Mead Corporation (0.59), Union Camp (0.81) and Westvaco (0.89).
Similarly, according to Standard & Poor's stock reports, Fleming Companies had a rock-bottom price-sales ratio in part because supermarkets are starting to be food distributors themselves. That shift has helped push down the price of Fleming shares from about $30 in September 1995 to $16.25 at Friday's close.
In other words, a low price-sales ratio is just the beginning. Investors must also scrutinize the company to see if it has the potential to improve its margins.
In this further inquiry, Mr. O'Shaughnessy looks for companies whose earnings and stock prices have risen in the last year. "This helps you find cheap companies that are on the rebound," he said.
Such an approach has lead Mr. O'Shaughnessy to Kmart and TJX, retailers with price-sales ratios of 0.19 and 0.51, respectively, in the survey.
In the early 1990's, Kmart lost market share to competitors like Wal-Mart and Target. In the last year, however, it has been closing underperforming stores, cutting corporate overhead, improving inventory and distribution systems and selling off interests in other retail chains to raise cash and strengthen its balance sheet.
"The financial issues are almost out of the way, and they may pay off some debt ahead of time," Mr. O'Shaughnessy said.
TJX, the discount-clothing chain that owns T. J. Maxx, is feeling the benefits of its acquisition of Marshalls, another off-price retailer, in late 1995. This has improved buying power and lowered costs; indeed, the stock price rose from $17 to $47 last year in part because of these prospects.
Moreover, TJX is far bigger than its largest competitor, according to a report by Jeffrey Feiner, of Salomon Brothers. That makes TJX "a true emerging category killer," Mr. Feiner wrote. He also believes that the stock, despite its 1996 run-up, is cheap, at least when the company's projected earnings are considered.
MR. BOUSA also seeks companies that have low price-sales ratios and are cutting costs. He likes Whirlpool, Ryder System and Delta Air Lines.
Whirlpool, with a ratio of just 0.40 in the Compustat survey, "looks cheap for a company that is a leader in its business," Mr. Bousa said. Profits have been weak in its European divisions, he said, adding that he believes that the company has been "very busy restructuring there, and we will soon start to see results." The company will also soon begin to see a payoff from its Asian investments, he said.
Ryder, a leader in truck leasing and business shipping, had a price-sales measure of 0.43, but it is economizing, too. Closing less profitable offices and cutting some layers of management will help it save $75 million this year -- 1.6 percent of annual operating expenses -- and the same amount in 1998, Mr. Bousa said. "At the moment, margins are well below what they should be," he said. "I expect them to increase significantly over the next few years."
Cost-cutting at Delta, the third-largest domestic carrier, is also well under way. Delta has been eliminating unprofitable routes in Europe, where new marketing alliances with Swissair, Sabena and Austrian Airlines may also help earnings.
Delta, with a 0.51 ratio in the survey, is also trying to contain costs and increase productivity. "Delta has done a tremendous job of working with a largely nonunion labor force in an industry that tends to be union," Mr. Bousa said. Moreover, Delta Express, which offers low-cost flights between the South and the Northeast, has limited inroads from discount carriers like Southwest and Valujet.
What about high price-sales measures? Like the low ratios, they are just a guide. Drug companies, for instance, often have wide profit margins. Thus, the Pfizer and Schering-Plough ratios of 4.9 and 4.8 do not necessarily mean the stocks are pricey.
But a lofty ratio can be a red flag. Microsoft's ratio of 12.5 is a caution for Richard H. Fontaine, portfolio manager of the Fontaine Capital Appreciation fund.
"Microsoft is a great company," Mr. Fontaine said. "But it is so big, it can only grow as fast as the industry. The premium the market is asking you to pay grossly overestimates the growth of this company."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Are Death Taxes So Inevitable?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE parents of millions of baby boomers have reached the age where they will die soon, and largely because of the bullish stock market in recent years, many of the boomers can figure on much bigger inheritances than they once anticipated.
So it was no coincidence when Speaker Newt Gingrich, trying to shore up his political base among conservatives and at the same time improve his standing in the opinion polls, suggested last week that the Federal estate tax be abolished. 
 His proposal will not be adopted any time soon, lawmakers and lobbyists agree. The $100 billion the estate tax will raise in the next five years is essential to the goal in Congress and the White House of balancing the budget by 2002.
For the time being, nothing is as certain as taxes on death. But down the road, Mr. Gingrich's view may well prevail. Canada, Australia and Israel have repealed their estate taxes. So has California. Sooner or later, the Federal estate tax could go the way of the Soviet Union and the eight-track tape. This is true for several reasons:
*More people are becoming subject to the estate tax yearly.
*The revenue raised is but a tiny portion of the total that the Government collects.
*Powerful lobbies oppose the tax, and almost no one campaigns in favor of it.
*Many economists argue persuasively that the tax is counterproductive.
 
Birds of a Feather
 The idea of abolishing the estate tax -- which rises to 55 percent on estates worth more than $3 million -- becomes more appealing politically as more taxpayers become subject to it. To be taxable, an estate must have assets greater than $600,000. Because of demographic changes, inflation and the increase in the value of stocks and bonds, the number of estates this large is expected to double, rising to 73,000 in 2007 from 37,000 this year, according to the Congressional tax staff. Over the next two decades, baby boomers will inherit as much as $10 trillion.
The proportion of taxable estates will still be small -- only 2.8 percent of all estates in 2007 compared with 1.6 percent this year. But increasingly, the tax affects families who never considered themselves wealthy.
The amount of future revenue will still be relatively small. Just before World War II, estate and closely related taxes like the gift tax accounted for about 7 percent of all Federal revenue. But as income taxes and payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare have risen, the estate tax has become less important as a source of revenue. Last year, it was 1.2 percent of all Federal receipts. That figure is expected to remain fairly steady for the foreseeable future.
Meanwhile, various business and farm lobbies have mounted a vigorous campaign to repeal the tax, arguing that children should not have to sell the family farm or business in order to pay the taxes.
In fact, fewer than 1 farmer in 25 leaves a taxable estate, the median tax on farm assets is about $5,000 and only three-tenths of 1 percent of the total amount of estate taxes collected comes from farm assets. Taken together, family farms and businesses account for only 7 percent of the value of all taxable inheritances in 1995, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And many of the heirs, even in these cases, would rather sell than continue to run the family business.
A stronger argument against the tax comes from economists who say it has not fulfilled its primary purpose: to prevent the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals. The tax encourages consumption and discourages saving, exactly the opposite of what should be done to strengthen the economy. And wealthy taxpayers arrange their finances in unproductive ways to avoid the tax.
The proponents of this view have mainly been conservatives. But among the prominent economists who have also made the argument more or less in their academic writings are Lawrence H. Summers, now the Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Alan S. Blinder and Joseph E. Stiglitz, two of President Clinton's principal economic advisers in his first term.
Like almost every other argument in economics, this one is not universal. Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says that if the tax has not prevented the accumulation of wealth, it should be strengthened, not abolished.
And Michael J. Graetz, a tax policy official in the Bush Administration who now teaches at Yale Law School, says he worries that eliminating the estate tax would seriously reduce the incentive for giving to charity.
The real issue, Mr. Graetz says, is not economic but political. "If you want to cut taxes," he said, "aren't there other places you would look at first, before cutting a tax that applies only to the very richest people in the country?"

Business and farm lobbies have been pressuring Congress to repeal the estate tax, but family farms and businesses made up only 7 percent of the $118 billion in estates reported to the I.R.S. in 1995. Stocks, bonds and cash accounted for 55 percent.
 
Publicly traded stocks and stock mutual funds 22%
Bonds and bond mutual funds 21%
Other assets, including insurance and annuities 18%
Real Estate 13%
Cash 12%
Personal residence 7%
Family farms and businesses 7%

HEADLINE: The World;
Marcos Died, but It Didn't Last

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
THE electric bill has finally been paid, the air conditioning is back on again, and the embalmed corpse of Ferdinand E. Marcos is not melting. Still unburied eight years after he died -- 11 years after he fled the Philippines -- the body of the former dictator continues to cause trouble.
The electric company's bill-collecting tactics last month -- shutting off the power when Mr. Marcos's wealthy widow, Imelda, claimed she could not afford to pay -- have stirred old passions. Mrs. Marcos is still insisting on a hero's burial, and the question of what to do with the body has arisen again to divide the nation. 
 It may seem a simple thing, deciding the fate of the refrigerated remains in a crypt in Mr. Marcos's home town, Batac. But there is a bigger problem.
The ghost of Ferdinand Marcos himself, it seems, has not yet been laid to rest in the Philippines.
Mr. Marcos dominated the country for 20 years, then fled to Hawaii to die in disgrace.
 
Memory Lane
 But his millions -- most people say billions -- of dollars in stolen wealth have mostly not been recovered, or even fully accounted for. None of his top lieutenants has been jailed. Most of the court cases against his family remain pending and the allegations of corruption against him have never been proved in court for the historical record. Many of those who hold power today -- notably President Fidel V. Ramos -- were Marcos men in their day.
Indeed, in a certain way this is still the Marcos Philippines. From the beginning of the campaign that eventually brought down Mr. Marcos in 1986, Corazon C. Aquino herself defined her philosophy in terms of the man she was seeking to overthrow. As his successor in the presidency, she vowed, she would be "the complete opposite of Marcos."
Now the major themes of government, politics and nation-building can be defined similarly by contrast with his rule: democratic government and freely contested elections, independent and functioning government institutions, an open and accountable economy, an end to monopolies, decidedly un-imperial presidents.
But this is not yet a self-confident democracy. Dictatorship has left a legacy of skittishness, and Filipinos are hypersensitive to any government actions that might bring back the past. An initiative to amend the constitution to allow Mr. Ramos a second term is being met by threats to revive the popular uprisings called "people power." A tough anti-terrorism law proposed last year was rejected by the public as smacking of repression. Moves toward instituting a national system of identity cards have raised fears that freedoms will again be curtailed.
 
No, I'm Not Him
 "Basically, we are dealing with a ghost," a leading journalist said. "Every time there seems to be a move to restrict civil liberties, Marcos haunts the debate. Ramos has to keep saying over and over again that he is not Marcos. The wounds are in many respects still very raw. The psyche is still traumatized."
With power so distrusted, inordinate store is put in what might otherwise seem unremarkable exercises of freedom -- as when the once-docile Supreme Court frustrates presidential initiatives at will, a congressman is arrested for rape, and a tycoon is charged with tax evasion.
One major legacy of the Marcos years, though, remains intractable: widespread corruption that saps the economy and separates the common man from the rich and well connected.
There are those who say it is time to bury the past: Let Mr. Marcos's body be laid to rest in the Hero's Cemetery in Manila as his widow demands. After all, proponents argue, a police dog that was killed in one of the coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino is buried there.
Filipinos love a good, noisy debate. "If we forgive Marcos, we might as well give sainthood to Judas!" proclaimed the newspaper columnist Max V. Soliven.
And Mrs. Marcos knows a good dramatic role when she sees one. "No music, no flowers," she pleaded. "He was a simple man."
One congressman, Vernardo Vergara, is proposing a compromise: Bury him here in Tuba, in the Cordillera Mountains 200 miles south of his home town, beside a bizarre, three-story concrete bust of himself that the late president ordered built on a steep hillside.
It is the young Marcos the sculptor captured, with his hair in a Ronald Reagan pompadour, gazing coolly out across his domain as if he would rule forever.
When he was ousted in 1986, some of his angry countrymen tried to blow up the statue but succeeded only in creating a small hole behind one ear. But time is accomplishing what they failed to do. The concrete shell is beginning to chip away, like a Philippine Ozymandias, revealing the wire mesh beneath it.
"He looks lonely," said Rainier Rivera, one of his diminishing corps of loyalists who had brought his family to gaze at the bust through tiny binoculars.
Abandoned and mostly forgotten, the colossal wreck is disappearing into the surrounding underbrush: pink, purple and white bougainvillea, Christmas palms, guava and avocado trees and the tall grass called talahib. Birds chirp in the sunshine, crickets buzz, and a gecko lizard quacks from somewhere up around the Marcos forehead.

HEADLINE: In Currency Trading, A McIndicator

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE Chinese yuan is the world's most undervalued currency, selling for barely half its real value against the dollar. And the Swiss franc is the most overvalued, selling for 66 percent more than it is worth against the dollar.
At least that's what the Big Mac index says. 
 The somewhat whimsical index, developed by The Economist, the British weekly magazine, measures the average cost of a Big Mac at McDonald's restaurants around the world, and uses that figure to estimate just how much a currency's valuation deviates from real value.
The latest figures show that the average price of a Big Mac in the United States, including taxes, is $2.42. That compares to $4.02 in Switzerland and just $1.16 in China. The index assumes that if a Big Mac costs less than $2.42 under current exchange rates in another country, then the local currency is undervalued.
It sounds a little wacky, but as a forecasting device the Big Mac index hasn't done badly.
Two years ago, the index indicated that the Japanese yen was valued at almost twice its real worth. Now, since the dollar has soared against the yen, the conclusion is that the yen is just about fairly valued.
The Economist proudly notes that during the last year, when eight major currencies rose or fell by at least 10 percent in value, the Big Mac index got the direction right for seven of them. That record is, it reports, "better than some highly paid currency forecasters." FLOYD NORRIS

HEADLINE: Burying Mobutuism

 BODY:
When the White House press secretary, Michael McCurry, declared last week that "Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history," he signaled the end of a long and unattractive chapter of American policy in Africa. Washington backed Mobutu Sese Seko through most of a 32-year reign in Zaire as he stifled the country's political development and looted its resource-rich economy.
American support reflected cold-war calculations. Mr. Mobutu rose to power by defeating forces loyal to the country's leftist independence leader, Patrice Lumumba. He repeatedly lent Zaire's territory to movements fighting neighboring pro-Soviet regimes. Mr. Mobutu was also a favorite of Western mining companies and their allies in the French and Belgian Governments, even though his misrule and corruption drove Zaire's economy to collapse. 
 Since the end of the cold war, Washington has been visibly distancing itself from Mr. Mobutu, but not vigorously enough at first to help dislodge him from power and give a chance to the democratic opposition movement that has been led for more than a decade by Etienne Tshisekedi.
Instead, the main threat to Mr. Mobutu has emerged from an opposition army commanded by Laurent Kabila, a surviving Lumumba loyalist who has won new backing from Zaire's eastern neighbors, Rwanda and Uganda. Beginning his operations six months ago near the Rwandan border, Mr. Kabila now controls nearly half of Zaire's territory.
With Mr. Mobutu refusing to surrender and Mr. Tshisekedi still hoping to play a role in any successor regime, the outcome remains uncertain. A military triumph by the Kabila forces alone would be troubling. Although Mr. Kabila has revived economic activity in areas he controls, he has shown little commitment to political pluralism and his forces have reportedly brutalized helpless refugees. Washington is right to try to broker a cease-fire and a political transition. But its influence is limited at this late point.
The United States has recently begun to develop a constructive post-cold-war approach to Africa. That has allowed it to move out from the shadows of former colonial powers like France and Belgium. Those countries, though now rushing to write off Mr. Mobutu, still view African politics through political loyalties and mining concessions.
In welcome contrast, Washington has recently made clear its preference for civilian-based regimes, exerted useful pressure for multiparty elections and encouraged and supported market-opening reforms. That healthy approach should define America's policy to Zaire's next leaders.

HEADLINE: All or Nothing;
Given Not an Inch, Political Foes Take a Mile

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
ANGRY California voters didn't just tinker last year when they revolted against perceived abuses in affirmative action. They rolled out a guillotine called Proposition 209 and killed the program with one slice of a fast-falling blade.
New York legislators are taking a similarly tough approach to rent control, threatening to let expire a state program that has suppressed apartment rents in New York City for 50 years. In Washington last year, "welfare as we know it" was not so much reformed as it was gutted. 
 On each of those issues, many analysts now argue, advocates for sweeping social programs adopted such uncompromising stands that they gradually alienated any constituency for reform. The result was the death or debilitation of many programs that might have survived had deft surgery been embraced as an option.
The phenomenon has changed the very definition of reform.
In many instances, reformers are no longer the people who want to adjust the programs to strengthen them; they are the ones who want to gut or abolish them. In today's political lexicon, welfare reform often means the end of welfare. Tax reform, at least as Speaker Newt Gingrich proposed it last week, means eliminating capital gains and estate taxes. Period.
Last week, in fact, the strength of abolitionist sentiment seemed to increase.
In New York, anti-rent control legislators beat back an attempt to extend regulations. In California, a Federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 209.
In the offices of the advocates, policy analysts, academics and editorial writers who have made a practice of defending policies to their death, there is now some belated second-guessing about that strategy.
One who argues that advocates for social programs need to learn the art of compromise is Wendell E. Primus, who resigned as deputy assistant secretary for health and human services last year in protest over the effect of the 1996 welfare bill on children. He is now director of income security for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan group in Washington that lobbies for low-income families.
"With regard to immigrants, for instance, I don't think we were willing to acknowledge that there was a problem there," Mr. Primus said, speaking of the welfare law's sanctions against legal immigrants. "I believe the advocates do the programs a disservice by not recognizing that sometimes the problems exist and that you need to get on top of them."
Another Clinton Administration exile, David T. Ellwood, a welfare policy theorist who is academic dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said he sensed a real tension among welfare reformers between a desire to talk about the system's failings and the fear that doing so would "just encourage people to cut, slash and burn."
"The welfare system had lost so much credibility by the time welfare reform was on the Republican agenda that it seemed almost impossible for people to talk about the bad parts of the bill and be believed," Mr. Ellwood said.
"And the tragedy is that we went way past where the American public wanted us to be, in my view. But there was nobody to say, 'Stop in the middle.' "
Rigidity is not a trait of only the left. The right's inflexibility on the budget a year and a half ago shut down the Federal Government.
With an all-or-nothing approach, both sides endanger their agendas.
The diehard defense of social programs, though, has long been a risky tactic because the programs, by definition, have limited, often powerless constituencies. Only the poor benefit directly from welfare, only the disabled from Supplemental Security Income, only minorities and women from affirmative action, only the lucky from rent control. By contrast, everyone has a theoretical interest in Medicare and Social Security, at least everyone who plans to get old, and as a result these programs appear relatively unassailable.
When a program with unchecked abuses loses its credibility, it becomes a broad target for the cost cutters. And when its supporters refuse to address or acknowledge the problems, public frustration only serves to sharpen the knives.
"In a lot of areas of social policy and public policy, we've pushed the envelope of the policy too far," said Peter D. Salins, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of studies criticizing rent control.
Alan Brinkley, a Columbia University historian whose 1995 book, "The End of Reform" (Alfred A. Knopf), documents the anti-liberal backlash that followed the New Deal, said, "The reason liberals defend these programs almost inflexibly is that a lot of these programs have been frail from the beginning and the reform efforts have been proposed by people hostile to them."
 
No Quarter
 Perhaps the best example is the affirmative action debate in California. Long after the public voiced frustration with fraud in government contracting programs and quotas for state jobs and university admissions, advocates and sympathetic politicians remained resolute, rejecting options to limit affirmative action programs to economically disadvantaged minorities and women. The result: 54 percent of voters approved the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209, which bars the state from bringing race or gender into such decisions.
"The advocates for a system completely based on race didn't seem to care that these systems were unsustainable politically and in some instances economically," said Joel T. Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu. "My argument with my Democratic friends was, hey, look, we generally can get support for things if it's an issue of helping working-class people do a little bit better. But if you make it a program based on collective racial guilt, that isn't going to fly."
The advocates for the more than 2 million New York City rent-control tenants have waged a vigorous fight against any change, despite well-documented cases of movie stars, politicians and millionaires paying a pittance for their apartments. Critics, who want the plan to expire June 15, complain that the system unfairly regulates the market and forces landlords to charge artificially high rents for non-controlled apartments.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican upstater supported by campaign contributions from the landlords, has proposed to end rent protections for all but the elderly, poor and disabled. "Rent control in New York City is in a class all its own because it's been going on so long that people see it as an entitlement," he said.
Will advocates for such programs learn from the experiences of the last year? Perhaps, some said.
"I'd like to think this community could learn," Mr. Primus said. "It will be a continuing debate and it will depend on the politics of the moment. But this has been a pretty sobering experience."

HEADLINE: A Go-Between Helps Muslims and Christians Interpret One Another

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, April 10

 BODY:
When Wilfried Hofmann was a young German exchange student in the United States 45 years ago, a car in which he had hitched a ride through Mississippi was hit head on by another car. Both men in the oncoming car were killed, and Mr. Hofmann and his driver suffered severe injuries. One of the doctors who treated him, amazed that he had survived, told him, "God must have something special in mind for you."
Mr. Hofmann wondered about that comment, but it faded from his mind as he attended law school in Germany and then earned a master's degree at Harvard. He almost forgot it entirely after entering the German diplomatic corps, where he specialized in the arcane details of European security policy. But in 1980, after much reading and long reflection, he made a decision that astonished his family, friends and colleagues: He converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam. 
 He was a Muslim during the years he spent as director of information for NATO, a post for which he was given the rare security clearance Cosmic Top Secret Atomal, granting him access to some of the alliance's most closely guarded nuclear secrets. His appointment as Ambassador to Algeria in 1987 provoked a storm of protest from Germans who considered it unthinkable that their country could be represented abroad by a non-Christian. He weathered the storm and served a full term in Algeria and then another term as Ambassador to Morocco.
Since retiring from the diplomatic corps in 1994, Mr. Hofmann has embraced a new role, perhaps the one that the faintly remembered Mississippi doctor had predicted decades earlier. He writes and travels ceaselessly, seeking to explain Muslims and Christians to each other.
The Istanbul apartment that Mr. Hofmann, 65, shares with his Turkish-born wife reflects the unusual blend of cultures he has embraced. His living room is dominated by richly embroidered red-and-gold Moroccan sofas and inlaid silver artifacts from North Africa, but when he offers a guest coffee it is not the Turkish sort but instead Jacobs Kronung, a favorite of German connoisseurs. On one table a magnificent Koran lies open, and on another there is a tin of Mozartkugeln, the rich pistachio-filled chocolates from Austria.
"My mission is to build bridges, to do whatever I can to make sure that we don't come to a violent clash of civilizations," Mr. Hofmann said. "Over and over again, I see that a Muslim from the Muslim world is not equipped to explain Islam to the West. To do that you have to know what makes the Western world tick. The same applies to explaining Western culture in the Muslim world. I believe I am at home in both worlds."
Like many Westerners, Mr. Hofmann is disturbed by what he views as the decay of the moral fabric that once bound societies together. There is nothing specifically Muslim in his lament about "rampant crime, the destruction of the family, the structural addictions to everything from drugs and alcohol to television and the Internet, the readiness of people to pursue their basest passions to such extremes as child pornography, the cooling of social relationships, the breakdown of solidarity among people, even the inability to confront death and the desire to deny it instead of accepting it as inevitable."
"Also, the subjugation of everything to economic laws, the belief that things like family and contemplation are less important than maximizing profit and production," he continued. "People who live in such a way that they earn less or produce less than they could are looked upon as crazy."
For Mr. Hofmann, who changed his first name to Murad after converting, the alternative to what he views as an increasingly amoral life style in the West is Islam. He does not practice a Westernized or watered-down version of the religion, but interprets it rigorously according to the Koran, which he reads in its entirety, in Arabic, three times each year. He has also completed the ritual pilgrimage to Mecca, the haj.
"We never saw him as crazy," said one of Mr. Hofmann's former diplomatic colleagues. "We respected what he did. He has become a missionary. Like many converts, his belief is very strong. There's a touch of fanaticism, but only a touch. On some points, like the compatibility of Islam with democracy, I don't find him completely convincing. But it's always a good thing to have an educated Westerner who can speak authoritatively about Islam."
This year, Mr. Hofmann's travels, which are paid for by Muslim groups, will include a two-week tour of the United States and visits to Casablanca, Morocco; Bahrain; Cairo; Amman, Jordan, and Oxford, England. He says he has seen Western tolerance for Islam plummet in recent years, a phenomenon he attributes to the Persian Gulf war and the Iranian death sentence passed on the writer Salman Rushdie.
"When I published my book 'Diary of a German Muslim' in 1987, the reviews were very respectful even in conservative newspapers," he said. "But in 1992, my book 'Islam: The Alternative' was bitterly attacked in Germany even before it was on sale. The very title was seen as a provocation."
Several of Mr. Hofmann's works have been translated into Arabic, English and other languages.
Citing the Koran, Mr. Hofmann said there was no legal basis for a Muslim death sentence against Mr. Rushdie. He also condemned many repressive practices of regimes that rule in the name of Islam.
"Certainly Islam has been used to bless all sorts of evil, but so has Christianity," he said. "It has been used to justify oppressive regimes including fascism, and to bless all sorts of weapons, even atomic bombs used against cities. No religion can protect itself against being misused."
Most of Mr. Hofmann's writings seek to explain Islam to non-Muslims, but he has also published a slim volume called "Islam 2000" in which he addresses himself to Muslims. Most of it is an analysis of Western prejudices and a critique of the Western view that sooner or later everyone in the world will "wear jeans, eat hamburgers, drink Coca-Cola, smoke Marlboros, watch CNN, live in Bauhaus-shaped buildings as a citizen of a parliamentary democracy and probably be a pro forma member of some Christian church."
But the book also calls upon Muslims and their political leaders to abandon practices that Mr. Hofmann says have no basis in the Koran and have led Islam to be associated in the Western mind with "fanaticism, brutality, intolerance, violence, despotism, violation of human rights and obscurantism."
"There is no use denying that the Muslim world has been shying away for far too long from a constructive, unapologetic discussion of human rights issues," he wrote. In many Muslim countries, he continued, "half of the entire population -- meaning women -- is prevented systematically from developing fully its human potential."
Many Muslims familiar with Mr. Hofmann's work view him as a hero, but others are not so sure.
"I see him as a wonderful example for Muslims, and especially for our youth," Nadim Elyas, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, said in a telephone interview. "Naturally there are some Muslims, especially those with extreme totalitarian views, who don't see him so favorably. Some find his positions insulting. But his style is such that he doesn't make real enemies, because he never tries to tell people what to do. He is just offering his ideas and suggestions."
Although Mr. Hofmann is often away from Turkey, he closely follows the resurgence of Islamic consciousness that is shaking politics and society here. He views it as a natural reaction to 75 years of militantly secular rule.
"Rural Turkey was never un-Islamic," he said. "A people cannot be radically torn away from its historical roots without the pendulum swinging back after a certain period of time."

HEADLINE: CITY SERVICES;
Good Overall Report Cards For Parks and Playgrounds

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
In the fall of 1995, the Sperandeo Brothers Playground at Atlantic and Linwood Avenues in the East New York section of Brooklyn was in terrible condition.
The swings were gone and some benches had been torn out, leaving only concrete supports. Where boards on the play equipment had been ripped apart, splinters and exposed nails created hazards. Even the flagpole was missing. 
 But a reporter's latest visit has found an entirely new playground on the site. A construction fence surrounds it, as final touches are made. Inside, new play equipment gleams, including a tot lot for small children. The new safety surface is expansive and spongy. There are sculptures of turtles for children and new checkers tables for adults. And there is a new flagpole.
The improvements to city playgrounds since 1995 are not all as dramatic as those at Sperandeo, but they are easily observable. Of the 20 sites examined two years ago, 13 were revisited, and all showed significant improvement. Visits to a dozen other playgrounds selected randomly supported the positive picture. Most striking was a uniform increase in cleanliness, but surfaces and equipment were better too.
The examination by The New York Times generally supported the assessment of the Parks Departments itself, whose ratings this year showed cleaner parks overall and equipment in better condition than last year. The improvements, parks officials say, are due largely to two factors: workfare recipients to clean the parks and a more aggressive use of money in the department's capital budget -- at times to pay for things that used to come out of the operations budget.
At Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem, two playgrounds that had no swings during a visit in 1995 have some now, and deteriorated safety surfaces have been replaced. There is the same sort of improvement at Morningside Playground a few blocks away, where missing infant swings and broken benches have been replaced.
At Gen. Douglas MacArthur Park on Staten Island, deteriorating equipment has been replaced, as have the rubber safety surfaces where grass had sprouted from cracks. At South Atlantic Playground in Ozone Park, Queens, the previous visit found a bench on fire, one of the swings ripped apart by pit bulls, jagged edges on some play equipment and widespread graffiti. This year's visit found bulldozers at work and the whole playground being redone.
Playgrounds in affluent neighborhoods were generally in good shape before, and are in good shape now. For example, the only discernible problem at the playground in Seton Park, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, was a broken faux antique light. But even at Arturo Toscanini Playground in the ragged heart of the South Bronx at Teller Avenue and 164th Street, there was new equipment.
"Before, this was all covered with glass and there were big holes," said Carlos Clemente, an unemployed man who lives nearby.
Many playgrounds also have new fences, which may account for some of the improvement, since children's playgrounds are locked after dark whenever possible.
According to the Parks Department's own survey, based on a statistical sample of districts, 94 percent of playgrounds were rated clean this winter, compared with 92 percent last winter. In 1992, just 72 percent were deemed clean. Officials attribute the greater cleanliness largely to the army of 6,000 welfare workers now cleaning parks.
In terms of overall conditions -- which include equipment and structural elements -- 69 percent were rated acceptable, compared with 63 percent in the same period a year earlier. In 1992, 57 percent were considered acceptable.
In the ratings most directly linked to safety, 73 percent of play equipment was rated acceptable, up from 56 percent a year earlier. Eighty-one percent of safety surfaces were rated acceptable, compared with 74 percent before.
One big factor in the improvements is the agency's new approach to spending money from its capital appropriations -- that is, money borrowed through bond sales and earmarked for long-term expenses rather than day-to-day operations.
In the past, delays in the design and construction process for such projects often prevented the agency from spending its full capital allotment in a given year, and the money accumulated from year to year. Now, by pushing those projects through more efficiently, the Parks Department is planning to spend $172 million in capital money this year, a 350 percent increase since 1994, when the figure was $51 million.
Of course that backlog of capital funds will not last forever; in fact, the department expects to be caught up on its capital spending by this year or next.
Some of the increase in capital spending is covering expenses that, in the past, have come largely from the annual operating budget, which underwent sharp cuts in the early 1990's.
For example, parks officials are approving large contracts with suppliers of products like play equipment and safety surfaces. Instead of signing an individual contract for $10,000 to replace a safety surface at one site -- and paying for it from operating expenses -- the department might sign a $100,000 contract with a single supplier, paid for out of the capital budget. Then, the material is delivered piecemeal, whenever and wherever it is needed.
"It's as if you'd set up a letter of credit for $100,000 of safety surfacing," said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. "Before, you had to wait for the playground to deteriorate, and then you'd go in for a $500,000 capital program that would take three years to do."
Not everyone thinks that the new approach is fiscally wise, however. Dean Mead, assistant director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that monitors city spending, calls it "a violation of a cardinal rule of civic finance."
"Maintenance expenditures ought to be paid by the people who use it today, and not spread to future generations," he said.
Parks officials cite several other contributing factors in the improvement of playgrounds. The agency has increased its fleet of roving repair vans from 4 to 24. Some 100 managers have also been given tool kits so they can make on-the-spot repairs in playgrounds while they make their rounds, rather than calling underlings to do the work later.
Mr. Stern also cites his practice of holding regular meetings with his borough managers to review ratings and target problem playgrounds -- a process he compares to law enforcement officials holding their vaunted crime-strategy sessions. "It's just like Comstat in the Police Department," he said.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Appears to Be Increasing Its Scrutiny of the Poorest

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Americans in the New York metropolitan region have the highest incomes in the country, Internal Revenue Service records show, but taxpayers are more likely to have their tax returns audited if they live in Mississippi, where incomes are the lowest in the country.
That fact emerges from the most extensive collection of I.R.S. data ever assembled outside the agency, figures that suggest that rather than being an anomaly, the audit rates in the tax agency's districts for New York and Mississippi illustrate a major shift in policy. 
 "The data indicate that the I.R.S. is increasing its focus on the poorest Americans and the smallest businesses while paying less attention to richer Americans and larger companies," said Susan B. Long, a Syracuse University professor who assembled the information and posted it last night on the Internet.
Calls by members of Congress to overhaul or eliminate the income-tax system are rising with the approach of the April 15 deadline to file returns. On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee opens hearings into the effects on families of scrapping the income-tax system and replacing it with another system, probably a tax on goods and services.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the powerful tax-writing committee, has vowed to "tear the tax system out by its roots."
These are highlights from information compiled by Professor Long:
*Audit rates for people earning less than $25,000 a year rose by nearly half from 1994 to 1995, as audit rates fell by nearly a third for those earning more than $100,000. Since 1988 the audit rate for people earning more than $100,000 has fallen, from 11.4 percent to 2.94 percent in 1994. The audit rate for people who earned less than $25,000 was 1.04 percent, up from 0.74 percent in 1994.
*Unincorporated businesses with less than $25,000 in revenues are two and a half times more likely to be audited than those with revenues of more than $100,000. That type of business reports on a Schedule C attachment to an individual tax return.
*Audits of large companies make up just two-tenths of 1 percent of all audits, yet they produce 58 percent of the increased revenue generated by audits. Despite that, the I.R.S. has in the last five years reduced the audit rate of the largest corporations, to 51 percent from 72.5 percent.
Tom Smith, an assistant commissioner of the I.R.S., said that the figures were accurate but misleading and that there had been no shift in attention from the top of the economic pile to the bottom.
Mr. Smith said audit rates for the lowest-income Americans appeared to have risen largely because notices had been sent to many people who had taxes withheld but did not file returns. Those notices show up in I.R.S. statistical reports as audits, he said.
Emphasizing that he had no hard information, Mr. Smith said he suspected that audits of Schedule C businesses with revenue of less than $25,000 had increased because when the agency did not know how much revenue a business had, it might list the sum as zero or a nominal figure in statistical reports.
And, Mr. Smith said, the audit rate for large companies has declined because Congress cut the I.R.S. budget. He would welcome increased financing to conduct additional audits, he said.
The information was assembled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research arm of Syracuse University that is run by Professor Long and David B. Burnham, a former reporter for The New York Times.
Michael Graetz, a Yale University law professor and a former senior tax-policy official in the Bush Administration, said: "This data is not surprising. It shows why the I.R.S. is in trouble."
Professor Graetz said increased I.R.S. scrutiny of people with lower incomes and with the smallest businesses would explain much of the recent resentment against taxes.
The figures show that the odds that an individual would be audited in 1995, under the traditional I.R.S. definition of an audit, was seven-tenths of 1 percent. The agency publicly reports a rate of 1.67 percent.
The difference stems from a change by the agency in 1988, when it started counting as audits the routine mailing of notices to people with minor discrepancies on their returns. That change allowed the agency to report that it had audited 1.57 percent of all individual returns in 1988 when, under the traditional definition, the rate was 1.03 percent.
The highest rate, by the traditional definition of an audit, is in Nevada: 2 percent. The rate is above 1 percent in 12 districts. Kentucky has the lowest rate: three-tenths of 1 percent.
Mr. Smith, the assistant commissioner for audits, said regional variations existed because of different levels of compliance based on regional cultures and financial practices.
The income information is the best available measure of income. Figures from the Census Bureau and private research firms tend to rely heavily on surveys, not statements signed under the penalty of perjury.
The Manhattan district of the Internal Revenue Service had the highest average adjusted gross income in 1994: $49,737. Mississippi had the lowest: $26,993.
The audit rate in the Manhattan district, which includes Westchester and Rockland Counties as well as Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, was 1.07 percent, compared with 1.15 percent in Mississippi.
In rankings by counties, Douglas County, a suburb of Denver, had the highest adjusted gross income in 1994, an average of $65,595, while the lowest, $14,098, was in Zavala County in Texas. Residents of Connecticut had the highest wage incomes, $38,031, while Montanans had the lowest, $20,080.
The tops and bottoms for dividends and interest were in the same districts. The Fort Lauderdale district, which covers southern Florida, averaged $3,529 in interest income and $1,660 in dividends for an individual. The lowest average was in the Mississippi district: $853 in interest and $321 in dividends.
The I.R.S. did not release to the clearinghouse breakdowns by district and county on how much people reported in capital gains or how much they paid in income, corporate and estate taxes.
The figures also show that the number of people counted by the I.R.S. as sentenced to prison in 1995 primarily on the basis of tax fraud is more than twice the number shown on the records of the Justice Department and the Federal Courts.
The Internal Revenue Service reports 733 prison sentences, but the Justice Department shows 318, and Federal Court records show 337.
Ted Brown, the I.R.S. assistant commissioner for enforcement, said the figures differed only because the tax agency arranged its statistics differently from the Justice Department and the courts. "They have mixed apples and oranges," he said.

HEADLINE: Shaking Up the Piggy Bank in Oregon

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., April 9

 BODY:
Bill Sizemore does not mind a bit when people tell him that he is probably the most hated and reviled man in Oregon.
"They say, 'A lot of people don't like you,' " he said, "and I say 'Yeah, but only 48 percent.' " 
 Last fall, the remaining 52 percent of Oregon voters backed Mr. Sizemore and his group, Oregon Taxpayers United, on a ballot initiative that has cut property taxes across the state by an estimated $1 billion. And ever since, from the Capitol dome in Salem to rural school boards, officials throughout Oregon have been cursing Mr. Sizemore's name, anticipating the sacrifices in services they say will be needed to pay for the cut.
For taxpayers feeling resentful about writing out checks this month to the Internal Revenue Service, spending a day with Mr. Sizemore as he flexes the taxpayer muscles he has helped pump up might offer welcome solace.
By catching a groundswell of anti-tax sentiment with the initiative, Measure 47, Mr. Sizemore harnessed a political force that he is wielding to keep hacking away at other taxes, to the point that national tax reform groups say that Oregon has become a state to watch and that Mr. Sizemore, a former Bible teacher and businessman who has never held elected office, is the reason.
"Bill Sizemore was the catalyst," said Damon Ansell of Americans for Tax Reform, a lobbying and educational group based in Washington that contributed more than $300,000 to the Oregon group last year. "He didn't just talk about it -- he did it."
What he did was lead the charge against property taxes at a moment when Oregon, normally known mainly as a liberal-leaning state, was facing expected increases of 10 to 20 percent in property taxes. Despite dire warnings that education and public services would suffer, Oregonians supported Measure 47, which cut property taxes for the next two years by about $1 billion from what they had been expected to become and limited their future increase to 3 percent a year.
On average, Mr. Sizemore said, the owner of a $200,000 house who would have paid $3,000 in property taxes will pay $2,400 under Measure 47.
The consequences of the initiative for local governments have not yet fully hit; new budgets are only now being drawn up and are expected to be much less severe than California cutbacks after Proposition 13 since the late 1970's. But in the Statehouse here, there has been talk of little else since the session began in January. The Legislature has been struggling with how to accomplish the cut, including ways to replace local education money with state money.
"The Democrat-Republican relations have been made more tenuous" by the measure, said Lynn Lundquist, a Republican and the House Speaker. Mr. Lundquist said Mr. Sizemore, a Republican, "is both hated and loved."
A strapping man with the blue-eyed good looks of the actor Ryan O'Neal and the disarming soft voice of Bill Clinton without the accent, Mr. Sizemore, 45, is "the scariest new face in politics," as a union official told The Eugene Register-Guard.
In person, Mr. Sizemore is anything but scary. As he steamed through the Capitol today in pearl stickpin and tasseled loafers, he had the look of a Hollywood politician from central casting. He fended off queries about rumors that he will parlay his paid job as the director of Oregon Taxpayers United to run for governor with the noncommittal toss-offs of a man who is tempted.
But in the abstract, the force Mr. Sizemore represents is intimidating to Oregonians who support government programs. He says he went after the property tax largely because he saw it as particularly unfair because it has no relation to the ability to pay. He says taxes should take up no more than 25 percent of a person's income. Ever. For anyone.
The percentage of total personal income going to taxes has risen over the century to the point, he said, "that this is a trend we either reverse or we are a Socialist country."
Mr. Sizemore says he has several moves up his sleeve. Next year, for example, he is planning to push for a ballot measure that would link any increases in government spending to inflation and population growth.
But in recent weeks, Mr. Sizemore has been busiest with the rewrite of Measure 47 in the Legislature. Faced with legal challenges, he has agreed to rework it with lawmakers, watering it down to about 90 percent of its former force. It is to be put back out to vote next month. The compromises appear worthwhile to avoid years of court battles, he said.
His close collaboration on the rewrite has provoked bitter criticism from some lawmakers that a man who was never elected has become one of the most powerful figures in the Capitol. But to watch Mr. Sizemore work is to see that his power really stems from just one main thing: the ability of Oregon Taxpayers United to pull together the forces to get an issue on the ballot.
This week, for example, the Oregon Legislature has been considering raising the state's gasoline tax to 34 cents from 24 cents, making state and Federal taxes 52 cents a gallon. In a discussion with the Senate president, Brady Adams, today, Mr. Sizemore said simply that if the Legislature tried to introduce such a tax, "we will collect the signatures and refer it to the voters." Mr. Adams said he did not believe that the tax would end up that high, but he took note of Mr. Sizemore's views.
As he passed through the Capitol's rotunda, some approached Mr. Sizemore with causes for him to support. One encounter was with two public health nurses who work largely with pregnant girls and who fear that Measure 47 will end their jobs.
Their descriptions of their clients' poverty prompted Mr. Sizemore to respond that he, too, had grown up in "abject poverty" but that he did not see welfare and other government programs as an answer. His roving father, he said, would leave the family for months, in part because he knew welfare would let them eat.
One nurse, Michele Clasen-Copley, responded, "All we're saying is a dollar now is better than a couple of million dollars later."
Cordially, Mr. Sizemore invited the nurses to write him a letter and meet with him. "But if you're saying the public should give more money to a government program," he said, "I'd probably be opposed to it."

HEADLINE: SURGE IN ECONOMY IMPROVES OUTLOOK FOR LOWER DEFICIT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Even as the White House and Congress struggle to find a compromise plan to balance the Federal budget, the outlook for the deficit continues to improve, and the shortfall is likely to come in smaller than either the Clinton Administration or the Republican leadership had expected.
Government officials attributed the improving outlook to a surge in economic growth and lower unemployment over the last six months that have helped generate more tax revenue and hold down Government spending. 
 Budget analysts said it was too early to give a firm projection of how sharply the deficit was falling this year, and they said that its path would be largely determined by how robustly the economy performed over the next six months.
"The deficit appears to be lower than we thought for this year, and that could bode well for future deficits," said a Republican Congressional aide. "It's early, but the trend is excellent."
But in one compelling illustration of the trend, a study this month by the Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit could fall to $91.7 billion this year. The deficit last year was $107 billion, the lowest in 15 years, but both the Congressional Budget Office and the Clinton Administration's Office of Management and Budget had been projecting that the deficit would increase this year.
The Congressional analysis cautioned that it was "too soon to draw any conclusions" about whether the surge in tax revenue generated by the strong economy would continue for the rest of the year and push the deficit below $100 billion for the first time since 1981. Officials said, however, that they were increasingly confident that their initial budget projections would prove overly pessimistic, as they did last year.
The Congressional Budget Office has already reduced its official estimate of the deficit from $124 billion to $112.3 billion for the year. The Administration has yet to change its projection of $125.6 billion.
The likelihood that the deficit will be lower than first projected underscores how much of the improvement in the nation's fiscal condition has come not from specific tax and spending decisions in Washington, but from a panoply of economic forces that has kept the economy growing for more than six years.
The economy grew 3.8 percent in the last three months of 1996, and it is projected to have grown about 3 percent in the quarter ended March 31. Although economists expect the economy to slow somewhat, especially now that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, they are still projecting growth for the year to run well above the 2.3 percent forecast in January by the budget office.
People involved in the budget talks said the outlook for the deficit would become clearer in coming weeks as the Treasury Department tallied tax revenue, which last year was substantially higher than anticipated.
Any reduction in the size of the deficit would make it easier for White House and Congressional negotiators to reach a compromise on the budget because a smaller deficit reduces pressure for the deep spending cuts that the Administration is determined to avoid and increases opportunities for the big tax cuts that Republicans are insisting on.
The latest projections could also help promote a compromise in the long-running dispute between the White House and the Congressional leadership over whose economic assumptions to use in calculating future deficits. Republicans are insisting on using the Congressional Budget Office projections. Although the budget office now has a lower deficit estimate than the Administration, mostly because it has updated its forecast more recently, the Administration's economic assumptions have generally been more optimistic.
Administration officials met last week with members of Congressional tax and budget committees, trying to lay the groundwork for a broad agreement on the levels of spending and taxation needed to balance the budget by 2002. Both sides say the odds of a deal are about 50-50.
Administration officials said that they were not yet counting on a lower-than-expected deficit this year but that any improvement in the deficit would make a budget deal easier.
"Every year, our projections have been conservative and the deficit has been lower than projected, and we're hopeful that 1997 will be the same," said one senior Administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
While cautioning that no one is counting on the deficit's falling as low as the $91.7 billion figure in the new Congressional analysis, one Republican aide called the finding "very interesting and potentially very helpful" as the parties try to address the nation's fiscal problems.
The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that accelerating spending on entitlement programs like Medicare was likely to put considerable upward pressure on the deficit again starting next year.
But, he said, "it's in everyone's interest to have declining deficits. It frees up money for tax cuts, and it could bring about a compromise on economic assumptions."

HEADLINE: Dorothy Norman, 92, Dies; Photographer and Advocate

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice. 
 She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire "to advance both art and action" and an interest in people actively involved with either.
In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.
Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.
Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, "Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer".
While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.
During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.
An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.
A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled "A World to Live In" from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published "Twice a Year," a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were "The Selected Writings of John Marin" (1949); "Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend" (1985) and "Encounters: a Memoir" (1987). In 1965 she published "Nehru: The First Sixty Years," a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.
In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.
Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Rent Disputes at a Ritzy Address;
Rumors of Shady Deals Are Emblem of City's Debate

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
To walk by the majestic Apthorp building is to feel a flutter of wonder, mingled with a stab of envy. Grandly arched entryways tunnel into a courtyard the size of a small park, replete with fountains whose gurgling music tickles the ears of such celebrity denizens as Nora Ephron and Cyndi Lauper.
But these days, the atmosphere behind the wrought-iron gates of this limestone landmark on the Upper West Side is less fairy tale than melodrama, farce or even horror story. 
 Rumors and recriminations echo through the marble and gold-leaf foyers, as tenants and landlords summon each other to court, and some residents whisper of shifty, clandestine deals for apartments and warn of toxins in radiators, poisons in paint, danger in invisible nooks, disaster in remote crannies.
By the time a dead woman was found on the building's roof in mid-February, it struck some tenants not as an oddity but as a metaphor, a sign of how surreal life in the Apthorp had become.
"This is like the House of Usher," Joe Winogradoff, a longtime tenant, said recently. "Beautiful on the outside, but on the inside, it's a corpse, and its guts are rotting away."
In Manhattan, such florid language is almost customary in discourse between landlords and tenants, whose relations run a gamut from frosty to fiery, bypassing tepid altogether.
But the Apthorp seems in part to be an emblem and microcosm of something else as well: the high stakes and determination on both sides of the debate over the state's rent regulation laws.
At the root of much of the unrest in the building, which occupies a square block bordered by Broadway, West End Avenue, West 78th Street and West 79th Street, is the tension between longtime tenants holding tight to rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartments and landlords eager to liberate those apartments from such economic constrictions, thereby restoring them to market value and perhaps quadrupling the rents.
For example, while old-timers in the Apthorp pay less than $2,000 a month for apartments as expansive as eight rooms, newcomers may pay closer to $10,000. That sort of discrepancy has led landlords to challenge some tenants' claims to apartments, and tenants to retaliate.
Moreover, as tenants of the Apthorp who benefit from rent control or stabilization consider the prospect of lawmakers in Albany scrapping those protections, they cannot help but shudder, because the deregulation of their apartments would force many of them to abandon not only the Apthorp but also a way of life they could not maintain anywhere else in Manhattan.
"Everyone is living in a building on the verge of a nervous breakdown," Ms. Ephron said, speaking of Manhattan in general and the Apthorp in particular. "This place is a hilarious, unbelievable psychodrama of a New York apartment building."
A resident of the Apthorp for nearly two decades, Ms. Ephron, a film maker and writer married to the writer Nick Pileggi, said that she lives in an eight-room apartment that is not covered by rent regulations. She declined to specify her rent.
Others at the Apthorp said they faced the possibility of steep increases, or outright eviction orders, and some of them are fighting to stay in the building with every weapon they have, seizing any and all ammunition to demonize and embarrass the building's landlords.
To wit: Although the corpse on the roof, identified as that of Gabriele Opferman, a 41-year-old German visitor to this country, had no apparent connection to the sparring between tenants and landlords, it quickly became a prop in the battle between the groups, with some tenants citing it as evidence of insufficient security in the building and railing that landlords were deliberately depriving tenants of information about the police investigation.
That investigation is still in progress. Autopsy tests completed last week showed that Ms. Opferman died from exposure to the cold, that she was not intoxicated and that she had no injuries or wounds.
"It's bizarre," said Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the New York City Medical Examiner. "As best we and the police have been able to determine, nobody knew her. So how did she wind up on the roof of a building that's not a tourist attraction?"
Her body apparently lay there for several days until it was spotted by members of a construction crew on a taller building nearby.
The discovery was jarring because the Apthorp, built in 1908, has long been synonymous with gracious living, its name hovering alongside those of the Ansonia, the Dakota and the Belnord in the pantheon of luxurious residences on the Upper West Side. Countless television and movie scenes have been filmed in and around its manicured courtyard, a sort of lush urban valley surrounded by 12-story mountains of stone.
There are 189 apartments, and it is unclear how many are occupied by people who view the building's managers as sinister and conspiratorial. Some tenants say they have no problem with the management. Lawyers for the building say that the malcontents are a tiny, albeit truculent, band, all of whom are on the verge of legal, justified evictions and are desperate to stave off that reality.
"The number of unhappy tenants is no more than a handful," said Howard Wenig, a lawyer for the partnership that owns the Apthorp, 390 West End Associates.
Mr. Winogradoff disagreed, producing a list of nearly two dozen tenants involved in litigation since 1993. That year may not be insignificant, because in 1993 and 1994, new state and city laws produced rent regulation provisions, commonly known as luxury decontrol, that gave landlords a new way to deregulate apartments that were vacated and changing hands.
Under these provisions, which were altered slightly by the New York City Council last month, landlords can deregulate apartments, allowing rents to rise to market value, if they make improvements to the apartments that are costly enough to justify an increase in rent to $2,000 a month, and if the new tenants have a household income of at least $250,000 for two years in a row.
But however many opponents there are, residents who do not count themselves among the opposition say that it has managed to kick up enough dust to suffuse the building with unease and suspicion.
"There's a general atmosphere of tension," said Jennet Conant, a writer for Vanity Fair magazine who moved with her husband, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Steve Kroft, into the building in October. "You're very aware of it."
Ms. Conant and Mr. Kroft are favorite objects of the Apthorp's vigorous rumor mill, which concerns itself to a great extent with how much newcomers are forking over for apartments that the building's management has succeeded in exempting from rent regulation. To longtime tenants paying relative pittances for rent-regulated apartments, those lofty sums are like incipient threats -- proof of how badly the Apthorp's landlords must want the old-timers to go away.
Residents say Ms. Conant and Mr. Kroft are shelling out about $10,000 a month for a four-bedroom, 3,200-square-foot apartment. Ms. Conant declined to comment on how much the couple was paying.
But the tales that are repeated more often, and are known by seemingly every resident one encounters, concern under-the-table, possibly illegal payments that some newcomers are rumored to be making to longtime tenants, and to landlords, in order to get their apartments.
Several affidavits filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in connection with a pending lawsuit describe a strange scene attending the transfer of an apartment from Shirley Heller, the ex-wife of the writer Joseph Heller, to new tenants.
According to these affidavits, from Ms. Heller and other people who say they observed the transfer, the new tenants brought with them a plastic bag bulging with $135,000 in small bills, $35,000 of which was to go to the building's landlords, who paced outside a room while one of Ms. Heller's friends tallied the cash.
Mr. Wenig said the incident is pure fiction. He scoffed as well at an oft-repeated bit of Apthorp lore that one famous tenant who recently moved in paid $250,000 -- $50,000 of which went into the building's coffers. "I'm sure it's untrue," Mr. Wenig said.
Some tenants further claim that the landlords at the Apthorp have succeeded in getting apartments exempted from rent regulation through a variety of bullying or illegal tactics, like false assertions that newcomers are using their apartments as secondary residences, and that landlords have misstated the amount and nature of work done to the building to obtain rent increases under rent regulation laws.
These charges, which Mr. Wenig says are false, are among the allegations made in a racketeering lawsuit that Tony Lazzarino, a longtime tenant, filed against the building's owners and managers in Federal Court in Manhattan earlier this year.
A previous version of Mr. Lazzarino's suit was dismissed, and Mr. Wenig said the resurrected incarnation also had no foundation.
"We have a wonderful system in this country," Mr. Wenig said, "and that system is that any person can write something down on a piece of paper and call it a lawsuit."
To discuss that lawsuit on a recent night, Mr. Lazzarino and Mr. Winogradoff gathered three other tenants inside Mr. Winogradoff's apartment. All but one of the five residents were fighting or had fought not to be evicted from the Apthorp. All occupied rent-regulated apartments.
In the cases of Mr. Winogradoff, 45, a freelance television commercial producer, and Denise Yuspeh-Hidalgo, 37, a freelance writer and editor, the apartments in question had belonged to parents who had died in recent years.
Mr. Winogradoff and Ms. Yuspeh-Hidalgo claim that they are entitled to keep the apartments because they each lived with their parents for years leading up to their parents' deaths, and thus qualify under rent regulation laws for succession rights and continued rent control.
The Apthorp's lawyers contend that Mr. Winogradoff and Ms. Yuspeh-Hidalgo, in fact, lived elsewhere, moving into the apartments around the time of their parents' deaths, and that their apartments should thus be rented to new tenants.
For both sides, there is considerable money at stake. Mr. Winogradoff pays $1,000 a month for a five-room apartment and Ms. Yuspeh-Hidalgo pays $1,700 for an eight-room apartment. Both apartments would command significantly higher rents if liberated from rent regulation and put on the open market.
But as these tenants pleaded their cases, their complaints ranged far beyond eviction threats as their voices coalesced into a buzz of near-hysteria. One moment, they described the brackish water cascading from their faucets; the next, they were tallying cases of breast cancer in the building. Snippets of conversation that began with complaints about asbestos veered without warning into speculation about phone taps and anonymous threats.
Neither Mr. Lazzarino nor Mr. Winogradoff would be photographed for this article for fear of what might befall them if their faces became known.
Ron Blumer, the one tenant at the meeting who had not faced the prospect of eviction, said he and many others in the building were transfixed and spooked by the travails of those entwined in litigation. "The writing is on the wall," said Mr. Blumer, 55, a writer for public television who pays $1,500 a month for a four-room, rent-stabilized apartment that he moved into in 1983. "Someday, they'll come after me."

HEADLINE: A Safer City Raises Spirits and Questions

SERIES: AFTER THE CUTS -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
After years of budget cutting and contraction, New York finds itself in a condition even more difficult to characterize than usual. Life in the city has measurably improved in some ways -- the drop in crime leading the list.
But in other areas, services have declined, though not as steeply as they did a few years ago. 
 As a result, many New Yorkers appear to have adjusted to the smaller government imposed on them by the first Republican Mayor and Governor in a generation, with one notable exception: education.
Those are among the conclusions drawn from a poll conducted by The New York Times, and an examination of a dozen municipal and state services in New York City, over the last month.
In an update of a similar survey conducted by The Times in the fall of 1995, reporters visited schools, parks, municipal hospitals, libraries and subway stations to take what amounted to small snapshots of the city. Other reporters took more wide-angle views of New York, by developing large, random samples of elementary schools and city streets. Still others analyzed the city's own statistics measuring government performance.
What emerged was a mixed picture of the state of the city:
Crime is down sharply, and many New Yorkers feel safer than they used to. About 235,000 fewer people are on welfare than just two years ago. New York City parks and playgrounds are cleaner, and playground equipment is in much better shape.
New York's streets, though, are much dirtier than municipal officials have reported. Classes in public elementary schools are more crowded than they were a few years ago -- and more crowded than education officials have acknowledged. City ambulances have taken longer to respond to serious medical emergencies during each of the last four years.
In broad ways, New Yorkers share that complex view of their city. The Times poll shows that many people feel safer than they have in years, but that many are worried about the condition of public education. The poll of 1,397 adults living in all five boroughs, also indicates that New Yorkers are upbeat about a number of services, ranging from street sanitation to libraries, though the reporters' surveys showed that some services are declining.
The reason for the disparity is not clear; perhaps the improvement in the economy, and feeling safer, make people look kindly on the status of other services. Or perhaps New Yorkers have accommodated to the scaled-down governments of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
The glaring exception is public education. When parents in the survey were asked if they would send their children to a private or parochial elementary school if money were not a factor, nearly three-quarters said they would. Only one in five said they would choose to send their children to a local public elementary school.
And when all respondents were asked whether they were satisfied with the quality of public schools in New York City, only 21 percent said yes; 67 percent said they were not satisfied.
The Times's own examination of public schools suggests that the public's dissatisfaction is based on fact. Over a period of several weeks in March, reporters surveyed 45 of the city's 660 elementary schools -- about 7 percent -- checking on the size of classes. The survey showed that class sizes were higher than education officials had reported.
Classes in three-quarters of the schools surveyed were larger, on average, than the 25.5 students per class in elementary schools reported by the Board of Education. Nearly one-third of the schools surveyed by The Times said their average class was 30 students or more. The Board of Education's goal is to limit the lower grades, from kindergarten to third grade, to a maximum of 25 students, and fourth and fifth grades to 28 students.
One reason for the crowding is that the school system has been growing by about 20,000 students a year, while absorbing significant budget cuts. Other services and agencies have been cut as well. When The Times conducted its survey of services 16 months ago, reporters found that public libraries, the subway system, the City University of New York and other government agencies had been forced to reduce service because of substantial cuts in the city or state budgets. When the same libraries, hospitals, colleges and subway stations were revisited last month, many appeared to have adjusted to the new and sometimes painful fiscal realities.
Most subway lines run less frequently during selected hours, for example, because of reductions in city, state and Federal subsidies. But the trains are keeping to the new schedules, which often was not the case when the subways were examined 16 months ago.
Reporters also measured some local services in new ways. Two reporters surveyed 800 city streets, selected at random in all five boroughs, and they found that New York's streets are not nearly as clean as the city's evaluations have suggested.
For at least a decade, municipal officials have said that about three-quarters of New York's streets were acceptably clean. In February, the Mayor released the latest city survey, which found that 83 percent of the streets were acceptably clean, the highest rating ever
But the Times survey, which relied on a yardstick similar to the city's, found that only 36 percent of the streets were acceptably clean. It also determined that a third of the streets were dirty or very dirty: twice the proportion found by the city's raters.
Most New Yorkers think streets are cleaner than the Times survey suggests. Only 7 percent of the people questioned in last month's poll said that the city's streets were very dirty, and an additional 17 percent said the streets were somewhat dirty. Half rated the streets as somewhat clean, and a quarter found the streets very clean. The telephone poll, conducted from March 1 through March 6, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
More than four in five respondents said their garbage was picked up on time most of the time. More than 7 in 10 said they had a lot of confidence that the Fire Department would come at once if called.
By a 4-to-1 ratio, people who used the city's parks at least once a month expressed satisfaction with the parks' overall condition. And by an 8-to-1 ratio, people who used the public libraries at least once a month said they were generally satisfactory.
It was the decline in New York's crime rate that produced some of the most definitive responses in the poll. When asked if they thought the city was safer today than it was four years ago, 43 percent of respondents said yes. Sixteen percent said no, and 38 percent said it was the same. When that question was asked in 1993, only 13 percent said they thought the city was safer.
One in three people polled in March said they were confident that they could walk in their neighborhood at night without being bothered. In a 1991 poll by The Times, only one in five people said they had such confidence.
The poll last month also demonstrated that New Yorkers' changing perceptions about crime were more than just a shift in attitude, but reflected actual experiences. Nine times since 1985, the Times/WCBS-TV polls have asked people whether they or any member of their immediate family had been the victim of a crime in New York City in the previous year. Almost every time the question has been asked in polls, 26 percent to 28 percent of respondents said yes. In the latest poll, however, only 17 percent said they or an immediate family member had been a victim of a crime.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said that the poll, along with many of the reporters' findings, underscored the Mayor's contention that he had cut back the size of city government without harming services. "I think what all this proves is that this city can be managed effectively," Mr. Mastro said.
"We have managed incrementally to reduce the size of city government, but also managed to maintain and in some instances improve city services," he said. "The Mayor made clear that we would live within our means and reduce the city's bloated bureaucracy, but at the same time, through better management, improve service delivery."
Perception, as measured in polls, both reflects and contributes to reality. Another way to judge the quality of city services is by trying to measure them.
The following articles, and others to be published later this week, offer assessments of selected city and state services.

After the Cuts
 
TODAY A detailed review of city services in the fourth year of the Giuliani administration finds a mixed picture.

TOMORROW A survey of elementary schools suggests that classes are larger on average than official reports claim.

TUESDAY While the city gives itself high marks for clean streets, a look at 800 streets yields a different view.

HEADLINE: Splitsville For Hartford And the Whalers

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
TWENTY-THREE years after the New England Whalers of the old World Hockey Association relocated, name and all, to Hartford -- a city renown for insurance but not for seafaring -- the team is leaving.
Now known as the Hartford Whalers, it plays its last regular season game tonight at the Hartford Civic Center. By next fall, the Whalers are expected to be in Columbus, Ohio (the first choice of the Whalers' owner, Peter Karamanos), St. Paul, Minn., or the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina. "We're done in Hartford, and there's no way we're coming back," Mr. Karamanos said in an interview from his home in a Detroit suburb. "We gave it the old college try, but the economics just didn't work. And we lost an awful lot of money." Mr. Karamanos -- bitterly assailed for deciding to move the Whalers out of Hartford by Hartford sports writers, some legislators, Hartford Mayor Mike Peters (who threatened to hit Mr. Karamanos in the head if he saw him on a Hartford street) and in vituperative letters to the editor of The Hartford Courant by Whaler fans -- will not be on hand to watch his team play Tampa Bay tonight. "I don't think it would be a good idea for me to be there," he said. 
 Despite their chronic ineptness on the ice -- the Whalers have had only three winning seasons during their 18 years in the National Hockey League -- their departure will leave a void at the Hartford Civic Center. The team has been the main tenant there, playing 41 regular-season games each year and helping to draw customers to restaurants, bars and stores in the Civic Center Mall and in the surrounding downtown area.
Actually, Whaler fans may get a reprieve. By late last week, it appeared that the team would just barely make the playoffs for the first time since 1992. With a playoff berth, the Whalers would play again at the Civic Center next Sunday and April 22, and possibly once more in the first round.
The Whalers' eventual departure -- besides hurting some businesses, costing jobs (at least 75 in the Whaler organization alone) and depriving a hard-core base of 10,000 fans a major source of recreation -- will also take away Connecticut's only major league team. But it is a team never embraced by the entire state, most of whose hockey fans were more attuned to either the New York Rangers or the Boston Bruins.
The Civic Center is left with two primary sports teams as tenants -- the New England Blizzard women's basketball team in the fledging American Basketball League and the Connecticut Pride men's team in the Continental Basketball Association. In addition, the University of Connecticut men's basketball team will continue to play a dozen or so of its home games at the Civic Center. The UConn women's team -- which played two games there to capacity crowds this past season -- is expected to play more games there. In effect, the Whalers' departure will again make Hartford a minor league town, to the consternation of many who maintain that the Whalers, bad as they might have been, gave Hartford the imprimatur of a big league city, last lost when the Hartford Blues baseball team, a member of the National League in the 1886 and 1887 seasons disappeared. Otherwise, the city has been home to minor league teams in baseball (although not since the early 1950's), basketball and football. In addition, in recent years the state's capital city also has had a team in an indoor football league, which departed last summer after two years in Hartford because of poor attendance.
Now indications are that the city will be awarded a franchise in either the International Hockey League or the American Hockey League. If Mr. Karamanos no longer wants anything to do with Hartford, the city is coveted by both leagues, which are one step below the National Hockey League, the sport's major league.
"The Hartford area is a great market for us, and the Civic Center is a wonderful facility," said Robert Ufer, the commissioner of the International Hockey League. "There's a good fan base there which we'd like to take advantage of."
The league is considering an application for a franchise from Brian Foley of Avon, the owner of a health care organization based in that town and of the Connecticut Pride basketball team. Mr. Foley would have to pay about $7 million for the expansion franchise.
But the American Hockey League has already awarded a franchise in Hartford to Howard Baldwin, a former part owner and managing partner of the Whalers. If Mr. Foley also receives a franchise, the decision as to which league would come into Hartford would be left to the Connecticut Development Authority, a quasi-state body that leases the Civic Center from the city of Hartford and has control of the building.
The older of the two leagues, the American Hockey League, was founded in 1936 and had a team in New Haven on and off from then until 1993. Hartford, though, has never had a minor league hockey team. And some people wonder whether the Hartford area's hockey fans, after having had major league hockey for more than two decades, would support a minor league team.
"Two of our newest teams are in former N.H.L. cities and they're doing very well," said Mr. Ufer, referring to I.H.L. teams in Winnepeg, Manitoba, and Quebec City, Quebec, whose N.H.L. teams left in recent years for Phoenix and Denver, respectively. "And we think the same thing could happen in Hartford," he said.
The Quebec Rafales have been averaging nearly 12,000 spectators a game, about the same as the Whalers averaged last season. (This season the Whalers have averaged about 13,600, which is 93 percent of capacity at the Hartford Civic Center.) The Manitoba Moose has been averaging slightly more than 7,000 fans per game.
So far this season, the I.H.L. has been averaging about 7,600 fans a game, about 2,500 more than the average in the American Hockey League. Strangely enough, the attendance leaders in both leagues are teams based in cities where there also N.H.L. clubs: the Detroit Vipers of the I.H.L. (12,000 spectators) and the Philadelphia Phantoms of the A.H.L. (nearly 9,000 spectators). On several occasions, the Phantoms have outdrawn the Philadelphia 76er's of the National Basketball Association when they've both played at home at the same time.
Officials of both leagues say out that one of their main selling points is the relatively low price of tickets -- about $11 compared with around $40 in the N.H.L. "You can sit down by the glass" -- alongside the ice -- "for $20," said Mr. Ufer, who played hockey at Yale.
"Because of our lower prices, we tend to draw more young people and more family groups," said David Andrews, the president of the 18-team A.H.L.
One reason for low prices is far lower salaries. The average salary in the I.H.L., Mr. Ufer said, is about $68,000, while in the A.H.L. it is around $35,000, according to Peter Hanlon, a spokesman for the league.
Though the quality of play in both leagues is, in general, just a notch below that of the N.H.L., there are distinct differences in their makeups. All of the A.H.L. teams are affiliated with the N.H.L. and eight of the minor league's teams are owned by the parent league. Players often shuffle between the N.H.L. and the A.H.L. This season, for example, at last count, 234 players had played in both leagues. The average age in the A.H.L. is about 23 compared with 26 in the I.H.L.
Where practically all the players in the A.H.L. are owned by N.H.L. clubs, most of the players in the I.H.L. are in effect independent, although 5 of the I.H.L.'s 19 teams have partial affiliations with the N.H.L.
"We're a free-agent league, with no reserve system," Mr. Ufer said; "They're committed to being a developmental league with young players while our teams have a mix of young and older players."
Not surprisingly, each league says it plays a better caliber of hockey than the other. "Our quality of play is not far below the level of the N.H.L.," said Mr. Andrews, the A.H.L. president."We have the best young players who are on the way up," he said, "and we think our hockey is more entertaining and more skillful. And over half of our players have already played in the N.H.L."
So, too, have the players in the I.H.L., which has grown from 12 to 19 teams since 1993. The difference, though, is that most of the former N.H.L. players in the I.H.L. most likely will finish their careers in the minor league. "Our players tend to be older and more experienced and we think we have a higher-skilled level of play," Mr. Ufer said from the league's offices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. Should Hartford get an A.H.L. team, the new team would have a natural rival close by in Springfield. In a twist, Springfield has been a Whaler farm team, but that relationship is being disolved at the end of the current season. Other New England cities in the league are Worcester, Mass.; Providence, R.I., and Portland, Me. By contrast, Hartford would be the only city from the Northeast in the I.H.L. whose clubs are mainly based in the West.
As for the Whalers: Mr. Karamanos, the club's owner, said voters in Columbus, Ohio, will cast ballots in a referendum on May 5 to decide whether to approve an increase in a sales tax in order to build a new arena where the Whalers could play.
"If it passes, we could play in a fairgrounds building there until the new arena was ready," said Mr. Karamanos, the owner of CompuWare Inc., in Farmington Hills, Mich., who says he has invested $91 million in the Whalers since he bought the team three years ago.
Mr. Karamanos also said he had received calls from people in Cincinati, San Diego and Kansas City who were interested in buying the Whalers. "But we're not going into any of those cities," he said.
In what amounted to a last-ditch effort to keep the Whalers in Hartford, Gov. John G. Rowland offered to build a new arena at a cost of $147.5 million and to cover $30.5 million of the losses the team would accumulate over a three-year period while the new center was being built.
But Mr. Karamanos rejected the offer when the Governor refused his demand for free rent and the elimination of a 10 percent tax on tickets that would be used to help pay for the arena.
Since the Whalers will be leaving one year before their lease expires, the club will have to pay a $20.5 million "exit fee," which the Connecticut Development Authority's of Directors is expected to approve this week.
Mr. Karamanos, in the eyes of many Whaler fans, has become Connecticut's version of Walter O'Malley, the owner who moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles 40 years ago.
But Mr. Karamanos said "The criticism has only solidified my judgement that we should get out as soon as possible."
"I gave $18 million to the Barbara Ann Karamanos Cancer Institute in Detroit," in memory of his first wife, who died of cancer, he said. "And I'd much rather give the Institute $20 million than waste another $20 million in Hartford."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article and picture caption last Sunday about the departure of the Whalers hockey team from Hartford misspelled the surname of the team owner. He is Peter Karmanos, not Karamanos.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Looking for Something to Say About Nothing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
READERS who have trekked this far into the Sunday newspapers, past the articles on deadlocked Federal budget negotiations and immigration reform and Newt Gingrich's popularity or lack thereof, through reports of potential mendacity at the White House and the discovery of a new subspecies of trapdoor spider in southern Yemen (its trapdoor opens inward, rather than outward) -- those readers deserve to be let in on a secret that correspondents and editors have been keeping for some time now. There is no news anymore.
News stopped happening, oh, a good two or three months ago, right after President Clinton's inaugural address turned out to be an overwritten dry hole. Most of what you read now is cleverly recycled from old news articles. The rest is drawn at random each day from a large, rotating cage filled with stories that are important enough in their own right but would never make the front page or Dan Rather were anything really going on. 
 Often they are quite interesting. But real news -- no, there hasn't been any actual, Good-Lord-Mabel-listen-to-this news in quite a while.
 
Proposals Languish
 Experts on news say this may be a long-term phenomenon, and so readers and reporters alike will just have to make the best of it. Nevertheless, it is tough slogging for the moment.
The last week's issues of The New York Times and The Washington Post, two cover-the-Earth news organizations, testify to just what journalists are up against.
Last Sunday's Times featured the disclosure that Congress does not want to reform campaign spending: "Many Proposals, Few Supporters," the headline calmly stated; "57 Measures Languish." The Post wrote about a new kind of bacteria found near hot-water vents on the ocean floor.
The rest of the week's front pages explained the lives of Japanese ultranationalists; the lack of progress in Mideast peace talks; the ongoing conflict in Zaire and Mr. Gingrich's opposition to a tax on capital gains. There was also "Tumultuous Albania Awaits U.S. Troops" and "Women's Hockey: No Fights, Just Skating."
The newsmagazines fared even worse. The cover of Time revealed that Ellen DeGeneres is gay; Newsweek rehashed last month's California suicides -- a Good-Lord-Mabel story that amply filled a vacuum. U.S. News & World Report told students how to get into the right college.
The Associated Press, a major news factory, did its best, announcing at midweek that the Sun had unleashed a gigantic blast of superheated gas that was rushing toward Earth at millions of miles per hour. This would be enough to make anyone yell to Mabel, but for what followed:
"Just a small eruption, scientists announced Wednesday, worth noting because it produced the first close-up photographs of a solar flare. It's nothing-out-of-the-ordinary size isn't expected to disrupt regular radio, telephone, television or cable communications, they said. Also, virtually no danger exists of blackouts."
"The effect will be almost none," the AP quoted a solar scientist as saying. NASA, the item added, viewed the eruption as 'barely a firecracker."
The scandal du jour -- the revelation that certain candidates for office would backflip naked across the set of "Face the Nation" for $250,000 -- has, somehow, failed to shock. The week's most virulent editorial berated the do-nothing Congress.
There were stunning new photographs of a Jovian moon. They looked amazingly like drugstore enlargements of Jovian moon photos released twice last year.
Can you say "dull?"
"It's a paradise for feature writers," said Ben Bagdikian, an esteemed reporter, editor, press critic and former dean of the journalism school at the University of California at Berkeley. "What used to be the summer doldrums in news, because Congress went home and people went on vacation, has become something we're going have to get used to."
The roots of this ennui are no great secret. The economy is booming; no news there. High-profile domestic problems like crime are, for the moment, in abeyance. People are bombarded with so much news these days -- on 24-hour cable; all-news radio; the Internet -- that they may be a bit jaded by it all.
Mr. Bagdikian blames the cold war. When it ended, he said, reporters lost the template that portrayed every President as Henry Fonda in "Seven Days in May," and every third world shoot-'em-up as a proxy war between nuclear-armed superpowers.
The new foreign bogeyman, China, also threatens to bury us -- not in a grave, but in low-cost textile exports. The latest shoot-'em-ups, in Albania and Zaire, are no less horrific than those in Afghanistan and Angola, just less threatening and more arcane.
 
Sons, Daughters, Gasoline
 "Really, since the Gulf war there hasn't been the sense that something will happen to take away our sons and daughters and, God help us, our gasoline," Mr. Bagdikian said. "Now the problems we see are the problems of capitalism. And criticizing capitalism has never been a popular subject in the general news."
Mr. Bagdikian says this may be a good thing. Now journalists can focus on serious social problems, like the gap between rich and poor nations, that had paled next to the prospect of being atomized by a missile warhead.
Newspaper executives regard it as a marketing opportunity. The American Society of Newspaper Editors, which met here last week, spent some time discussing what to put in newspapers now that television has a lock on crises and the closest thing to a Brezhnev is Alan Greenspan.
The answer, said Sandra Mims Rowe, the editor of The Portland Oregonian and the society's new president, is "ethics, religion, health, life" -- subjects that would never have beaten the Ayatollah Khomeini to page one. And "deep" coverage, which television can't match, on the remaking of the social compact in Congress and the political battle over the future role of Government.
No news? "We may look back on this time and say it was just as formative and significant as the 60's and the civil-rights marches," she said.
Maybe. Meanwhile, be sure to catch the article beside the Jovian moon photo. Deep in the ice-clad seas of Europa, there may be life -- bacteria, scientists say. Clustered around hot-water vents.
Actually, they said that last year, too. The betting is that everyone has forgotten.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a dearth of news in recent months misidentified the actor who played the President in the movie "Seven Days in May." He was Fredric March, not Henry Fonda.

THE SUN AT MIDDAY
 Tales of a Mediterranean Family.
 By Gini Alhadeff.
 226 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $23. 
 This is a deeply personal book that raises a big abstract issue. It homes in on individuals, making you think about communities. "I want no family, no religion, no country, no self I have to answer for," says Gini Alhadeff. A Sephardic Jew by descent, she has lived in Alexandria, Tokyo, London and New York. She spoke French in childhood and moves with equal ease from that tongue to Italian or English. All her family are polyglots, cultural chameleons.
When I was growing up in Egypt -- growing up British and never allowed to forget it -- I was deeply conscious of cultural diversity. I played on the beach in Alexandria with children who were lithe, dark and who chattered in Arabic, French, Greek, whatever came to hand. Among them could well have been Alhadeffs or Pintos, the two strands of Ms. Alhadeff's complex heritage, one that fascinates her although she refuses to be contained by it or held responsible for it. That attitude clearly was shared by her parents, who converted to Roman Catholicism in their 20's and who left her to find out that she was of Jewish extraction when she herself was an adult.
Racial identity, religious identity -- we know well enough what has been done in their names to feel that the world would be a healthier place without any affiliations at all. But most of us cleave to community. Ms. Alhadeff was raised a Catholic but says, "Now I see different religions as merely a question of esthetics -- music and architecture -- on the one hand, and method on the other: how do you become acquainted with the strangers in you?" She has an Arabic surname, an Italian passport; taxi drivers ask her if she is Turkish, Indian, Spanish? She has managed to float free of cultural definition and I envy her. Most of us are too readily defined.
But she is able to escape a cultural straitjacket and feel liberated rather than untethered, because she has this wealth of identities to assume. She may refuse to assume a Jewish identity; she may question her obligation to feel anything in particular about the island of Rhodes, the origin of her father's family and of its fortune. But she remains conscious and involved; she needs to reach out to her origins as much as any of us. And "The Sun at Midday" is a vivid, eloquent discussion of her complex ancestry and its implications.
She writes with elegance and panache, serving up word pictures of her more colorful relatives: Cousin Pierre, a priest in Italy who wears a canary yellow polo shirt, uncreased baggy navy blue cotton pants and sandals with blue synthetic velvet straps, and who, Robert Mapplethorpe said, played footsie under the table with him. Piero and Beppe in Milan, who own a marble lampstand with three bronze dachshunds. And above all her parents, married in Alexandria when very young and subsequently locked into a cycle of infidelity: "Adultery is the mostly invisible web on which our lives have been woven. . . . Adultery was the pastime in Alexandria."
Sephardic Jews were the clever, flexible merchant class of the Mediterranean: flexible above all, moving between cultures, adapting to social and economic circumstance. When Mussolini's racial laws against Jews came to Italian-occupied Rhodes in 1938, Ms. Alhadeff's grandfather left and set up business in Alexandria, joining that group of prosperous families whose wealth was based on cotton. I remember those names -- Mosseri, Cattaoui, Menasce -- the Boston Brahmins of Alexandria, rich, exclusive, apparently impregnable. All are now dispersed around the world. A few years ago, my hostess at an Alexandria dinner party sought out for me the relics of that society -- ancient bejeweled ladies, infinitely courteous old gentlemen in blazers and gray flannels, talking upper-crust English with a faint tinge of exotic accent. That lost world was conjured up -- beach parties, villas and mansions hung with bougainvillea, glittering shops, the Corniche. Most of it is now drowned beneath a sea of concrete, the sea so polluted that the beaches are empty.
Ms. Alhadeff too has searched for the past: her grandparents' graves, her grandfather's house. But in a sense she has it still very much alive, preserved in the members of her family to whom she gives so much graphic life. The only one to speak for himself is her uncle Nissim, whose account of his experience in Auschwitz makes a haunting central core to the book -- a grim reminder of the implications of Jewish identity.

HEADLINE: Workers Have Reason to Protest Cutbacks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your April 10 Business Day report on labor unrest in France presents what has become the official line on living standards not only in Europe but also in this country: The benefits that workers have become accustomed to are no longer feasible in the new globally competitive economy. Wages are too high, social programs too generous, and job security too rigid. It's a tough world out there: Get used to it. 
 And yet, as your article indicates, the protests against cutbacks go on, and why shouldn't they? Because of continued economic growth, our societies are now richer than ever, not poorer. Our productive capacity is greater, the skills of our work force are at an all-time high, and profits have rebounded sharply.
Putting aside our environmental problems, which play no role in the new realism anyway, what conceivable basis can there be for the claim that we can no longer afford the living standards of the past?
There is plenty of room for debate on how to improve living standards: from what programs to set up, to how to share responsibilities and rewards more equitably in production. But there is no reason for workers to lower their expectations, no matter how many times they are told to do so by the representatives of wealth and power.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Tracking Executives' Compensation

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Ferdinand Lundberg's "The Rich and the Super Rich" became a 1968 best seller -- even though it was an update of a book he had written 30 years earlier -- because there was much interest in the fortunes of the rich and often not famous, but little information available.
These days a wealth of information on executive pay and individual wealth is available, most of it free, over the Internet. 
 Executive salaries and even some executives' employment contracts are available from the World Wide Web site of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Bill Gates Wealth Clock tracks how the fortune of Microsoft's founder fluctuates based on the most recent trading of the company's shares on the Nasdaq market.
You can even learn some of the basics about pay and benefits for executives and those who work for them at sites maintained by the American Compensation Association, by the Foundation for Enterprise Development and by Richard Hannah, a professor at Middle Tennessee State University.
The newest site is Executive Pay Watch, which the A.F.L.-C.I.O. started last week as part of its efforts to revive the union movement by educating workers about the size of their paychecks, compared with those of their bosses.
"We are trying to do what we can about these outrageous salaries," Richard L. Trumka, secretary- treasurer of the labor federation, said. "If you look at the value being added to these companies, it is mostly coming from the production workers and the rank and file, but the rewards are all going to the guys at the top and we want to fight back."
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. site lists data for 96 companies and allows users to calculate how many years one would have to work -- either at the minimum wage or at the average pay of all Americans -- to make what each of the 96 chief executives made in 1996. (A minimum wage worker made $11,400 if employed full-time in 1966; the average was $24,700.)
Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, was paid $204.2 million, most of it in stock options. At the average wage, one would have to work 8,269 years to make that much, the Web page calculator shows.
The Web site also compares hourly wages, listing the minimum wage at $4.75, the average at $11.88 and Mr. Eisner at $98,191.
Even more jaundiced views of executive pay are available at the Bill Gates Wealth Clock and a site maintained by a Boston group called United for a Fair Economy.
For a celebratory view of wealth there is the Forbes 400 list, available free from the Web pages of the magazine that calls itself the Capitalist Tool. The site comes with useful tools for searching among the richest by name, age, industry, state of residence and even marital status.
The April 11 issue of Business Week focuses on executive pay, with charts, graphs and comparisons, all under the headline: "Tying pay to performance is a great idea. But stock-option deals have compensation out of control."
The Business Week site has simple tables showing which executives made the most, who delivered the most to shareholders in relation to his or her pay and who delivered the least. Also available are details of the 20 biggest fortunes-in-waiting, based on the value of stock options held by executives who have yet to exercise them. Topping the list is Henry Silverman of HFS with $544 million in waiting.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
To the End, Schubertiade Overcomes The Odds

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
It is possible to view Schubert in an altogether different light: not as a fragile genius tragically cut down as he was emerging from the bloom of youth but as a hardy survivor who pushed ahead for six years despite the ravages of syphilis to forge a profound and eloquent mature style.
"He was not alone," Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College and a conductor and musical gadfly, said at a symposium during the Schubertiade, which ended on Thursday evening at the 92d Street Y. In fact, Mr. Botstein suggested, Schubert's death at 31 made him "part of the majority" in Vienna at a time when the average life expectancy was 30 to 35 years; the wonder was that he actually lived to maturity. 
 To that extent, the Schubertiade itself proved aptly symbolic over its 10-year course and especially in this, its final season. Conceived by the noted German baritone Hermann Prey, the series survived times of financial crisis and administrative upheaval at the Y only through repeated changes of shape and scale.
And this year, as a triumphant conclusion still lay within reach, in a remarkable series of programs that plucked the ripest fruits of Schubert's final years, Mr. Prey, the central performer, and his pianist, Michael Endres, withdrew at the last minute. The Y was left to scramble over the last three weeks to fill the various gaps left in four of the six concerts, and did a fine job of it, enlisting the likes of Stanford Olsen, Hakan Hagegard and Mitsuko Shirai as singers and James Levine and Hartmut Holl as pianists.
"I was very, very sad that I couldn't do it," Mr. Prey said on Friday from Naples, Fla. He was suffering from extreme exhaustion, he explained, after similar series of concerts in Munich and Tokyo.
"It would have been the peak of my life to do it in New York," he added. "But I couldn't come to New York only 80 percent of what I used to be. We all have our ups and downs, and I fell down. No one could be sorrier than I was."
So variety replaced relative uniformity, and in truth, fresher voices replaced the 67-year-old Mr. Prey's, though his intelligence, experience and sense of style were inevitably missed. Many of the performances raised questions of scale, balance and blend, which were not always happily resolved.
Mr. Hagegard, another baritone, represented the most straightforward substitution, in the song cycle "Schwanengesang" on Wednesday evening, with Mr. Levine as the originally scheduled pianist. Mr. Hagegard ranged from a fine-spun lieder style and a genuinely touching "Standchen" to occasional extremes of volume that were almost shattering in the Y's small hall.
Mr. Olsen, a tenor, adopted a more consistently extroverted, almost operatic approach toward "Die Schone Mullerin" on April 2, with Mr. Levine filling in: again, a flexible, expert pianist. The sheer size of Mr. Olsen's performance recalled the baritone Thomas Hampson's "Winterreise" in February in Carnegie Hall; with less reason to resort to power in this intimate auditorium, Mr. Olsen may simply have been playing to his own strengths: his intonational control seemed more secure at full volume.
Here, the orphaned "Winterreise" fell to a team of long standing, Ms. Shirai, a mezzo-soprano, and Mr. Holl, on April 5. It is no longer unusual to encounter a woman singing the role of the jilted male in "Winterreise," and Ms. Shirai and Mr. Holl have recorded the cycle for Capriccio.
In this case, the problems of balance arose from the dominance of the pianist. Even to a listener fond of active collaborations, Mr. Holl's work seemed unduly aggressive, laying down a bed of nails that left little scope for Ms. Shirai's lovely but restrained singing. Giving almost no play to the hope and optimism, however illusory, that Schubert afforded with his ironic use of the major mode and other devices, the performance seemed not so much the "journey" of the title as a colorless, featureless, repetitive trudge.
The Tokyo String Quartet, one of the groups most often represented in the Schubertiade over the years, brought down the curtain on Thursday with the "Death and the Maiden" Quartet and (with Gary Hoffman as second cellist) the C major Quintet. Here, much of the interest was focused on the Tokyo's internal balance, with Mikhail Kopelman still settling in as the permanent first violinist, replacing the injured Peter Oundjian.
The "Death and the Maiden" raised immediate suspicions, with Mr. Kopelman's plush, lyrical tone sounding anomalous over that familiar infrastructure of seething intensity. But the unity, tighter in the later movements, seemed complete in the quintet.
In the end, one wished only for the observance of another sectional repeat or two. If ever there was a time to linger over Schubert's heavenly lengths, this was it.
So, 10 years after Misha Dichter and Joseph Kalichstein led off the first Schubertiade with the G major Fantasy for Piano Duet (D. 1), here was the end, rounded out brilliantly on Wednesday by Mr. Levine and Ken Noda, playing the late F minor Duet Fantasy (D. 940). It is fascinating to ponder how many listeners may have made the complete trek and how they may have felt about it. Trudy Miller, the program director of the Schubertiade, asserted from the stage that some subscribers had gone the route, but the Y was unable to say who or how many.
If any there were, they wandered in the relative desert of the youthful works through the early years, when the programs were conceived along strictly chronological lines. They saw countless changes of direction, including a season, in 1993, in which the concerts consisted only of piano works, played by Andras Schiff: enough to give downsizing a good name. And they finally reaped the payoff of the great late works, if not quite in the performances they expected.
It was a remarkable achievement in a parlous time, when both the Schubertiade's parent institution and the classical-music world found reason to reassess their missions. For its survival, much credit must go to Ms. Miller (first as associate program director, then as director), Christopher H. Gibbs (first as consultant, then as musicological director), Omus Hirshbein (as program director through 1994) and Joseph Horowitz (as annotator and adviser through 1994).
The Y's current administration would do well indeed to come up with another project able to draw the dedication and good efforts of so many talented individuals. For that matter, any organization would.

HEADLINE: SIDES SQUARE OFF ON DECONTROLLING ELECTRICITY SALES

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
A high-stakes battle is unfolding in Congress and across the country over legislation to give consumers the same choice in buying electricity that they now have in choosing airlines and long-distance telephone companies.
At stake is the restructuring of the electric power industry, an enterprise worth $200 billion a year that has been tightly regulated since Franklin D. Roosevelt was President. 
 Bills in the House and Senate would break up the regional monopolies that utilities now enjoy and order states to open the retail electricity market to nationwide competition. But the pace of deregulation and its exact scope are major unresolved issues in a debate that is likely to extend into next year.
The legislation's proponents, led by large manufacturers, argue that increasing competition could slash the electricity bills of homeowners, retailers, schools and farmers, as well as manufacturers, by 15 percent to 50 percent. Critics, including most of the nation's investor-owned utilities, warn that Federal legislation is unnecessary because nearly every state is moving to offer new choices to residential and commercial customers. Utilities in at least six states, including New York, have pilot programs under way.
The legislative donnybrook has attracted an army of lobbyists and consultants, including several former members of Congress, and the issue has become one of the most closely watched on Capitol Hill this year. Analysts estimate that both sides combined could spend as much as $50 million this year in lobbying fees and advertising campaigns.
"It seems to be the only thing going on right now, or at least the most visible," said Elaine Acevedo, president of the American League of Lobbyists.
The lobbying wars are not confined to Washington. Supporters and critics of the Federal legislation are squaring off in several major cities and most state capitals.
In Chicago last week, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a national advocacy group with strong ties to influential Republicans like Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, bought $50,000 in radio advertisements to promote the deregulation of the electricity industry.
The Illinois chapter of that group also hired a plane to fly over Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park during opening-day baseball games for the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox. The plane pulled a banner urging Chicago's major utility, the Commonwealth Edison Company, to give consumers more choice.
On Monday, a House Commerce subcommittee headed by Representative Dan Schaefer, a Colorado Republican who has introduced a sweeping deregulation bill, will hold a hearing on the issue in Atlanta. Other hearings will be held in the next few weeks in Richmond, Chicago and Dallas.
The issue's complexity has clouded early predictions that Congress would pass a comprehensive bill this year or next. Ms. Acevedo said, "This is a five-year project, at least."
The battle lines on retail electricity competition cut across political lines, with Republicans and Democrats on both sides. Republicans are divided between free-market advocates, who favor Mr. Schaefer's bill, and states' rights supporters, who are wary. Democrats are also split over whether deregulation could hurt residential consumers, who use relatively little electricity compared with big companies.
Since the 1930's, electric utilities have been a collection of monopolies regulated by the states they serve. Utilities have been protected from competition and guaranteed rates that yield a profit. As a result, electricity prices vary widely from state to state, with customers in the Pacific Northwest paying, in some cases, one-third the rates of consumers in the Northeast.
Congress deregulated the wholesale electricity market in 1992; last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expanded the authority of utilities and some municipalities to bargain for the cheapest power supplier. Under this arrangement, utilities and other power producers buy and sell electricity and send it to one another over existing transmission lines.
But the big prize is the retail market. Under the proposed restructuring, consumers would get their electricity over the same wires carrying it now. The only difference would be which organization sold them the power. Consumers could buy electricity directly from utilities. Or they might buy it through an organization that could buy power in large volume for many people, like members of a labor union, a church or a professional association.
The proposed bills would deregulate only the power-generating part of the industry. Transmission and distribution would remain monopolies, with companies charging one another fees to ship electricity over their lines.
The hotly contested debate has spawned more than a dozen coalitions that are trying to influence its outcome and has sometimes resulted in unusual alliances.
Last week, a new coalition of coalitions, Americans for Affordable Electricity, was formed to coordinate support for deregulation. The group's members include the Ford Motor Company and Sears, Roebuck & Company, school administrators, mom-and-pop grocers and a handful of utilities that are not encumbered by a lot of debt and are confident of their ability to compete.
"We're going to raise enough money to compete toe to toe," said John J. Motley 3d, a senior vice president of the National Retail Federation and chairman of the new coalition. Mr. Motley said the alliance expected to raise at least $4 million for lobbying and advertising.
A leader in this alliance is the Enron Corporation, a large gas and electricity company based in Houston. Enron is spending $25 million in advertising this year, including local television spots it bought during the Super Bowl in Washington, Houston, Omaha, and Portland, Ore., but company officials say that the campaign is for overall brand advertising and that not all of it is tied to the deregulation effort. Enron has also contributed $5,000 to $10,000 to half a dozen studies and reports that herald deregulation, said a company spokesman, Mark Palmer.
Leading the charge on the other side of the debate is the Edison Electric Institute, a group of 100 investor-owned utilities that account for about 75 percent of the nation's electricity.
"We're very much in support of efficient competition," said David K. Owens, a senior vice president at the institute. "But we oppose a Federal mandate for choice. If this isn't done correctly, it could create tremendous disruption among states."
The institute raised $3.8 million last year from members to pay for lobbying, and it expects to raise about the same this year. Many utilities particularly want to make sure that any deregulation plan would allow them to recover big debts incurred because of inefficient nuclear power plants.
In addition to its eight in-house lobbyists, the institute has hired, at a cost of $15,000 a month each, the firms of two former Congressmen, Dennis Eckart, Democrat of Ohio, and Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican who is a close friend of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The institute has also hired, at a cost of $10,000 a month, the firm employing Haley Barbour, the former national chairman of the Republican National Committee. In addition, Robert M. McGlotten, a former top lobbyist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., reported receiving $100,000 last year from the institute.
Loosely aligned with the utilities are the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, rural electric cooperatives and small power companies owned by municipalities. The union estimates that it has lost at least 25,000 jobs since Congress deregulated the wholesale electricity market. I.B.E.W. officials in Georgia say they plan to picket the Congressional hearing in Atlanta on Monday because they will not be allowed to testify.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Good News On Wall Street Is Pretty Bad

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Not since 1990, when George Bush was President and the big international news was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, has the Dow Jones industrial average fallen 10 percent from a record high.
Now it is close to happening again. But many stock market investors can only wish their portfolios were down just 10 percent. The damage to most stocks has been much more severe than that, particularly for the technology stocks that until a year ago, were the stars of the stock market. 
 "I call it the stealth bear market," said Charles Clough, the chief equity strategist of Merrill Lynch. He noted that many smaller and more speculative stocks peaked last spring, before a summer drop in prices. They recovered after that, but not to new highs, and are falling again.
That deterioration in the market was obscured to some extent by the success of many large stocks, quite a few of which continued to set new highs until last month.
In general, technology stocks have been among the most battered, but the best and brightest of the group resisted the trend, at least until recently. Microsoft, now the largest technology stock in terms of market value, with a capitalization of $116 billion, is still up 15 percent since the end of 1996 and is down just 8 percent from the peak it reached in February.
Intel, the No. 2 technology stock, is about even for 1997, even after sliding $6.75, to $130.50, on Friday. That fall came amid fears that steep price cuts on its Pentium chips would eat into profits this summer. Both Intel and Microsoft are far above where they were last spring.
But an index of smaller technology stocks, those in the Russell 2000 index, shows a very different picture. That index peaked last May, then plunged 33 percent by late July. By late January, it had made up about three-fourths of that decline, but now it has given up almost all of that recovery, and stands only 5 percent above its July low.
The Russell 2000, which includes 2,000 companies that rank just below the top 1,000 in market value, hit new highs as recently as late January, although it has since fallen 8.5 percent. It remains well above its lows of last summer.
Similarly, the Nasdaq composite is off 13.1 percent from its January high. But Richard Eakle, an analyst whose firm, Eakle Associates, is based in Fair Haven, N.J., said that even before last week's fall in prices, 41 percent of Nasdaq stocks were down at least one-third from their 1996-97 highs. That suggests, he said, "that high-flying tech sectors have begun a secular downturn which could persist for years."
The Dow, which is now off 9.8 percent from the peak of 7,085.16 reached on March 11, is getting attention because that average has managed to avoid a 10 percent decline for so long. The 1990 plunge, which began just as the country entered a recession, ended after the Dow had fallen 21 percent. In 1994, after the Federal Reserve raised rates, the Dow almost dropped 10 percent, but a rally on the day the Dow seemed likely to hit the level brought prices back.
Investors have noticed the differing performance levels, and money has tended to move from more aggressive mutual funds toward ones that buy bigger, and presumably safer, stocks. In February, the latest month for which complete data are available, investors put 24 percent less into aggressive growth funds than they had last May, when speculative stocks were peaking. But they put 35 percent more money into growth and income funds, the most conservative of the diversified stock funds.
The latest report on mutual fund cash flows, from AMG Data Services, indicates that stock mutual funds took in substantial funds in the week through this past Wednesday, after suffering small withdrawals in the previous week. Those figures are based on a survey of funds, and are not as comprehensive as the monthly figures from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
It was a scare about inflation, and fear that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates further, that was blamed for Friday's selloff of stocks, in which the Dow fell 148.36 points to 6,391.69, and most other indexes also fell more than 2 percent.
But that decline came on relatively modest volume, an indication that while the amount of money pouring into the market has slowed, so far there is not a big drive to take money out of the market. Most investors are probably down more than 10 percent from the peak, but they still have substantial profits.
And it appears that, despite those losses, most investors do not think there is a better place than the stock market for their money. It is on a continuation of that attitude that Wall Street is depending in hopes that the slide will be contained.

HEADLINE: Web Retailers Finding Allies At Sites With Nothing to Sell

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
Trying to generate business on the Internet has been likened to dropping your business cards on a Manhattan sidewalk during rush hour. Almost no one knows you exist, and the few who stumble upon your card are unlikely to be the kind of business prospects you were looking for.
To increase the right kind of inquiries, dozens of on-line retail stores have set up relationships with information sites that are devoted simply to text, pictures, graphics or music -- without any retail component. 
 The practice -- known variously as syndicated selling, on-line franchising or associates programs -- allows retail sites to link with information sites to alert Web travelers where they can find products that might interest them. In return, the information sites receive a commission on any sales generated through the link. The information sites are not restricted to giant corporations; even mom-and-pop sites are becoming players in this field.
"Syndicated selling is a recent, but very fundamental, part of the Internet direct marketing business," said Mary Modahl, an analyst at Forrester Research, and a co-author of a report on the subject. "It's the difference between having one store and having 5,000. Obviously, the more points of sale you have the better." According to Ms. Modahl, the practice will continue to grow as consumers overcome security and privacy concerns and become more comfortable with shopping on line.
The best known of these programs is the associates program at Amazon.com, the largest on-line retailer of books. Since starting with the concept in July 1996, it has signed up more than 8,000 associates, or partner Web sites, to send potential customers its way. The associates -- ranging from Star Chefs, a site devoted to celebrity cooks, to Puppynet, a site about pure-bred dogs, to Atlantic Monthly magazine -- have a link to Amazon on their sites, and receive a percentage of the sales generated at Amazon. The commission had been 8 percent on about 300,000 titles. But starting today, the commission on those titles has been raised to 15 percent with a 5 percent commission on about 1.2 million titles that Amazon stocks. Amazon, which is based in Seattle, is preparing an initial public offering and said it is thus not allowed to discuss business operations for several weeks.
Of course, giving and receiving commissions for referrals is nothing new to the business world. Small- business owners from travel agents to health club operators have traditionally used incentives to get current customers to bring in their friends and acquaintances. "What makes these Internet programs significant is that they are specific to the medium," said Scott Smith, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications, a research firm. "The Web allows both the retailers as well as their partners to direct traffic in a mutually beneficial way never before possible."
On the Web, being listed on the search engines and using advertising banners have been the most common ways of generating traffic to retail sites, but that is often not enough. "Internet retailers are learning that they need more than advertising," Mr. Smith said. "They need to make hard sales. What you're doing is harnessing the power of affinity groups and allowing people to act as agents for you. They have a propensity to buy because of their direct interest in what's being offered."
Almost every major retailer on the Web has a similar program either on line or in the works. CD Now, the largest of the Internet music retailers, has made a major push to sign up partners. "It represents about 10 percent of our business right now, and we expect it to grow to 15 percent within the next four months," said Jason Olim, president of CD Now. The company, based in Philadelphia, says it sells more than a million dollars of music a month and has 200,000 registered shoppers.
These referral programs take a variety of forms. Some, like Amazon, pay a percentage of sales generated from the visit as a commission. Others, like Cbooks Express, an on-line computer bookstore, pay a flat $10 fee for each new customer who makes a purchase at the host site. CD Now has two types of deals.
One is a "cosmic credit" program that is a simple link from a content site (typically smaller sites run by amateur music lovers) that get a 5 percent commission for in-store merchandise. The other is a more sophisticated "merchandising partnership" with large sites (like AT&T Worldnet and Pathfinder). These higher-level partnerships involve cash deals that are privately negotiated. About 2,000 sites have signed on for the cosmic credit program and more than 25 companies are merchandising partners.
For the stores, these referrals offer advantages over other Internet sales options. Being part of an Internet shopping mall, for instance, usually means a limited number of visitors, while a single site makes it difficult to attract new customers because they have to come to the site on their own. Syndicated selling, on the other hand, allows the marketer to reach audiences according to their areas of interest, and allows multiple points for entry to its site.
But the most important feature of the syndicated-selling technique is that the host site can offer items for sale without having to invest in expensive support.
"Providing good content is hard enough to do without having to do the whole business side of retailing," said Joe Vella, founder and president of Jazz Online, a leading provider of jazz information, which has a partnership with CD Now. "I couldn't do as good a job as a true retailer. The expenses would be prohibitive."
Of course the characteristics that make syndicated selling a success also make for potential problems. The information sites deny any conflict, saying it would damage their credibility. But there is always the danger that because these sites have a stake in making sure that visitors click through to the retailer's site and then purchase the product under review, they are less likely to be critical in their product reviews.
"Suddenly, everyone is a publisher and a salesman at the same time and the kind of content you provide can have a direct impact on the revenue you get from the marketer," said Steve Fox, editor in chief of The Web magazine.

Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died Saturday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection, and despite those comforts, developed an early sense of social justice. 
 She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, a son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman became a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, was involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was also one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around a desire "to advance both art and action" and an interest in people actively involved with either.
 In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with Alfred Stieglitz, the photographer and advocate of American modernism, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.
Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.
Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of him, "Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer."
While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi.
During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education.
She was a founding member of New York City's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of both the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.
An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.
A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled "A World to Live In" from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published "Twice a Year," a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were "The Selected Writings of John Marin" (1949); "Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend" (1985) and "Encounters: a Memoir" (1987). In 1965 she published "Nehru: The First Sixty Years," a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.
In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.
Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Landmark Showdown;
Separating the Rockettes and Radio City Maybe a Way Out of a Lease Dispute

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
When a group made up of the investment bankers Goldman, Sachs & Company, the real estate developer Tishman Speyer Properties and David Rockefeller took control of Rockefeller Center last year, they acquired $1.4 billion worth of real estate, an ice-skating rink, a celebrated Christmas tree site and one of the most famous stages in the world, Radio City Music Hall.
What they did not get was what has been on that stage for 65 years: the Rockettes, the precision dance team whose dozens of svelte, high-kicking legs have been as much a part of the Music Hall's architecture as the gilded arches that frame its proscenium. 
 The Rockettes, along with Radio City's highly profitable Christmas extravaganza and its somewhat less profitable Easter show, are owned by a separate company, Radio City Productions Inc., which is locked in something of a standoff with the new owners of Rockefeller Center for control of the Music Hall's future. If they do not come to terms, it is possible that this year's Christmas show at Radio City will be the last. By 1998, the Rockettes could be strutting across a competing stage somewhere else, a Radio City in exile.
Radio City Productions pays its landlord roughly $5 million a year for a lease on the Music Hall, which the new owners feel barely reflects the potential of the 5,901-seat hall, New York's largest proscenium auditorium. And while the new owners of Rockefeller Center will not speak publicly about Radio City Productions, they have not been shy in telling people in the entertainment industry that they feel the company has operated the hall as a tired museum, filling it up at Christmas and letting it go dark for much of the rest of the year.
"Radio City is the keystone of everything we're doing at Rockefeller Center," said Jerry Speyer, who as president and chief executive of the partnership that now controls the center has repeatedly stated his interest in restoring the landmark property to its former prestige.
Neither Mr. Speyer nor other owners of Rockefeller Center would discuss details of plans for Radio City, nor would the management of Radio City Productions speak on the record about the hall's future. Each side, at least in public, talks only in the most diplomatic terms about the other. But interviews with people in the entertainment and real estate industries provided the following picture of an unusual struggle that balances entertainment, history, landmarks and real estate economics.
Radio City Productions is clearly eager to remain in charge of the Music Hall. But the new owners have been talking to several of the biggest names in entertainment, including Time Warner, the Disney Company and MCA/Universal, hoping to find someone else to take over the hall. None of these companies has seemed eager to sign on as manager, however, in part because the hall, for all its fame and architectural glory, needs an estimated $30 million to $50 million for restoration and bringing its mechanical systems into the computer age.

A Lease Flawed By Missing Assets
But the reluctance also stems from the fact that a lease on the space would come without the assets for which the hall is most famous. A Radio City operated by Time Warner or Disney, however successful its programming might be, would be a Radio City without the Rockettes or the rights to produce anything that could be called the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. And last year's 193 Christmas performances, seen by roughly a million people, produced $44 million in revenue and, according to people close to the company, $12 million to $14 million in profit.
Would it matter? At this point, no one is certain whether the auditorium called Radio City Music Hall needs the show that bears its name more than the show needs the auditorium. Is Radio City Music Hall the Rockettes, or are the Rockettes Radio City Music Hall?
As if to prove that its attractions can exist apart from their real estate, as well as to demonstrate its ability to do more than stage familiar events in the same place, last year Radio City Productions mounted road versions of its Christmas show in Branson, Mo., and Myrtle Beach, S.C. The efforts were so successful, the company says, that it plans to add a Radio City Christmas show at the Fox Theater in Detroit and maybe one on the West Coast. To provide Rockettes for these shows, the company is staging auditions around the country this month, expecting to nearly double the roster of Rockettes, to 140.

Sharing the Vision Of the Landlords
The company has also been quietly lobbying to convince its new landlords that it agrees with the goal of increasing the income from the Music Hall and the diversity of its programming, and that it is the company best equipped to do it.
Indeed, like a politician who runs against his own record, Radio City Productions has tried to distance itself from its own prior management. In January the company replaced its chief executive, James A. McManus, with Arlen Kantarian, a former marketing executive from the National Football League who has run Radio City's marketing and entertainment divisions for several years.
Mr. Kantarian has changed many of the company's executives, and he is focusing on marketing the hall more aggressively for corporate events, concerts, film openings and large-scale awards presentations like ESPN's Espy sports awards. In June, Radio City will be the site of the Tony Awards, which have always been presented in a Broadway theater.
Rockefeller Center's owners, however, are under considerable pressure to make a decision soon. Theaters book many months in advance, and with Radio City's management future uncertain beyond January, many events that might be booked into the hall will soon need to seek firmer commitments elsewhere. One possibility is that Rockefeller Center's owners broker an affiliation between Radio City Productions and another manager, allowing the hall's old programming to coexist with new programming. Another option for them to buy Radio City Productions from its present owner, the company that formerly owned all of Rockefeller Center, the Rockefeller Group.
While Radio City Productions is now cast in the role of old-guard operator of the Music Hall, the company was born only in 1979, after the Music Hall's last major crisis, when Rockefeller Center, frustrated at its inability to fill seats with the family-oriented films that had been its staple for years, announced plans to close the hall.
After an outcry, in which the Rockefeller family, which then still controlled the real estate that carried its name, was portrayed as a desecrator of landmarks, the center agreed to preserve the hall as a general entertainment center and created Radio City Productions to run it.
Radio City Productions' mission was similar to the one demanded by the new landlords: to broaden the use of the hall and make it a profitable magnet for tourists and New Yorkers alike. No one doubts that for several weeks each December they succeed almost beyond expectations; the company likes to call its Christmas show the most popular live entertainment attraction in the country, drawing a larger audience than a Broadway hit does in a year.
The company managed to book the Music Hall for 250 days in 1996 and is projecting about 280 bookings in 1997. But it remains to be seen whether that is enough for the new management, which has committed itself to a total overhaul of Rockefeller Center. The Goldman, Sachs and Tishman Speyer group showed its determination to create a new image for the center last month when it announced that Christie's, the auction house, was moving into the space now occupied by the Rockefeller Center garage.

Trying to Enhance An Upscale Image
The Christie's deal brought a prestigious and highly profitable tenant to the center, but even more, it demonstrated a willingness to rethink every aspect of the landmark property, so long as it enhances Rockefeller Center's traditional, upscale image. The new owners so far have given the impression that their goal is to preserve and enhance that image, which once made the center perhaps the most prestigious commercial address in the country.
All of this suggests that while the owners would like to increase revenue from the Music Hall, they would not look kindly on plans to revamp it radically, turning it into an entertainment-oriented theme park. The hall's eminence comes not only from its venerable name but from the fact that it remains one of the few auditoriums in the country that can offer live entertainment in extraordinary surroundings, surroundings that are not only vast but authentic. Radio City is the last, and in some ways the greatest, movie palace ever built.
Major physical change would be nearly impossible anyway. After the close call with demolition in 1979, the hall's interior, including its sumptuous lobby, in every way New York's Art Deco cathedral, was made an official city landmark. Alterations to its appearance require approval by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which would look no more kindly on plans to change the Music Hall than on proposals to pave Central Park.

Size: A Strength And a Weakness
Yet people on all sides of the Music Hall standoff agree that the hall is ripe for fresh thinking. Much of its Art Deco magnificence desperately needs freshening, and much of its technology dates from its opening in 1932. The hall's enormous system of hydraulically operated stage elevators and turntables, for example, is still run with its original control panel, with a wall of analog dials that looks like the engine room of a vintage ocean liner. Not a digital readout to be seen.
In the end, the immense size of the Music Hall is both its strength and its weakness. No other hall provides its combination of history, grandeur and immense scale; the Theater at Madison Square Garden, formerly called the Paramount, is nearly as large but utterly banal, a blown-up Third Avenue movie theater. It cannot come close to duplicating the experience of being at Radio City.
Yet Radio City Music Hall is too big, really, for many events that are other halls' bread and butter: concerts by musicians who can't draw the audiences of a Bette Midler; musical theater, for which many of its seats are simply too far from the stage, and films that don't gain a special dimension from Radio City's huge screen.
What looks best on its stage, paradoxically, are the Rockettes, whose lines of rhythmic legs virtually become part of the hall's stunning architecture. At this year's spring stage show, most of the acts were tired relics of a day when singing and dancing on stage was a novelty. But the Rockettes, the oldest thing of all at Radio City, seemed in the context of the show to be the newest and the freshest, their energy zapping like a laser across the Art Deco auditorium. At Radio City, everything that is old is new again.

HEADLINE: Trinity College Leads Effort To Spark Hartford's Renewal

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
The brand-new wrought-iron staircase, lighted by ornamental lampposts, connects the gothic splendor of Trinity College to the blight of the Frog Hollow neighborhood below.
The stairs are a small thing, compared with the $175 million that will be spent on schools, job training, mortgage assistance and family services in the 15 blocks that surround -- and imprison -- the 173-year-old college. 
 But the stairs are a symbol of Evan S. Dobelle's grand vision for the liberal arts college in urban America. Motivated by enlightened self-interest, this unorthodox college president, more slick politician than tweedy academic, has set out to restore his community to health and his institution to preeminence.
In two years as Trinity's president, Mr. Dobelle has rejected the two standard solutions for good schools in bad neighborhoods: Build high walls and spend a fortune on security or buy up the adjoining land and gentrify. Instead, using the college's financial resources and prestige, he has galvanized other large neighborhood institutions, government and private industry in a collaboration to save Frog Hollow for its largely Puerto Rican residents.
"We're an institution of privilege, we have a significant endowment, we don't pay taxes, yet we sit on our hands and say, 'America's going to hell and that's too bad,' " Mr. Dobelle said, his words tumbling out with whirlwind intensity. "Do we continue to presume that it's O.K. to teach liberal arts to students here, and talk about civility, and not be concerned about what's across the street?"
That question is also Yale's. And Marquette's. And Spelman's. And many more colleges that are reaching over their ivied walls and into crumbling communities. But none of these institutions, not in New Haven, Milwaukee or Atlanta, has launched as imaginative a plan for urban renewal as Trinity, according to Henry Cisneros, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
"It is simply the best example," said Mr. Cisneros, now president of Univision Communications in Los Angeles. "Evan Dobelle understands the stakes better and is doing it better than anyone."
Mr. Dobelle sounds like a preacher when he discusses the role of the academy in the inner city. "I've chosen a field that has all the capacity to bring back America, a field that's a sleeping giant. It's underled and overmanaged and needs to be reminded of its moral authority."
The plan for Frog Hollow is an ambitious combination of safe streets, stable home ownership, state-of-the-art schools and jobs.
Trinity's partners in the initiative are Hartford Hospital and its mental health component, The Institute of Living, Connecticut Children's Medical Center and Connecticut Public Television, all in Frog Hollow. These institutions have put up $10 million in seed money. The rest comes from city, state and Federal bonds and grants and from local companies.
The centerpiece of the project is a nine-acre parcel, once a bus yard, that will be home to three new schools -- a K-to-6 Montessori school, a middle school and a high school science and technology center that will be shared by students throughout the region. The schools are scheduled to open in the fall of 1999.
Nearby will be a Boys and Girls Club, managed by Trinity students; a job training center, run by a grass-roots group; a family resource center and a new police substation. Eventually, Mr. Dobelle hopes to relocate certain campus businesses, like a bookstore, copy shop and art gallery, to the streets below.
To help to stabilize Frog Hollow Trinity and the other institutions are buying two- and three-family houses out of foreclosure, renovating them with local contractors and selling them back to neighborhood residents, with reduced-rate mortgages.
The same residents, after training at the job center, will be first in line for certain entry-level positions -- clerical or security, for instance -- at the college and hospitals. Those who do not take advantage of educational or vocational opportunities will be denied housing subsidies.
Three early beneficiaries of the plan are Janette Williams, soon to buy a three-family house; Timothy Otte, who has bought the building where he has run a restaurant for 23 years; and Rob O'Connor, vice president of a drapery business where employees and clients were preyed on by crack addicts until Trinity bought and tore down their dens.
Ms. Williams's house, which she will share with her sister, daughter and infant grandson, was bought at auction by Trinity and its partners for $50,000, then spiffed up with a new furnace, bathroom fixtures and carpet. Ms. Williams, a Baptist pastor and counselor in a group home, will buy it for $80,000. Her sister's employer, Hartford Hospital, will cover the $10,000 down payment and not expect repayment if the family stays for 10 years. The mortgage, negotiated by the college, will cost less than 5 percent.
Mr. Otte, the owner of Timothy's, is an aging hippie who bakes nine-grain bread but has no head for finance. His customers were being pelted with bottles from a crack house next door until Trinity bought and emptied the building. The college also cosigned a loan that allowed Mr. Otte to buy his building for $55,000. The new staircase from the college leads to his front door.
Mr. O'Connor, who employs 35 neighborhood women as seamtresses, was similarly plagued by drug activity in six abandoned buildings on Broad Street. Trinity bought those, too, and plans to replace them with new, two-family homes.
What Trinity is doing began with the streetscape that greeted, and discouraged, prospective students and their parents: Boarded-up or burned-out buildings, their windows dark eye sockets, their vestibules crack dens and their sidewalks a battleground for warring gangs.
These were once handsome brick houses, home to men and women who built bicycles, sewing machines and rifles. But that was before Connecticut's capitol city, graced with parks built by Frederick Law Olmstead and museums endowed by J. P. Morgan, saw its manufacturing base collapse, its insurance companies and banks merge and downsize, and its middle-class flee to the suburbs.
That left Trinity at a disadvantage compared with its competitors, like Williams, Hamilton and Bowdoin, all colleges with bucolic settings. So the Board of Trustees decided to turn a liability into an asset, promote the city as an extension of the classroom and find a president to turn its vague plans into reality.
Mr. Dobelle, 52, emerged from that selection process. In the staid world of academia, his resume, to put it mildly, is unique: Citadel dropout who didn't earn a degree until he was well past 30. Aide to a series of moderate Republicans like Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania and Gov. John A. Volpe of Massachusettes. Twenty-something mayor of Pittsfield, Mass. Chief of protocol for President Jimmy Carter. Treasurer for the Democratic National Committee. President of two community colleges.
Mr. Dobelle did not have the right pedigree, but he had the right stuff. He was a deal-maker and a fund-raiser. He had political connections on both sides of the aisle. He was versed in the urban agenda.
And he had a formidable personality. Bold or impatient, depending on one's view. Determined or relentless, eloquent or bombastic, charming or manipulative. But someone to be reckoned with, a force of nature.
The trustees, while unanimous in their selection, did pause.
Mr. Dobelle insisted on knowing whether he was a serious candidate before completing his application, a most unusual request. He visited Hartford before his interview, the only candidate to do that, and then told the trustees his proposed agenda, without waiting to be asked. During the trustees' deliberations, each time Mr. Dobelle's name was mentioned, it became an inside joke to shed one's suit jacket and head for the window, like Clark Kent morphing to Superman.
Mr. Dobelle's arrival at Trinity spawned a wave of high-level resignations among administrators who did not like his high-octane style, so out of sync with the slow rhythms of academia. "Evan took the whip out and said 'Get to work,' " said Mike Peters, the Mayor of Hartford. "Some people couldn't deal with it."
Mr. Dobelle makes no apologies for being a taskmaster. "I set the bar at a certain level," he said. "Some people went over it. Most didn't."
He claims to return every telephone call the same day. His desk has no drawers because papers get moved immediately. He leaves voice mail for staff at 4 A.M. when his mind is buzzing. They are grateful that he restrains himself from calling them at home.
Meetings are short and plans have precise timetables. "Everything is Project 2000," Mr. Dobelle said. "Isn't there ever a Project Tuesday? I don't have any interest in 'maybe' or 'we'll try.' "
Despite the whip-cracking, Mr. Dobelle has largely won over his key constituencies: faculty, students and community residents.
He lifted the cap on faculty hiring for the first time since 1979 and otherwise has left teachers to their teaching, giving equal respect to urban economics and the Victorian novel.
He consulted students on architectural plans for the campus, hired some as interns in his office, invited them to trustees meetings to network for future jobs and called others with congratulations after football victories.
The community was welcomed to a campus concert by Tito Puente. It was the first time many had been up the hill. Since then, Mr. Dobelle has shown up at neighborhood meetings, learned people's names and spoken to them in fluent Spanish. His two primary aides on the project are Puerto Rican. One, a longtime college employee, was given enough time off to earn an economics degree.
Mr. Dobelle recalled recently the solitary moment when he decided what needed to be done here and that he was the man to do it. It was the day before his interview with the board and he had come to Hartford to prowl the campus and the neighborhood.
At dusk, he sat in the football bleachers with the city spread below him. "I always believe that if I can see it, I can do it," he said. "I could see it that day -- what I've done."
Few dare contradict him, but his 10-year-old son, Harry, had no qualms: "What you're doing, Dad," he said, literally italicizing the verb tense. "It isn't done yet."
Mr. Dobelle seemed torn between pride at Harry's precocity and irritation at the rebuke. "It's not done yet, but it will be," he said, matching Harry's emphasis. "I have never not accomplished what I've said. It's never happened and it won't this time."

HEADLINE: The Taiwan Factor

 BODY:
For a small island that has had no diplomatic relations with the United States since 1979, Taiwan has played an outsized role in the furor over White House fund-raising and the management of American policy toward China. Many of the contested donations to the Democratic Party bear Taiwanese connections and the high tensions in relations between Washington and Beijing last year were to a considerable degree precipitated by Taiwan.
Taiwan wants both strong commercial links to China and political autonomy from Beijing, a split agenda that cannot help but produce trouble in the years ahead. Taiwan also looks to Washington to help secure its prosperity and its freedoms, putting the United States in a bind. 
 As a democratic country locked in a difficult relationship with a Communist behemoth, Taiwan deserves American sympathy and support. But American policy must be measured against other interests and cannot be sustained if Taiwan abuses Washington's support.
The mischief that Taiwan can produce was apparent in the 1995-96 crisis in relations between the United States and China. The dispute arose when the Clinton Administration approved a visa for President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to make an unofficial visit to Cornell, his alma mater. China saw the visa as a threat to America's one-China policy, which commits Washington to recognize only one government, Beijing's, within the historic boundaries of China, which includes Taiwan.
While China overreacted to the decision, Taiwan knew full well that the visa would upset relations between Washington and Beijing. Cornell invited Mr. Lee after receiving two large contributions from Taiwan. Taiwan then successfully pressed Congress to demand that the White House issue the visa. Once in the country, Mr. Lee used his visit to make politically tinged speeches.
Taiwan and Taiwanese-Americans played a central role in the White House fund-raising abuses. In this case, the most likely motivation was to strengthen American commercial ties with China and Taiwan. The Democratic Party fund-raising trio of John Huang, Johnny Chung and Charlie Trie are all Taiwanese-Americans. The Los Angeles Buddhist temple where Al Gore attended a fund-raising event is affiliated with a Taiwanese religious leader. There is nothing wrong with Asian-Americans being politically active. But funneling foreign contributions or buying political access, as suspected in these cases, is illegal and troubling.
Those who worked to win President Lee his visa knew their success would poison relations between the United States and China. Mr. Huang, meanwhile, is a strong advocate of warmer ties between Washington and Beijing and Mr. Chung has links to Chinese companies, including the Chinese military's main arms-dealing outlet.
These contradictions reflect the complexity of today's democratic and affluent Taiwan. Multiple parties tug its foreign policy in different directions. Local businesses have developed close relationships with the Chinese mainland, where factory labor is dramatically cheaper. But while Taiwan's economy is now more closely entwined with China's, President Lee has sought to recover the distinct diplomatic identity Taiwan enjoyed until 1979.
America's interest is to encourage China and Taiwan to avoid confrontation in the hope that more attractive resolutions may be available in the future. In practice, Washington needs to discourage not only military adventurism by China, but also diplomatic adventurism by Taiwan. America also has a clear interest in maintaining strong economic ties with both Taiwan and China, respectively its seventh- and fourth-largest trading partners. When China and Taiwan crudely try to manipulate American politics and policy, it is natural for Americans to be dismayed.

HEADLINE: 100,000 March in Iran to Protest Berlin Court Ruling on Slayings

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, April 13

 BODY:
More than 100,000 people marched on the German Embassy in Teheran today, in one of several protests across the country against a German court's ruling implicating Iranian leaders in political assassinations.
Hundreds of riot policemen ringed the German Embassy compound in downtown Teheran, the capital. But the protest was orderly, and in some ways appeared orchestrated not to strain relations with Germany, a lucrative trading partner, to the point of rupture.
There were no chants against Germany, and organizers stopped the crowd from burning a German flag and an effigy of the German judge who issued the verdict on Thursday. Instead, the protesters burned an Israeli flag, and the crowd chanted, "Death to America!" and "Death to Israel!" 
 Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said "millions" were expected to attend rallies nationwide, and demonstrations were later reported in more than a dozen other cities, including Qum, the seat of Iran's ruling clergy.
Last week a Berlin court convicted four men in the 1992 murders of four Iranian dissidents there and said the order to kill had came from top Iranian leaders, without identifying them by name. Prosecutors had earlier implicated Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
The court's decision set off the worst diplomatic crisis between Iran and the West since 1989, when Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Muslims to kill a British author, Salman Rushdie, after accusing him of blasphemy.
After the court ruling, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and all European Union countries except Greece recalled their ambassadors from Teheran. The actions were welcomed by the United States, which for years has sought to isolate Iran, accusing it of sponsoring state terrorism.
Iran, which rejected the ruling in Germany, summoned home its Ambassador to Germany and withdrew four diplomats. It has also said it would recall envoys from the European Union countries that summoned home their ambassadors.
Today the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Hassan Rowhani, said Iran had canceled a planned visit by an Australian economic delegation. It also suspended all trade contracts with New Zealand, the state-run news organizations reported.
Mr. Rowhani called for a "total revision of ties with Germany," urged a halt to investments there and a ban on purchases of German equipment, state television reported.
The 270-seat Parliament held a special closed session today to review relations with Germany. Later Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati warned that any reduction of ties with Iran by Western countries would affect their business interests with the Islamic republic, a country of 60 million people that is one of the world's largest suppliers of oil.
"Iran will give an appropriate response and will remember their actions in its future dealings with them," he was quoted as saying by Iranian television. But he said he considered the actions by Western countries "symbolic steps."
Neither side appears ready to further jeopardize relations. Germany is Iran's largest Western trading partner, with their annual trade exceeding $1.8 billion. Other European companies supply Iran with everything from power plants and telecommunications equipment.
Still, more fallout is possible. Mr. Rowhani told Parliament that the European Union's decision to recall ambassadors was "a fruitless act." But he said in a speech broadcast by Iranian television, "Without doubt, it will be replied in kind by Iran."

Rent Control: Mayor Dodges Both Bullets

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
FERNANDO FERRER cares a lot about New York's rent laws. So much so that on Friday he summoned Bronx legislators for an "emergency meeting" on the subject. Then he generously opened up the strategy session to the entire New York City press corps.
Eight state legislators -- all Assembly members and all Democrats -- showed up for what was ostensibly a spontaneous sharing of ideas in the Borough President's Grand Concourse office. But the meeting, which began a half hour late, only really got under way when the discussion turned to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the chairman of the Bronx's Democratic Party, delivered the first tirade. 
 The Mayor, Mr. Ramirez asserted, was well known for his belligerence. "But the question a lot of people are asking," he said, "is: 'How come on this we're not seeing the bully?' "
The politicians around the conference table all nodded. Especially vigorous in his assent was Mr. Ferrer, who hopes to oppose the Mayor in the fall.
Picking up on the theme, Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera declared that the Mayor had already failed a critical test of leadership. Last Monday, he noted, there had been a procedural vote in the State Senate, which the pro-rent regulation forces had lost.
"The Mayor did not go up there and lobby," Mr. Rivera said, looking directly into the television cameras hovering at table's edge. "There was dead silence from New York City."
TO say that the issue of rent regulation presents Mr. Giuliani's rivals with a political opportunity is not really to do justice to the awkwardness of the Mayor's present situation.
Mr. Giuliani is the first Republican Mayor in a generation and he presides over a city where, nominally at least, his party is still outnumbered five to one. Less than six months before he has to face voters at the polls, his ostensible allies -- the state's Republican Governor, George E. Pataki, and its Republican State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno -- plan, by their own account, to weaken or kill outright the rules that keep rents down for almost 2.5 million New York City tenants. With friends like that, who even needs Democrats?
Finding himself in the increasingly familiar quandary of choosing between the Republican Party and New York City voters, the Mayor has responded with characteristic pragmatism. He has distanced himself from the anti-rent regulation fervor of his party and has vowed to fight -- on principle! -- with the tenants. (No one knows how many rent-regulated tenants are apt to vote in the coming mayoral election, but a conservative estimate puts the figure at several hundred thousand.)
In siding with the tenants, it should be noted, the Mayor has cast aside not only party loyalty, but also his own oft-stated position that market competition is the best solution to New York City's ills. This is a particularly striking renunciation, since virtually every economist in the country would argue that rent regulation is one of New York City's ills.
"You have a Republican Mayor who has the free-marketeer attitude toward everything except housing," grumbled Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord group.
WHAT finally turns out to be surprising about the Mayor's predicament on rent regulation, then, is not that potential challengers like Mr. Ferrer would try to use it against him, but that so far at least they have had so little success.
Over the last few weeks, it has been Mr. Giuliani's support of the rent laws, rather than his failure to accomplish anything on their behalf, that has led the news. Today, the Mayor is scheduled to travel to Albany to lobby on the issue, and once again he can expect his efforts -- fruitful or otherwise -- to dominate the coverage.
The way Mr. Giuliani has managed to cast the issue, he is a champion of the tenants simply for taking their side. If the rest of his party is in the opposite camp, well, the Mayor has implied, that's just not something he should be held responsible for.
In point of fact, however, there are a lot more persuasive tactics the Mayor could use -- should he so choose -- to bring the members of his party around.
Mr. Giuliani could, for example, make it known that he will oppose any of the city's five Republican State Senators who do not work to extend the laws. He could even threaten to support Mr. Pataki's Democratic opponent in next year's gubernatorial election, hardly a stretch for a man who three years ago backed Mario M. Cuomo.
Of course, tactics like this carry enormous risks; if they fail, they can make a politician rue the day he ever ran for office. And so it is in the Mayor's interest to continue to play it safe. And it is in his opponents' interests to expose his calculation for what it is. As Mr. Ferrer put it on Friday, not just once but several times: "The Mayor has taken a dive."

Welfare Rolls Show Fewer Recipients

SERIES: AFTER THE CUTS -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The city has made major changes in how it serves the poor and vulnerable. But whether those changes have helped or hurt the poor has been a matter of passionate debate, and one informed by few facts.
The number of New Yorkers on welfare has declined by 235,000, or 20 percent, from a peak of 1,160,593 in March 1995 to 925,188 in January, the last month for which statistics are available. 
 But no one knows what happened to most of those who are no longer on the rolls. Did they find full-time jobs? Were they people who already had jobs who were ferreted out by city fraud investigators? Did they disappear into the underground economy? Did they leave New York City?
City officials say that the huge decline in the welfare population saves the city money, and they note that homeless shelters are not bursting and the streets are not choked with beggars. They also say that 35,000 people still receiving welfare are at any given moment working for their benefits, learning the advantages of responsibility and timeliness.
Critics contend, though, that requiring welfare recipients to sweep the streets or clean the parks does not necessarily lead to real jobs in the private sector and to financial independence. They say the Giuliani administration can document that only 8,000 of the more than 130,000 people who have gone through the workfare program wound up with real jobs. And they assert that the administration has chosen not to track more closely what has happened to those who have left the rolls or gone through the work program.
"It's information they don't want to know," said Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee.
In contrast, the administration's effort to overhaul the perpetually troubled child welfare system has been met with general applause. Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, produced a 145-page reform plan, one that calls for decentralizing the agency into a neighborhood-based system that enhances training and improves the pay for caseworkers in a move to stabilize a notoriously volatile work force. Mr. Scoppetta said he had won the Mayor's pledge of "many millions of dollars" to make it all happen.
But the plan's proponents, within and outside the administration, warn that it will be years before results can be fairly assessed. And clearly those unconvinced by the plan -- from union officials to social workers to caseworkers who have yet to see an appreciable improvement in their work conditions -- wonder if there is a sufficient sense of urgency to make fundamental changes. They note that the agency still has not hired the caseworkers already in the budget. JOE SEXTON

HEADLINE: CITY SERVICES: Department of Buildings;
Despite Changes, Permit Lines Are Long

SERIES: AFTER THE CUTS -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Nowhere in the City of New York is the ritual of standing in line so dominant a fact of life as at the Department of Buildings. So under pressure from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the department has merged, centralized and automated the process of permit applications and building inspections. The result, curiously, has been longer lines.
"Everything they do to simplify enhances my job security," said Judith Faulkner, one of the legion of expediters -- paid line-standers and paperwork handlers -- who have inhabited the department's corridors in lower Manhattan for decades, and whose numbers have increased since Mr. Giuliani took office. "Sometimes," she added, "it seems like madness." 
 But city officials say there is method to the madness: To speed things along they have combined some services, making for more efficiency despite the longer lines.
"We have finally arrived in the 20th century," said Gaston Silva, who was appointed the city's Commissioner of Buildings in August and who has led an assault on its red tape through a greater use of computers. He has consolidated operations with other city agencies and increased reliance on "self-certification" by architects, engineers and plumbers.
With the city economy strengthening, the department has recorded a modest increase in building permit applications, mainly in such projects as store or apartment renovations rather than large-scale projects.
And in a shift designed to increase efficiency, it has merged some of its permit application procedures with those of the Department of Transportation and Department of Environmental Protection, so builders can file their applications in one place.
"One-stop shopping" has brought more applicants than ever to the Buildings Department offices in each of the five boroughs. Yet the average processing time for combined sewer and building permit applications is two days, compared with nine days before the new system, city officials said. A broader campaign to cut red tape has come with "self-certification," through which plumbers, architects and engineers simply certify in writing that their work conforms to city codes. Inspectors double-check those projects later in random visits. But most builders, fearing legal liability, evidently still prefer to have a city inspector sign off on their work.
Self-certification has become more widely accepted, though. In 1995, only 15 percent of the permits for new buildings were self-certified; last year that number rose to 43 percent, according to department records, with most of the increase among builders of single-family homes on Staten Island.

HEADLINE: A Bay Is Sick. Will the Cure Make It Worse?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KEY LARGO, Fla.

 BODY:
IN more than 20 years as a fishing guide on Florida Bay, Mike Collins has experienced many a classic sunny day prospecting for shy bonefish and high-leaping tarpon in beds of turtle grass waving in the clear water.
But in the bay's western reaches these days, the once-clear water looks like pea soup -- vivid evidence of a widespread bloom of algae and, to some people, an unmistakable sign of an ecosystem in trouble. The turtle grass is dead or dying. Its stalks bob on the surface ripples, and its diseased roots crumble to the touch. Bonefish and tarpon have fled. 
 "Isn't it nauseating?" Mr. Collins said as he gazed at the chalky green water.
The bay -- 600 square miles of shallow flats tucked between the Everglades and the Florida Keys -- is in the grip of an ecological crisis, many experts say. Some fear that as the bay goes, so in some measure may go the coral reefs just outside the Keys. This is the third largest barrier reef tract in the world and, together with the bay itself, a vital part of the region's tourist economy. Divers and snorkelers love the reef, but "it's kind of hard to sell tourists dirty water," said Mr. Collins, who has led a council of interest-group representatives advising administrators of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
The main source of the bay's difficulties, almost everyone agrees, is the lack of fresh water. For most of this century people have been draining the Everglades and diverting much of the swamp's fresh water for agriculture, urban development and flood control. A lot of the water is simply channeled into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Under natural conditions the Everglades flow drains into Florida Bay and is carried to coral reefs on currents through the middle and lower Keys. The cure for the bay's problems, it is widely thought, is to restore as nearly as possible the natural flow of water from Lake Okeechobee in the north, through the Everglades to the bay and the reefs. A Federal-state effort to do just that is under way.
But some scientists think this could actually worsen the bay's plight, and there begins a bitter argument.
One camp, whose views have been dominant, holds that when the bay was deprived of fresh water it became too salty, and that this hypersalinity is at the heart of the bay's decline.
A dissident camp argues that pouring more water from the Everglades into the bay will only hasten the decline. The reason, say these scientists, is that agricultural runoff is already injecting so much nitrogen into the Everglades water that this powerful nutrient is stimulating algae blooms in large expanses of the bay. More fresh water would only pour in more nutrients, according to this view, causing the bay to choke faster.
A third view says that at this stage, it is all an ecological mystery; that not enough is known about the bay's immensely complex blend of natural and man-made forces to be sure just what is going on. "We're working on hunches and guesses," said Dr. John C. Ogden, director of the Florida Institute of Oceanography in St. Petersburg.
The effort to restore natural water flows to the Everglades over the next 10 to 20 years, which is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, involves an extensive re-plumbing of the intricate network of canals, pumps and portals that have sucked water out of the great marsh. The main focus of the plan has been the Everglades themselves, and Florida Bay for a time suffered as a sort of ignored stepchild. But that has changed, and an intense scientific effort is being made to understand how the bay will be affected.
Everything is complicated by the fact that no one is certain what the condition of the bay was before humans altered the South Florida ecosystem in the 20th century. In the 19th century, naturalists reported clear tropical blue waters dotted by white sand keys, or small islands. But many scientists think that historically, the bay functioned more like a classic estuary, a marine-freshwater hybrid periodically made cloudier and richer in algae-producing nutrients by increased flows of Everglades water in rainy periods and by the disruptive action of hurricanes. Still others say that the bay has displayed both faces alternately over the long term.
Two relatively recent developments, many scientists say, combined to convert the bay from an estuary of varying salinity and cloudiness to a more sheltered, saltier and generally clear "marine lagoon": the diminished flow of Everglades water and the filling in of parts of the Keys to accommodate first a railroad early in this century and then, later, the keys highway, which partly blocked the natural flushing movement of water between the bay and the ocean.
With no hurricanes disturbing the bay for more than three decades (Hurricane Andrew in 1992 passed too far north and went by too fast), it entered a stable phase characterized by especially thick stands of turtle grass and the clear water prized by so many people.
In this condition, as before, the bay remained one of the country's most important fish nurseries, abounding in shrimp, lobsters, stone crabs, seahorses, sponges and fish like spotted sea trout, pompano, snook, permit, black drum and the bonefish and tarpon so desired by anglers -- at least 64 fish species in all.
But according to one camp in the Florida Bay argument, the ecosystem was poised for disaster. And when the summers of 1987 through 1990 brought successive droughts and abnormal heat, even less fresh water flowed to the bay, creating super-salty conditions. The stress created by the combination of hypersalinity and high temperatures, says this hypothesis, made the turtle grass more susceptible to disease, which may have touched off its decline. In any case, it began dying by the tens of thousands of acres. As the grass decayed, in this view, it provided nutrients like nitrogen that sparked the algae blooms. Large, bushlike algae smothered the remaining turtle grass and killed sponges and corals, while microscopic algae turned the water to pea soup, cutting off sunlight essential to the grass and making more of it die.
As partial support for the hypersalinity-and-drought hypothesis, some scientists cite improvement in the situation over the last two years, brought about by heavy rains that poured more Everglades water than usual into the bay. Salinity has dropped to acceptable levels and not as much sea grass is dying, said Dr. Ron Jones, director of the Southeast Environmental Research Program at Florida International University. In the eastern bay, chlorophyll levels, a measure of algae growth, also appear to have declined. This shows that "the bay's biggest problem is lack of fresh water," Dr. Jones said. But, he said, "you've got to be sure that when you fix it, you do it with clean water."
And there, say the dissidents, is the rub. The chief dissenter, Dr. Brian E. LaPointe, a marine biologist at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution at Fort Pierce, Fla., argues that in the western part of the bay, conditions are getting worse, not better. This shows that "salinity was not the problem," he said. Rather, he contends, it is excess nutrients -- specifically, nitrogen -- being washed into the bay with fresh water from the Everglades. These nutrients, he said, have produced the big, bushlike algae growths and the microscopic pea-soup algae. Moreover, he said, the nitrogen level is so high that it is probably toxic to the grass.
Dr. LaPointe argues that it is a classic case of eutrophication: the gradual choking of an aquatic ecosystem by too many nutrients. Eutrophication is widely considered a major threat to coastal waters around the world, which get vast amounts of nutrients washed off farmland and carried offshore by rivers and streams. The western bay, Dr. LaPointe said, has already become "hypereutrophic," signaling the final phase of eutrophication. In areas of maximum algae bloom, he said, the bay is "like a sewer pond."
The ultimate sources of the killing nutrients, he contends, are the extensive farms at the head of the Everglades. When land is drained for agriculture, that enables bacteria to release nutrients from the soil more efficiently. Dr. LaPointe said these nutrients, along with fertilizer runoff, are carried by a broad, shallow Everglades current called Shark River Slough to the western bay, where currents sweep them first eastward, then south and southwest, through the middle Keys and over the reefs offshore. As more water has poured out of the slough in the recent wet years, he said, nitrogen levels also increased sharply at Looe Key in the lower Keys.
The reefs may also be affected. When there is a big bloom of microscopic algae in the bay, the cloud has been observed from the air to reach out to the main reef tract in the Atlantic, four to six miles offshore. Dr. LaPointe has taken vivid videos of larger algae choking corals on smaller ocean reefs closer to shore.Some studies suggest that the algae have killed parts of coral colonies in the middle Keys.
But other experts contend that nutrients from the bay are not a major problem for the main reefs; that natural sources of nutrients from the deep ocean, treated sewage from the Keys and a decimation of fish species that normally clean the reefs of algae are more likely culprits. Like reefs throughout the Caribbean, those off the Keys have been hit in recent years by a number of troubles, including algae growth, disease, bleaching and death of corals.
This includes the reefs off the upper Keys, near Key Largo, where flocks of flying fish flit about a profusion of divers' boats. This section of reef is protected from the bay's waters by currents and land barriers; whatever is causing the problem there, it is apparently not nutrients from the bay. Still, perhaps half the reef tract is theoretically open to pollution from the bay.
Dr. Jones and others dispute the eutrophication hypothesis, saying that nitrogen in agricultural runoff north of the Everglades is absorbed by vegetation and algae as it passes through the big marsh. Few if any nutrients even get into the bay, Dr. Jones said, "not unlesss they figured out how to jump 70 kilometers and fly down to the bay."
On the contrary, said Dr. LaPointe, the Everglades' chemical profile, which includes a shortage of phosphorus, limits the ecosystem's ability to take up nitrogen that he says flows into the bay in the form of ammonium, a potent stimulator of algae.
For now, the role of agriculture as a generator of nutrients harmful to Florida Bay is widely considered an open question. But an independent panel of scientists set up by the Government to review the science of the bay has not dismissed Dr. LaPointe's hypothesis, said Dr. Donald F. Boesch of the University of Maryland at Cambridge, the panel's leader. For one thing, he said, it is clear that turtle grass is continuing to die in areas not stressed by high salinity. Then there are those persistent algal blooms in the western bay. Even Dr. Jones said he found their presence unexpected and surprising.
The eastern bay does not appear vulnerable to Everglades runoff, the panel found, because water there does not contain enough phosphorus, and algae need both nitrogen and phosphorus to bloom. Nor does the Everglades water draining into the eastern bay through a channel called Taylor Slough contain enough phosphorus. By contrast, said Dr. Boesch, the western bay has plenty, and added nitrogen would spur algal growth there.
In the end, Dr. Boesch said, "both of those feuding factions may be in part correct," depending on what part of the bay one is talking about. But just now, he said, "no one knows exactly what's going on."
Most experts are confident that restoring the flow of fresh water on something approaching a natural schedule will set the bay on a course toward some version of its earlier self, said Dr. Steven Miller, a marine biologist with the National Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. "But as we re-engineer the system again," he said, "we need to be careful we don't make it worse."
What if it turns out that increased flow of fresh water does indeed speed the bay's eutrophication, as Dr. LaPointe argues? The answer is to be flexible enough to adjust course if and when that becomes clear, said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, an ardent advocate of the restoration project. "To the extent there's a problem," he said, "I think we can adapt to it as we go along; not only can, but must."
Assuming the bay does eventually get better, some scientists say, new health may not look like what many people consider the old health to be. As the bay regains its estuarine character, they say, the water may be cloudier. Episodes of blooming algae may continue. In the short term, "it might not be as pleasant as we might like," said Billy Causey, the superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. For that matter, said Dr. Jones, "I can't tell you with certainty that what we have out in Florida Bay right now isn't exactly what it should be."
In the long run, Mr. Babbitt said, restoring fresh water flow "is surely going to have a positive effect," while on the other hand, "you risk collapsing the ecosystem if you shut off that flow and leave it."

Florida Bay was formerly clear and thick with turtle grass, far left, but blooms of microscopic algae have made parts of it opaque, like pea soup, left. Larger algae, called macroalgae, crowded out grass, much of which died. Fish like tarpon and bonefish left. Scientists say a reduced flow of water from the Everglades is the root of the change, but disagree on whether the immediate cause is high salinity or agricultural runoff carried into the bay through Shark River Slough, right.

HEADLINE: A Battered Museum With Lots of Art and No Place to Go

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
The trustees of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco have moved a step closer to resolving a major embarrassment to the city: the earthquake-damaged M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, which sits in Golden Gate Park trussed in steel-and-concrete structural supports.
At a time when San Franciscans are reveling in their cultural renaissance -- a new modern art museum, a new library, a new historical museum, to name a few points of pride -- they have dithered over rebuilding the city's oldest public museum, which was given a "highest hazard" rating after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. A majority of voters want the de Young to remain in its peaceful setting amid Golden Gate Park's eucalyptus and cypress trees, but in November a vocal minority who object to the traffic it draws into the park blocked a $73 million bond issue to rebuild the museum there. 
 On Thursday, the trustees narrowed their search for a new location. They selected three sites outside the park and also kept the current setting in the running, in recognition that the bond measure had failed only because it required a two-thirds majority. Although some residents feared that an accompanying underground parking garage would add to pollution and congestion in the park, more than 62 percent of the voters approved the bond issue.
"It is an exasperating situation," the museum's director, Harry S. Parker 3d, said. Already, Mr. Parker has had to shift one exhibition -- a huge cache of art to be lent next year by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London -- from the de Young to the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, which he also heads.
In addition to the current site, plans for which would no longer include a parking garage, the sites selected for further investigation are the home of the disused Transbay Terminal at First and Mission Streets and two lots along the waterfront that once held ramps for the Embarcadero Freeway. That double-deck freeway, seriously cracked in the 1989 quake, was demolished in 1991.
But the de Young's ordeal is far from over. A new museum will cost at least $100 million. Wherever it is built, public money will be needed. Because money-raising measures are unpopular, said Deborah Frieden, the museum's project manager, "it's extremely difficult to get the required two-thirds if there's any opposition whatsoever."
At recent public forums, many San Franciscans argued that the de Young should remain in the park. "People are so attached to the Golden Gate Park location that the idea of a bond issue to move the museum out of the park is quite daunting," said Mr. Parker. "We can't get a bond issue to stay or to go. We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't."
Even without a parking garage, the de Young faces a questionable future in Golden Gate Park. The main access road, already closed on Sundays, would also be off-limits on Saturdays -- and possibly during the week -- under a master plan the parks department is considering. But most museum visitors come on weekends.
Because that restriction would limit access, some members of the city's art world now support a move. "They need to have their own identity, and remove themselves from Golden Gate Park to allow more access and to have a new structure," said John Berggruen, a leading San Francisco art dealer. "If they took that bold step, and built something wonderful, the community and the world would rise to the occasion and they'd get the patronage they deserve."
Mayor Willie Brown, who will play an important role in the de Young's future, has also come to that conclusion. He is in China and could not be reached. A spokesman for the Mayor, T. J. Johnston, said, "Mayor Brown has emotional ties to the de Young in Golden Gate park, but he does not want to see more cars in the park."
Mr. Johnston said the Mayor, like museum trustees, was leaning toward the Transbay Terminal site, which in contrast to the city-owned Embarcadero sites is owned by the state. The Mayor has said he could purchase property rights for a nominal fee, the spokesman added.
Although San Francisco's Academy of Sciences has also been eyeing the Transbay Terminal plot, the site does have a certain logic for the de Young. It is two blocks from the new San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and near the new historical museum in Yerba Buena Gardens. The Terminal lot is larger than the alternatives on the Embarcadero, though it is smaller than the de Young's park site. But a museum built there could be taller and extend deeper into the ground than one in the park.
Trustees are hoping to make their final selection as early as June, then put a new bond issue on the ballot next year.
But there is no guarantee that San Franciscans will unite behind their choice. Even though another big quake could damage the current de Young building, home to the most comprehensive collection of American paintings on the West Coast, a new museum could be years away.
"I just wish they'd get going," said Mr. Berggruen, "because they have an opportunity to build a grand museum in a way that would bring in more collections and more exhibitions."

HEADLINE: A European Takeover Conspiracy Theory

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER 

 BODY:
Conspiracy theory is in vogue right now, so let's pretend for a moment that the Italians, French and Germans wanted to take over American fashion. They plot their mission over dinner with French wine, Italian pasta and German organization. Phase 1 they plan cautiously: the opening of boutiques all along Madison Avenue with great fanfare that almost overwhelms the New York shows in the fall of 1996.
Phase 2 must be much more subtle. What if each of them buys a piece of the most promising talent in American fashion? What if someday New York fashion isn't New York fashion at all, but the generation following Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein all belong to the greater Europa? The table erupts with Machiavellian laughter, and they all begin to salute one another with a chummy satire of the American way, high-fiving one another with glee. 
 There might not be a conspiracy, but certainly the most energetic shows of this season can be traced back to European dollars. Isaac Mizrahi has money from Chanel's Wertheimer family; Anna Sui's Sui collection is financed by the Italian company Gilmar; Marc Jacobs is now part of the LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton family; Richard Tyler got an infusion from Donatella Girombelli, who hired him to design Byblos, and John Bartlett has backing from Ms. Girombelli as well. Todd Oldham, a consultant to Escada of Germany, placed its chairman, Wolfgang Ley, in the front row of his show this week, a gesture suggesting the importance of those fees in the livelihood of his house.
It's noteworthy that the American sportswear powerhouse Anne Klein at one time tried the European approach by putting Mr. Tyler and then Patrick Robinson at the design helm. The house never managed to get the formula right. Mr. Tyler proved with Byblos in Italy that he was perfectly capable of producing the sort of stuff that would have set Anne Klein's business on fire. And Mr. Robinson did the same last week with his first collection under his own name.
The fashion industry has changed a great deal from the days when Mr. Lauren, Mr. Klein and Ms. Karan got their businesses up and running. If those companies have become like the big film studios in Hollywood, with more real estate, clout and name recognition, certainly the younger generation here resembles the independents who carried away the Academy Awards this round.
The new rules of the fashion game have made it virtually impossible for young designers to break through as designers could even 10 years ago. So credit the next tier of designers for inventing new games to play.
Mr. Jacobs, for instance, has the sort of staying power that psychopaths in slasher flicks might envy. Don't leave the chain saw next to him; he isn't gone yet, Jamie Lee! Don't turn your back on him; he's coming back for more!
The stamina and fortitude that have kept Mr. Jacobs going are so quintessentially American that it would be unpatriotic not to wish that a hearty, flush company here, not in France, might have backed him.
But one of the many factors disassembling the fashion show system is that the pedigrees of fashion houses are as complex as those of many of the designers who create for them. In Europe an American is designing Gucci; a German, Chanel, and two Englishmen are designing for Christian Dior and Givenchy. Stella McCartney, the most English of the English designers, will now design for the French label Chloe (owned, through the Vendome Group, by Financiere Richemont of South Africa), taking over from a German, Karl Lagerfeld. And it is the Italians, Germans and French who have given the infusion of capital to a new generation of American houses primed to become household names.
It brings to mind the speech everyone kept giving at the Academy Awards about "The English Patient," how the cinematographer was from here, the actors from there, but it all came together in this heart-wrenching . . . well, you know the drill. That is the sensibility that overwhelmingly dominates fashion today, too. Just as movies need to appeal to audiences overseas to make up the budget, fashion has to appeal to people everywhere. So what fashion looks like today is often without provenance, or with roots so complex that they cannot be categorized.
Power in fashion perpetuates itself, because advertising assures editorial coverage no matter how uninteresting a designer's collection may be.
So the influx of money to the less-established Seventh Avenue houses -- which might eventually lead to the big licenses like perfumes and underwear that make designers more money and give them more clout -- will certainly alter economies of fashion that have long been in place.
But other equalizers are also in play today.
Television, for example: Few designers spend money on commercials, and television has allowed the programs that cover fashion to be wonderfully even-handed and adventurous in the runway events they feature and the designers they profile.
Then there are talent and creativity. With little advertising and few licenses, Helmut Lang and Ann Demeulemeester have wrought havoc on the fashion ecosystem by creating such strong signatures that more commercially successful designers seem powerless to resist them.
Those signatures are the promise of the rising tier of designers as well. None of the designers backed by the Europeans have been copied wholesale elsewhere yet; being copied by other designers is a symbol of the commercial strength of a signature. The only designer whose influence has extended to shows overseas is Ms. Sui, when her punky baby doll dress look was all over Italian runways four years ago.
Yet, what set the shows of these Euro-juiced designers apart was that their heads hadn't been turned by Mr. Lang and Ms. Demeulemeester. Their clothes are distinctively their own. They aren't part of the bland commercialism that success often brings. They didn't fall victim to the sorts of trends that, in the end, victimize their customer. Their strength was in their resistance to the tricks that have defined the previous generation here and in Europe.
There couldn't be a more telling sign of a new order in fashion than Women's Wear Daily on Monday, which put the young designer Daryl Kerrigan on its cover rather than clothes from Donna Karan or Calvin Klein, who showed on the same day.
Ms. Kerrigan is a designer of the new order, who from a tiny boutique in the East Village has invented a style, a signature and a business. It won't be long before European industrialists discover her, too.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up as Rubin Signals No Shift in Strong Support

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied late yesterday to a 38-month high against the German mark and rose, though less sharply, against the Japanese yen after remarks by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin sparked a selloff in European currencies.
Mr. Rubin said American support for a strong dollar had not changed, restating his position in the face of the currency's recent gains. But he did not rule out intervention by central banks to support the yen. Traders bought dollars and yen and sold marks, British pounds and French francs on the news. 
 "If you read between lines of what Rubin is saying, he appears to be behind a strong dollar except as it applies to the yen," Tom Hoge, vice president of foreign exchange at the Bank of New York, said. "In a situation like this, you've got more upside room for the dollar versus the mark than the yen."
A modest rally in American stock prices, more signs of economic weakness in Japan and remarks by Japanese officials suggesting that interest rates would remain low also contributed to the dollar's strength.
But trading was relatively light ahead of the Government's report today on the March Consumer Price Index, which investors will read closely for signs of rising inflation.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7300 marks, the strongest since February 1994, after Mr. Rubin spoke in Washington. It settled in New York at 1.7298, up from 1.7201 on Friday. The dollar rose to 126.20 yen from 126.03. The pound cost $1.6210, down from $1.6284.
At his appearance at a news conference to discuss tax-simplification proposals, Mr. Rubin was asked whether he had discussed intervention in the foreign-exchange market with Japanese officials.
Mr. Rubin said United States policy on the dollar remained unchanged, suggesting that he still wanted a strong currency. But he also reiterated his concern over the yen's weakness, which is contributing to a widening trade deficit between the United States and Japan.
He said that concerning the yen, "we will not comment on our intentions with respect to what we may do until after we have done it and will act when it's appropriate and not act when it's not appropriate."

HEADLINE: Return of a Haitian Prodigal;
For a Rap Leader, a Concert Grows Into a State Visit

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 14

 BODY:
The Fugees had some distinguished personnel working on their crew when they performed here on Saturday night. President Rene Preval ran down the catwalk jutting from the stage to the center of the crowd to stop people from hanging onto the scaffolding. His ad hoc intervention was successful, though the 30 machine-gun-toting police officers who accompanied him might have had something to do with it.
As the President tried to show he was a man of the people, the audience's Creole chant of "Get down!," directed at those on the scaffolding, slowly transformed into "Down with the high cost of living!" 
 At one point, the man guarding the entrance to the stage was Raoul Peck, the Minister of Culture, who like most politicians during the week the Fugees spent here seized the public-relations opportunity for Haiti and for himself and associated himself with the band as much as possible.
Why the Fugees? Two of the three members of the best-selling pop and rap group have Haitian roots: Wyclef Jean, known professionally by just his first name, was born here, and and his cousin, Prakazrel Michel, known as Pras, is the son of Haitians who emigrated to the United States.
"It's the return of the diaspora!" some of the band's more optimistic supporters cheered, a reference to the many thousands of Haitians who have left the island for cities like Miami, Montreal and New York, where the Fugees are based. It was also the only concert by a popular American group to take place in Haiti that anyone here could remember and the biggest staged concert the country has ever had, attracting an estimated 75,000 people.
Though the concert was intended to raise money for orphans and Haitian refugees who have been sent home, the more symbolic contribution was the pride it inspired in a country that is weary of being stigmatized as a breeding ground for violence and AIDS and hopeful of increasing awareness of its vibrant music, art and culture.
From the moment they arrived at the airport on Wednesday until their departure yesterday, the Fugees were received like heroes. Fans and a welcoming band mobbed the runway and the airport when the band flew in, racing down the street to catch up with the group's car as it sped off to the hotel with police escorts.
In a society riven by great economic disparities and hostility between haves and have-nots, light-skinned and dark-skinned, it is rare to appeal successfully to the entire population. The trio was enthusiastically welcomed at orphanages, where aspiring musicians greeted the Fugees with versions of their hits "Killing Me Softly" and "Ready or Not." At cocktail parties and at a fund-raising concert at Club Med, the Haitian elite swarmed around them for autographs and photos. At the Presidential Palace, Mr. Preval (with Prime Minister Rosny Smarth at his side) heaped praise on the Fugees as ministers and diplomats looked on. At Lafami Selavi, a home for street children, the founder, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide gave the band a tour, and arranged for the children to interview the group on the center's ramshackle radio station.
"It's good to see what can happen when a band like the Fugees unites us in the middle," Mr. Aristide said. "They are stars among stars. Through them, Haiti can tell the world how it's not just poverty we have here. We are rich from our culture."
When was the last time the Haitian population united like this? "In 1994, when I came back," said Mr. Aristide, exaggerating a bit. (He was restored to office three years after a military coup.)
One reason the Fugees received such an overwhelming welcome was that, unbeknown to his fans everywhere else in the world, Wyclef, the band's leader, has been recording songs in Creole on his own for the last seven months and sending them to Haitian radio stations.
"Certain songs just started coming out of me in Creole," he explained. "So I just recorded them, not to sell but to play to the kids. And every song I sent down here -- six of them -- became No. 1."
 
'Give Haiti A Chance'
At the Bicentenaire plaza on the waterfront, producers knocked down a former discotheque, brought in millions of dollars' worth of concert equipment from Miami, hired scores of local people (for $4 a day, nearly twice the minimum wage) and corraled 500 police officers, many of whom just stood on the side of the stage and enjoyed the unparalleled spectacle. (Before setting off fireworks, Wyclef warned the audience not to be scared.)
Jubilant fans pumped their hands in the air and sang along to the message-strewn Creole hits like "Yele ("Cry Out" ), a beautiful song in any language, and "Ayiti, Un Chans" ("Give Haiti a Chance"). Wyclef's lyrics, which like much of Haitian popular music call for reforms, have already become catch phrases in the street.
In his lyrics, Wyclef pictures himself in a helicopter showering the country with money and warns that if the country does not change, it will "sink like a boatful of refugees." (The band's name is shorthand for refugees.)
The band didn't just play pop, rap and reggae. Much to the audience's excitement, it was able to leap into rasin (roots music) and rara (carnival music.) From his moves to his melodies, Wyclef tried to portray imself as a Haitian Bob Marley in the making.
"This place needs Haitian-Americans with a vision to come back," Theodore (Lola) Beaubrun of Boukman Eksperyans, one of Haiti's most important rasin groups, said backstage. "But the Government doesn't want the educated to return, because people might get ideas, and the Government doesn't like that."
Wyclef, whose grandmother used to work at the rundown market in town, suggested that there was a hint of hypocrisy in his acceptance by Haiti's rich and powerful. "If I wasn't making millions, the President wouldn't have let me in the palace like that," he said. "What I said when I was here was that I'm the kid on the other side of the fence who can't get in here to see the Fugees."
The Fugees' performance on Saturday night was like a bomb that Wyclef kept igniting, defusing and reigniting, only to extinguish it again. He spent at least an hour of the show talking and trying to organize the audience and his crew as his bandmates looked on, bored, and the audience wondered if this was what an American concert was supposed to be like.
Two-thirds into the show, his bandmate Pras left the stage for his hotel, saying, "I got to get out of here." Shortly afterward, the third band member, Lauryn Hill, who is five months pregnant, retreated to a building reserved for V.I.P.'s, leaving Wyclef alone onstage to finish orchestrating his party.
Tickets were priced around $3, which is steep for a country with an unemployment rate of 70 percent. (Some fans actually asked the Fugees for ticket money after getting their autographs.) But as soon as the concert began, fans knocked down a barricade and were streaming in.
 
A Long Wait For the Crowd
Manno Charlemagne, the Mayor of Port-au-Prince, who gave the Fugees the key to the city earlier in the week, opened the show by performing the acoustic protest songs that made his name during the 30-year Duvalier dictatorship. He was followed by short sets by some of Haiti's top bands, including the exuberant rasin group Kanpech and younger ragamuffin reggae and rap bands like King Posse and Original Rap Staff, who were decked out in Hugo Boss clothes.
By the time the Fugees went onstage for a three-hour show, the audience had been standing up (packed tightly in the simmering heat with little water or food or bathroom facilities) for seven hours. During the entire week, Wyclef was a canny showman offstage. In the days before the concer, he could be spotted on the back of a police motorcycle, leading his motorcade through the street, talking the President into trying on his sunglasses and generally seizing every opportunity to deliver inspirational messages to Haitian youth.
For the first 45 minutes of the concert, the band enthusiastically worked the entire audience, even the Haitians crowded onto the docks far behind the stage. (By the end of the show, a section of the docks had collapsed. There were no reports of serious injuried.) The band turned everything from "Ready or Not" to their own rasin song "Main, Fugee Debarke" into anthems of solidarity and positivism.
As if to prove their ability to transcend class divisions, the Fugees performed a carnival song that criticized materialists in the Government, with Boukman Eksperyans, the band that wrote it, and then rapped with Sweet Micky, a singer popular with the bourgeois, who boasted of his solidarity with the materialists. And later, they chipped away at class barriers, with Wyclef Jean standing on stage joining hands with a small black boy on one side and a mulatto boy on the other.
But the Fugees may have tried to savor the moment for too long. All was fine when they told the audience they were filming a video for a new single, "Guantanamera" (with the voice of Celia Cruz on tape), and again when they filmed a thank-you message to MTV for giving them a Viewers' Choice Award.
But they also stopped the show for three different takes of a thank you to Nickelodeon for a another award; performed "Guatanamera" a second time to get the video right, and stopped the music so that both Ms. Hill and Wyclef could capture the scene on hand-held cameras. Wyclef at one point stopped talking to the audience and started giving instructions to camera crews on how to best document the history-making show.
He said his intention was to make Haiti look good to the rest of the world. But the concert wasn't being broadcast outside of Haiti; it was being taped for an hourlong BET show and a possible MTV half-hour special.
In the end, a jubilant chaos stole the show as fans swarmed backstage and onstage and a giant posse of rara musicians leaped into the fray for a jubilant jam. The music kept going when Wyclef left the stage and walked to his bus surrounded by a swirling crowd of rara musicians and fans. In the middle, danceing arm in arm, were Wyclef and Mr. Preval, with no machine guns in sight.

Coke Earnings Climb 38.4% in Quarter

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company reported strong first-quarter earnings yesterday, buoyed by the highest growth in its domestic soft drink volume in 11 years.
The company said net income grew to $987 million, or 40 cents a share, up 38.4 percent from $713 million, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The earnings matched analysts' expectations, adjusting for a gain of $198 million, or 8 cents a share, from the sale of Coke's 49 percent stake in its British bottling operations to Coca-Cola Enterprises. 
 Case volume grew 9 percent in the United States, "an extraordinarily strong performance, and more growth than any soft drink company has had here for many a year," said Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst with Paine Webber. The last time volume rose 9 percent was in the first quarter of 1986.
"The company's domestic growth was stronger than Coca-Cola itself expected," Mr. Goldman said, adding that the number was difficult to attain since domestic volume grew 8 percent in the comparable quarter last year, making for a difficult comparison.
Still, revenue declined 2 percent, to $4.14 billion from $4.22 billion in the quarter, the company said, reflecting the effect of a stronger United States dollar as well as the sale of European bottling operations.
"On a normalized basis, revenues would have been up 10 to 11 percent," said Andrew J. Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley.
Wall Street seemed to approve, as Coca-Cola shares rose $1.875, to $55.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Contributing to the domestic volume gains were strong performances by the company's Sprite, Surge, Nestea and Powerade brands. Fruitopia beverages also showed gains during the quarter, in contrast to the sluggish performance of Snapple at the Quaker Oats Company.
Mr. Goldman of Paine Webber said the strong results also reflected double-digit growth from distribution at convenience stores and gas stations, in comparison with single-digit growth at supermarkets. "Coke is getting stronger and stronger in the so-called cold-drink channel," he said.
In the first quarter, Coca-Cola continued to market its products aggressively in the United States, including the test-marketing of both the countour Coke can and the embossed Sprite can in selected markets.
In a domestic disappointment, however, Coca-Cola's Minute Maid division suffered a 7 percent decline in case volume, coming after a 9 percent increase in the corresponding quarter last year.
Over all, the strong domestic results "demonstrate again that our United States business is far from being a mature market for soft drinks," Roberto C. Goizueta, Coke's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "In fact, it is capable of dramatic growth."
Mr. Goldman calculated that outside North America, Coke's case volumes were between 9 and 9.5 percent, stronger than originally expected.
And internationally, gallon shipments of soda concentrates and syrups increased 7 percent, exceeding the company's own volume estimates.
"Globally, Coke is stepping up its marketing very aggressively as Pepsi is rebalancing and refocusing," Mr. Conway of Morgan Stanley said. "Coke's global business is like a bulldozer in full motion."
In Europe, case volume was up 18 percent in Spain and 15 percent in Italy during the first quarter, while volume declined 2 percent in Germany, Coke's largest European market, as a result of the slowdown in the country's economy.
But volume increased 26 percent in Eastern Europe and 15 percent in the Middle East.
In Latin America, Coca-Cola enjoyed a volume gain in Mexico of 7 percent and 8 percent in Argentina. And a strong showing in Venezuela followed Coke's coup last summer, when it induced Pepsico Inc.'s successful bottler there to defect to Coca-Cola; Mr. Goldman said that Venezuela accounted for about 2 percent of the 9 percent volume increase in Latin America.
But volume was down 1 percent in Brazil, as a result of the loss of purchasing power among Brazilian consumers.
Although volume increase in China was a disappointment -- 19 percent in the first quarter, instead of 41 percent in the comparable quarter last year -- volume in Japan was up a respectable 6 percent, "on top of 8 percent a year ago," Mr. Conway said. "The Japanese market is important for Coke in terms of profitability."

Bonds Lower In Advance Of Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With investors defensive in fear of a strong consumer price number, Treasury securities were flat yesterday, with prices caught in a tight range in thin volume.
The surprising gain in the core Producer Price Index last week, which offered the first real peek of inflation, gave rise to fears that today's Consumer Price Index would provide similar evidence that the economy is too strong. 
 The 30-year bond's price slipped 2/32, to 93 12/32, pushing its yield up a notch to 7.17 percent, from 7.16 percent on Friday.
Analysts said negativity was entrenched, as investors wondered whether the Fed might remain in a tightening cycle longer than had been originally thought.
Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest in Minneapolis, said the quarter-point rise in the Federal funds rate on March 25 might not be enough to cool the economy. "But another move at the May 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting is not a fait accompli," he said. "There are plenty of economic statistics to watch between now and then."
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com in Menlo Park, Calif., said, "The long bond is now within close range of the 1996 high yield of of 7.24 percent." He added, "Though few in the market would be surprised by a test of this level, an 8 percent bond yield is another story."
Still, he continued, "an 8 percent bond yield is not as farfetched as some believe."
He said, "It took less than two months for the long bond to travel 67 basis points, from 6.50 percent to 7.17 percent. Another 67 would put us within striking distance of 8 percent, at 7.84 percent."
Mr. Jones added that the market tended to underestimate the extent of Fed policy moves and "the movement in bond yields during any given market cycle."
The Atlanta Fed's regional manufacturing index, which was released yesterday, rose to 10.3 in March from 7.0 in February. While employment increased, prices fell.
But the report had little market impact because investors are more focused on the C.P.I., which could set the tone of the market through April.
"Expectations for tomorrow's Consumer Price Index are for a 0.3 percent in the overall number and core rate," Jack Ablin of the Private Bank at Bank of Boston said. "To me, that's kind of aggressive because it translates to a 3.6 percent annualized inflation rate."
He added: "The bond market has been no picnic. However. our target for the long bond is for a 7.25 percent yield, and we would go from a neutral position to a buy at that level."
That assumes the Fed will raise rates again in May and that two tightenings are all the economy needs, he said.
"Relative to the stock market's projections, bills and notes are beginning to look more attractive," Mr. Ablin added, noting that may have accounted for the slightly better-than-expected bill auction yesterday.
The average rate at auction for a three-month bill was 5.15 percent, up from 5.14 percent last week, while the rate for a six-month issue was 5.42 percent, up from 5.30 percent.
"The very quiet market on Monday tells you that both dealers and investors are comfortable with their positions as we head into Tuesday's C.P.I. data," Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said yesterday.
"And those positions appear to be short," he added. "In general, nothing has changed; this remains a bear market. Dealers are willing sellers, and with each piece of information that makes the prospect of a Fed tightening more certain, sellers grow more bold. That means even constructive data now merely offers an opportunity for bears to sell. Quality buyers tend to ignore volatile days as Tuesday could be, leaving only the speculative parties to play."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Philippine Corruption Started Before Marcos

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your April 13 Week in Review article "Marcos Died, but It Didn't Last" describes corruption in the Philippines as a legacy of the Marcos years. But corruption was pervasive long before Ferdinand Marcos rose to power. It was the product of centuries of foreign domination that undermined governmental legitimacy, of intense regionalism that weakened identification with national interests, and of a plantation economy that yielded a self-serving elite. 
 Mr. Marcos embodied these sources of corruption and he exploited them brilliantly, but he was their creation and not their creator.
Similarly, the argument over what to do with his body is a symbolic expression of longstanding divisions in the body politic. This debate most clearly reflects regional rivalries, since Mr. Marcos's fellow Ilocanos advocate a hero's burial as a matter of tribal pride.
However, it also mirrors class tensions, since middle-class urban intellectuals and some sections of the traditional ruling class tend to demonize the late dictator, while the Marcos legend survives among many of the poor.
If burying Mr. Marcos is difficult, it is because the complicated heritage that gave birth to him is still alive. Of course, having his widow, Imelda, around doesn't make it any easier.

G.M. Quarterly Profit Soars, Eclipsing All Forecasts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 14

 BODY:
Exceeding even the most optimistic predictions of Wall Street analysts, the General Motors Corporation said today that its earnings more than doubled in the first quarter as the troubled North American division reported its strongest profit in a decade.
The auto company and securities analysts attributed the gain in profitability to G.M.'s introduction of new models in North America that are less expensive to manufacture, together with broad savings in parts purchases and more efficient factories. Profit rose despite a decline in the exchange value of the yen, which made it easier for Japanese auto makers to offer low prices and forced G.M. to counter with deep discounts on many models. 
 "The core profitability of the operations was strong in a hostile environment," said Scott F. Merlis, an independent auto analyst in Westport, Conn.
G.M. had net income of $1.72 billion, or $2.30 a share, compared with $714 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $42.26 billion, from $39.24 billion a year ago.
The consensus of financial analysts had been that G.M. would earn $2.09 a share, and the highest estimate had been $2.20, according to First Call, a Boston company that tracks earnings forecasts.
G.M.'s North American auto assembly operations produced net income of $764 million in the first quarter, compared with a $279 million loss a year earlier. Even allowing for the $750 million in after-tax losses the division incurred during a paralyzing strike in March 1996, this year's figure represented a solid improvement.
"I am pleased with the results for the quarter," said J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer. "It was good performance in general and particularly good performance here in North America."
Yet the auto company, Detroit's largest, has not put its labor problems behind it. While G.M. concluded a three-year national labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union last autumn, it has had trouble reaching individual agreements at factories.
In March, a strike at a pickup truck factory in Fort Wayne, Ind., reduced first-quarter income by about $40 million, although most of that can be made up by extra production the rest of the year, Mr. Losh said. Workers at an assembly plant in Oklahoma City have been on strike for the last eight days, slowing the introduction of a new Chevrolet Malibu, a car for which G.M. has planned an elaborate advertising campaign.
But of the 15 new models that G.M. has been gradually introducing, many have sold very well once the factories have reached full production. Sales of the completely redesigned Pontiac Grand Prix were up 88 percent in March from a year earlier. The new models have fewer parts and are intended to be easier to assemble than the models they replace, presumably reducing labor costs.
Because G.M. has completed most of the costly retooling of its factories for the new models and increased production, it was able to operate its factories in the United States and Canada at an unusually high 95.3 percent of capacity in the first quarter. "Whenever you get an operating rate over 95 percent in a manufacturing facility, you're going to mint some money," Mr. Merlis said.
Yet the new models are entering an extremely competitive market, as Japanese producers have used the weak yen to hold their prices level while American auto makers have continued raising prices at or slightly above the inflation rate. Partly as a result, G.M.'s average rebate and other buying incentives rose to $860 a vehicle from $598 a year earlier.
Mr. Losh said that he thought the higher incentives would continue at roughly the same levels this quarter.
G.M.'s auto parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems, reported net income of $180 million in the first quarter, even after taking a one-time charge of $50 million for factory-closing expenses. By comparison, the division earned $79 million in the first quarter of 1996, when it had $120 million in strike-related losses.
First-quarter profit in international operations declined to $317 million, from $432 million a year earlier, because of a deteriorating European market. With most auto makers there struggling with overcapacity and cutthroat pricing, G.M.'s average retail incentives for each vehicle climbed to $622 from $443.
The drop in first-quarter international profit would have been even sharper if the international operations had not posted a one-time after-tax gain of $55 million from payments by Volkswagen to settle a lawsuit relating to its hiring of G.M.'s former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
G.M.'s car loan and lease division, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, reported a rise in earnings to $372 million, from $309 million a year earlier. While some capital gains were included in the higher profit, there is also some evidence that credit losses may have reached a peak in the fourth quarter of 1996 and are now falling, Mr. Losh said.
Another G.M. division, the Hughes Electronics Corporation, reported first-quarter earnings of $235 million, down from $312 million the year before. The 1996 quarter earnings, however, included $30 million in strike-related losses and a one-time gain of $72 million from the sale of a 2.5 percent stake in its satellite-to-home broadcast business. G.M. has agreed to sell Hughes's military businesses to Raytheon.
G.M.'s results in the first quarter of last year included $219 million in after-tax profit from businesses that have since been spun off or otherwise discontinued, notably Electronic Data Systems, which was spun off last summer.

HEADLINE: Foreign Monsters, False Alarms

BYLINE: By Walter A. McDougall; Walter A. McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, is the author of "Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter With the World Since 1776."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
"America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy," said John Quincy Adams in 1821, and Americans have tended to obey that dictum. They declared war on Britain in 1812 only after 15 years of grievances, on Mexico in 1846 after a decade of strife over Texas, and on Spain in 1898 after years of slaughter in Cuba. They were late entrants in both world wars and reluctant cold warriors. Perhaps the United States should have identified some of its foes as "monsters" much sooner. But that is not the American style.
So why are so many people now eager to brand China an arch-enemy? Do they see the People's Republic as the reincarnation of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia? Are they hoping to advance their careers, score points against President Clinton, unite fractious Republicans, boost military spending, promote protectionism? Or are they just "shocked" that Democrats took illegal donations? 
 Americans have always hated it when foreign powers appear to meddle in their politics. Grover Cleveland made tariff reduction a centerpiece of his 1888 re-election campaign. But because Britain was the champion of free trade, it was the specter of foreign influence, not economics, that made tariffs a "wedge" issue. "Cleveland Runs Well in England" ran the Republican slogan, and a flier (falsely) quoted The Times of London to the effect that "the only time England can use an Irishman is when he emigrates to America and votes for free trade."
But the attacks did not hit home until The Los Angeles Times got hold of a letter written by the British Ambassador, Sir Lionel Sackville-West, indicating that Cleveland was preferable to Benjamin Harrison. Cleveland demanded that Sackville-West be recalled to London, but the President's campaign was doomed.
In Federalist No. 3 John Jay warned that factionalism would expose the United States to "foreign arms and influence," and the 1790's brought ample evidence of that danger. Citizen Genet, the first representative of the French Revolution to America, seeded the states with French money, Secretary of State Edmund Randolph allegedly funneled foreign dollars to the Whiskey Rebellion, and Jeffersonians accused Federalists (notably Jay) of being flacks for British plutocrats. No wonder George Washington condemned "permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others" lest America become "in some degree a slave."
Indeed, American exceptionalism in foreign policy lies less in utopian dreams of a new diplomacy than in a fierce commitment to sovereign freedom from foreign corruption. The trouble is, this longing for political purity is itself utopian. Ever since Herod Agrippa took up residence in imperial Rome to lobby on behalf of his fellow Jews, governments have tried to nudge the domestic politics, and hence the foreign policies, of others.
Louis XIV's gold tinkled in every chancery in Europe, and subsidies to foreign rulers were the weapon of first resort for British intelligence. French money underwrote the American Revolution, and czarist bribes greased the Russian transfer of Alaska through Congress. Before World War I, France, Germany and Russia conspicuously subsidized newspapers in each other's capitals. In imperial China it was customary for treaties to be lubricated with bribes to insure that all relevant officials had a stake in their execution.
Pristine Americans largely abstained from meddling in others' affairs until the cold war convinced them that their liberty was under assault by an enemy whose preferred tactic was subversion. Whereupon they put all previous bribesters to shame, beginning in the 1940's with covert aid to anti-Communists in France and Italy and building up to billions in "foreign assistance" to friendly and pliable regimes.
America's munificence made its own politics the target of every lobby on earth. Pro-Israeli, -Arab, -Greek, -Armenian, -Japanese and -Korean political action committees have been regular, legal contributors to our campaigns. Not one but four China lobbies have vied for American support: the Christian missionaries of the 1920's and 30's who took China's side against Japan; the "old China hands" of the 40's whom McCarthyites deemed dupes of Mao; the China lobby of the 50's and 60's, which cold war liberals denounced as a front for Taiwanese Nationalists, and today's "New China Lobby," alleged to be in the pay of Beijing.
But for all the anxiety, no critic has suggested that the American national interest was ever sold for 30 pieces of silver. On the contrary, the putative "pinko" Dean Acheson aggressively waged the cold war in Asia, and the putative reactionary Richard Nixon was the one who went to Beijing.
Don't get me wrong. If officials are found to have compromised American interest for foreign lucre, they should be dealt with as scoundrels were in John Quincy Adams's day: tarred, feathered and run out of town. But the fact remains that the United States and China need each other, not least to defuse Asian time bombs like North Korea. The real danger is less that American foreign policy may be manipulated in the shadow of foreign donations than that it will be radically altered in the glare of xenophobic hysteria.
The premise of the China-threat lobby is this: What if China continues its explosive growth, does not crack up like the Soviet Union, waxes nationalistic, remains under the thumb of authoritarian leaders and strives for Asian military hegemony even as the United States grows weak and retreats from the Western Pacific? Won't we be sorry then that we kowtowed to Beijing back in the 1990's?
But the odds of all these what-if's coming to pass are exceedingly long. And even if we decide that today's paper dragon will soon breathe fire, what would the China-threat lobby have us do? Forge a ring of containing alliances?
Not likely, because unless China goes on the warpath, declaration of another cold war would be the surest way of scaring our Asian friends into the arms of Beijing. Would we beef up our own military? That, too, is unlikely, since we have lost our Philippine bases, promised a lower profile in Japan and may soon lose our justification to remain in Korea.
So the only containment policy available is a trade and technology embargo of the sort imposed on the former Soviet Union. But that weapon, while sharp, would wound our own companies and those of our allies that have huge investments in China. By some estimates, only a quarter of every dollar "made in China" stays there in the form of wages and taxes. The rest flows abroad as payment for management and materials or as profits for foreign investors.
Again, don't get me wrong. If China starts grinding its neighbors or vital United States interests underfoot, it will deserve the treatment Americans have historically afforded monsters. But we should not forget that our traditional wisdom is based on refusing to cry before we are hurt, going the extra mile to insure (should conflict come) that there is no doubt about whom is to blame, and letting the enemy take the first shot. Only from such wisdom can we derive a frank, constructive policy toward China that will serve and survive the Clinton Administration.

HEADLINE: State Regulators Seek to Bar Criticism of Con Ed Accord

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 14

 BODY:
State regulators, eager to win quick approval for a major restructuring of Consolidated Edison, are trying to keep much of the criticism raised by environmental, consumer and some business groups from being aired in a series of hearings that could decide the energy accord's fate.
Dozens of organizations, government agencies, corporations and others have filed written expert testimony for an upcoming "trial" on the proposed accord before an administrative judge at the Public Service Commission. The judge's decision, scheduled for June, will go to the commission, and in such cases it usually forms the basis for the commission's decision, which is final unless the Legislature and the Governor step into the process. 
 But on Friday, the commission staff filed a motion asking the judge to strike from the record some or all of the testimony of the agreement's leading critics, including consumer and environmental groups, a coalition of retail stores and several of Con Edison's potential out-of-state competitors and even the state's own Consumer Protection Board.
Con Edison and the industrial power customers that stand to gain from the agreement filed similar motions.
While it is not unusual for the commission staff to weed out testimony it deems irrelevant, consumer groups said they had never seen such a wholesale attack on dissenting points of view.
The judge, Judith A. Lee, is expected to rule on the motions Wednesday. Her decision can be appealed to the commission.
The proposed agreement, between Con Edison and the staff of the commission, would break the state's largest utility into three separate companies, let power suppliers begin to compete for customers the way long-distance telephone companies do and grant much larger rate reductions to big businesses than to residential users.
Con Edison, serving New York City and most of Westchester County, is by far the largest of the state's seven regional electric monopolies, and Pataki administration officials, who have called competition the key to lower rates, say the agreement will set the pattern for the restructuring of the state's entire power industry.
"Trying to shut consumer and environmental groups out of something this important is an amazing level of obnoxiousness and over-reaching by the P.S.C.," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer group. "It's an attempt to eliminate dissent from a process that already resembles a kangaroo court."
The commission staff motion objected to the expert witnesses' comments, characterizing them as "generic testimony lacking any nexus to settlement" or as properly dealt with in other cases before the commission.
But opponents of the Con Edison deal dismiss that as a bald attempt to stifle criticism, and argue that if they waited for the other cases to be resolved, the Con Edison pact, clearly on the fast track, would already be decided.
David Flanagan, a commission spokesman, declined to address the matter, saying that the motion spoke for itself. He also argued that the actions of the staff did not represent those of the commission members. But many people involved in the dispute, including some commission officials, say that John F. O'Mara, the commission chairman appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, has closely directed the staff's actions, and is the primary architect of the Con Edison deal.
Of Mr. O'Mara, Mr. Flanagan said, "He is not part of the proceeding at this point." The proposed agreement, announced last month, has come under attack from a number of directions. Environmentalists protest its near-elimination of mandated conservation programs. And they, along with the state's small independent power producers, say that competition among electric companies could encourage use of cheaper, dirtier methods of generation, like burning coal, at the expense of cleaner gas-fired or hydroelectric power, the mainstay of the independents.
Consumer groups and small and medium-sized businesses objected to a provision that gives a 25 percent rate reduction over five years to large manufacturers, 10 percent to other large commercial users and 3.3 percent to residences and smaller businesses.
Large business groups, out-of-state power companies that want to enter the New York market, the state Consumer Protection Board and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco all contested the agreement because it does not do more to open the state to active competition among suppliers.
The commission staff's motion would hit environmentalists particularly hard. A coalition of 18 environmental and allied groups -- including the Natural Resources Defense Council, New York Public Interest Research Group, Environmental Advocates and the American Lung Association -- submitted testimony from three experts; the commission staff asked to strike the testimony of two of them entirely.
"They've got an agenda in mind, and they're going to roll right over anything that gets in the way of their end result," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the defense council, one of the experts whose testimony was contested.
The commission staff also proposed to eliminate the entire testimony of experts for the Retail Council, an alliance of stores, and Wepco, a power company seeking to enter the New York market. And it would strike chunks of testimony from the American Association for Retired Persons; the New York Energy Buyers Forum, a coalition of universities and hospitals, independent power producers and Enron, another out-of-state energy company.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Tweak China Over Hong Kong

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
In a move that will undoubtedly irritate China, President Clinton has decided to meet this week with Martin Lee, a Hong Kong democracy leader.
The White House announced the meeting today after widespread criticism of Vice President Al Gore's decision not to visit Hong Kong and after Mr. Lee was warmly received on Capitol Hill. 
 "There is a perception out there that we have not been firm enough in reacting to China's recent moves on Hong Kong," a senior Administration official said. "Clinton seeing Lee will help dispel that."
Another official said, "The meeting is the message: what happens in Hong Kong matters to Sino-American relations."
A forceful lawyer who leads the largest political party in Hong Kong, Mr. Lee has been pressing for support in his efforts to preserve basic political and personal liberties once the British Crown colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.
China's choice to be Chief Executive of Hong Kong after it takes control, Tung Chee-hwa, is coming to Washington next month and would expect to meet Mr. Clinton as the British Governor, Chris Patten, has in the past. Meeting Mr. Lee now will make it easier for Mr. Clinton to meet Mr. Tung later, an official said.
After he met in April 1996 with Bob Dole, then the front-running Republican Presidential candidate, Mr. Lee was granted a session with Anthony Lake, then Mr. Clinton's national security adviser. Mr. Gore "dropped by" on that session, a diplomatic phrase that connotes a sort of semi-official meeting.
This year, after the White House was criticized because Mr. Gore bypassed Hong Kong on his trip to China and after the Senate Republicans gave Mr. Lee a high-profile reception, the White House decided on a full Vice-Presidential meeting, with Mr. Clinton dropping by.
Beijing regards its resumption of control over Hong Kong as an internal matter, or at most one limited to China and Britain.
But American officials have stated many times that China's actions in Hong Kong will be a "benchmark" for Chinese-American relations generally, and the issue will be central to this year's debate in Congress on the annual extension of special trading status for China.
Mr. Lee, who has been traveling the world pressing Hong Kong's case, met Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright this afternoon. She spent part of the weekend telephoning the German, Spanish and Australian Foreign Ministers urging them to help rebuff Beijing's effort to block debate on a Danish resolution criticizing China's human rights record at a United Nations meeting in Geneva. But Washington, a co-sponsor of the resolution, may have begun its lobbying too late. The vote to block debate comes on Tuesday, and China is expected to prevail.
Mr. Gore made Hong Kong a "prime topic" in his private discussions with Chinese leaders in Beijing, officials said. And Mr. Clinton has delayed setting a firm date for China's President, Jiang Zemin, to make a state visit to the United States in part to judge what happens in Hong Kong later this year.
But the Administration has yet to strongly criticize Beijing for recent moves to curtail some civil liberties in Hong Kong once it resumes control. China has already chosen a Provisional Legislature to replace the current elected one, for example, and Mr. Tung has said limits will be imposed on public protests and free association. The Provisional Legislature is already passing laws, including a decision to scrap key parts of a 1991 ordinance that incorporates a Hong Kong Bill of Rights drafted after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
Mr. Gore chose not to go to Hong Kong, despite advice from some White House officials that he do so. Then, the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, was praised for his own visit.
"It was a bad show," Mr. Lee said in a recent interview here as he lobbied for a meeting with Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton. "What message do you send to China except that you're shoving Hong Kong under the rug? Of course he had to go."
Mr. Lee has urged the United States not to tie trade and economic matters, like the most-favored-nation status, to human rights in China, "because it hurts Hong Kong first and badly."
President Clinton would have to decide how to react if Beijing ran roughshod over Hong Kong, Mr. Lee said. But to cut economic ties in response, he said, "is like saying: 'If you still beat your wife and violently, I'll shoot her.' "

China Eases Residency Rules
 BEIJING, April 14 (Reuters) -- China said today that Hong Kong residents who want permanent right of abode in the territory will not have to be present there on July 1, the day it returns to Chinese sovereignty.
Easing a policy stated earlier, a spokesman for the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was quoted in The People's Daily as saying that a Chinese resident will be able to establish permanent right of abode in Hong Kong if he returns to the territory within 18 months of the transfer of power.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Keeps Dow From Crossing 10%-Drop Threshold

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market flirted with history yesterday, but rallied enough late in the afternoon to prevent the Dow Jones industrial average from registering its first 10 percent decline in six years.
The Dow, which began the day just 15 points above the mark that would put it 10 percent below its March 11 high, fell by as many as 35 points early in the day. But the average stormed back in late trading to end with a gain of 60.21 points at 6,451.90. 
 "It was time for the blue chips to come back," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "Is this a brave new world? Of course not. But it's a rally."
Indeed, yesterday's rebound after a 148- point decline Friday allowed the Dow to add another day to what is already the longest stretch in history without a 10 percent decline.
But the closely watched average is still just 75 points from such a decline and any disappointing news, such as an unexpectedly strong rise in the March Consumer Price Index to be released this morning, could send it tumbling again.
Yesterday the market was bolstered by strong earnings reports and by what some analysts called an "oversold" condition -- meaning that prices had plummeted to the point where they were bound to get at least a temporary lift as bargain hunters moved in to buy.
And while few analysts believe the stock market is about to soar again, many said that the "gloom and doom" that some had feared after Friday's selloff never materialized.
"We dropped about 200 points between Thursday and this morning," said Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards. "But the sellers ran out of steam, and we got some bottom fishing."
Several analysts said the rally yesterday might have come from a late-afternoon computer program trade that resulted in the purchase of a "basket" of Dow component stocks.
According to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn., a large computer-generated buy program started at 2:25 P.M. and lasted until 2:58 -- which is about the time the Dow began soaring.
Yesterday's rally, however, does not obscure the fact that the Dow -- which surged 9.8 percent, to 7,085, in March -- has definitely faltered. After more than three months of trading in 1997, the Dow is now up just 3 points for the year, or less than one-tenth of a percent.
Broader market indexes were mixed yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.08 points, to 743.73, and the Nasdaq composite rose 9.51, to 1,216.41. But the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks lost 0.64, to 338.61. And on the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks lost ground than gained in some of the lightest trading of the year. Volume on the Big Board was 406.8 million shares, down from an average 510 million this year.
The current downturn, the market's worst in years, is largely a result of worries about inflation and higher interest rates. The market decline that began last month accelerated after the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates on March 25 in hopes of slowing economic growth.
Since then, the Dow has given up 424 points, partly because of higher interest rates in the bond market, which many believe make bonds more attractive relative to stocks.
Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that as long as the economy continued to expand, expectations of inflation would threaten to erode stock prices.
"We're in one of those periods where good economic news is bad market news," he said, noting that a strengthening economy increases fears of inflation and could encourage the Fed to raise interest rates again, a possibility that the market has been contemplating for weeks.
But some analysts say that strong earnings reports this week could help prop up a sagging market.
Yesterday, better-than-expected earnings from Coca-Cola, General Motors and Travelers Group helped the Dow. Shares of Coca-Cola rose 1 7/8, to 55 5/8; G.M. gained 5/8, to 53 5/8, and Travelers was up 2, to 48 3/8.
Procter & Gamble and I.B.M., however, were the Dow's biggest gainers. P.& G. was up 3 1/4, to 119 5/8, and I.B.M. rose 3 1/8, to 136 1/2.
Technology stocks may also post some gains this week. Yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 rose 2.1 percent, partly because of Intel, which climbed 3 1/4, to 133 3/4, just ahead of its earnings announcement.
After the market closed yesterday, Intel said its first-quarter profits more than doubled, to $2.20 a share, beating analysts' expectations.
While many investors will be focusing on the Consumer Price Index report due today, some are hoping that a strong earnings season will shift the focus of investors away from interest rates. Thus far, earnings have been strong.
"The early returns are coming in at 4 percent above expectations," said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call Inc. in Boston, which tracks earnings. "The early signals are very favorable."

HEADLINE: Ex-Clinton Ally Gets 3 Years; Starr Says Inquiry Is Revived

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 14

 BODY:
A Federal judge today imposed a three-year prison sentence on James B. McDougal, the Whitewater business partner of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, for illegally obtaining millions of dollars in Federally backed loans in the 1980's.
The sentence was a relatively lenient one for 18 felony convictions that could have drawn a considerably longer prison term. It came after the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, suggested to the judge that Mr. McDougal's recent cooperation had rejuvenated the three-year-old criminal investigation of the Clintons for their ties to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the corrupt thrift that Mr. McDougal operated in the 1980's with Susan McDougal, who was his wife at the time. 
 Mr. Starr appeared to go out of his way to indicate that in Mr. McDougal, he had found a new and vital witness in the investigation of the Clintons and that his inquiry was not only back on track but had gained momentum. Just two months ago, the future of the Whitewater inquiry appeared in question, when Mr. Starr said he would resign to become a university dean. Five days Later, he changed his mind and said he would stay with the inquiry until it was finished.
Where the investigation would ultimately lead, however, remained an open question. Neither Mr. McDougal, nor the Government's other witness, who has testified publicly against the President, has much credibility. Both have criminal convictions, which would make it difficult to base a case against the Clintons on their word alone.
Mr. Starr said many hours of debriefings and grand jury testimony by Mr. McDougal had "truthfully and substantially aided" investigators, leading to new revelations "which could only be known by a few insiders."
The usually circumspect prosecutor said Mr. McDougal had pointed investigators to witnesses and documents that "independently corroborates substantial portions of Mr. McDougal's testimony." He also emphasized that Mr. McDougal "is at the epicenter" of an investigation that began as an examination of three people: the President, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McDougal.
Citing the secrecy rules that govern grand jury proceedings, Mr. Starr declined to describe the new evidence provided by Mr. McDougal. Whitewater prosecutors recently submitted papers under court seal to describe Mr. McDougal's utility as a Government witness.
But people familiar with the investigation have said Mr. McDougal has challenged the veracity of Mr. Clinton's testimony at the criminal trial last year of Mr. McDougal, Mrs. McDougal and the former Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker.
In the course of testifying as a witness for the defendants, Mr. Clinton said he had played no part in a fraudulent $300,000 loan backed by the Federal Small Business Administration. Such loans were supposed to go to members of minorities or to economically disadvantaged business owners, but that loan, issued in 1986, helped prop up the Arkansas land venture called Whitewater.
The man who issued the loan, David L. Hale, testified that Mr. Clinton, as Governor of Arkansas, asked him to make the loan at a meeting attended by Mr. McDougal.
Today, Mr. McDougal strongly hinted that he had turned against the President, his onetime friend and ally. Asked by a reporter after his sentencing whether he still stood by his statement before the trial that it would absolve the Clintons of any crimes, Mr. McDougal responded, "I wouldn't go to the bank on that."
Neither the White House special counsel, Lanny J. Davis, nor the Clintons' personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, would comment today on Mr. McDougal's sentence and Mr. Starr's remarks.
In an interview with "Dateline NBC" to be broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr. McDougal explained his decision to cooperate with investigators by saying he had hoped that the President would pardon his former wife, who was convicted of four felony counts connected to Whitewater.
"I felt he had abandoned Susan," he said. "I really thought he would pardon her. That was a big factor in my decision." Later, he said, "I just got sick and tired of lying for the fellow, you know."
Mr. McDougal said he had not betrayed his old friend, the President. "I think the Clintons are really sort of like tornadoes moving through people's lives," he said. "I'm just one of the people left in the wake of their passing by, but I have no whining or complaining to do because I have lots of company."
The sentencing of Mr. McDougal closes a chapter in the Whitewater tale but leaves the story line incomplete. Prosecutors have not indicated whether they intend to pursue new charges against anyone or close their investigation.
Mr. McDougal is now the second witness, after Mr. Hale, who is reported to have challenged the President's testimony. But both men are deeply flawed as witnesses, as felons who committed crimes involving fraud and deception. And Mr. McDougal has had mental and physical illnesses that, his doctor said today, have impaired his memory.
While witnesses like Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale have often been considered sufficient to make prosecutions in run-of-the-mill fraud, obstruction or conspiracy cases, as a practical and political matter, their testimony alone would not be enough in a case against the President or First Lady. There is a significantly higher threshold of proof for investigations involving such figures.
Still, the events of this week in Little Rock suggest that the Whitewater prosecutors are now proceeding aggressively against the White House, a far different picture from the one that emerged during the upheaval of the few days when Mr. Starr was expected to resign.
Now, however, all outward signs indicate that the investigation has moved into a higher orbit.
This week, for instance, President Clinton's current and former chiefs of staff, Erskine B. Bowles and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, have been ordered to appear before the Whitewater grand jury here to be interrogated about the steps they took to find income for Webster L. Hubbell in 1994. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether Mr. Hubbell was paid after he resigned as Associate Attorney General as part of a scheme to discourage him from cooperating with investigators and whether he testified truthfully.
Judge George Howard Jr. of Federal District Court had wide latitude in sentencing today. Most counts against Mr. McDougal carried maximum prison sentences of five years, and savings and loan executives convicted of comparable crimes have received prison terms more than twice as long as Mr. McDougal got today.
Still, Mr. McDougal's sentence is the longest prison term drawn by any defendant involved in the Whitewater inquiry. Judge Howard also ordered Mr. McDougal to pay a $10,000 fine and make restitution of $4.2 million to Federal agencies. He gave Mr. McDougal 60 days to report and said he would recommend that the sentence be served at a prison hospital because of Mr. McDougal's health.
Since Mr. McDougal lives in a trailer and holds few assets, no one expects such restitution any time soon. Before he was sentenced, his lawyer challenged a financial report putting the value of his stock in the Whitewater venture at $10,000. While it may have some value for souvenir hunters, those assets are now depleted, said the lawyer, Sam Heuer.

Japanese to Continue Policy of Low Rates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan's governor, Yasuo Matsushita, said yesterday that the central bank would maintain its low interest rate policy. To help the economy, the central bank has kept its discount rate at a low of five-tenths of 1 percent. Expectations for higher rates in the United States and no change in Japan have led the dollar higher. 
 Speaking at a luncheon of Japanese business executives, Mr. Matsushita said the Bank of Japan's monetary policy would not be immediately affected by foreign interest rates or currency fluctuations.

HEADLINE: Maker of Cancer Drugs to Oversee Prescriptions at 11 Cancer Clinics

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
A big British pharmaceutical manufacturer has taken over the management of 11 cancer centers it owns in United States hospitals, in what analysts say is the first case of a maker of drugs actually overseeing their prescription.
Zeneca P.L.C., the British drug company, said that the founder of its Salick Health Care unit had resigned and that it was assuming management of the unit's 11 cancer centers at American hospitals including Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and St. Vincent's Medical Center in Manhattan. 
 "We are unaware of anything like this elsewhere," said Clifford Hewitt an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company, "It is very unusual for a product company to own a service business of any kind. And this arrangement is a first."
Some medical ethicists were troubled by what they saw as a conflict of interest since Zeneca, the world's second-largest manufacturer of cancer drugs, would now be directly overseeing patients' cancer care. And Dr. Bernard Salick, the founder and chief executive of the clinics, said yesterday that he was concerned about how the centers he had built would be treated by the new management as well as the continued independence of physicians working at them.
Zeneca bought a half stake in Salick Health Care in 1995 and had an option to buy the remaining shares this October. But Zeneca chose to accelerate the timetable, buying the rest of the company two weeks ago. Few analysts had anticipated that the deal would be completed so soon.
In a prepared statement about the buyout, Zeneca executives said they were motivated by the desire to own a highly successful cancer care company. The statement did not address whether there would be any limitations on what drugs doctors at their centers could prescribe, and the company could not be reached for comment last night.
It had been universally expected that Dr. Salick, a kidney specialist turned entrepreneur, would remain in charge of the company's day-to-day operations and serve as a buffer between Zeneca and the hospitals. Offering big salaries and assurances about maintaining quality at the centers, Dr. Salick has personally closed virtually all the deals with hospitals and prominent cancer specialists.
For example, when Dr. Salick opened a center at St. Vincent's last fall, he raised the program's profile by hiring Dr. Ron Blum from New York University and Dr. Timothy Gee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Dr. Salick said that he was shocked last week when Zeneca executives informed him that they no longer required his services, since his employment contract was supposed to run through 1999. He said he decided to leave yesterday, after the company offered him the post of chairman emeritus and relieved him of most of his responsibilities.
Zeneca is replacing him with Michael J. O'Brien, a 25-year veteran of the drug company, who Zeneca said had most recently overseen its specialty businesses group.
Dr. Salick said that, while he expected his centers to continue to deliver good care, he was concerned that the new arrangement might make the doctors at the centers less independent. He said he had hoped his management team would serve as a "safety valve" to make sure that doctors could prescribe whatever medicines they saw fit. He said he had insisted that his doctors be allowed to collaborate with competing drug companies in their research.
"I am very distressed about this," Dr. Salick said. "I didn't feel I would be able to control quality." He added that he was starting a new health care company that would focus on diseases like cancer and AIDS to compete with Zeneca.
In a statement yesterday, David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said, "We are sorry that Dr. Salick did not take the role offered to him."
He added that Zeneca's purchase was part of the company's strategy of "seeking broader opportunities to provide services and expertise -- as well as pharmaceutical products -- to the health care industry."
Salick Health Care is known for its expertise in offering cost-efficient cancer care for patients in managed care plans, as well as for innovations like 24-hour outpatient chemotherapy.
Other hospitals at which Salick operates cancer centers include the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, Calif.; Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami and Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Salick also owns or operates more than two dozen dialysis clinics.
In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have branched out, owning drug-distribution companies and home health care agencies. But never before has a company employed doctors who can prescribe its drugs.
"From a business standpoint this makes sense," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. "They're going to get their arms around cancer care in managed care, and at the same time make sure their products get a fair chance at the table.
"From the patient standpoint," he added, "you would wonder is this the Zeneca cancer clinic and do they have the whole palette of products. If you go to a Mercedes-Benz dealer, you get Mercedes-Benz products."
Executives at hospitals with Salick centers said that while they had expected a Zeneca takeover they were surprised by Dr. Salick's departure. But they expressed confidence that there would be separation between the sales interests of Zeneca and decisions concerning patient care.
"We're not anticipating any changes and we're hopeful that Zeneca's new position will open up new ways to serve our patients," said Dr. Karl Adler, chief executive of Saint Vincent's Medical Center.
Dr. Adler said that physicians could not be readily swayed in their prescribing, so patients would continue to get the drugs they needed.
Some health experts said that they worried more about the larger implications of the deal than about the fate of the 11 Salick centers. They said that when one company could control both the manufacturing of a drug and its distribution, an important patient safeguard had been lost.
"It is quite possible that Zeneca's motives are pure, but I think we will see more deals like this in the future and the real question is what sorts of checks and balances ought to be in place," said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. "Having your doctor, your clinic, your pharmacy and your testing lab all owned by the same person is not the optimal structure for health care."

Your position on removing rent regulations is ill conceived (editorial, April 8). Landlords currently have every incentive to improve the housing stock. 
 The only thing that will be accomplished by removing rent regulations is the removal of the middle class from the city. Inflationary pressures will cause great upheavals in all neighborhoods, destroying the very fabric that keeps them alive.

HEADLINE: The Incredible Shrinking Meal

BYLINE: By DONNA ST. GEORGE

 BODY:
ONCE there was the lunch hour. Now there is the lunch squeeze: the midday mealtime interlude that has been rushed, scaled down and even eliminated as workers like Susan Julbe juggle the demands of office and home.
 Mrs. Julbe, a business manager for National Public Radio in Washington, clocks her lunch break at ''about seven minutes'' -- the time it takes to microwave a frozen entree in the office kitchen and bring it back to her desk.
 She eats while she works, she said, having just finished a lunch of Healthy Choice chicken cacciatore, because ''it gives me that extra hour in my day.'' 
 Though Mrs. Julbe may sound extreme, she is part of a trend that has changed restaurant menus, inspired a successful line of convenience foods and helped create a boom in takeout eating and corporate catering.
 A growing number of Americans view the lunch hour of old as a luxury that no longer fits into a world of downsized businesses, heavier workloads and time-pressed families with two working parents.
 When the National Restaurant Association polled workers in late 1996, for example, nearly 40 percent reported that they did not take a real lunch break. Forty-five percent said they had less time for lunch than before.
 And in two other recent surveys, the American lunch ''hour'' measured up to about half its billing: 29 minutes in one survey and 36 minutes in the other.
 ''Lunch is not the big thing that it once was,'' said Mildred Culp, a Seattle workplace consultant. ''People, if not overwhelmed, are at least swamped, so they are looking to use their time more efficiently.''
 Dr. Culp added that the social aspects of lunch have changed for many workers. ''People are now communicating by E-mail,'' she said. ''They don't have to get together to chitchat and be friendly.''
 Underlying the squeeze on lunch are a string of other 1990's realities.
 For Rich Bentley, the lunch hour fell apart after the birth of his son, Kyle, eight months ago. Both Mr. Bentley and his wife work full time. And once their son was in day care, their schedules had to be arranged around Kyle's.
 ''The old days of leisurely lunches and workouts are gone,'' said Mr. Bentley, an administrator at the State University Health Science Center at Brooklyn, who organizes his workday so that he can leave by 5 P.M. and pick up his son from day care on time.
 Now, lunch has shrunk from a 60-minute break to a fast bite at a hospital cafeteria or neighborhood takeout counter. ''I call it a 15-minute wolfing session,'' Mr. Bentley said. 
 Many lunchers, feeling such pressures, skip the noon meal altogether.
 Lunch is, in fact, the most missed meal -- not breakfast, as many people believe, said Harry Balzer, a vice president of the NPD Group, a consumer research organization in Rosemont, Ill., that tracks eating trends. 
 Last year, the average American older than 18 skipped lunch 66 times, compared with 56 times in 1984, the first year for which it has data.
 But to Mr. Balzer, that fact is not nearly so striking as this one: more and more Americans are joining the brown-bag brigade. Some 43 percent of men and 34 percent of women brought lunch from home at least once every two weeks in 1996, up about a third since 1987.
 ''It's a trend, there is no question about that,'' Mr. Balzer said. ''In my way of thinking, it's because there is no easier or cheaper meal you can have than the meal you have carried from your house and that is sitting 10 feet away from you whenever you want.''
 The brown-bag trend is well known to food manufacturers, who have created shelves of new products for packing in paper bags and briefcases: items likes Oscar Mayer Lunchables and Starkist Charlie's Lunch Kit.
 The lunch crunch of the 90's, which is especially evident among office workers, is well recognized by restaurateurs, who have expanded takeout operations and stepped up corporate catering -- so that workers will not have to be away from their offices long, if at all.
 In the 1980's, ''people were willing and able to wait half an hour for a seat,'' said Peter Wyss of Restaurant Associates, which owns Tropica, Cafe Centro and Naples in the MetLife Building in midtown Manhattan, as well as takeout restaurants. ''You don't see this anymore anywhere in midtown Manhattan,'' he added.
 In Chicago, Karen Ryan may typify the worker who once went out to lunch but now eats takeout at her desk. Just five years ago, she and colleagues felt relaxed enough about their jobs to lunch regularly at sitdown restaurants.
 ''Now, people catch it when they can -- and there's no such thing as a lunch hour,'' said Ms. Ryan, an account representative at J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency. ''There are never enough hours in the day to get things done.''
 The dwindling lunch hour, however, is not only a result of schedule overload. For some, skimping on lunch is a way of expanding time for personal activities. For example, Mr. Wyss said lunch hours in his restaurants had slowed down on Fridays as customers tried to wrap up their workweeks in four and a half days.
 Dennis Riese, head of the Riese Organization, which owns 150 New York restaurants, observed: ''We're not a society of workaholics like we used to be. People are interested in devoting more of their time to play and to family.''
 For all of these reasons, takeout eating has developed into a way of life -- and a new generation of restaurants has embraced it.
 ''There's just a ton of business out there in people who can't get away from their offices and yet want restaurant-quality food,'' said Peter Godoff, co-owner of Paradise and Lunch in Manhattan, whose services include delivery of lunch to workers at their desks. 
 To accommodate the time-conscious, even Le Bernardin, the elegant French restaurant on the West Side, started a 30-minute ''timely lunch'' menu in late February. ''We had four or five tables every day that said, 'Rush, rush, super-rush,' '' the owner, Maguy LeCoze, said.
 But for business professionals, the most striking trend at lunch may be their companies' inclination to play host.
 Companies of the 90's often bring work and lunch together -- feeding workers, but keeping their attention straight through lunch.
 ''The mind-set is that you can't take the lunch hour out of the workday, so you have to incorporate work into it,'' said Ricky Eisen, owner of Between the Bread, a corporate caterer that brings lunch to 100 offices a day in New York.
 With 2,000 businesses as clients, Ms. Eisen's catering operations have often reflected changes in corporate America. In 1991, she said, her business ''took a dive'' as companies downsized, restructured and cut back on expenses.
 That year, several major corporations served sandwiches at their annual Christmas parties. ''It was to me a horror,'' she said. ''It broke my heart.''
 Since then, corporate catering has rebounded -- but lunch has been reconfigured. ''Primarily, I see that lunch has changed in its purpose,'' Ms. Eisen said. ''It used to be a rest from the workday. Now it's part of the workday.''
 This new approach has changed menus, she added. In the 1980's, lunch was more elaborate, with new foods and flavorings. At one lunch in five, alcohol was served. ''It was more dining than eating,'' she said. ''Now it's eating.''
 In the 90's, alcohol is gone. Few are the meals that require multiple forks and knives. Now, companies want easily handled sandwiches and finger foods, with less sauce and mayonnaise.
 ''They want people to be able to hold lunch in one hand and keep working with the other hand,'' Ms. Eisen said.
 At A. T. Kearney, management consultants in New York, such catered lunches are a mainstay, said Fredda Paul, who oversees them. But no matter what is on the menu, business comes first and guides the agenda, she said.
 ''I'm here two years, and I have never seen anyone just sit back and enjoy the food,'' she said.
 All of this lunch cutting is not necessarily healthy, experts say.
 ''People think they are increasing their productivity by eating while they're working at their desks, but what we find is that they need to take that break to refocus,'' said Neil Schmottlach, director of the Fisher Institute for Wellness at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind.
 Melanie Young, a public relations executive in New York, whose company does special events in the food industry, confided that she has eaten too many lunches ''over my keyboard,'' hoping to cram more work into her day.
 Not only has she gummed up her computer by spilling her food while working, Ms. Young said, but she has also come down with indigestion. ''You're torn between taking this call -- and talking to this person who you know you're never going to reach again -- and eating your lunch,'' she said.
 The great exception to the lunchless trend may be among those who regularly do business over restaurant lunches -- and who find the noon meal a perfect moment for building good will with clients and partners.
 Nationally, lunch traffic at restaurants has grown 6 percent from 1993 to 1995, good news for an industry that suffered a lengthy slump after the 1990 recession, and after tax laws limited deductions for business meals. In New York, many restaurants report a bigger increase in the last year or so: more than 10 percent.
 ''Lunch took a real serious hit in the early 1990's,'' said David Ruggerio, the owner and executive chef at Le Chantilly in Manhattan, who also manages Maxim's. But in the last 18 months, he said, quoting sales jumps of 40 percent to 50 percent, ''people are going back to lunch.''
 Still, the restaurant lunch of 1997 is a different world from its 1980's counterpart. It's not a two-hour affair, with two or three martinis, restaurateurs say. Now, many lunchers want to fold their linen napkins and pay their tabs only 45 minutes after they sit down.
 ''Today, it's like they're on a dead run,'' Mr. Ruggerio said. ''They run through the door, they drop their coats, they get a menu, and they're ready to order. It's definitely not a casual situation.''
 In 1997, lunch customers order very fine wine -- but by the glass, not the bottle. They heed price. Gone are the days when it seemed that almost every business lunch was added on to a house account, with the careless wave of a hand.
 The way Clark Wolf, a New York-based food and restaurant consultant, sees it, people are of two minds about lunch. Most days, they are time-pressed and looking for takeout. But once or twice a month, they go all out.
 ''You have the tiny, tight lunch and the 'the heck with it, let's do dinner at 1 o'clock,' lunch,'' he said. ''It's like hemlines, all the way up and all the way down.''
 Among daytime diners, Mr. Wolf noted several trends. One is a tendency toward two-appetizer, no-entree lunches. Another is a hankering for comfort foods: macaroni and cheese, chicken pot pie, meatloaf.
 ''Macaroni and cheese is major -- but haute macaroni and cheese,'' he said, recalling a dish at the Regency that features penne pasta, with three different cheeses and crabmeat. ''Macaroni and cheese for grownups,'' he said.
 The trend is comfort food ''not as retro, but to replace home,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''People don't cook anymore.''
 As for whether or not America has grown more nutritionally conscious about lunch, there is evidence both ways.
 Restaurateurs tell of more people ordering vegetables and fish. ''Beef for lunch? It's nonexistent,'' said Julian Niccolini, a managing partner at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
 At Le Chantilly, Mr. Ruggerio said his three-course vegetable lunch menu is embraced by 25 percent to 30 percent of the lunch crowd. ''Even these guys who are 250 pounds are eating vegetables,'' he said.
 And Mrs. Julbe, the brown-bagger at National Public Radio, said nutrition is definitely in her mind when she packs a low-fat frozen meal for lunch each day.
 But there are skeptics. After all, America has grown more obese in recent years. And Mr. Balzer's research organization has found that hamburgers, French fries and chicken nuggets are among the fastest-growing foods in America.
 ''It seems quite unlikely that people are eating more nutritiously at lunch,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University. But she added, ''Some probably are, and some are not.''

HEADLINE: Women Legislators Banish 'Politics as Usual'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Women in Washington Statehouse Lead U.S. Tide" (front page, April 14): You've confirmed what many of us have long suspected -- as more women hold elected office, both policy and "politics as usual" will change.
While it is true that women do not vote as a bloc, women do share certain characteristics. In general, women feel less secure economically than men. And they are likely to spend a significant portion of their time raising children. As a result, women are not inclined to be anti-government. They see government both as an instrument for maintaining the social safety net and as a positive force in shaping programs that safeguard the health and educational well-being of children. 
 As your article suggests, where women have a significant presence in state legislatures, these tendencies have allowed them to tip the balance in favor of sensible legislation -- dampening cuts in social services, raising the minimum wage.
If only our nation's Capitol could follow suit. Currently, only 9 percent of the Senate and less than 12 percent of the House is female. Could this be the reason that Congressional leaders seem to have stagnated on so many important issues like passing a budget and reforming Social Security? And perhaps it is part of the reason that the most pressing topic of conversation in Washington these days is what the other guy did wrong.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Near 4-Year Lows On Report of Weak Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Gold prices fell to nearly their lowest point of the last four years yesterday after a Government report showing that inflation is in check reduced the metal's attraction to investors.
On other markets, wheat and coffee fell. 
 Consumer prices rose one-tenth of a percent last month, the Labor Department said yesterday. The report reduced fears that inflation was poised to increase. Recent reports showing economic strength had fueled such worries and had led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an effort to check inflation.
Some investors buy gold to guard against rising inflation, which erodes the value of interest-paying assets like bonds.
"Today's C.P.I. report was very bad in gold terms," said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. "We've already got interest rates going higher, and now there's a sign that inflation isn't as strong as first thought."
Gold for June delivery sank $4.80, to $343.90 an ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest for the most active contract since Feb. 13, when gold settled at a four-year low of $343 an ounce.
Wheat fell amid doubts that last weekend's freeze in the Plains states had damaged the sprouting winter wheat crop as much as had been feared. Speculation that the recent wheat rally would lead more farmers to plant the crop also drove prices lower.
July wheat dropped 6.5 cents, to $4.2175 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Coffee fell on speculation that a report due after trading ended would show a surge in United States inventories. That speculation proved to be incorrect, however, and the report could lead to a rally in coffee prices today.
Traders had been expecting that the Green Coffee Association's report on stockpiles would show an increase of 200,000 to 300,000 132-pound bags. After trading ended, however, the association said inventories rose by only 111,000 bags, to 1.657 million bags during March. May coffee fell 3.6 cents, to $1.924 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.

Flush With Cash, Hotels Renovate

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
New York's hotel business is booming and many hotel operators are using the cash produced by heavily occupied rooms and rising room rates to improve their properties with renovations. According to the Hotel Association of New York, 33 different operators are spending a total of $400 million to refurbish guest rooms and meeting areas.
 Although hotel room occupancy rates in 1996 were the highest in 15 years, the desire to visit New York appears to be increasing. The overall occupancy rate in the first three months of this year was 77.3 percent compared with 72.2 percent in the first quarter of last year, according to the accounting and consulting firm of Coopers & Lybrand.
Demand for hotel rooms is allowing operators to increase room rates, which averaged $166.51 in the first quarter of this year, compared with $150.84 in the first quarter of 1996, an increase of 10.4 percent. In the luxury segment of the business, which includes hotels like the Plaza and the New York Palace, the rate in the first three months this year was $226.02 compared with $202.76 for the same period a year ago, an increase of 11.5 percent. 
 Real-estate analysts said many of the projects were efforts to catch up on improvements that had been put off during the slump of the early 1990's and to differentiate products from competitors. And, they said, the renovation programs may be a precursor to major new midtown hotels, both conversions of existing buildings and new construction.
"The industry is relatively prosperous now and there is cash available to fix hotels up," said Arthur Adler, a partner in Coopers & Lybrand's hospitality consulting practice. "If you don't have cash there's not much you can do. Some of this is catching up on maintenance that was deferred during the hard times of the early 1990's."
Mr. Adler said hotels need to periodically upgrade their properties if they are not to start looking rundown and shabby. "There is a rule of thumb that you need to replace the soft goods, things like carpets and wallpaper, every five years," he said. "You do the case goods, the beds, desks and furniture, every 10 years."
One of the bigger programs is being undertaken by Sheraton Hotels of New York and is affecting all three of its properties in Manhattan. Two are to be refitted to attract business travelers while an underused exhibition space at the third is to be converted into a conference center. The whole project will cost $25 million to $30 million, the company estimates.
An undertaking of a different sort is to be done at the historic Algonquin Hotel, which was acquired last month by the Camberley Hotel Company of Atlanta. Camberley is planning to spend $4 million to make the property more comfortable and efficient without changing its character.
"We have a mandate to address the entrance and main lobby" to get guests in and out of the hotel's rooms more efficiently, said Alexandra Champalimaud, whose interior design company been awarded the project. "We want to be very discreet about how we make the changes." Other hotels at which renovations are currently under way include the Grand Hyatt, the Plaza and the New York Palace.
The 146-room Sheraton Park Avenue, at 37th Street, is in many ways typical of the big corporate conversions now under way. It is being changed to what the company calls its Corporate Club format. That includes rooms with larger than normal desks, ergonomic chairs, in-room data ports for connecting computer modems, dual telephone lines with voice mail, adjustable lighting and a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet printer/fax/copier machine. It also includes higher rates; $240 a night compared with $200 for the hotel's former standard rooms.
Then, in June the company will close its Sheraton Manhattan at Seventh Avenue and 52d Street for a similar conversion of its 650 rooms. Reopening is scheduled for August.
At the Sheraton Hotel and Towers, diagonally across Seventh Avenue from the Sheraton Manhattan, a 30,000 square-foot-exhibition space that company officials said had only a 20 percent utilization rate is being converted into a conference center with 13 rooms of varying size.
Although New York had an 83 percent occupancy rate for all 1996 (summer and fall occupancy rates are traditionally higher than those of the first quarter), financial analysts and industry consultants said it was still not clear whether the economics yet justified building new hotels.
"It is clearly cheaper in today's environment to renovate than to build new," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hotel and real estate consulting company. Nevertheless, he said, a number of projects appear to be nearing actual construction, including the proposed Sofitel Hotel on a vacant site on 44th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and the renovation of part of the old Macmillan building at 52d Street and Third Avenue into a Marriott Courtyard hotel.Also under way is a project north of Grand Central Terminal by Bernard Goldberg's Gotham Hospitality Group, which operates five hotels in Manhattan. And Apple Core Hotels, which operates three properties in Manhattan, has announced it will convert a 96,000-square-foot former office building at 130 West 46th Street, near Times Square, into a 172-room hotel that will probably be operated under the Golden Tulip name.
One new hotel, the 90 room Chelsea Savoy Hotel, opened about a month ago at the corner of 23d Street and Seventh Avenue.

HEADLINE: Mustafa Amin, Liberal Editor Jailed by Nasser, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 15

 BODY:
Mustafa Amin, a pioneer of Arab journalism and an advocate of Western-style democracy who was imprisoned under President Gamal Abdel Nasser, died at his home in Cairo on Sunday. He was 83.
Mr. Amin and his twin brother, Ali, were publishers of Egypt's five best-selling publications until Nasser nationalized the country's press in 1960. 
 The brothers continued writing in the daily newspaper Al Akhbar and the weekly Akhbar Al Youm, where Mustafa Amin stood out in calling for closer ties to the United States, as a bastion of freedom and democracy. Coming at a time when the Nasser Government was becoming friendly with the Soviet Union, neither that message nor Mr. Amin's criticism of Communism were well-received in official circles.
In 1965, while lunching at his villa in Alexandria with an American diplomat, Bruce Taylor Odell, Mr. Amin was arrested and charged with being an American spy. After a secret trial in which prosecutors demanded that Mr. Amin be put to death, Mr. Amin was sentenced to prison, and remained behind bars until 1974. He was then freed, ostensibly on the grounds of poor health, by President Anwar al-Sadat, who after succeeding Mr. Nasser in 1970 pursued friendlier ties with the West.
Mr. Amin became editor of Akhbar Al Youm, and upon the death of his brother in 1976 took over a daily column known as "An Idea," which was published in Al Akhbar and in a London-based Arabic newspaper, Asharq Al Awsat.
Born in Cairo in 1914, Mr. Amin was educated at the American University in Cairo and at Georgetown University in Washington, and grew accustomed from early in his career to being under fire for showing sympathy to Western liberalism, free enterprise and a free press.
He was first jailed in 1939 for an article that criticized King Farouk, and was jailed for two brief occasions in the early days of Nasser's Government in the 1950's. Nevertheless Mr. Amin produced spicy, lively journalism that continued to gently peck at those in power.
His relations with Nasser were not always poor. In 1956 the President sent Mr. Amin to Washington to show American officials photographs and other evidence of the destruction caused by the joint British, French and Israeli invasion that followed Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.
Mr. Amin and his brother helped to school a generation of Egyptian journalists. He wrote four books about his experience in jail, including a popular autobiography that described how he was tortured.
Having spent nine years in prison, he devoted many of his columns to promoting the ideal of freedom, which he said would transform Egypt into a stronger country and make its people more creative.
Mr. Amin is also known for adding a human dimension to Egyptian journalism. Early in his career he helped to popularize the establishment of a Mother's Day, and he later began a monthly appeal in the pages of Al Akhbar for donations to help students, the handicapped and the needy.
He is survived by his wife, Isis Tantawi; his daughter, Safia, and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: A Modest Start on Sweatshops

 BODY:
A newly proposed code of conduct for domestic and overseas sweatshops makes useful pledges to improve the appalling working conditions of apparel workers around the world. But the code is so littered with loopholes its impact will probably be limited unless public and press attention remains fixed on the problems of sweatshop workers.
The Presidential task force that developed the code included industry giants like Nike, Reebok, L. L. Bean and Liz Claiborne, as well as representatives of labor and human rights groups. It got industry pledges to provide abuse-free factories, hire children at least 15 years old, limit the workweek to 60 hours and protect the right of workers to organize without fear of retaliation by their employers. The code also calls for companies to hire independent monitors that would work with local human rights groups. This provision is vital, since in oppressive societies workers would only voice discontent to groups that have gained their trust. 
 Identifying and publicizing abuses is essential to improving conditions. The coverage of inhumane conditions at Central American factories turning out clothes for Wal-Mart under the name of Kathie Lee Gifford led to creation of the task force. Two years ago, the industry would have brushed off any proposal to monitor its third-world factories.
The weakness of the code is its lack of precise commitments. The accord suggests but does not require local independent monitoring of working conditions or public disclosure of infractions. The 60-hour limit on the workweek can be waived for what are called "extraordinary" circumstances.
Even if a follow-up commission strengthens the wording, the code cannot work unless American consumers penalize non-participants. Some companies will not sign the code. Warnaco, which makes Hathaway shirts, withdrew from the task force because the company fears that public disclosure of monitors' reports will reveal trade secrets to competitors. If consumers flock to lower-priced clothes produced by companies that ignore the code, the effort will fail.
The task force correctly rejected the idea of imposing a "living" wage, calling instead for companies to pay only the locally prevailing minimum wage. An externally determined wage would almost surely victimize the world's worst-paid workers. Manufacturers would close shop in countries like Haiti and Vietnam where workers produce too little to cover the higher wage employers would be required to pay, and reopen production somewhere else where factories are more productive. The more humane course is to rely on competition to drive up productivity and wages, as has happened in South Korea and other Asian economies.
At best, a voluntary accord that includes industry can only accomplish so much. The task force may help reduce the political heat on Mr. Clinton, labor unions and industry to deal with the working conditions in faraway factories. Whether third-world workers will ever see a benefit depends on sharpening the code and intensifying disclosure of companies that violate its provisions.

Dollar Falls as Price Report Eases Outlook for Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other major currencies yesterday as a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices dampened expectations for another Federal Reserve interest-rate increase next month.
The Fed's decision to lift borrowing rates last month and speculation that another increase might be on the way helped to bolster the dollar in recent weeks by making deposits in the currency more attractive. Today's number gave traders pause. 
 The Consumer Price Index "was lower than expected, and people are looking at it and saying, 'Maybe the Fed's going to hold,' " said Stephen Jury, managing director of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland. "That means a little more stability for the dollar."
The dollar settled at 1.7270 marks in New York, down from 1.7298 on Monday. The dollar fell to 126.09 Japanese yen from 126.20.
But strong rallies in stocks and bonds prevented the dollar from falling too far, some traders said.
The dollar began its decline against the yen in Asian trading amid lingering concern that the Bank of Japan might sell dollars for yen to lift its sagging currency. "They want a nice, orderly rise in the dollar and they're trying to defuse the natural tendency for it to go higher," said Paul Spirgel, senior currency trader at the Royal Bank of Scotland. "It could get ugly if the dollar reaches 130 yen and goes through it."
The dollar's rise has helped to create renewed concern about the Japanese trade surplus. A further reading will come tomorrow when the United States reports its balance of trade for February.
Before falling against the mark, the dollar got a lift from comments by Otmar Issing, chief economist of the German central bank, suggesting that investors might seek dollars until Europe's planned common currency, the Euro, gains credibility.
The Euro "will, in the best case, need time until it becomes accepted in international markets," Mr. Issing said. The remarks prompted dollar-buying that drove the currency to 1.7366 marks, its highest since Feb. 24, 1994. Even so, the rally proved short-lived as traders focused on the diminished prospects for a Fed rate increase in May.

HEADLINE: U.S. Giving North Korea More Food

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
On the eve of a new set of meetings with the North Koreans, the State Department announced today that the United States would provide $15 million worth of corn to North Korea, answering an international appeal for aid to avert a growing famine.
The State Department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said the United States responded quickly to the latest appeal since food shortages in North Korea are expected to reach a critical stage this spring. 
 The contribution was made in response to a request by the United Nations' World Food Program for a total of nearly $100 million worth of food for North Korea this year, equal to 200,000 metric tons. It follows a $10 million contribution announced by the United States in February.
The North Korean Government has in recent months withheld promises of improved relations until the United States and others do more to help it deal with chronic food shortages, which were worsened by flooding in 1995 and 1996. But the Clinton Administration has insisted that it will not link such aid to North Korea taking part in peace talks.
"Although the threat of famine results largely from the failed policies of the North, we view the suffering as a humanitarian, not a political issue," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said in a speech this evening at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
An Administration official said today that the United States announced the new contribution the day before a delegation of North Koreans was to meet American and South Korean delegations in New York, as a way to pre-empt efforts by the North to make more aid a condition for it to take part in talks.
North Korea requested Wednesday's meeting to deliver its formal response to a proposal, made a year ago by President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, to hold "four party" peace talks. The talks, which would include the two Koreas, the United States and China, would try to cement a formal end to the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in July 1953 but no peace treaty.
The Administration remains hopeful that North Korea, whose Communist Government remains one of the world's most isolated, will agree to enter into negotiations, but officials remain wary of its erratic signals.
After visiting the heavily defended border between North and South Korea last week, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen sternly warned the North Koreans to stop military provocations and show a willingness to negotiate if it hoped to receive more food aid.
"I think there has to be some indication on the part of the North Korean Government that it wishes to reach some kind of accord to move away from this militaristic approach that they have taken," Mr. Cohen said.
North Korea has also agreed to hold additional discussions in New York in May with the United States and South Korea on its missile development. The Administration has expressed some concern about reports that the North is prepared to deploy long-range missiles, although officials said it is not clear that it will do so.
Perhaps to play down expectations, the officials have said the Administration does not expect an unequivocal answer this week from the North Koreans, whose delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan. Rather, Washington expects to hear a "litany of needs," as one senior Administration official put it.
The economic crisis in North Korea has left much of the population severely malnourished, forcing the hand of its leader, Kim Jong Il. "The regime is coming to the realization that it has no choice but to engage the United States and South Korea in a significant and meaningful way," the official said. "Its options are quickly running out."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	New Generals in North
 TOKYO (Reuters) -- North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, shored up his position today by appointing more than 100 generals.
North Korean news organizations, while lavishing praise on his father, Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Stalinist state, who died in 1994, described his 55-year-old son as "the great successor."
Kim Jong Il, supreme commander of the North's military, has yet to be confirmed in two key posts once held by his father -- General Secretary of the ruling Workers' Party and state President.
But people who follow North Korea say the younger Mr. Kim will assume the posts after the third anniversary of his father's death in July. In a fresh sign that he was on course toward succeeding his father, Mr. Kim ordered the promotion of more than 120 army officers to general.

Inflation Data Bring Surge In Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond yields fell yesterday to their levels of a week ago as a smaller-than-expected rise in the Consumer Price Index sent relieved investors back into the market.
The price of the 30-year bond surged 30/32, to 94 10/32, pushing the yield down to 7.09 percent, from 7.17 percent on Monday. 
 Some market analysts, however, saw yesterday's gains as nothing more than a brief reprieve. They noted that some of the buying came from speculators covering their short sales. Short-selling involves the sale of borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back later at lower prices and pocketing the difference. However, if prices begin to rise instead of fall, speculators rush to cover their short positions by buying back the securities to limit their losses.
The rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in the March Consumer Price Index reported yesterday was below the consensus forecast of two-tenths to three-tenths of 1 percent and followed a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in February and one-tenth in January. The core index for March, which excludes food and energy, rose just two-tenths of 1 percent, matching the February increase.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said the limited rise "surprised the bond market, which had sold off on April 8, when a Labor Department economist told a financial news service that the March core C.P.I. could be marginally higher than the two-tenths of a percent February gain partly due to the reimposition of the 10 percent Federal tax on airline fares on March 7 and also partly because of early introduction of higher-priced spring clothing."
However, Mr. Harris noted that "seasonally adjusted apparel commodity prices actually fell four-tenths of a percent in March," and not all of the 10 percent airline tax was passed through to consumers. Airline fares were up 4.5 percent.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said strong economic growth coexisted peacefully with tame consumer price inflation in the first quarter of 1997. He said the March price numbers "illustrated the widespread absence of inflationary pressures, despite strong economic growth and mounting wage pressures." Mr. Hoffman said energy prices, which fell sharply last month, would also help hold down inflation again in April.
Still, he said, "the currently muted price inflation will not prevent the Federal Open Market Committee from raising the Federal funds rate again."
As to the timing, he said that an increase at the May 20 meeting of the Federal Reserve committee was not a foregone conclusion, especially if consumer spending eases this month as suggested by recent reports of mixed department store sales and softer vehicle sales.
"I suspect the long bond yield will settle into a 7 percent to 7.25 percent range over the spring months," Mr. Hoffman said.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at the consulting firm I.D.E.A., said he saw no change in market sentiment as a result of the weaker-than-expected price report. "It does reinforce market perception that there will not be an aggressive tightening cycle by the Fed," he said. "This kind of number tells us that the Fed is acting pre-emptively. And it does not appear so far that the Fed has acted too late in adjusting rates."
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said one number alone could not produce a turnaround, given the market's fear of inflation.
"So you caught some people short here today," Mr. Delaney said, adding that the market was rising even before the price report was released because of "an early rumor of a large Asian central bank buyer of 10-year notes."
Economic data coming out today include March figures on housing construction, industrial production and capacity utilization. "If they follow C.P.I. and are weaker than expected," Mr. Delaney said, "then the market may have something."

New automated system for speeding travelers through immigration will be tested in Bermuda.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AT the World Travel and Tourism Council meeting in Washington today and tomorrow, I.B.M. will demonstrate an automated system for speeding passengers through immigration checkpoints at airports. Called Fastgate, the system will undergo testing beginning next month at Bermuda International Airport; by fall it is expected to be in North America, Europe and Asia.
Comparing travelers' fingerprints, hand geometry or voice prints, the A.T.M.-like devices are also said to confirm that travelers do not pose a known security threat. "The minimal level immigration check is higher than what is in place at airports today," said Jeff Mortner, I.B.M.'s worldwide solutions manager for Fastgate. And because travelers using Fastgate are expected to clear immigration checkpoints in no more than 15 seconds, on average, police and immigration officers will have more time for other matters. 
 After the test period, travelers will be able to enroll in the Fastgate system through participating airlines or credit card companies. This will require them to provide their names, addresses, dates of birth and passport numbers, as well as to record their fingerprints or voiceprints at a participating airport.
Once enrolled, a passenger will be able to insert a card into a biometric reader and answer a few questions on a touch screen. Fastgate will then retrieve the passenger's information from the I.B.M.-managed data base and compare the biometric information to verify identity. The system will then seek confirmation from various Government data bases that there are no security alerts for the traveler. As for any privacy concerns, I.B.M. said it "employs state-of-the-art security to protect the data base, but travelers should remember that most of this information is already known to the card issuer, and participation is purely voluntary."
 
Airline Update
Next Tuesday or Wednesday, the 10-millionth passenger will fly the Delta Shuttle, which along with the US Airways Shuttle flies hourly between New York and Washington and New York and Boston. The lucky passenger will receive two free round-trip tickets to any Delta Air Lines destination, as well as hotel accommodations and assorted bagatelles. Millions more passengers have actually flown the shuttle, which was formerly owned and operated by Pan Am. But as Pan Am slid toward bankruptcy, and eventual liquidation, it sold the shuttle to Delta in 1991 and Delta began operating it in September of that year. The 10 million consist only of passengers aboard the shuttle under Delta's ownership.
On June 1, Delta will add two nonstop flights each Saturday and Sunday between Atlanta and Orlando, Fla., the busiest route on Delta's worldwide system, then on July 1 will add three more on both days. They will be in addition to the 14 daily flights the carrier currently flies between those cities. While demand for the increased service exists, the carrier said it was able to provide it by deploying some planes that usually fly business routes during the week but are less in demand on weekends.
South African Airways is offering a special fare for travel through June 15 and from Aug. 1 through Sept. 30. Valid between either New York or Miami and Cape Town, the $2,004 fare is good for two passengers, a $600 saving off the $2,598 cost of two regular economy tickets.
Continental Airlines will begin daily nonstop flights between Houston and Honolulu on Aug. 1, and daily nonstop service each Thursday and Sunday between Houston and Nassau, the Bahamas, beginning June 26. Introductory fares from Houston and surrounding states, as low as $398 round trip, are on sale through April 30, and are good for travel to Honolulu through Nov. 20 and to Nassau through Aug. 31.
Delta and Varig Airlines of Brazil recently decided to end their code-sharing arrangement on June 14, the day before Delta begins daily service from Cincinnati via Atlanta to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -- and three months before Varig and UAL's United begin their code-sharing partnership on Sept. 26 . Delta and Virgin Atlantic will end their code-sharing program this summer, after which Virgin, a unit of Virgin Group, will hook up with Continental. Meanwhile, Delta, which already has 10 code-sharing partners, is awaiting United States Government approval for three more: Air France, All Nippon Airways and China Southern Airlines.
 
Hotel Update
The Hanoi Daewood Hotel -- which boasts almost 450 rooms and suites, fax and computer capabilities, a health club and an indoor driving range with putting greens -- has become the first hotel in Vietnam to join the Leading Hotels of the World, the reservations and marketing alliance of more than 300 luxury hotels in about 70 countries.
 
Travel Acquisition
Carlson Wagonlit Travel said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Travel Agents International, a Florida operator of franchised travel agencies, for an undisclosed amount.
Carlson Wagonlit, based in New York, is a travel agency franchiser with annual revenue of $13.3 billion. It is a joint venture of the Carlson Companies of Minneapolis and the Accor Group of Paris. Travel Agents International has annual sales of $600 million.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Profit Rose 33% in First Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 15

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc.'s first-quarter net income rose 33 percent, easily topping forecasts, on strong North American demand for its heavy machinery.
Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving machinery, had net income of $394 million, or $2.08 a share, up from $296 million, or $1.53 a share, in the period a year earlier. Earnings beat the average estimate of $1.70 a share from 16 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International Inc. 
 Revenue for Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., rose 11 percent, to $4.26 billion from $3.84 billion.
"Superlatives aren't enough to describe the first-quarter results," Mark Koznarek, a partner at Midwest Research, said. "The big question is, did they borrow from the second quarter to get those results?"
Caterpillar shares rose $3.625, to $83 yesterday.
"These are the good times," said Douglas Oberhelman, the company's chief financial officer. "The U.S. economy was stronger than we thought."
Sales in the United States rose 15 percent, to $2.17 billion, on increased volume and a larger market share.
Outside the United States, sales rose 6 percent, to $1.9 billion, representing 47 percent of sales, down from 49 percent in the quarter a year ago. Sales declined outside Mexico in Latin America, and in Australia and Western Europe.
The company warned, though, that second-half sales could be hurt if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates more than forecast this year.

HEADLINE: March Shows Little Inflation and the Markets Stage a Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Consumer prices edged up a mere one-tenth of 1 percent in March, the Government said today in a report that eased inflation fears and ignited a Wall Street rally that was also fueled by some strong corporate earnings reports.
Inflation at the consumer level last month was held in check by moderation in grocery prices and by the most substantial decline in energy prices in nine months. Indeed, there would have been no increase at all in the Consumer Price Index if airline fares had not jumped because Washington restored the 10 percent Federal ticket tax that had lapsed because of disputes between Congress and the White House. 
 In reaction to the report, the Dow Jones industrial average surged more than 130 points, or 2 percent. And the price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose almost a full point, pushing its yield down to 7.09 percent.
These days, said Irwin L. Kellner, president of Kellner Economic Advisers, "neither growth nor wage increases nor anything else translates into higher prices at the consumer level."
Today's set of price figures followed Friday's report that prices at the producer level climbed four-tenths of 1 percent once the erratic food and energy components were disregarded. The inflation scare produced by that report caused markets to fall sharply.
Today's report offered a contrast to the jump in the so-called core index of producer prices, with the consumer "core" rising just two-tenths of a percent, the fifth increase of that size in the last six months.
But today's figures, analysts said, do not necessarily mean that the Federal Reserve will resist raising short-term interest rates again in May. The Consumer Price Index tends to lag behind other indicators, and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, appears to be basing policy mainly on whether he thinks growth is so strong that it is likely to create strains in the economy and put pressure on prices in the months ahead.
"These data will not take the Fed off the hook if the economy remains strong," said Alan D. Levenson, an economist at UBS Securities in New York.
Many forecasters expect coming data to show that gross domestic product barreled ahead at a 4 percent pace over the winter. And there is little sign that the economy has moderated so far this spring.
Indeed, the Commerce Department said today that inventories held by business grew moderately in February even as sales were the strongest in nearly a year. Total business inventories rose three-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $1.02 trillion, after a revised rise of four-tenths of a percent in January. Sales increased by 1.4 percent, to $746.3 billion, after a 1.2 percent gain in January.
"The inventory and business sales data reinforce the view that inventories are lean," said Ken Mayland, an economist at Keycorp. That means companies are likely to step up production as long as demand remains healthy.
Despite the robust economy, analysts said they found few reasons to worry about inflation in today's price report, which showed that the cost of services rose at a slower rate of just 2.7 percent for the three months through March. The pace in the autumn quarter had been 3.2 percent, with the summer at 3.5 percent.
"Inflation's going to stay low," predicted Mickey D. Levy, economist at Nationsbank, pointing to falling oil prices, a strong dollar that is blunting the cost of imported goods, deregulation of utilities and no signs of shortages.
Indeed, energy prices skidded 1.7 percent in March, the first decline since August, as gasoline fell 2.1 percent and household fuel oil and natural gas tumbled 3.6 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. This was the biggest drop for natural gas since the Government began keeping track of it in 1952.
These lower energy prices helped keep the cost of housing, which accounts for 41 percent of the index, unchanged, and helped hold the rise in transportation to one-tenth of a percent despite the renewed airline tax and a 1.2 percent increase in the cost of used cars and of financing an automobile.
Grocery store food prices eased two-tenths of a percent, while the index for apparel declined three-tenths of a percent after six consecutive increases.
But the cost of medical care, which has been in a lengthy deceleration, jumped four-tenths of 1 percent, the most in 14 months, paced by drugs and supplies and professional fees.
Over the last 12 months, the C.P.I. climbed 2.8 percent, while the core rate excluding food and energy gained 2.5 percent.
"The market was prepared for the core to move up to as high as 2.7 percent," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist for Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal in Chicago. The lower figure, he said, "should ease the concern that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve."
Most economists say that the C.P.I. -- the basis for Federal cost-of-living and tax-bracket adjustments -- overstates inflation by a significant margin. But politicians of both parties are reluctant to incorporate this finding into their budget making out of fear of a backlash from recipients of Social Security and other Government funds who would receive smaller raises.
Prices in the New York metropolitan area rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March but only 2.5 percent for the latest 12 months.
Since March 1996 prices have risen 4.1 percent in San Francisco, 3 percent in Chicago, 2.5 percent in Philadelphia and 1.6 percent in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: New Hurdles To Trade Deals With China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 15

 BODY:
Just as the Clinton Administration heads into critical months of negotiations over China's willingness to make some far-reaching economic changes, the talks with Beijing have hit several potentially major roadblocks that make an agreement this year increasingly doubtful, Administration officials said today.
The two top American trade negotiators with Beijing are resigning. The officials, Lee M. Sands and Deborah Lehr, who have led the talks over the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organization, said they were negotiating with Mayer, Brown & Platt, a law firm that recently hired Mickey Kantor, the former United States trade representative and Commerce Secretary. 
 Their decision to join their former boss in the midst of an enormously complex negotiation that reaches far beyond trade issues, and that has become the focal point of the Administration's engagement with China this year, surprised many American officials,
Indeed, Chinese trade officials have begun warning their American counterparts, in Hong Kong and in Washington, that they are hesitant to proceed with the negotiations because they fear any agreement could further enmesh Beijing in charges swirling around the financing of the 1996 American Presidential campaign.
"They are afraid that any deal will be portrayed in Congress as something that China bought," a senior American official said. "Clearly, they are getting advice to let things cool off."
But the Justice Department is still investigating American intelligence reports that first gave rise to suspicions that China may have sought to funnel money into the campaign and influence several House and Senate races.
Chinese officials have repeatedly denied the charges, which they term fabrications intended to derail relations between the two countries. So far, little evidence has come to light directly tying the Chinese Government or third parties acting on its behalf to any specific campaign contributions. But that will be the subject of Congressional hearings expected to begin later this spring.
"You have to conclude that this does not bode well for the negotiations," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and the No. 2 official on a Presidential commission on Asian trade that just submitted its report to the White House. "It is very difficult to change negotiators in the middle of something this sensitive and complicated. And the Chinese realize that the political atmosphere in Washington is hardly favorable for them right now."
In the small world of American trade diplomacy -- the United States trade representative's office has only about 160 employees -- Mr. Sands, 45, and Ms. Lehr, 32, were regarded as two of the country's most capable negotiators. Together, they worked out the accord last year on the protection of software, videos and music that forced China to close many of the pirate factories producing illegally copied products at tremendous cost to American companies. Both speak Mandarin, and both played central roles in developing a strategy for persuading China to drop a range of restrictions on foreign companies and to phase out protection for state-run industries.
But both said that the nonstop pace of negotiating with China -- Mr. Sands has traveled there 61 times in six years -- came at considerable cost to their families. Some of their colleagues said they were frustrated that the campaign scandals had all but frozen the development of Asia policy in Washington, making the Administration leery of capitalizing on China's recent offers to slowly open long-protected areas of its economy. The plans of the two negotiators were reported today in The Washington Post.
Their departure will come only a few months after the chief American trade negotiator with Japan, Ira Shapiro, announced that he would leave to return to private law practice in Washington.
In a telephone interview today from Washington, Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Kantor's successor as trade representative, said that the departures of Mr. Sands and Ms. Lehr would be "a major loss." But she added, "I have a very good relationship with the Chinese as well." As Mr. Kantor's deputy, Ms. Barshefsky traveled to Beijing a dozen times and negotiated with the Chinese on a range of issues.
"We've never had negotiations that survived solely on individual personalities," she said. "In the end, the big decisions are made by the trade ministers."
The Clinton Administration's initial hope had been to make China's entry into the World Trade Organization a centerpiece of President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington next fall. And in recent months China has made major concessions, agreeing, for example, to give direct trading rights to foreign companies. Until now, most companies have had to work through state-run trading houses to distribute products in China.
But the hardest part of the negotiations, concerning subsidies to inefficient Chinese state industries that would be greatly harmed by open competition, are just beginning. They are likely to be taken over by Robert Cassidy, a longtime negotiator with extensive experience in Asia.
Mr. Cassidy will also find himself trying to keep together a coalition of countries with interests in China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Japan and others have been urging that China be admitted quickly, so it can be more fully integrated into the club of trading nations.
The United States, a senior Japanese official said last week in Tokyo, "is pressing too hard for major concessions" from China, and delaying the day when Beijing is forced to lower its tariffs and meet other obligations of the world trade agreement. American officials respond that Japan is seeking to ingratiate itself with Beijing while hoping to take advantage of market openings won by American negotiators.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Family Income at All-Time High

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Propelled by a 60 percent increase in Donna Hanover's income and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 27 percent raise, the joint income of New York's first couple soared to $442,778 before deductions last year, the most they have ever earned together, according to tax returns released yesterday. In 1995, they reported $303,889 in income.
The couple's income has been going up each year that Mr. Giuliani has been Mayor, mostly because of Ms. Hanover's television and movie career. 
 In 1995, she made $167,000; last year, she made just under $259,000, mostly from her work for the Television Food Network and WNYW-TV, the Fox network station where she is an interviewer and feature reporter. She also reported about $50,000 in income from film and theatrical work.
Last year was also the first in which Mr. Giuliani benefited from the raise he signed into effect in 1995 for himself and other top city managers. Although his official salary is now $165,000, compared with $130,000 in 1995, he reported an income of $166,660 last year because of a retroactive raise payment from the year before, minus a contribution to a tax-deferred pension.
The couple's income was by far the largest of any of the mayoral candidates'. It was twice as much as the next largest earner, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan. None of the candidates reported anything particularly unusual, although Ms. Messinger made a point of giving her $19,000 raise to charity, with most of it going to the New York Community Trust to support its economic development and employment programs. As a result, she had a much larger charitable deduction than the other candidates.
The Rev. Al Sharpton filed for an extension of time to submit his return after many of his tax records were destroyed in a recent fire at his campaign office. Michael Hardy, his lawyer, said that Mr. Sharpton estimated his income at about $50,000 and had sent the Internal Revenue Service a check for $1,500. The lost material, he said, included many of the receipts from the private speaking engagements that constitute much of Mr. Sharpton's income.
Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Hanover, who filed jointly, paid $123,873 in Federal tax last year, or 28 percent of their income, along with $49,285 in state and city taxes.
Although most of their income came from wages and earnings, they also reported $3,735 in dividends, $4,892 in capital gains, and $4,380 as the estimated value of the daily trips to and from work in city cars under police protection.
The couple paid $17,600 for child care during 1996, or about $338 a week, and also paid the provider's Social Security and Medicare taxes.
They also claimed $11,635 in charitable contributions to 43 recipients, including $1,000 each to the Convent of the Sacred Heart and St. David's School, which their children attend. The contributions included $800 to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association Widows and Children's Fund. The Mayor and the police union are currently at odds over the union's new contract.
Ms. Messinger and her husband, Andrew Lachman, paid $25,415 in Federal taxes on a joint income of $201,906, or 13 percent of their income, along with $15,007 in state and city taxes. Most of their income came from their salaries as Borough President and public school administrator.
Including the donation to the community trust, Ms. Messinger and Mr. Lachman contributed $28,323 to 97 charities. The second largest was to their synagogue, the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, and they also donated $780 worth of clothing to Housing Works. The couple reported $5,516 in capital gains from the sale of 15-year state and city bonds.
Councilman Sal F. Albanese and his wife, Lorraine, a secretary, paid $40,054 in Federal taxes on a joint income of $190,629, or 21 percent of their income, along with $19,922 in state and city taxes. Most of their income came from salaries and Mr. Albanese's outside income as a lawyer, and the couple reported a large capital gain -- $54,056 -- from the sale of several stocks, including Time Warner and Boston Life Science.
As a result of the stock sales, Mr. Albanese was the only candidate to owe money at tax time, and the only one to pay a penalty for underpayment of taxes.
The couple reported $3,125 in charitable contributions, but did not specify the recipients on their return.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, and his wife, Aramina, a public school principal, paid $33,093 in Federal taxes on a joint income of $188,700, or 18 percent of their income, along with $18,661 in state and city taxes. Except for $116 in interest, all of their income came from their salaries.
The couple reported $7,860 in charitable contributions, including $4,870 worth of items donated to the Salvation Army, and a donation of $1,500 to Our Lady of Angels Roman Catholic Church.

HEADLINE: Albright to Go to Hong Kong For Transfer of Rule to China

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced tonight that she would go to Hong Kong to represent the United States in the ceremonies marking the return of the British colony to Chinese rule on July 1.
Ms. Albright, invited by the Governments of China and Britain, will lead the American delegation to the ceremonies, which she said the world would watch "with a mixture of hope and concern." 
 She accepted the invitation only after considerable discussion within the Clinton Administration over the diplomatic sensitivities involved in a ceremony, which will celebrate the transfer of a vibrant colony to Communist rule.
She also discussed the invitation on Monday with Martin Lee, a prominent democratic leader in Hong Kong, who "strongly urged" her to attend, an aide to the Secretary said.
Ms. Albright made her announcement during a speech tonight at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. In the speech, she reiterated that the United States was committed to military, economic and political stability in Asia and defended the Clinton Administration's policy of engaging China, despite concerns about Beijing's repression of dissent and its record on human rights.
Beijing's actions as it moves to establish control over Hong Kong have been increasingly viewed as a test of Washington's China policy, particularly in Congress, where there is talk of threatening sanctions if China represses personal or political liberties.
The Clinton Administration faced criticism of its policies last month after Vice President Al Gore bypassed Hong Kong on a trip to China. On Monday, however, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton announced that they would meet with Mr. Lee later this week, a move that seemed sure to annoy leaders in Beijing.
Ms. Albright said the United States supported "the preservation of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and its way of life and basic freedoms." Some 40,000 Americans live in Hong Kong, she noted, while American investments there total $13 billion.
By attending the ceremonies marking the transfer of power, "I will underline American support for the continuation of Hong Kong's current way of life and freedoms," Ms. Albright said. "And I will emphasize America's continued involvement in protecting our interests and supporting Hong Kong's people as they enter the Chinese nation."
Ms. Albright's decision comes after the Chinese have already taken a number of steps that have provoked concern over how Beijing will deal with political and civil liberties in Hong Kong.
Beijing has set up its own legislature for the area, which has decided to scrap parts of a bill of rights for Hong Kong drafted after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. And its designated Chief Executive for Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, has said he intends to set limits on public protests and free association.

HEADLINE: 6 Copters Have Crashed in East River Since '85

BYLINE: By TONY MARCANO 

 BODY:
The East River has been the site of six helicopter accidents in the last 12 years. And while the cause of yesterday's crash remains under investigation, in most such helicopter accidents around the city the culprit was mechanical failure, rather than pilot error.
Four of the helicopter accidents in the East River since 1985 were attributed to engine failure. In another instance, the pilot told investigators that a sudden gust of wind blew his craft off course. 
 Before yesterday's crash, the most recent incident was in October 1993, when four tourists from Paris escaped injury when a sightseeing helicopter owned by Island Helicopter of Garden City lost power and was forced to make an emergency landing in the East River near Wall Street. Several months earlier, a helicopter owned by the same Long Island company made an emergency landing in Central Park under similar circumstances.
Island Helicopter also owned three helicopters that crashed between 1985 and 1990. All of those crashes occurred at the East 34th Street Heliport and resulted in fatalities.
On April 27, 1985, a helicopter that was taking off from the East 34th Street Heliport plunged into the river. Three years later, a man was killed and four others were hurt when an Island Helicopter aircraft crashed into the river while attempting to land at the same heliport. On Feb. 11, 1990, a 14-year-old boy died after being trapped in the cold water when a sightseeing helicopter went down. It was in that incident that the pilot cited weather-related problems.
In another incident involving an Island Helicopter craft, five people were rescued unharmed on April 1, 1991, when a helicopter whose engine failed ditched in the East River.
Island Helicopter, which also operates as the National Helicopter Corporation of America, has long been a nemesis of Manhattan residents. As the main tenant of the East 34th Street Heliport, it is responsible for nearly 40 percent of the 400 daily helicopter takeoffs and landings at the city's four heliports, according to a study by the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Traffic at all four heliports has been on the rise, mostly because of the increasing popularity of airborne sightseeing tours. From 1994 to 1995, the number of takeoffs and landings increased by about 11 percent at the East 34th Street and West 30th Street Heliports, 2 percent at the East 60th Street Heliport and 1.3 percent at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport near the Battery.
Residents have long complained that the helicopter noise has been excessive and have claimed that National and other tour operators fly low and slow to allow better viewing for sightseers. Responding to those complaints, the city, which owns the East 34th Street Heliport, had attempted to cut by 50 percent the number of flights there, but a Federal judge ruled in January that the city had insufficient grounds to justify the restriction.

HEADLINE: Mixed Results for Public School Proponents

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss.

 BODY:
No one is saying that the future of public education comes down to a group started by 20 parents here in Mississippi's capital.
But as big-city schools continue to lose white and middle-class minority students and as alternatives to public education like systems using school vouchers continue to hover on the horizon, there is an intriguing glimpse of American education in that group, Parents for Public Schools. 
 The group, which got its start in 1989 at a gathering of mostly affluent white parents in the living room of Dick Molpus, who was then Mississippi's Secretary of State, began with a simple idea: If parents want to support and nurture public schools, they should put their children in them. Out of that idea has grown a national organization that now includes minority parents and has 50 chapters in 22 states. The chapters work on a long-term basis to upgrade public education in entire communities or school districts.
Despite some successes, however, Parents for Public Schools is also a case study in the limits of good intentions when it comes to revitalizing public education.
Although the group's growth is a signal that many others want to embrace its philosophy that healthy public schools are fundamental to the nation's future, even here in Jackson the percentage of whites in the schools continues to dwindle.
In the 1988-89 school year, black students made up 77 percent of the district, and white students 23 percent. Now the district's 32,414 students are 87.7 percent black and 11.6 percent white. Of the four elementary schools with a substantial white enrollment -- where much of the group's energy was originally focused -- all have seen a significant decline in the percentage of whites in recent years.
And such declines are occurring throughout the country, as highlighted by a recent study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which found the fastest rate of school resegregation since the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.
"There are a lot of people in the country in a lot of different roles who are in a sense desperate for ways to make public education work, so I think an organization like this has enormous potential," said M. Hayes Mizell, a member of the group's board who works on education with the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation in New York. "But a broad philosophical kind of support for education will only take you so far. And that's why unless you really come to grips with an improvement agenda, and you really strike at the heart of what education is all about, the general notion of supporting public education can take you only so far."
In some ways, the growth of Parents for Public Schools has been remarkable. Its 50 chapters are in places as diverse as Greenville, S.C.; Waco, Tex.; Ellenville, N.Y.; Teaneck, N.J.; Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Cleveland. Beyond enrolling their children in local public schools, members of the group focus on concerns like bond issues, overcrowding or alternative schools. Through conferences, literature and joint planning, members share information on common education problems and strategies for addressing them.
In Cincinnati, the chapter helped organize support for two successful bond issues in recent years, and has organized a public rally for public education.
Brewster Rhoads, vice president of the Cincinnati chapter, said, "I think it's absolutely essential that parents become more involved than they've ever been, not just in supporting their own kids' school, but also in making sure that the community at large rededicates itself to making sure that public schools work."
In Jackson, members of Parents for Public Schools say the continued shift in the racial balance of the schools reflects in part the growth of the black population.
"If it wasn't for Parents for Public Schools, this would probably be an all-minority district today," said Kelly Butler, the group's executive director. "We put a thumb in the dike even if we didn't completely reverse the tide."
Consequently, the group has changed its focus from recruiting white parents to building alliances of parents of different races and economic backgrounds to find solutions to problems in the schools.
Here in Jackson, for example, the chapter president is white but the chairman of the task force that deals with specific issues is black, and the board is about half black and half white. The national board has 6 minority members out of 23.
The group has no schedule for growth, but officials say they get up to about 10 inquiries about possible new chapters a week, and hope to be active in all 50 states before long.
"There are a host of worthwhile organizations working to improve particular schools," Mr. Molpus said. "We can be the voice for systemic reform at the school district level around the country. If that happens, I think you'll see some of the divisiveness along racial and class lines healed."
Still, most chapters depend on the efforts of a small core group, and local leaders of Parents for Public Schools are wary of grand claims.
In addition to the forces pulling white and middle-class minority students from public schools, they say, is the simple factor of time: parents involved in their own lives and schools can find it hard to stretch to find energy for such an organization.
"It is swimming against the tide, but that doesn't mean we have to sink," said Margaret Hulbert, president of the Cincinnati chapter. "Parents for Public Schools provides so much emotional and intellectual support. It's easy to look at the problems of the schools and say, 'Why bother?' It really helps to know other people are finding ways to make things work."

HEADLINE: Bill Gives City New Powers To Fight Crime at Markets

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
With the hard-won blessing of labor leaders, the Giuliani administration and the City Council agreed yesterday on a bill to give the city sweeping new powers to combat organized crime at the city's five major wholesale food markets.
Under the agreement, the city would be allowed for the first time to investigate and expel officials of unions who are suspected of having connections to the Mafia, which investigators say controls the markets and has long inflated prices through kickbacks and extortion. 
 But after a day of intense lobbying by a broad coalition of union leaders, the city retreated from its insistence on having the final word on the expulsion of union officials. Instead, those accused of being corrupt could appeal the city's decision to an arbitrator, whose ruling would be binding. The city also agreed to changes that would limit its ability to ban union leaders for crimes committed many years ago.
If passed by the full Council, as expected, the legislation would dramatically expand the scope of a campaign begun by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1995 to reform the markets and the city's garbage-hauling business through stricter city regulations and background checks on owners and workers.
It would strengthen controls already in place at the Fulton Fish Market in lower Manhattan, and would take investigators for the first time into the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, the Brooklyn Terminal Market in Sunset Park, the Gansevoort Meat Market in Greenwich Village, and the Brooklyn Wholesale Meat Market in Canarsie.
The markets are vital to the city's economy, handling most of the fresh fish and unpackaged fruit, vegetables and meat shipped into the region. More than 200 businesses in the markets generate more than $3 billion in sales annually and employ about 8,000 people. The fish market alone generates about $1 billion a year in sales and is the nation's largest seafood distribution center.
But law-enforcement officials say that for decades, mobsters extorted money from merchants to quell labor unrest and demanded no-show jobs for their friends and relatives, driving up prices for retailers and closing down some wholesalers.
The agreement came after a day of closed-door meetings in which the bill was changed several times, and labor leaders and city officials both claimed victory. Union leaders had mounted an aggressive campaign against the administration's plan, saying it would set a dangerous precedent in allowing the city to meddle in union affairs, and they called the changes significant.
"Union sovereignty has been upheld," said Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin of Queens, the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, the bill's main opponent.
Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro, one of the architects of the administration's plan, said that while the city agency in charge of the plan, the Department of Business Services, would have to abide by an independent review, the compromise allowed the city to choose the panel of arbitrators from the Office of Collective Bargaining. An accused union official would then pick one arbitrator from that panel to decide his case.
"So the Commissioner of Business Services is still ultimately responsible for all aspects of the enforcement here," Mr. Mastro said. "The heart and soul of this bill remains."
The bill was passed in a 5-to-2 vote yesterday by a City Council committee, and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who brokered many of yesterday's changes, said he expected the full Council to pass the bill at its next meeting on April 30. "I would not have okayed this unless I thought it was right and fair," he said.
The bill is written in such a way that it restricts the city's power to fingerprint workers and run background checks to members and officials of three union locals that have been linked by convictions and indictments to the Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families: the United Seafood Workers Local 359 of the United Food and Commercial Workers; Local 174 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, and Local 202 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

HEADLINE: Banks Discover the South Bronx;
Forced to Open, Branches Profit and Refute Stereotype

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Felipe Guzman brimmed with ambition. After working for United Parcel Service and a thriving grocery store, the 27-year-old Dominican immigrant wanted to break out on his own and open a bodega in the South Bronx.
Convinced that he did not have the credit history to get a bank loan, he followed the path of his father and thousands of immigrants before him: he borrowed from a Dominican "prestamista," or loan shark. Agreeing to what he said are typical terms for such loans, Mr. Guzman received a two-year, $75,000 loan at 30 percent interest and bought a rundown bodega on the corner of 183d Street and Grand Concourse. 
 Last spring, as business dwindled and he struggled to make loan payments of nearly $5,000 a month, Mr. Guzman turned to an unlikely savior. On his cousin's recommendation, he visited a nearby Fleet Bank branch that had opened in September 1995. To his surprise, he received a $25,000 line of credit at 12.5 percent interest. He remodeled the bodega, the Ceneida Superette, and business has taken off.
Mr. Guzman's success may be part of a nascent revolution. In a challenge to long-running assumptions about banking in low-income areas, three of the four new bank branches and loan offices in the South Bronx are performing above expectations. The arrival of the branches and loan offices over the last 19 months -- the first group arrival in the South Bronx in 20 years -- is largely a result of a series of innovative attacks by Matthew Lee, a community advocate.
A tall, lanky organizer virtually unknown to the public, Mr. Lee is a lightning rod in banking circles. He said that the success of the new banks proved what advocates had maintained for decades: If banks open branches in low-income neighborhoods and aggressively pursue customers -- especially small businesses -- they can attract immigrants and the working poor who now rely on loan sharks and check-cashing services. Banks, Mr. Lee contends, can help rejuvenate blighted areas and make a profit.
Bank officials said they had intended to open new branches in the South Bronx, but the four new branches and loan offices resulted primarily from challenges Mr. Lee filed under the Community Reinvestment Act. Enacted by Congress in 1977, the law requires banks to provide services and loans to low-income neighborhoods in cities where they operate. Under the measure, community groups have the right to challenge or ask Federal regulators to block a proposed bank merger based on a bank's poor effort under the law.
Even foes of Mr. Lee grudgingly admit that he has mastered the complex Community Reinvestment Act and has skillfully used it to force banks to open branches in the South Bronx. Dressed in jeans, Mr. Lee, a bearded 32-year-old, tirelessly buzzes around the dilapidated but computer-equipped offices of Inner City Press, the free newspaper he founded, and Community on the Move, the advocacy group he coordinates.
"It was clear redlining," he said of the dearth of banks in the South Bronx three years ago. "They were dividing the area up by race."
Bankers say the issue is far more complicated and contend that their success in the South Bronx is a result of the economic revival of the neighborhood. The same success would not necessarily occur, they say, if several branches opened in other low-income neighborhoods.
But Mr. Lee and bank executives agree that the South Bronx is disproving stereotypes. Bankers' assumption that money cannot be made in poor neighborhoods and advocates' assumption that bankers systematically avoid minority neighborhoods are being undermined.
Jeffrey Barker, Fleet Bank's vice president for New York City bank operations, said of the South Bronx branch: "It's done exceptionally well. It's absolutely a profitable branch. I treat it no differently than any branch in midtown Manhattan. In fact, I think the growth potential may be greater up there."
Fleet Bank, which is working to counter accusations of failing to lend to poor people, was not alone in reporting favorable results. Republic National Bank and Marine Midland Bank both report that business in the loan processing offices they opened in the South Bronx in September 1995 are ahead of projections.
Only Dime Savings, which reopened a branch in February 1996, says it is running behind projections. But Dime officials attributed the slow start to the lack of a lending program for small businesses and said they expected the branch to be profitable by summer.
In 1994, Mr. Lee said, only four major banks -- Chemical, Emigrant, Banco Popular and Apple -- had branches in the South Bronx, whose population is about 500,000. Even with European American Bank and North Fork Bank scheduled to open branches this year, Mr. Lee says the neighborhood is underserved.
The Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a nonprofit organization, said the city's richer neighborhoods had more banking services available than the city's poorer areas. In Manhattan in 1996, there was one bank branch for every 2,709 residents, compared with one branch for every 12,038 residents in the Bronx.
Charles Hamm, president of Independence Savings Bank, based in Brooklyn, and a member of the board of the New York State Banking Department, said that redlining, a practice in which poor areas are identified and excluded from lending, no longer existed in New York. The problem, he said, is that a neighborhood needs a minimum number of small businesses and middle-income customers for a bank to turn a profit.
Martin Liebman, Marine Midland's president for metropolitan New York, said that the South Bronx was unique because of a 20-year-old, multibillion-dollar effort by the city and the Federal Government to build more than 30,000 housing units in a neighborhood that epitomized urban decay. The investment, he said, attracted middle-income residents and fueled a broad economic upswing that has helped the new branches.
The key to rejuvenating low-income areas, Mr. Hamm said, is active local leadership. He said that despite aggressive efforts to make loans in low-income areas in Brooklyn, his bank failed to find customers. Independence agreed last fall to open a branch in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, although no opening date has been set. Mr. Hamm committed to the project after residents in the area, which had no bank branches and one of the city's largest public housing projects, met his challenge to collect 3,000 signatures.
"This is the best opportunity in 20 years in some neighborhoods that have traditionally been seen as hopeless," he said. "But one thing we need at the community level is less talk and more action."
But Roland Collymore, a 29-year-old South Bronx resident, said small businesses were in desperate need of capital.
In the spring of 1995, he said, he wanted to start a company in the South Bronx that would import Caribbean soft drinks. Two major banks rejected his applications for a small-business loan and Mr. Collymore, who emigrated from Trinidad when he was 8 years old, was told to see a credit counselor. But when he went to a counseling service, Mr. Collymore said, he was told that his credit history was excellent.
In June 1995, Republic National Bank approved his loan application. In exchange for placing $8,000 in a Republic account, Mr. Collymore received a $19,000 loan. Nearly two years later, Collymore Distribution Inc. is doing $80,000 a year in business and is growing steadily.
"I think there were two reasons I couldn't get a loan," said Mr. Collymore, who is black. "The first was the location of my business. The second was racial discrimination."
Mr. Lee, whose office is around the corner from a closed bank branch that was turned into a gospel church, is now helping a dozen community groups across the country to use the Community Reinvestment Act to bring their own challenges against banks. "The issue is fairness everywhere, not just the squeaky wheel gets the grease," he said.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Declining Birthrates Irk Grandparents and Other Experts

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Despite the gallery of charts and graphs on display tomorrow night, Ben Wattenberg, the host of "Think Tank," is not running for the Ross Perot Tony of 1997. He's out to demonstrate that birthrates are going down everywhere, with momentous social and economic consequences. Along the way, he demonstrates that a significant subject does not necessarily make for an enthralling hour of television.
The data in "The Grandchild Gap" is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records: modern industrial nations, including the United States, now have their lowest birthrates ever, below replacement levels, and the numbers are dropping in poorer countries too. As Mr. Wattenberg reports, they've got a lot less babies even in Brazil. 
 The main reasons for the decline, elaborated on here, can be no secret to PBS viewers: Women are going in for contraception and careers. As for the consequences, if you haven't heard about the problems facing Social Security and Medicare as the old get older and the young get fewer, you've been tuned to the wrong channels.
Mr. Wattenberg's interviews with groups of young women who are putting off having children in deference to making a living and parents who would like their grown offspring to give them some grandchildren smack of afternoon television. And the experts he calls on in several countries have a way of repeating one another even when they aren't saying much.
Lurking here is an argument against Zero Population Growth advocates, whose hearts are presumably dancing at the prospect that the number of bodies on the globe may stop increasing a century from now. Mr. Wattenberg (who is associated with the American Enterprise Institute, no anti-growth operation) is not rejoicing; he seems to be worried about family values, among other things.
But instead of digging into the question of how many people are enough and why, Mr. Wattenberg, enamored of his charts and without much help from his producers, only touches on what he sees as dire long-term consequences for Western societies. The worst news is that if the birthrate in Italy continues its present slide, in 200 years there will be no more Italians.
But take heart. Somebody reports that the shortage of grandchildren is proving a boon to the pet industry, and the program set me to thinking about renting out 5-year-old Andrew and 1-year-old Rebecca to grandchildless 60-somethings.

HEADLINE: MUSIC REVIEW;
A Consolidated Orchestra That's Thriving

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The season about to end has been fraught with labor unrest, budget crunches and hand-wringing about the state of the music world. These worries are nothing new: similar crises arise every few decades, and solutions that may seem painful at the time often prove workable in the long run. The remarkable performance by the Virginia Symphony at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening was a reminder that consolidation can have its benefits.
The Virginia Symphony began as the Norfolk Symphony in the 1920's, but when the recession of the late 1970's put several orchestras in peril, it merged with the Penninsula Symphony and the Virginia Beach Pops and took its current name. 
 It now plays a 42-week season that takes it all over Virginia. Most crucially, its performance on Tuesday was energetic, committed and, for the most part, finely polished.
JoAnn Falletta, the orchestra's music director since 1991, framed the concert with Barber's First Symphony and Elgar's "Enigma" Variations, works that showed off the orchestra's strengths, both section by section and as a polished ensemble. Ms. Falletta is a demonstrative, kinetic conductor, and if her gestures sometimes seemed excessively grand, they achieved clear results.
In particular, she brought a lovely sweep to the Elgar, and elicited not only a rich, warm string sound but also superbly detailed wind and brass playing.
Between the Barber and the Elgar, Ms. Falletta led the New York premiere of Adolphus Hailstork's Piano Concerto, a neo-Romantic work packed with attractive melodies and almost Tchaikovskian opportunities for technical display. Leon Bates was the soloist, and equally at home in the ruminative lyrical sections and the stretches of bravura scoring.

HEADLINE: For WNET, A New Fund And a New Security

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
Under the chandeliers in the Plaza Hotel's ballroom tonight, the usual crowd will gather for Channel 13's annual black-tie dinner, but the fund-raising announcement they hear will not be the usual one.
Henry R. Kravis, chairman of WNET's board, will announce that the station's capital campaign has raised more than $70 million, far more than has ever been raised by a public television station before, with nearly two-thirds of it going into the station's first endowment. 
 Also unusual is that most of the endowment's income is to be used not for buildings or equipment but for research and development in programming and Internet educational services.
The news that WNET/Thirteen has exceeded its goal of $65 million, set at the capital campaign's start five years ago, comes just as the station is facing several major challenges: the threat of further cuts in Federal and state financing for public television, an increase in competition for corporate and foundation money and the creative challenge from its chief programming rival, WGBH in Boston.
WNET and WGBH are by far the two most prolific producing stations in the public system, providing the bulk of the programs seen nationally on PBS.
Giving Thirteen's programmers an extra $1.75 million or more each year to invest in developing programs, as envisaged, could make a big difference in what viewers ultimately see on Channel 13 in this area and on PBS across the country.
Since the capital campaign began, three projects have arisen in part because of the security it promised, said the station's president, William F. Baker. One is City Arts, a half-hour magazine show about creative developments in arts fields in New York City, which won five local Emmy Awards last year and is nominated for 11 this year.
Another is Reel New York, a summer series showcasing films and videos by local independent film makers. The third is broadcasting the first hour of the Tony Awards on June 1. With CBS wanting to broadcast the theater awards show only from 9 to 11 P.M., Jed Bernstein of the League of American Theaters and Producers approached Mr. Baker about broadcasting the first hour.
"In the past I would have needed time to chase down an underwriter," Mr. Baker said, noting that production costs would probably reach $280,000. With PBS agreeing to foot about half the bill, Mr. Baker could sign the deal almost immediately.
It was Mr. Kravis who had the idea of creating an endowment for WNET.
"As a trustee, I was always amazed that the station went hand-to-mouth each year, raising just enough money to get the programming done," Mr. Kravis, a founding partner of Kravis Kohlberg Roberts & Company, said in an interview. "For an institution with an annual budget of well over $100 million, that is no way to operate. Other great cultural institutions have large endowments -- museums, libraries, great universities -- and if you think about Thirteen, it's all those in one, a museum, a library, a university, and with the ability to reach millions of people every day."
Mr. Kravis started the campaign by donating $5 million himself. The gift was used to start a new media center where WNET has developed a advanced Web site and a multitude of electronic learning materials accessible to teachers.
More important to the general viewer, the endowment creates possibilities for better programs. The challenge of finding it belongs to two people Mr. Baker hired two years ago: Ward B. Chamberlin Jr., station vice president, and Tamara E. Robinson, vice president for national programming.
At that time, WNET had a reputation for producing first-class programs about the performing arts and natural sciences but was also known for shunning producers who wanted to tackle difficult documentary subjects.
Such people went to WGBH, which has regularly been winning more of the prestigious broadcast journalism awards than anyone else. (Six of the eight Peabody Awards won by PBS stations for last season went to WGBH.)
Mr. Chamberlin and Ms. Robinson began reaching out to producers with ambitious ideas. David Grubin proposed a five-part series on the brain; Thirteen embraced it and has applied to the National Science Foundation for additional money.
Ric Burns, a New York producer working on a 10-hour documentary about New York City, had been frustrated in his attempts to have WNET become a co-producer with WGBH, his regular producer. Ms. Robinson has made that happen. She also gave research money to the independent producers Joel Sucher and Steven Fischler to pursue a project on the history of aviation.
"Since Tammy and Ward came, there's a lot more focus on programming," said Joan Ganz Cooney, a Thirteen board member and a founder of Children's Television Workshop. "They've got a better mix, and it's just plain livelier. It's less predictable."
Lively is not always profound. New series have included "Going Places," a travelogue with Al Roker, the NBC weatherman, as host, and "Savage Skies," about tornadoes. But both series have been popular with PBS stations around the country.
"You do see a difference," said Bill Young, program director at the PBS station in Dallas, KERA. "It's the number of quality things coming out of there now, things they put in place a year or two ago."
In the last two years, WNET has increased its output to 87 hours from 14 hours at a cost of about $40 million. Sixteen new series are scheduled for next season along with the regular flow of programs in the station's signature series: "American Masters," "Great Performances," "In the Spotlight," "Nature" and "In the Wild."
Among the new offerings next season is a four-part series called "Stephen Hawking's Universe," about black holes, the Big Bang, and the search for a unifying theory about the universe, from Aristotle to Mr. Hawking himself.
"One of my goals is to have a major science series each year, along the lines of the Stephen Hawking project," Ms. Robinson said. Another goal, she said, is to make sure a new weekly half-hour series about religion and ethics takes permanent root nationally.
Thirteen's programming department has also reopened its doors to independent film makers.
"A few years ago WNET cut 'Independent Focus,' which was then the longest-running independent film series on television," said Ruby Lerner, executive director of the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers.
For two or three years, independent film makers got either no response or an endless runaround from WNET, Ms. Lerner said. Then Mr. Chamberlin and Ms. Robinson promoted Anne Gorfinkle, who had strong ties with independent film makers, to deputy director of programming and began meeting with the independents again. The result was "Reel New York."
"It was fully funded by WNET, which we weren't expecting," Ms. Lerner said. "We thought we'd have to help them beat the bushes in fund-raising. And working with their programming staff was like a love fest. Someone said, 'I remember sitting around this same table 10 years ago and nearly getting into a fistfight.' It's been a big change in a relationship that was often openly hostile in the past."
The money to produce programs still has to come from Thirteen's contributors, foundation and corporation sponsors and government agencies. Of the $70 million capital campaign, $55 million is in hand and $35 million of that has been set aside as endowment.
"This will never replace annual giving," said Paula A. Kerger, WNET's vice president for development. "But it will keep a strand of money dedicated to new programming and will cushion us for any major swing in the economy or in Washington."

HEADLINE: U.N. Ignores U.S. Call to Rule That Iraqi Flight Broke Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 16

 BODY:
In a setback for the United States, the Security Council issued a statement today that did not condemn Iraq for violating sanctions by flying a group of Muslims to Saudi Arabia last week without United Nations permission so they could make the pilgrimage to Mecca.
After four days of tortuous diplomacy, the Council issued a unanimous statement that failed to say whether the flight violated sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or deliver even the mildest rebuke to Iraq after China and Egypt, with varying degrees of support from Russia and France, took a firm stand against criticizing Baghdad. 
 President Saddam Hussein issued a defiant statement in Baghdad on Monday saying Iraq had only "exercised its inherent right to use its civilian aircraft," calling America's position "illegal, tendentious and arbitrary" and warning that he reserves the right to fly planes again.
The statement today failed to reflect the vigorous denunciations of the flight issued last week by the American representative, Bill Richardson, who called it a "flagrant violation" of sanctions. It even fell short of a mildly critical draft circulated earlier that expressed the Council's "concern" over Iraq's action.
Instead, the statement recalled that Iraq had originally asked the Security Council committee overseeing sanctions for permission to fly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia and also to release $50 million in frozen funds held by Persian Gulf countries to cover their expenses.
The committee replied that it would be better placed to consider such a request if it came from a country willing to release funds to pay the pilgrims' costs.
The statement said: "The Government of Iraq proceeded with this particular flight without specific consultation with the committee. Such consultation would have allowed the committee to consider the matter and to determine whether the flight required committee approval under the relevant resolutions."
The Council urged all member nations to meet their obligations under these resolutions and underlined "its respect for the obligation of Muslims to perform the haj pilgrimage."
Members have not yet considered a far more serious list of accusations against Iraq drawn up last week by the United Nations commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
In that report, the commission's chief officer, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, says that five years after the Persian Gulf war, Iraq had still not made "the major political decision" needed "to give up, once and for all, all capabilities and ambition to retain or acquire the proscribed weapons."
He said Iraq continued to harass his arms inspectors. And he accused Iraq of failing to account satisfactorily for all its long-range Scud missiles, underreporting production of bulk biological warfare agents, failing to declare all chemical bombs and retaining the technology and equipment for "large-scale production of VX," a lethal nerve gas.
The reluctance of France and Russia in particular to criticize Baghdad in today's statement reflects those countries' growing impatience with the trade embargo against Iraq, which they fear the United States plans to retain as long as President Hussein remains in power.
Russia and France want to see Iraq selling its oil and trading normally again because they are owed billions of dollars for weaponry sold to President Hussein and because their companies have signed lucrative contracts to develop new Iraqi oil fields that remain frozen for as long as sanctions are in place.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Prices Surge as Report Shows Lower U.S. Inventories

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices surged yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after a report showed United States coffee inventories were lower than expected.
On other markets, corn and beef futures fell sharply on a report that an Indiana man died of an illness similar to so-called mad-cow disease. 
 Coffee reserves rose by 111,000 132-pound bags, to 1.657 million bags in March, leaving them 30 percent below a year ago, the Green Coffee Association reported after markets closed on Tuesday. Most traders had predicted an increase of 200,000 to 300,000 bags.
With exports from Central America and Colombia set for a seasonal decline and Brazil's harvest several months away, concern is now mounting that reserves will dwindle.
Coffee for May delivery jumped 15.65 cents, to $2.0805 a pound.
Coffee prices were also bolstered by labor unrest in Brazil. Dockworkers at the port of Santos, Brazil's largest, walked off the job on Tuesday to protest the hiring of nonunion employees. Brazil is the world's largest producer of coffee.
Cattle and corn fell after The Times of Hammond, Ind., said a man died of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease on March 30. The brain-wasting ailment was found in Britain in recent years among people whose deaths were linked to eating beef from cattle suffering bovine spongiform encephelopathy, known as mad-cow disease. No direct link between the two diseases has ever been found.
Officials of the Indiana State Department of Health declined to confirm the cause of the man's death. The Agriculture Department said "there's no evidence of B.S.E." in the United States herd.
Still, the report prompted anxiety among traders that consumer demand for beef would drop.
Live cattle for June delivery fell the 1.5-cent limit, to 63.90 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Corn is the primary ingredient in livestock feed, and July corn fell 6.75 cents, to $2.9725 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off vs. Yen on Remarks By Officials in Japan and U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher yesterday but fell against the yen after Japan's top currency policy maker said the yen was too weak and the senior United States trade negotiator warned Japan to curb its growing surplus.
The remarks by Eisuke Sakakibara, director of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, and by the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, reinforced fears in the market that the United States and Japan would act jointly to prop up the yen. 
 The dollar's strength in other dealings came on news of a surge in United States industrial output in March and a monthly report by Germany's central bank that said the dollar's levels reflected a healthy United States economy.
Trading was subdued ahead of the Commerce Department's report today on the United States trade balance for February.
"The market is just waiting for those trade numbers," said Steve Warendorf, chief dealer and vice president at Girocredit Bank in New York. In the wake of the comments by Mr. Sakakibara and Ms. Barshefsky, he said, "those trade numbers need to be seen."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 125.73 yen, down from 126.09 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.7283 German marks from 1.7270 marks. The British pound fell to $1.6244 from $1.6316.
Mr. Sakakibara, widely viewed as the architect of Japan's foreign-exchange policy, told a meeting of the Tokyo Forex Club that the dollar's recent surge to four-and-a-half-year highs against the yen was "clearly excessive." Reiterating what other Japanese monetary officials have said, he warned that they would take action if deemed appropriate.
Ms. Barshefsky told reporters in Washington that the United States remained concerned about Japan's trade surplus. She also said that President Clinton would convey the concern to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto when they meet in Washington on April 25.
Despite the dollar's retreat against the yen, traders said that the basic economic forces pushing the dollar higher against the yen remain in place: higher United States interest rates and low rates in Japan, which have attracted Japanese investment in the United States.
"I think people are still nervous about what the Japanese will do to defend the yen," said Bob McEntee, a currency trader at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia. "But I can't see a lot of people looking to buy yen either, given the rates over there."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
America's trade gap is (1) a disaster (2) a sign of success.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S 1985 all over again. America's trade deficit is ballooning, thanks mostly to the huge imbalance with Asia. Only this time the "culprit" is authoritarian China rather than Japan, our democratic ally. And even Newt Gingrich, a stalwart free-trader, is warning the Chinese to shape up or sell their teddy bears and running shoes somewhere else.
Is this deficit worth worrying about? Well, yes, no and maybe. 
 Yes, because it reflects relatively low savings rates in a rich nation with an aging population that requires huge borrowings of capital from abroad.
But no, few economists are losing sleep over last year's near-record $165 billion deficit on the most comprehensive measure of international financial exchange, the current account. Indeed, in some ways, it is a sign of success. Robert Z. Lawrence of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard notes that the doubling of the deficit since 1992 has been driven by a steady economic advance in America -- and stagnation in Japan and Europe.
And maybe the deficit is a blessing in disguise because it gives American business a political weapon to beat back foreign competition.
Even the record $39 billion deficit with China amounts to less than meets the eye. In part, it follows from Beijing's desire to amass foreign currency reserves on the eve of the takeover of Hong Kong. More important, suggests Nicholas R. Lardy of the Brookings Institution, it comes when China is inheriting export markets from the more productive, higher-wage economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. "Taken as a group," he said, "China and the four tigers had a smaller share of world exports in key labor-intensive industries in 1994 than they did in 1984."
To most people, trade deficits mean jobs lost to peasants willing to work for a bowl of rice (or a burrito) a day. But to economists, jobs are just not part of the trade equation: the Federal Reserve largely determines employment. Indeed, the Fed has just raised interest rates, serving notice that it wants to restrain further reductions in joblessness, no matter how successful exporters are, out of fear that excessively tight labor markets will lead to higher inflation.
For better or worse, the current account deficit is simply the other side of an immutable accounting identity -- the difference between domestic investment and savings. Countries like Japan that save more than they invest automatically run surpluses. The black ink shows up as added holdings of foreign securities and property. Chronic deficit economies, like America's, are in effect selling assets to finance foreign purchases.
Deficits are bad if individuals are consuming the proceeds of the asset sales when they ought to be worrying about how they will get by when they retire. But it's good news when it reflects a surfeit of investment opportunities.
By this reckoning, America rates a B-minus. Private savings are low, but Washington has taken decisive action to curb the Government's dissavings by reducing the budget deficit.
Note, too, that the current account deficit shrank from a peak of 3.6 percent of national output in 1987 to 2.1 percent in 1996. It will probably fall much further when Japanese and European policy makers crank up growth and foreigners stop throwing money at American financial markets. "Nobody worries these days that the American current account deficit is unsustainable," Mr. Lawrence concludes.
But what about China? Economists have never shared the popular fear of imbalances. Robert M. Solow, the Nobel economist, is fond of saying that he has been running deficits with his barber for 40 years straight, buying haircuts for cash and never selling him a single economics lesson.
By the same token, global trading patterns driven by fundamental economic realities -- wages, resources, product demand -- virtually guarantee that America will run a big trade deficit with Asia. Mr. Lardy predicts that retaliation against Chinese import restrictions (or human rights abuses) would merely reshuffle America's deficits with individual Asian countries rather than change the overall imbalance.
That said, it is still worth speculating why the deficit with China has grown fourfold in six years. The obvious reason is that Asia's low-wage export industries have shifted to the economy with the lion's share of the region's low-wage workers. A subtler reason is that the Chinese Government has been buying foreign currency at a feverish pace, driving down its own currency and making Chinese goods more competitive abroad.
But that is neither surprising nor undesirable. The $100 billion-plus war chest should allow China to hold the line against any speculative run on Hong Kong's currency after unification. Equally significant, it should hasten the day citizens are permitted to invest abroad freely and could mean major capital outflows once restrictions are lifted. "There's considerable pent-up demand in China for foreign assets," Mr. Lardy explained.

HEADLINE: Investigators in Salinas Case Subpoena Records of a Texas Bank

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
In a widening of the American inquiry into possible money-laundering by the brother of Mexico's former President, Federal investigators are examining the movement of millions of dollars through Texas Commerce Bank, people familiar with the matter said yesterday.
Investigators have subpoenaed bank records relating to several million dollars in cash deposited in a Houston branch of the bank in the name of Margarita Nava Sanchez. The deposits were made in 1989, when Ms. Nava Sanchez was the girlfriend of Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former President. 
 Raul Salinas, who is in a Mexican prison awaiting trial on charges of illegal enrichment and masterminding a political murder, has denied any wrongdoing.
Officials in Switzerland, Mexico and the United States have been examining his transfers of more than $100 million out of Mexico to overseas accounts. Swiss authorities have recently asserted that most of the $100 million or more that Raul Salinas deposited in their country came from drug traffickers. But they have yet to present the evidence to support their assertions.
In the 1990's Raul Salinas's money was managed by private bankers at Citibank, who orchestrated a complex series of transactions that moved deposits to Swiss accounts.
In earlier years, Mr. Salinas has told Swiss investigators, he used cruder means to shift money out of Mexico and Ms. Nava Sanchez appears to have had a role in some of those dealings.
She was, for example, a principal of Maramex Corporation, which in 1989 opened accounts at the private Banque Pictet in Geneva, transferring millions of dollars there.
In this period, Texas Commerce Bank seems to have been a preferred conduit for Mr. Salinas's millions. Texas Commerce was bought by Chemical Banking Corporation of New York in 1987, and Chemical was in turn acquired early last year by Chase Manhattan Bank of New York. A Chase spokesman yesterday declined to comment on, or reply to, questions relating to accounts in the name of Ms. Nava Sanchez, or of Mr. Salinas or his alias.
The Justice Department, along with the United States Attorney's offices in New York and Houston, is continuing to investigate Raul Salinas and his money transfers through the United States in the late 1980's and early 1990's. These transfers, which occurred during the presidency of Carlos Salinas, coincided with the liberalization of Mexico's economy and the privatization of several of its largest industries. During those years, Mexico also witnessed rapid growth in profiteering from drug trafficking and money-laundering.
Mr. Salinas's supporters maintain that he is a convenient scapegoat for prosecutors and the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo. Carlos Salinas is living in self-exile in Dublin.
Stanley Arkin, a well-known New York lawyer who was recently retained to defend Raul Salinas, said yesterday that he had no knowledge of the money deposited in Texas Commerce Bank, and also did not know who might respond for Ms. Nava Sanchez, who could not be otherwise reached. "The focus of this case," he said, "should be on the extraordinary efforts that have been made to frame Raul."
Texas Commerce Bank was also favored with cash deposits of about $9 million by Mario Ruiz Massieu, a former Mexican Deputy Attorney General, in 1993 and 1994. He maintained it was his family's savings, but a jury in Houston recently confiscated nearly $8 million after a trial in which prosecutors asserted it was protection payments from drug barons.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Surges; Home Building Holds Its Pace

BYLINE: By ReutersReuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Industrial production surged in March, while housing starts maintained a healthy pace, the Government said today.
The two reports showed that economic growth continued to be strong, and they revived concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating. 
 Total output by the nation's mines, factories and utilities climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent last month -- higher than economists' expectations of a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent -- following a revised February pickup of six-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve reported.
Growth in industrial output accelerated to an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter this year, up from 4.5 percent in the final three months of last year, when strikes in the auto industry hurt output.
The capacity use rate, which measures how near to limits businesses are operating, jumped to 84.1 percent, from a revised 83.6 percent in February -- the highest rate since 84.3 percent in March 1995.
"We've certainly moved into an inflationary danger zone," said Anthony Chan, chief economist of the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation of Columbus, Ohio. An operating rate above 84 percent signals rising potential for bottlenecks from higher prices for raw materials and bigger wage demands from employees, he noted.
The Fed said that total manufacturing production jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent in both February and March this year, driven primarily by more demand for costly and long-lasting durable goods like household appliances and computers. Mining output was up nine-tenths of 1 percent in March after a strong 1.5 percent gain in February, while utilities increased output by eight-tenths of 1 percent following a 3.4 percent decline in February.
In the housing report, the Commerce Department said builders broke ground on fewer new homes and apartments last month than in February but still finished the first quarter with a higher total than in the final three months of last year.
Construction starts on new homes and apartments fell 6.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million, after a revised 10.7 percent jump in February, when unseasonably mild weather increased building activity.
The drop in March home building was concentrated in the Midwest, where heavy rains and flooding pulled activity down at the steepest rate in more than three years.
Costlier mortgage rates, which topped 8 percent in April for a 30-year loan, are expected to restrict housing activity.
Mortgage rates will rise especially if Fed policy makers raise rates again when they meet on May 20. The Fed raised the Federal funds rate a quarter-point on March 25.
"The economy is clearly growing too fast for the Fed's comfort," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. The question is not whether the central bank will raise rates, "but how far and how fast," he said.

HEADLINE: Dragging Out H.M.O. Payments;
Are Health Care Companies Profiting From the 'Float'?

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Health maintenance organizations were supposed to raise the level of efficiency in medical care, reduce costs and make the system more convenient for patients and doctors alike -- all departures from traditional insurance practices.
But hospitals, doctors and patients are complaining that as H.M.O.'s take on many of the functions of traditional insurers, they are adding to costs and interfering with care by taking longer to pay their bills. 
 Some of the biggest H.M.O.'s are among the slowest payers, as measured by accounts payable and daily medical costs. Three of the dozen biggest companies -- Oxford Health Plans, the United Healthcare Corporation and Humana Inc. -- were, respectively, 94, 77 and 71 days behind in their payments at the end of last year, based on company reports as analyzed by industry experts. The three reported a total of $3.23 billion in accounts payable to doctors and other medical providers on Dec. 31.
Executives of such companies say the payment numbers are misleading. Some say the numbers make them look slow because they have added traditional health insurance lines that involve time-consuming paperwork and greater financial reserves. H.M.O.'s that offer wide choices of doctors and hospitals as a higher-cost option -- so-called point-of-service plans -- say they have similar problems.
But analysts say that those explanations only underscore the changes in the H.M.O. business that frustrate providers and patients. "H.M.O.'s are becoming no different than any other commercial insurance company," said William O. Cleverley, a health care finance expert at Ohio State University. "The Aetnas and Prudentials always were slow payers."
The H.M.O.'s also blame growing pains for payment delays, including problems arising from mergers. In particular, they have been struggling to upgrade, replace or mesh computer systems.
But the complaints from patients and health care providers are coming at a time when the managed-care industry, bruised from cutting premiums and recruiting expensive specialists and hospitals to attract market share, is struggling to raise operating income. And coincidentally or not, the effect of the payment delays is to swell the bottom line at the H.M.O.'s. A large share of the profits at many H.M.O.'s now comes from what has long been a mainstay of traditional insurers: earning interest on other people's money.
For example, at United Healthcare, the nation's largest for-profit managed-care company, "investment and other income" accounted for 35 percent of pretax profits in 1995 and 32 percent last year (not counting a one-time gain), compared with just 25 percent in 1994.
Angry providers, citing payment lags that have some hospitals scrambling to meet payrolls and at least a few doctors taking out loans to cover office expenses, say such numbers reflect a calculated strategy by big managed-care companies to enjoy the "float" on providers' and patients' money.
"In the last year, the amount of money we're talking about in the float becomes very significant," said Dr. Octavio Chirino, a former president of the St. Louis Metro Medical Society.
But David Koppe, chief financial officer of United Healthcare, said the jump in interest income reflected reserves required by state regulators largely to cover newly acquired customers for traditional insurance. "It's not coming off the float," he said.
In any event, delays in payment are not growing across the board. In fact, the median time for H.M.O. payments to hospitals, the biggest billing category, actually decreased to 63 days, from 73, from 1991 to 1995, according to Medicare statistics reported in the Almanac of Hospital Financial and Operating Indicators.
Nonetheless, in 1995, the last year for which figures are available, a fourth of all H.M.O.'s held onto unpaid claims for 89.5 days, on average, or 5 days longer than in 1993, according to HCIA Inc., a health care information company in Baltimore.
What's more, even as the industry as a whole cuts its payment time for hospital bills, it is sharply falling behind the pace being set by traditional insurers. In places where relatively few people were in H.M.O.'s, the median payment time was 58 days in 1995, compared with 63 days in markets dominated by H.M.O.'s.
The claims-processing systems at some H.M.O.'s are "stressed to the breaking point, overwhelmed with growth and requirements to provide reports to customers and medical management," said Ted Nussbaum, a health care consultant in New York with Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
In denying that the payment delays are intentional, the H.M.O.'s say it is simply not in their interest to alienate customers, especially these days, when competition among managed-care companies is so fierce.
"The good will that comes from rapid service is more important than a few days of interest income," said Stephen F. Wiggins, chairman of Oxford, which is based in Norwalk, Conn. He said that while Oxford had "over $1 billion in cash in the bank," it "never intentionally delayed any payments."
Still, a big H.M.O. like Oxford could pocket more than $400,000 a day by collecting interest on the float, according to Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
With numbers like that, the H.M.O.'s cannot help but benefit from payment delays, whatever their intentions.
At Oxford, for instance, as membership exploded from 513,000 in 1994 to 1.5 million at the end of last year, the company's revenues ballooned to $3.08 billion from $760 million. At the same time, cash on hand or available in short-term investments tripled, to $619 million -- not including $220 million Oxford got from a stock offering last year -- as the company tried to improve its computerized bookkeeping and fell behind in paying its bills. Oxford had 110 days of unpaid medical bills in December 1994, 82 days at the end of 1995 and 94 days last Dec. 31, according to a formula used by Interstudy, a nonprofit H.M.O. research firm in Minneapolis.
Oxford owed $624 million in all to doctors, hospitals and other medical providers on Dec. 31, and was far enough behind in payments that it advanced $75 million in interest-free loans to irate providers in the New York area early this year. Mr. Wiggins said early this month that the company would be paying promptly again, which Oxford defined as within 14 days, by May.
Oxford's problems underscore the changes that have transformed H.M.O.'s.
When they first appeared, after World War II, they had a simple, self-contained structure, employing their own doctors in their own hospitals. Subscribers paid premiums to the H.M.O. and that was the end of it.
Over the years, that model mutated into far-flung networks of health care providers who contract with one or more H.M.O.'s through a dizzying variety of billing arrangements. Other complicated payment rules apply when a consumer goes to an "out of network" doctor. These changes have turned many H.M.O.'s into traditional insurers in the sense that they largely function as conduits for huge flows of cash between patient and provider.
Given the big role that H.M.O.'s now play, concern is growing about the impact of the payment delays on patients and providers.
In New York, the Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, is examining a number of complaints from "consumers who said they were being chased by doctors for payment," said Chris McKenna, a spokesman. "We are concerned that these patients might be reluctant to seek care." And in Georgia, the big managed-care companies are "taking longer and longer to pay," said Carolyn Milby, business administrator of Georgetown Pediatrics, a six-doctor group in the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody. "Basically, we're just being squeezed."
Some hospitals have slowed their own payments for supplies and equipment, often forgoing discounts they used to get for prompt payments. Hospital executives say their suppliers, in turn, are raising prices in a ripple effect.
The University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia said its waiting time for payments from H.M.O.'s had increased by 40 percent, to between 90 and 100 days, in the last two years. John Wynne, chief financial officer of the hospital, said that unpaid managed-care charges owed to the hospital and its staff doctors averaged $7 million to $10 million.
"The H.M.O.'s are adding to our costs of doing business," Mr. Wynne said. "We still have to pay the salaries of nurses and doctors."
Doctors and hospitals in a number of states are lobbying for tighter rules for prompt payment. Maryland already levies an interest penalty of 1.5 percent a month on money owed to providers for more than 30 days, a rule that health care experts there credit for the state's better payment record. In 1995, Maryland hospitals were paid 16 days faster than the national median.
But such rules are not always rigorously enforced. In Georgia, health insurers are supposed to pay uncontested, or "clean," bills within 15 days, said Camilla Grayson, an executive at the Georgia Medical Association, adding, "Everybody thinks that's a hoot, because they never do." The median wait for Georgia hospitals was 61.5 days in 1995.
In February, Humana told doctors in Georgia and six other states in the Southeast that it was at least 60 days late on $112 million in claims for treatment of military families.
In the ensuing chaos, one medium-sized hospital in central Georgia struggled with a backlog of $1 million in unpaid military bills. And at Georgetown Pediatrics, the doctors "had to borrow money to make ends meet," said Ms. Milby, the manager.
Humana was not the only late payer. "We deal with 12 or 13 managed-care companies," she said. "It's pretty much across the board."
Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., took over the enormous military dependents' contract, which generates gross annual revenues of $2.4 billion, last September. Underestimating the case load by 30 percent, by its own account, Humana subcontracted claims payments to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina.
Dr. Joe Stubbs, an internist in Valdosta, Ga., said that Humana now "seems to be working honestly and desperately to make it right." But, he added, "Humana took this contract, knowing full well that they did not have the computer capability of handling this type of situation."
By late March, Humana said it had whittled the backlog down to a mere $73 million.
"We have made considerable improvements in the last seven or eight months," said Bill Weronka, a spokesman for Humana.
Other H.M.O.'s, while conceding problems in the past, say they, too, are now on the right course.
Commenting on complaints by the New Jersey Hospital Association, Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Healthcare unit of Aetna Inc., said late payments were "an issue" last year, but the problem was temporary. "We had a blip in 1996," she said.

Strong Data On Output Hurt Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, a day after prices surged on a report of lower-than-expected inflation. Still, some investors sold after a new report, showing strong manufacturing activity, revived fears of inflation and of a more aggressive stance by the Federal Reserve against it.
The 30-year Treasury bond closed the session down 3/32, to a price of 94 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, ended at 7.09 percent, unchanged. 
 The Fed released a report yesterday showing that industrial production, led by manufacturing of durable goods, surged nine-tenths of 1 percent in March. Capacity utilization at industrial plants rose to 84.1 percent, the highest since March 1995.
And a Commerce Department report yesterday on housing, showing a 6.4 percent decline in housing starts during March, hinted at a somewhat slower housing sector.
The market traded a bit higher on the headlines, but some investors took advantage of the gains to sell. The two reports came a day after the Consumer Price Index for March had showed virtually no inflation.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, played down the significance of the industrial production report as a forecast of inflation.
"Market participants are concerned about the inflationary implications of higher levels of capacity usage, and this certainly does have a direct bearing on industrial-sector prices going forward," Mr. Fine said. "But in a service-sector economy, and one that is becoming more so with each passing day, the usefulness of capacity utilization as a precursor to future inflation is diminished as time goes on."
Capacity utilization was higher than its current level from November 1994 through March 1995, Mr. Fine said, but did not cause a run-up in inflation or a rise in bond yields.
Still, analysts expect the Fed to factor the strong factory report into its deliberations at the May 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which determines interest-rate policy. The committee raised rates last month in an effort to head off inflation, which bond investors fear because it erodes the value of their holdings.
Indeed, Mr. Fine said that another rate increase was a strong possibility. He said that the report of benign inflation might not have as much influence on the Fed as many investors might think, since the committee is focusing on heading off future price increases, not just containing current ones.
"At this juncture," he said, "there seems to be little standing in the way of another round of Fed tightening in the near future, particularly if the F.O.M.C. wants to act pre-emptively in the face of a rapidly expanding economy."
Many market participants expect that the Fed will raise the Federal funds rate, the target rate for overnight borrowing between banks, by another quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent, when the committee meets. Some traders expect that the 30-year bond yield will rise to 7.25 percent by that time.
Yesterday, the Treasury announced the size of its auctions of notes scheduled for next week. They will consist of $17 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday.
In when-issued trading late in the day, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.49 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.79 percent.

HEADLINE: More of Largest U.S. Banks Post Income Rise in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Some of the largest banks, including the BankAmerica Corporation and the Fleet Financial Group Inc., reported yesterday that first-quarter earnings had risen, as they held down costs and raised revenue from other businesses like trading.
BankAmerica, the country's third-largest bank, after Chase Manhattan and Citibank, said earnings rose 8.3 percent; Fleet, the bank ranked No. 11 by assets, said earnings surged 18 percent, while the Republic New York Corporation increased 11 percent and the Wachovia Corporation rose 8.8 percent. 
 Wachovia was particularly hard-hit by credit card losses, amounting to about 17 percent of its pretax earnings. Most banks suffered similar losses, although many managed to compensate by cutting costs and increasing revenue.
Despite the earnings increases, the banks' stocks slid. They have been down in recent weeks on investors' fear that rising interest rates would hurt earnings. Concern that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again sent them down further yesterday, analysts said.
"The earnings have been encouraging," said James Schmidt, a portfolio manager for John Hancock Advisors, who heads a group that invests $6 billion in financial stocks. "Expenses are up at most banks only a few percent, loan growth has been moderate as expected and the credit quality numbers are still fairly good."
BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, said first-quarter earnings rose 8.3 percent on the strength of increased lending to businesses and consumers and income from securities trading.
The bank said net income rose to $780 million, or $2.05 a share, from $720 million, or $1.79, a year earlier, exceeding the estimate of $1.97 a share, according to an I.B.E.S. International survey of 22 analysts. BankAmerica shares fell $2.25, to $103.875, in Big Board trading yesterday.
Net interest income rose 1.3 percent, to $2.14 billion, as the bank's portfolio of loans expanded 6.8 percent, to an average of $165.48 billion. However, net interest margin narrowed to 4.16 from 4.36 percent, which means the bank over all earned less from its loans.
Income from newer, fee-based businesses rose 8.7 percent from last year to $1.39 billion as the bank increased service charges on deposits, fees and commissions, credit cards and securities trading.
Fleet Financial Group's first-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, as the bank cut costs and lifted revenue by taking over NatWest Bancorp in New Jersey.
The Boston-based bank said net income rose to $311 million, or $1.10 a share, from $264 million, or 94 cents, a year earlier. The earnings edged past Wall Street's expectations of $1.09, according to a survey of 20 analysts by I.B.E.S. International. Fleet shares fell 37.5 cents, to $57.25.
Yesterday, Fleet agreed to sell its Option One Mortgage Company subsidiary to H & R Block Inc. for $190 million in cash. The Fleet unit, based in Santa Ana, Calif., made more than $1 billion in residential loans to people with bad credit.
Republic New York earnings rose 11 percent, helped by a 14 percent gain in net interest income and from increased securities trading.
Republic, the nation's 18th-largest bank, said net income rose to $110.2 million, or $1.89 a share, from $99.6 million, or $1.64, a year earlier. That beat Wall Street's average estimate of $1.85 a share. Republic stock rose 25 cents, to $84.75.
The New York-based bank said net interest income -- the interest it earned less what it paid for funds -- rose to $253.6 million from $223.1 million. Income from trading activities rose to $46.1 million from $45.7 million. Total noninterest income rose 18 percent, to $126.4 million, with earnings from servicing deposit accounts, trust accounts and overseas business fueling the increase.
The Wachovia Corporation, the nation's 20th-largest bank, said first-quarter earnings rose 8.8 percent from increased revenue on loans. The bank, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., said net income rose to $163.1 million, or 99 cents a share, from $149.9 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier. The earnings met analysts' expectations of 99 cents, according to I.B.E.S., Wachovia shares fell 25 cents, to $55.375.
Wachovia said credit card losses jumped to $40.08 million, from about $28 million a year ago.

HEADLINE: New Jobs Grow in Once-Shunned Areas

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 16

 BODY:
Pedro A. Gonzalez now earns less in a week than he used to make in a day. But for his family and his neighbors here, that is progress.
For the last three months Mr. Gonzalez, who said he used to be a high-ranking gang member and drug dealer, has been paid $8 an hour to drive forklifts and run other machines at Munoz Machine Products, an auto parts company that was started this year in Detroit's empowerment zone, an impoverished area where the Federal Government is trying to foster urban renewal. 
 He no longer collects up to $1,000 a day, but his new job comes with health insurance.
"It was getting old, standing on the street corners and getting shot at," said Mr. Gonzalez, a 23-year-old high school dropout.
Until recently, he said, there were very few jobs on Detroit's southwest side. Now he is one of 500 workers in the neighborhood with a new job.
Mr. Gonzalez's neighborhood, along with a broad stretch of Detroit, is in one of the nation's six urban empowerment zones, areas chosen to receive $100 million each in Federal grants and about $250 million in Federal tax breaks over a decade.
Vice President Al Gore, Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, along with municipal officials from across the country, came here this week for a two-day conference on empowerment zones.
In a speech here on Tuesday, Mr. Gore applauded a consortium of seven banks in the Detroit area for lending more than $600 million in two years to businesses in the zone.
There are 48 new projects in Detroit's 18.35-square-mile empowerment zone, worth $3.8 billion, according to the city. Altogether, those ventures are expected to create 2,750 jobs. Each of those long-absent jobs eases the pain of an area where the poverty rate is 47 percent and the jobless rate is 29 percent, nearly seven times the state average.
In Detroit, political and business leaders said the empowerment zone was a catalyst for planning the development of the city, but that far more powerful forces ultimately spurred the investments there. First, the election of a pro-business Mayor, Dennis W. Archer, increased optimism about the city as a whole.
In addition, Detroit's big auto makers found that they could meet their goals of buying more auto parts from minority-owned companies if they encouraged small businesses to locate in the empowerment zone. Those companies have eagerly taken advantage of the $3,000-per-worker tax break they get for hiring workers who live in the zone.
Along with Detroit, Federal studies say, Baltimore is considered the star pupil of the empowerment zone program, which began nearly two and a half years ago. The other urban zones are in Atlanta, Chicago, New York and a region that includes Philadelphia and Camden, N.J.
As part of the program, the Clinton Administration also sent Federal redevelopment money to nearly 100 other communities and designated three rural empowerment zones -- the Mississippi Delta, the Highlands in south-central Kentucky and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas -- which were each given $40 million in grants over 10 years. In addition, Los Angeles and Cleveland were designated supplemental empowerment zones, and got grants of about $128 million and $90 million respectively.
Several recent studies commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development have found that most of the areas chosen for redevelopment have made progress in the first two years of the decade-long program.
"It is working," Secretary Cuomo told the crowd gathered for the conference here.
The program as a whole is a combination of ideas bandied about by Democrats and Republicans alike through several administrations. It was intended to allow communities to leverage Federal grants for housing and social services with tax breaks that encourage business development and job creation. President Clinton's budget calls for a second round of empowerment zones.
In his speech here, Mr. Gore said proposed rules would encourage Federal contractors to set up shop in empowerment zones or other distressed neighborhoods nationwide.
"When Uncle Sam goes shopping, Uncle Sam ought to come to Detroit and the South Bronx and the Mississippi Delta and the Kentucky Highlands," the Vice President said, to "promote job creation in the areas that need it most."
That is good news for people halfway across town from Mr. Gonzalez's neighborhood who work at Superb Manufacturing, an auto parts company with 190 employees that has been expanding since Detroit won empowerment zone status.
Welfare recipients and others who live in the drug-infested neighborhood surrounding the company have found work on its assembly lines for jobs that pay $6 to $19 an hour.
Hasan D. Miller, a 38-year-old former welfare recipient, runs a machine that welds parts for the Ford Taurus sedan. The blocks around the factory are still dangerous at night, Mr. Miller said, but he added that, since work reappeared in his neighborhood, "things have changed for the better."
His co-worker, Sonji R. McEwen, 31, said she was on welfare for 14 years until she found work at Superb two years ago.
"Quite a few people have jobs now and are not dependent on food stamps and welfare," Ms. McEwen said.

HEADLINE: THE MONEY PIT: A special report.;
Bonn's Blank Check Buys Hollow Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany

 BODY:
For a rough idea of what has happened in the former East Germany, imagine someone wrote a check worth $1 trillion to a state with an economy the size of North Carolina's.
Since the Berlin wall fell in late 1989, half the homes in eastern Germany have been renovated. Schools and museums, parks and playgrounds, factories and power plants have been showered with money. The Trabant, the cramped, smoke-belching car that came to symbolize everything people hated about the old Communist regime, is all but extinct, replaced by millions of shiny Volkswagens, BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes. 
 Eastern Germany -- with an economic output last year of about $230 billion -- now has twice the number of shopping malls per resident as western Germany. It has 5,000 miles of new highways, 2,800 miles of new railroad track and one of the world's best telephone systems.
And nowhere has the adrenaline of all that money had more impact than in this historic city 80 miles southwest of Berlin. Smartly dressed men and women eat and shop in the exquisitely renovated Art Deco downtown district. Gold-painted sculptures adorn the renovated Baroque facade of Commerzbank's branch. The once-crumbling skyline now blazes with office towers and luxury hotels. And just out of town are a gleaming new international airport, a $1 billion convention center and a $1.5 billion cargo-handling facility.
Since 1990, the German Government in Bonn has given more than $600 billion to its former eastern rival through business subsidies, special tax breaks and support payments for individuals. Enticed by the tax breaks and subsidies, companies have invested $500 billion more.
But for all the cash thrown at eastern Germany, the economy remains fundamentally bankrupt. Even as wages have skyrocketed in a rush to catch up with those in the west, there are not nearly enough real jobs to go around. Unemployment is at 25 percent, growth has almost ground to a halt, output per worker is still half the rate of western Germany's, and exports are minuscule.
"Never before in history has one country spent so much money building pyramids," said Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. "There has been a tremendous waste of economic resources."
In Leipzig, a third of the work force is unemployed after accounting for Government-financed make-work jobs and early retirement programs. A third of the office space is vacant, including several of the fanciest new buildings. Local tax revenue accounts for just one-tenth of the city's $2 billion annual budget.
The only thing that keeps eastern Germany afloat is billions upon billions of marks handed out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government every year.
All this is causing big problems not just for Germany but for Europe, too. Loaded with $300 billion in debt related to eastern Germany, the country is in danger of not being able to meet the fiscal requirements to qualify for the Euro, the single European currency planned for 1999. And without Germany, there can be no Euro soon, wrecking the timetable on which Europe's political leaders have pinned much of their hopes for long-term economic recovery.
The domestic repercussions are just as bad. Even as the 60 million western Germans become angrier about paying a 7.5 percent "solidarity" surtax for reconstructing the eastern section, which has fewer than 20 million people, Mr. Kohl is trying to cut health and retirement benefits to reduce the deficit.
For all the excess, some experts argue that in the end Germans will witness a huge payoff from the eastern spending spree if they wait for a decade or more.
But others contend that eastern Germany combines the worst of two worlds: the bankrupt legacy from 45 years of Communist mismanagement and the gold-plated rigidity that has jeopardized western Germany's own ability to compete on the world market.
And to the Government's chagrin, former Eastern bloc countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which received a fraction of eastern Germany's external aid, are growing faster and attracting a lot of unsubsidized investment from Germany's biggest companies. Those countries, by contrast, have kept wages competitive and relied mostly on free-market forces since the collapse of the Soviet system.
"We blew it in east Germany," said Herbert A. Henzler, chairman of the German office of McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm. "In terms of economic policy, we did almost everything wrong."
 
High Cost of Labor
Wages Are Up; Productivity Isn't
Where did all the money go?
What many German economists say is not so much that the money was simply poured down a rat hole as that eastern Germany's problems boil down to one almost unbelievable statistic: The average hourly wage in eastern Germany has soared to more than $16 an hour, actually slightly higher than in the United States.
In a well-intentioned but damaging series of decisions in the early 1990's, the German Government essentially imposed West Germany's entire structure of high wages and mandatory social benefits onto an economy that had collapsed. West Germany's powerful labor unions added to the pressure, pushing hard to extend the terms for all western contracts into the eastern states in part to avoid hearing an immediate Ross Perot-style sucking sound of jobs moving from west to east.
High labor costs are now making it hard even for western Germany to compete in the global economy. But for eastern Germany, where the output per worker is only half as much, the wage situation is catastrophic.
"The economy here is comparable to that of a third world country, or perhaps Spain or Portugal," said Joachim Ragnitz, an economist at the Halle Institute for Economics, not far from Leipzig. But "labor costs are much lower in Spain or Portugal."
The only business that has truly generated a lot of jobs in the last few years is the construction industry, which, thanks to the lavish subsidies, employs about 17 percent of all workers in eastern Germany, a share of the work force that is about three times that of most countries. But even that segment is now losing ground because of tremendous overbuilding.
With too many high-priced workers chasing too few real jobs, the Government has persuaded as many as 800,000 people a year to leave the work force through generous early retirement programs. Several hundred thousand people are in training programs and 200,000 more are in what officials candidly call make-work jobs.
Germany was warned ahead of time about the potential for disaster. "It was probably the single biggest mistake," said Gunter Thumann, an economist with Salomon Brothers who was with Germany's Ministry of Economics and the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Thumann helped write an I.M.F. paper in 1990 that pleaded for Germany not to raise wages too quickly in the east.
"It was as if they read only the things we said they shouldn't do," Mr. Thumann said, "and then did them."
To be sure, many experts say the German Government had little choice politically. Unlike other former Soviet bloc countries, East Germany was absorbed into the West virtually overnight. Its residents had been promised the full benefits of German citizenship, a promise crucial to their vote for reunification in 1990. If eastern German wages and benefits had remained far below those in western Germany, the most skilled residents would have simply flooded westward.
"We are suffering today from decisions that were economically wrong but politically correct," said Werner J. Patzelt, a professor of political science at Dresden Technical University. "If you had told East Germans that they should get reunited with West Germany but that they should only have one-third or one-half of their wages, reunification would never have happened."
But while most of the problems flow from the fact that wage gains have been so much more rapid than productivity improvements, other mistakes contributed to the conundrum now facing eastern Germany. For one, the flood of money from Bonn produced by the tax subsidies was so indiscriminate that billions have been spent on projects that so far have yielded little economic value.
"A lot of the tax-driven projects were unprofessional, dilettantish and simply dumb," said Sascha Hettrich, head of the Berlin office of Jones Lang Wootton, the real estate consulting firm. "It happened a lot."
 
Costly Rebuilding
$3.2 Million A Job at a Plant
Nowhere is the eastern German jobs problem more vividly on display than at the monstrous and toxic chemical complex that the Dow Chemical Corporation is taking over near the city of Schkopau.
The complex looms over the surrounding farmland like a film noir vision of life after the apocalypse, with 500 crumbling buildings ensnarled by hundreds of miles of rusting, leaky pipes. Thousands of windows have been smashed. Many walls are so soaked with poisonous mercury that the job of grinding them up has become a hazard.
Today, this site is the German Government's biggest single project aimed at rebuilding eastern Germany's industrial base. It is also one of the most expensive job-preservation programs in history.
The Government has committed $7 billion to tear down 90 percent of the works, rebuild it with the latest technology and subsidize losses for several years. But while 18,000 people worked there before the Berlin wall fell, and 4,000 are working now, Dow plans to employ no more than 2,200 when the plant is restored. The cost per job: $3.2 million.
"From Dow's perspective, it would have been much easier, less expensive and less risky to build an entirely new plant," said Bart Groot, the general manager of the site. But Mr. Kohl pledged to rebuild eastern Germany's devastated chemical region, whatever the cost. With wages so high, the only choice was to build costly, capital-intensive factories employing only a comparative handful of workers.
By 2000, if all goes according to plan, this plant will be equipped with everything from computer systems to a 280-mile pipeline to the Baltic Sea. It will get a new highway, new rail connections and a terminal at the Baltic port of Rostock.
For Dow, which has pledged to invest up to $700 million in return for 80 percent of the company, the project is relatively safe.
But does it make sense for Germany to spend so much money for so few jobs? Beyond the Dow project, the Government plans to invest more than $20 billion to rebuild scores of other insolvent chemical complexes nearby.
Supporters argue that the plan is the least bad of the alternatives. Simply demolishing the old plants would cost billions and leave nothing for the region's future. By rebuilding with the latest technology, they argue, the Dow complex will ultimately generate 10,000 jobs and jump-start the local economy.
Even with all the subsidies, the project could still go sour if demand from Eastern Europe is below expectations. To turn a profit, the plant's sales need to double to at least $1.2 billion. "That's where the risk comes in," Mr. Groot said. "If that market does not materialize, then the investment becomes much less attractive."
 
Empty Towers
Plenty of Space, But No Tenants
Handsome and knowledgeable, Nico Preindl radiates the confidence and charm of a supremely effective real estate agent. But these days he spends much of his time in the echoing emptiness of Leipzig's new List Bogen office complex.
"It is a catastrophe," said Mr. Preindl, an agent for a unit of Hypo Bank of Germany, one of the developers. "There are four big office projects right in this neighborhood, and we all have the same problem -- no tenants."
Mr. Preindl is one of many witnesses to the financial disaster from Bonn's promotion of eastern German real estate. Thanks to a 50 percent tax write-off, wealthy western Germans have poured more than $100 billion into tax-oriented real estate funds.
The result is a region that is wildly overbuilt with luxury hotels, office towers, shopping malls and apartment complexes. The problem is particularly acute in Leipzig, which was a center of trading and publishing for centuries before World War II.
During the last five years, Leipzig officials estimate they have attracted $20 billion in investment. The city has a forest of new office buildings, 40 new hotels, scores of shopping malls and at least a dozen new industrial parks within a 30-mile radius.
The only thing missing is the business to support all this. "This city is under terrible pressure," said Heinrich Rohrs, general manager for Commerzbank's Leipzig branch. "The whole city is so overbuilt. There just isn't any demand. There isn't any life."
The $100 million List Bogen hardly looks like a disaster. The facade is sheathed with pink marble, accented by blue steel frames and dark-tinted windows. The building has 217,000 square feet of space, advanced energy systems and a fiber optic network.
But so far, the only tenant is a small bakery on the ground floor. Mr. Preindl says he has contracts to lease 10 percent of the space. But he must fend off hungry competition on all sides. A few blocks away is the Atrium, which has rented only one-third of its space. Next door is the even bigger Frederich List Haus, which will be finished in June and has yet to sign up any tenants.
"Our company has the staying power," Mr. Preindl said. "But how long should we have to wait? The next 2 years? The next 5 years? The next 10? No one knows."
In eastern Germany, local officials have labored mightily to blend tax breaks with direct subsidies from Bonn. Want a $200 million Formula One speedway to spruce up a desolate coal-mining area? The state of Brandenburg does, so it is planning one for Lausitz, 40 miles west of Dresden, where the land is pocked by old strip-mining craters and laced with toxic chemicals.
Some officials have already nicknamed their project, which would be the biggest raceway in Europe, the German Indianapolis. The state has agreed to pick up 80 percent of the construction cost.
There are a few problems, though. The Formula One racing organization has said it will not use the new track. Nor are German automobile makers interested in using it as a test center. And the entrepreneurs who dreamed up the project are balking at a required 15-year commitment.
Brandenburg officials say they are not perturbed. "The decision has already been made," said Cord Schwartau, a spokesman for the state economics ministry. "We are just debating the details."
 
Seeds of Growth
Just Add Money For 20 Years
For all the problems, many experts agree that western German money is slowly creating the basis for what ultimately could be a spectacularly modern economy. Eastern Germany's telephone network, built from scratch by Deutsche Telekom, is more advanced than that of the United States. Siemens A.G., the giant electronics conglomerate, and Advanced Micro Devices, the American computer chip manufacturer, are building semiconductor plants near Dresden. The Opel unit of General Motors has one of the most advanced automobile assembly plants in the world, in Eisenach.
"I feel optimistic," Professor Patzelt of Dresden Technical University said. "You can see the flourishing landscapes that are developing -- the infrastructure, the shops, the factories. We are in the spring now, not the fall."
Outside Magdeburg, an irrepressible eastern German entrepreneur named Eberhard Pohl has tapped several hundred million dollars in Government help to build the Technologiepark, home to more than a dozen high-technology start-ups.
"You see how beautiful the land is?" Mr. Pohl asked, as he drove down newly paved streets in the middle of what was recently farmland. He pointed out a wildlife sanctuary on one side of the road and on the other, the gleaming modern glass Innovation Center, hooked up to 5,000 digital phone lines.
But all this is cold comfort to most unemployed workers. The new factories are usually so highly automated that they make little dent in the jobless situation. At the $200 million prescription drug factory built by Salutas Pharma G.m.b.H., robots mix ingredients, pound out pills and pack boxes. The factory will employ no more than 320 workers. "If we designed the plant any other way, we simply would not be competitive," said Ludwig Grasmueller, its manager.
None of this investment is self-sustaining yet. With costs far lower in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, most companies are reluctant to invest in eastern Germany without generous subsidies.
That is even true for Germany's high-profile corporations. Volkswagen wants a factory in eastern Germany, but it almost canceled the project because the European Commission in Brussels, which must rule on subsidies that might give an unfair advantage to a business within the European Union, objected that $90 million in subsidies was improper. Meanwhile, Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary, without much outside help, has built an advanced factory in Hungary, which the company can use as a lever to pry concessions from German labor.
"The unions always assumed we were pushovers and that we would never build a plant in Eastern Europe," Norbert Essing, Audi's spokesman, said. "Now they take us much more seriously."
Analysts say the problem of high labor costs cannot be fixed quickly. "Do you keep pouring in more subsidies, or do you cut wages?" Mr. Thumann of Salomon Brothers asked. "You'd really have to cut wages, but politically that's impossible."
But pouring in subsidies is becoming more difficult, too. The German Government is running shorter of money, and voters now despise the 7.5 percent "solidarity" tax.
Some subsidies are being cut back. The tax break that ignited rampant overbuilding in Leipzig and elsewhere was trimmed in January, choking off some projects.
Meanwhile, many companies, quietly encouraged by Bonn, are breaking ranks with the national union contracts and reaching cheaper local agreements.
For the foreseeable future, however, Germany plans to keep pumping money eastward, whether or not western German residents like it. Critics say that may be money down the drain. Optimists say the investment will pay off -- eventually.
"In 15 or 20 years, east Germany will have the most modern infrastructure and the most modern economy in Europe," Professor Patzelt said. "All you need to do is finance the transition. What we really need is another 20 years."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Boston Chicken hits some rough spots in a bond sale.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
BOSTON CHICKEN, a phenomenal initial public offering more than three years ago, has found Wall Street happy to put in more money ever since. But now it appears that investors are a little more hesitant about committing more cash.
Boston Chicken, which operates the Boston Market chain of restaurants, is trying to raise money by selling convertible bonds, and marketing of the bonds is being done by underwriters headed by Merrill Lynch. It is hoped the bonds will be sold late next week. 
 The sales pitch evidently has not been going as well as might have been hoped. The company has scaled back the size of the offering and is expected to pay a much higher interest rate than it paid on a similar bond sold in 1994.
Few companies have been as controversial on Wall Street as Boston Chicken. There are committed bulls, who see a company growing rapidly with a menu that is healthier and more in tune with the times and with the aging baby-boom generation than are traditional fast-food operations such as McDonald's.
But the bears are just as committed, and have been denouncing the company ever since it went public. To their minds, most of the company's reported profits have come from area developers -- franchisees -- who are losing money but can make required payments to Boston Chicken because they have borrowed the money. And who lends them the money? Boston Chicken, of course.
The stock's fate over the years has illustrated the waxing and waning of the influence of the two camps. At first, the bulls had it. When the stock went public on Nov. 9, 1993, at $10 a share adjusted for subsequent splits, it was one of the hottest issues in years. It opened for trading the first day at $22.75, and closed that day at $24.25.
Since then, there has been a lot of churning, but not much progress. It peaked last December at $41.50, but has since slipped to $27.25, just 12 percent higher than it closed on its first day of trading in 1993. During the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 84 percent.
In 1994, Boston Chicken did its first convertible bond offering, paying a rate of just 4.5 percent. The low rate reflected the fact that investors were eager for the potential upside of the stock.
Now, money managers say, the underwriters have said they expect the bonds to offer a rate of 6.5 percent to 7 percent. (The underwriters declined to comment.) Market interest rates are up since 1994, but by less than one percentage point. The extra amount the company is being asked to pay appears to represent a lessening interest in Boston Chicken, whose bonds are rated B-minus, or middle-level junk, by Standard & Poor's.
In March, when Boston Chicken filed the offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it said it planned to raise $250 million. But an amendment filed by the company with the S.E.C. this week cut that to $200 million.
That decline, according to the company, was due to market conditions. It certainly was not because the company's need for cash had declined. It had planned, as soon as the new offering was completed, to redeem its outstanding bonds. Since the stock was then trading above $30, it expected the bonds to be converted into common stock. If the stock is above $27.97, it would be in the interests of the bondholder to convert rather than take the cash.
Unfortunately, the stock has since fallen below the conversion price, and now the company says only that it will force conversion if the stock rises. If it does not, it will have to keep paying interest.
At the end of last year, the company had $800 million outstanding in notes receivable, almost all of it in loans to franchise developers. The company had no reserve for bad debts, a fact that bears on the stock have complained bitterly about, particularly since the area developers have been losing money at a rapid rate -- $156.5 million last year. The company says the developers will turn profitable soon, but concedes that if they do not, it "could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position and results of operations."
Until those developers are generating a lot of cash, with which they can repay loans, Boston Chicken will need to keep hitting up investors for more cash. The problems with selling the current bond issue indicate that is getting to be more difficult than it used to be.

HEADLINE: Zaire Rebels Attract The Fat Checkbooks

 BODY:
Mining executives are swarming around Shaba province a week after the mineral-rich region fell to Laurent Kabila and his rebel troops, signing lucrative deals despite Zaire's uncertain future. 
 But the economic potential is enormous in the rolling, fertile land, which holds millions of tons of cobalt, copper and zinc. Yesterday, the rebel administration signed its first mining contract, a multimillion-dollar deal with American Mineral Fields, based in Hope, Ark.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
A Shore City Tries to Shed A Faded Image

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
THE boardwalk was empty. It was sunny, warm, slightly breezy, the kind of day that could turn an up-tight working stiff into Huck Finn. Yet not a soul was visible as far as the eye could see.
The pier amusements were idled behind steel gates, the Zoom Phloom and Sea Serpent stopped in their tracks and the gulls off in the distance, by the water's edge of the wide, wide beach. It looked like the ghost of boardwalks past. 
 In the old days on April afternoons on the boardwalk, the police had to chase away truants playing Frisbee, and couples wrapped in sweaters and each other would stroll the planks until sundown.
The hotels and motels would start sprucing up in March. But most are still closed. So is virtually everything else: the restaurants, the newsstands, even the pubs.
THE ones that can still afford to will faithfully reopen, of course, on Memorial Day. But how long can they keep this up? Wildwood (year-round population: 5,000) is suffering for being a three-month town. The unemployment rate is 28 percent, businesses keep closing and people keep moving out. On streets just beyond the classic kitschy motels on Atlantic and Ocean Avenues, the "For Sale" signs look like pickets.
John Siciliano, for one, has faith. He must, as the executive director of the Greater Wildwoods Convention and Civic Center. "We're trying to market events that are beyond the three-month season, trying to push the season from three months to maybe five, from mid-March through mid-November," he said. In late September, for instance, the city is to be host to a monster truck show. "It's a phenomenal thing," Mr. Siciliano said.
There are grander plans for Wildwood, North Wildwood and Wildwood Crest. A baseball stadium and minor-league team for the 1998 season. A bigger, better convention center that will replace this outdated one, which has no meeting rooms. Lots of attention-getting ads in national magazines.
Once, this city sold itself. It had a name. It was the blue-collar Riviera, just about the most famous shore town in Jersey after Atlantic City. The investment portfolio-ed of Philadelphia, Delaware and parts north escaped to Cape May and its Victorian painted ladies. (Or to Stone Harbor, which is like St. John in the Virgin Islands, a half-secret). Everybody who was Everyman came here.
Teen-agers, especially, couldn't stay away. Well before senior week in mid-June, when graduates would pack the motels for their annual bacchanals, they would start trickling in on the first nice Saturday in March, trying to get into the bars with fake I.D.'s and pubescent mustaches, crowding the piers.
BUT even the great gush of teen-agers has shrunk to a small stream. "They go to Cancun now," Mr. Siciliano said.
The city's tax base has gone south, too. In recent years, Wildwood's tax base has fallen sharply while the rest of Cape May County's has increased. Even during the peak of the summer season, the 14,000 hotel and motel rooms can not stay full.
What happened, no one can say for sure. It could be Wildwood played itself out. Fashionable vacation spots are like fashionable clothes. One year, clingy polyester blouses and skintight bell-bottoms are the ultimate cool. Five years later, they are the most embarrassing things ever made and the Salvation Army can't give them away. Then, polyester blouses and bell-bottoms, hard as it is to believe, are back.
Wildwood officials blame Atlantic City casinos for their problems, which is why, two years ago, they came up with a plan to bring Indian gambling to a parking lot. Chief Larry Snake of the Delaware tribe of western Oklahoma declared the two-and-a-half-acre municipal lot ancestral Indian land. A referendum to deed the lot to the tribe for a casino passed by a 2-to-1 margin. And then, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman brushed off the idea as though it were a mosquito on her nose.
Last year, Wildwood started a television campaign that beckoned visitors with a calypsolike jingle called "Welcome to Our Island." This year, Mr. Siciliano said, the city will expand modestly on the theme, with ads that mention the wide beaches, friendly people and fun on the piers.
The ads do not mention Wildwood's 50's-era neon motels, like the Waikiki Motor Inn, the Tahiti and the Royal Hawaiian. But maybe they should. The other day, two young women in bell-bottoms were touring Atlantic Avenue, taking pictures of the motels, and said they were very cool.

HEADLINE: Dow Rallies For a 3d Day, Gaining 92.71

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market rose sharply yesterday for its third consecutive gain, as the Dow Jones industrial average extended a rally, helping it recover nearly half the losses it had suffered in the last month.
Strengthened by robust earnings reports from companies like Merck, Caterpillar and Eastman Kodak, and by renewed investor confidence, the Dow soared 92.71 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 6,679.87. In the last three sessions, the Dow has gained about 288 points, or 4.5 percent, its best three-day stretch in more than five years. 
 Technology stocks, though, continued to lag behind; the Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology issues, dropped 2.61 points, to 1,210.27. But the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 8.81 points, or 1.2 percent, to 763.53, continued recovering after losing nearly 10 percent since mid-March.
"It was another impressive performance," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott. "It's a recovery bolstered by some better-than-anticipated earnings reports and ebbing inflation worries."
Indeed, of 168 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have released quarterly earnings reports, 65 percent posted earnings that were higher than expected, according to I.B.E.S. International Inc. Though more reports will be issued in the coming weeks, earnings are running about 4 percent above expectations, according to Peter Crays, manager of United States research at I.B.E.S. That is up from about 2.4 percent a year ago, and on pace to be the highest since early 1995.
The market drew strength at the opening yesterday by reports that several large tobacco companies are negotiating a liability settlement with state regulators. While a settlement would be expensive, many analysts believe it would reduce some of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term prospects of those companies.
Shares of RJR Nabisco Holdings, maker of Winston and other cigarettes, rose 3 1/4, to 33 1/2. Shares of Philip Morris, which produces the Marlboro brand, surged 4 1/4, to 43 1/4, the Dow's biggest gainer for the day. The company also posted strong first-quarter earnings yesterday.
Other Dow stocks that had big days included Caterpillar and Kodak, both of which reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday. Caterpillar was up 1 5/8 a share, to 84 5/8, and Kodak rose 2 3/4, to 78 1/8.
A Federal Reserve report released early in the day, which found that industrial production grew faster than expected in March, initially pushed interest rates higher in the bond market, and proved to be a drag on stocks.
But investors seemed to discount the figures, choosing to reflect on Tuesday's benign inflation data from the Consumer Price Index for March and sending blue chips higher.
Since a 148-point plunge on Friday, the Dow has inched back toward its closing high of 7,085.16, which was set March 11. Despite having surrendered all of this year's gains in the five weeks since, the Dow is now back up 3.6 percent.
Yesterday's gains for the Dow, which followed a 135-point rise on Tuesday, capped the average's best three-day percentile increase since December 1991, when it advanced 5 percent in three sessions during a year-end run-up of 9.8 percent.
Few other indexes have performed so well. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 0.54 point yesterday, to 340.24. And the S.& P. Financials index lost 0.10 point, to 85.10 -- suggesting that the rally in large-capitalization stocks is even narrower than it was earlier in the year.
Among the worst-performing issues of late are growth stocks. For instance, the Montgomery Securities 500 Growth index -- which is based on the 500 fastest-growing companies -- is now down 18 percent on the year, partly over concerns about slowing growth rates and rising interest rates. Similarly, the Nasdaq is down 6.3 percent this year.
Stocks of large companies, meanwhile, have been rallying on solid first-quarter earnings reports, particularly among shares in retailing and consumer-product companies.
Among companies posting strong profits yesterday, shares of Ford Motor gained 1 5/8, to 34 7/8; Merck rose 1 1/8, to 85 5/8, and Time Warner gained 3 1/8, to 43 7/8.
Mr. Peroni, who believes inflation concerns were exaggerated, sees renewed optimism for the market, particularly in the second half of the year. "The inflation fears were overblown," he said. "The Fed's action is just going to prolong the steady growth scenario upon which the bull market has thrived for years."
Raymond Worseck, the chief economist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, sees things differently. Mr. Worseck, and many other analysts, expect the pace of economic growth to slow in the second half of the year, which could present a situation similar to that of 1994, when the Dow gained just 2.1 percent.
"This is about as good as it's going to be," he said. "We believe the growth rate will gradually weaken as the year goes on."
Higher interest rates and a strong dollar will begin to affect the growth rate, he said, sending the economy into what he called a "growth recession," that is, a slowdown, not a full-blown recession.
Such a situation would be similar to one that occured in 1994, when inflation jitters upset the market -- much as it is doing right now, he said.
But 1997 is not 1994, Mr. Worseck noted, they just have a few similar features. "Like Mark Twain said: History doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes.
"This year," he added, "we had a pause in the longer-term bull market, just like we did in 1994."

HEADLINE: Craig Butler Tate, 51, Executive For Colgate-Palmolive Company

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Craig B. Tate, a corporate executive who began his lifelong career with the Colgate-Palmolive Company as a summer intern and rose to become its chief technological officer with primary responsibility for product development, died on Tuesday evening in a helicopter crash in the East River off Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he was taken after the crash. 
 In his 28-year career at Colgate-Palmolive, a multinational consumer products manufacturer that is the world's largest seller of toothpaste, toothbrushes and deodorants, Mr. Tate served in a number of executive positions, including high posts in Europe, Asia and the United States. He opened the company's first manufacturing plant in China.
As chief technological officer since 1994, Mr. Tate had "global responsibility for research and development, patents, manufacturing engineering technology, information technology, strategic materials and environmental affairs," according to a biographical statement from the company.
Craig Butler Tate was born on June 16, 1945 in Winston-Salem, N.C. He grew up in Omaha, Neb., and received a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University in 1967. In 1969, he received a master's degree from Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.
It was in the summer before graduating from the Tuck School that Mr. Tate worked as an intern with Colgate-Palmolive. After graduating, he returned to Colgate-Palmolive and worked in various marketing and product management jobs. In 1984 and 1985, he worked as vice president and executive assistant to Reuben Mark, the company's chief executive officer. Later, he became the vice president for worldwide new products and vice president for global marketing.
Mr. Tate was elected an officer of the corporation in 1989 and in 1992 was named president of Colgate-Palmolive's Far East division.
He is survived by his wife, Sharon; and four children, Christopher, who is studying at Stanford, Andrew, Melissa and Carrie.

HEADLINE: Apartment Dwellers Prepare for a Strike By 30,000 Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of anxious apartment dwellers in New York City are stocking up on garbage bags, hiring security guards and otherwise gearing up for a possible strike on Monday by more than 30,000 doormen, elevator operators, handymen and janitors.
The reason for the frantic preparations is clear: nothing concentrates many New Yorkers' minds more than the prospect that the janitor who hauls the garbage down the service elevator each morning is about to go on strike. 
 Co-op boards are renting large Dumpsters into which tenants are to deposit their garbage themselves. To reduce clutter and work, tenants are being told not to put out their recyclables if there is a strike. And in a New York version of tending one's own garden, some co-op boards are telling residents they should vacuum the hallway outside their apartment door.
"The vast majority of buildings are taking the possibility of a strike very, very seriously this year," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, an association of 1,939 cooperative and condominium buildings.
Last night, at a packed meeting at the Sheraton New York Hotel, more than 1,000 union members voted to give their president the authority to call a strike. And with a strike deadline set for 12:01 A.M. Monday, negotiators for the building owners and building workers said they would begin round-the-clock talks today, acknowledging that they remained far apart over how much the workers should be paid.
About the only thing the two sides seem to agree on is that it is too early to tell whether the powerful union will walk out at 3,000 apartment buildings.
Fearing that prospect, many building owners have hired security guards to watch front doors. Some co-op boards are requiring tenants to sit at the front desk for four hours a week, and others are asking residents to help sort the mail. As security measures, some buildings plan to lock basements and laundry rooms for the duration of a strike.
Many building owners are giving out identification cards to tenants, domestics and nannies, saying people without such cards will be admitted only if escorted by a tenant.
"We're moderately worried," said Aaron Diamond, president of the co-op board at 180 Riverside Drive, at 90th Street, in Manhattan. "We're going to try to manage the best we can. When there was a strike like this in 1991, it inconvenienced a lot of people. Everyone had to go down for their deliveries. No construction work was allowed inside the building."
The apartment workers last went on strike in 1991, and after a 12-day walkout, won a pay raise of 11.6 percent over three years.
Many residents voice concern that the strike deadline is on the same day as the first night of Passover, when families, relatives and friends gather for seder feasts. Since seder guests will not have ID cards, residents fear mass confusion in their lobbies as guests are turned away at the front door or tenants have to rush downstairs to escort their guests.
"Some buildings are requiring people to come down to meet guests, while others will let guests come up if their names are first put on a list downstairs," said Neil Davidowitz, vice president of the Orsid Realty Corporation, which manages 52 apartment buildings.
Then there is the question whether there will be anyone to run the manual elevators that still exist in many pre-World War II buildings.
As often happens in labor negotiations, each side is publicly flexing its muscles in the hope of impressing its adversary that it can easily outlast the other if there is a strike.
Officials in the union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, say they have lined up the support of other vital unions, including some whose members repair buildings, to maximize pressure on landlords.
For their part, landlords and co-op owners say they have topped off their oil tanks and hired security guards to minimize the impact of a strike.
Some co-op boards are warning the union that a strike will hardly affect them because their buildings have lined up replacement workers to run elevators and take down garbage. Roger Erickson, co-op board president at 333 West End Avenue, at 76th Street, said his building has hired such workers.
"We seem to be in a very good shape, and it will be much easier for all of us," he said.
Mr. Erickson acknowledged that hiring replacement workers "raised a few eyebrows" in a neighborhood known for being politically liberal.
In the negotiations, each side has made an opening offer that the other side says is ludicrous. Labor experts note that bargainers often back off their opening positions as soon as serious negotiations begin.
Officials close to the talks say the Realty Advisory Board for Labor Relations, a landlords' group, is demanding that new building workers accept starting salaries that are 45.5 percent below the $551 a week earned by experienced doormen, elevator operators and janitors. These officials say Gus Bevona, the union's president, is demanding a raise of more than 15 percent in the first year alone, to more than $650.
"We're meeting and we're not yelling at each other, and that's good," said James F. Berg, the landlords' chief negotiator. "But we remain miles apart on economics and other items."
Many experts predict that the union will end up accepting an agreement like the one more than 30,000 service workers in commercial buildings accepted 15 months ago after a 30-day strike. Those workers, also in Local 32B-32J, agreed to a starting salary 20 percent below that of experienced workers, with their pay rising to the level of experienced workers after 30 months. In that contract, experienced workers won an 8 percent raise over three years, to more than $600 a week.
Several union members who insisted on anonymity said they saw little reason to strike because in their view it will be hard to gain a contract better than that obtained last year by the commercial building workers.
A few new elements are expected to complicate this year's negotiations. In the talks, which began last week, Mr. Bevona has argued that because of the recent jump in rents and the possibility that rent controls will be eliminated or weakened this year, landlords are in a stronger financial position and should not demand a lower starting wage.
Dennis Sheehan, a union spokesman, said, "We've had economists studying the industry and clearly it's on the rebound, and we're negotiating against that background."
Mr. Bevona faces his toughest challenge ever from a dissident movement that is eager to overthrow him and accuses him of running the union like a dictator. These dissidents had hoped to deny Mr. Bevona the power to order a strike unilaterally. Instead they want to insure that the rank and file reserve the right to review management's final offer and vote whether to strike. But last night's vote gave Mr. Bevona the right to call a strike, a move that many labor experts say strengthens a leader's hand in negotiations.
At the meeting in the Sheraton's Grand Ballroom, Mr. Bevona attacked the landlords' negotiating position and belittled the dissidents' calls for more democracy, saying their demands would weaken the union. He never opened the meeting to remarks from the floor, and when two union members sought to speak, heavily muscled guards ushered them out of the room.
Dominic Bentevegna, a leader of the dissidents, asserted that Mr. Bevona packed the meeting with loyal business agents and prevented many dissidents from getting into the ballroom.
Several apartment workers interviewed said they would accept a contract like the one commercial building workers agreed to last year, but they said it was hard to predict whether Mr. Bevona would.
Dino D'Angelo, a doorman at 164 West 72d Street, said, "Most of the rank and file aren't looking for a strike, but if management goes overboard in their demands, that could force a strike."

HEADLINE: Zairian Rebels' New Allies: Men Armed With Briefcases

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: LUBUMBASHI, Zaire, April 16

 BODY:
A week after Shaba Province fell to Laurent Kabila and his rebel troops, mining company executives are swarming around this region of mineral riches and signing lucrative deals despite the uncertainty hanging over the nation's future.
Less than two days after Lubumbashi was captured last Thursday, the executives were already flying into the city aboard private jets and setting up shop in the Hotel Karavia. They could be seen meeting at poolside and over meals with the rebels' finance minister and the newly appointed Governor of the province. 
 The stakes here are enormous. The province has billions of dollars in untapped mineral reserves. The rolling, fertile land holds millions of tons of cobalt, copper and zinc.
Today, the rebel administration signed its first mining contract, a multimillion-dollar deal with American Mineral Fields a company based in Hope, Ark.
"Here we are looking at the richest potential for copper and cobalt in the world," said Jean-Raymond Boulle, who owns a controlling interest in the company. "It's giant in terms of minerals. It will come back."
He said the risks inherent in signing a deal with a rebel government that has not been recognized by other nations are far outweighed by payoffs.
For the rebels, mining contracts provide a means of tapping the country's mineral wealth to finance the war and create jobs in an economy devastated by 30 years of corruption.
"People are going to start going back to work and getting those jobs which had been robbed from them," said the rebels' Finance Minister, Mwana Mawampanga.
Under the new joint venture the Arkansas company would take over two lucrative mining operations in return for investing $885 million over the next three years.
The company has agreed to sink $580 million into rehabilitating a dormant zinc mine at Kipushi, building a new smelting plant and acid factory on the site. It has also promised to spend $305 million on a project in Kolwezi to extract cobalt from a mountain of slag there.
The Finance Minister, Mr. Mawampanga, signed the agreement on behalf of the political arm of the rebel forces, said that, in general, the rebels intend to honor Zaire's agreements with mining companies, though they leave the door open to renegotiate the details.
"A bad contract is better than no contract," he said. "But somewhere down the road we will sit down with those who want to work in this country and check the fine points and improve things."
To the rebels and their supporters, the mineral money is a godsend. For mining executives, the goal is to protect agreements already reached last year with the Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, but some are angling to get better deals.
For instance, American Mineral Fields officials have persuaded the rebels to give them the Kolwezi mine-tailings project, even though the Zairian Government was leaning toward a South African firm.
The decision follows attempts by American Mineral to curry favor with Mr. Kabila. Specifically, Mr. Boulle has put his chartered Learjet at the rebel leader's disposal for three weeks.
Mr. Boulle is from Mauritius. The American chief executive officer of his company is Mike McMurrough, a former director and vice president of another of Mr. Boulle's companies, Diamond Field Resources. Mr. McMurrough, of Hope, Ark., President Clinton's hometown, is said to have been a land surveyor there.
Diamond Field Resources was also involved in a venture to exploit the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. The park, the only significant diamond deposit in North America, was opened by the state to private developers in 1989.
In an effort to resurrect meager production in Zaire, the state mining company, General des Carrieres et des Mines, known as Gecamines, once the main engine of the economy, turned to a series of joint operating agreements with foreign mining concerns after being crippled by years of theft and mismanagement.
Many of these companies are pushing ahead, despite the war being waged all around them. In perhaps the biggest deal, a mining subsidiary of Eurocan Consolidated Ventures signed an agreement in December to build a mine in Tenke Fungurume, a concession believed to contain 220 billion tons of copper and cobalt.
These days, executives of the company, called Tenke Fungurume Mining, are nervous. They have been staking out Mr. Kabila and his lieutenants at the hotel, seeking assurances they can go ahead with the $350 million project. So far, they have not been given a final word.
"The information we are having is that our agreement will be ratified," Dirk Vanhooymissen, the company's managing director, said. "They are encouraging us to continue working."
Another company waiting to see what the rebels will do is Anvil Mining, an Australian enterprise that won a concession from the Mobutu Government to build an open-pit copper mine at Dikuluishi, a parcel containing 1.6 million tons of high-grade ore. Anvil's director, Bill S. Turner, is also waiting on pins and needles at the Hotel Karavia for an audience with Mr. Kabila.
"The gap between what this country is producing and what this country is capable of producing is wider than anywhere else in the world," Mr. Turner said over a drink in the hotel restaurant. "This country has the capacity to support 200 or 300 mining conventions. It's a ridiculous tragedy. If this new government comes forward and makes a strong statement that they will support contracts properly, you will see a flood of mining companies coming into Zaire."
The willingness of foreign executives to sign contracts with the rebels may not be a foolhardy as it seems. If Mr. Kabila succeeds in taking the capital, they will be in business. If he does not, any new government that emerges from the crisis will be forced to attract private investment from abroad, since the World Bank and International Monetary Fund essentially cut off aid to Zaire in 1993.
What happened to Gecamines is a case study in how Mr. Mobutu's systematic and nihilistic style of official stealing has destroyed Zaire's economy.
The decline of the state company began in the late 1980's when the global demand for copper dropped. At that point, Gecamines was producing 470,000 tons of copper and about 14,000 tons of cobalt a year. Last year's output was a meager 38,000 tons of copper and 4,000 tons of cobalt.
Gecamines executives, appointed for political reasons by Mr. Mobutu and his allies, worked in collusion with customs officials to plunder the company's warehouses, stealing everything from spare parts to fuel. They also stole huge amounts of copper and cobalt, smuggling it to South African middlemen, former Gecamines officials said.
None of the profits from the company were reinvested in the mines, but were siphoned off by politicians in Kinshasa, former executives said. At the same time, Gecamines employees began cannibalizing mining apparatus, sending truckloads of spare parts, equipment and ore concentrates to South Africa.
Deep in Kipushi mine's rusting bowels, Musumali Tshapwila, a miner since 1968, worries about his imminent retirement. He said that at Kipushi tons of ore ascended the shafts to the earth's skin every day. The miners, he said, were paid enough money to buy food, send their children to school and even save a little for luxuries. Inflation has stolen their money, he said, and corruption has shut down the mine.
"I have nothing now," he said. "I don't have my own house, or even a bicycle."
Asked who was to blame, he did not hesitate. "Mobutu," he said. "He's the one who destroyed everything. He has no consideration for a human being."

Tobacco Companies in Talks On Possible Settlement
The tobacco industry has initiated talks aimed at gaining immunity from most lawsuits over smoking-related illnesses in exchange for broad concessions. The discussions could forever change the way cigarettes are marketed and regulated.
In the talks, RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris have offered to submit to F.D.A. regulation and to create a fund of more than $250 billion over the next 25 years as compensation for tobacco's health toll. [Page A1.]
 
Philip Morris announced strong earnings, and its shares, as well as those of other tobacco companies, were sharply higher, too. [D3.] 

Ford Earnings Help Auto Stocks
The Big Three auto makers' stocks soared after Ford Motor reported first-quarter profits that were far higher than analysts thought possible. General Motors and Chrysler had surpassed expectations earlier. [D3.]
 
German Compuserve Chief Indicted
Prosecutors in Bavaria have indicted the head of Compuserve's German on-line computer service on charges of trafficking in pornography, attempting to hold the company responsible for material that its customers could obtain from sites on the Internet. [D19.]
 
Divergent Results for PC Makers
Apple Computer reported a bigger-than-expected loss, but Compaq's earnings exceeded analyst estimates. [D2.]
 
Big Banks' Profits Increase

Industrial Output Surged in March
Industrial production rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in March, while housing starts maintained a healthy pace. [D7.]
 
Time Warner Report Tops Forecasts
Fueled by strong performances in almost every division, Time Warner's cash flow rose sharply, surpassing expectations. [D7.]
 
Since Time Warner failed to sell New Line Cinema, which it acquired in its purchase of Turner Broadcasting, some people have grown concerned that the autonomy of the feisty distribution and production company will be threatened. [C15.]
 
AMR's Income Beats Expectations
American Airlines' parent, AMR, reported earnings that while down slightly were better than expected, reflecting strong demand for seats despite a dispute with pilots. [D3.]
 
Rival Bid for Education Company
Harcourt General said that it was making a $740 million cash offer for National Education, a provider of educational and training services, topping a friendly bid from Sylvan Learning Systems. [D4.]
 
Strong Report by Bear Stearns
Bear Stearns said that its profit rose sharply, another in a series of largely positive earnings reports recently from Wall Street firms. [D8.]
 
Zaire Rebels Sign Mining Deal
Zaire's rebels signed their first contract for the mining of the country's underground riches, a multimillion-dollar deal with American Mineral Fields, a company based in Hope, Ark. [A10.]
 
German Marks Head East, to Stay
For all the money thrown at eastern Germany since reunification with the west, seen in the construction sites dotting Berlin, the economy remains fundamentally bankrupt. [A1.]

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Blithely Seeks Big Donors

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Undeterred by the furor over campaign fund-raising, Republicans are planning a black-tie dinner next month featuring Congressional leaders in hopes of attracting contributors who will give or raise as much as $250,000 apiece.
For a quarter of a million dollars, donors will get breakfast and photographs with Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who will share their "opinions on our party's issues and strategies for the 105th Congress," the invitation says. 
 They are also guaranteed a seat at one of the four head tables with Republican luminaries at the dinner, which will be held on May 13 at a Washington hotel. In addition to breakfast and dinner, they are invited to lunch with Republican leaders in the House and Senate, who will talk about "Republican strategies for the upcoming 1997-98 elections." Their donations earn them the title of "co-chairman" of the event.
The Republican National Committee expects a handful of the more than 2,000 guests to give or raise $250,000 each. It hopes to raise a total of $11 million.
A spokeswoman for the Republican committee, Mary Crawford, said there was nothing untoward about the party's soliciting large donations and offering contributors a chance to rub shoulders with Congressional leaders. It is the fund-raising practices of Democrats, not Republicans, Ms. Crawford said, that are being questioned.
The Republicans are so certain of their ground that a pile of "Gala Facts" sheets describing the benefits for each level of contributor were openly available on tables at the committee's spring meeting in Florida last weekend. The planners of the gala were reflecting the attitude of Senator Lott, who earlier this year described the solicitation of unlimited money as "the American way."
One Republican who plans to attend the gala said the concern among his circle of donors was not about how the event appears in light of the fund-raising controversy but whether any of the gala proceeds would go to Mr. Gingrich for the $300,000 levied against him in January by the House ethics committee. They were assured it would not, he said.
Critics say the Republicans are demonstrating a surprisingly casual approach to the appearance of trading money for access.
"It's the Republican version of your White House coffee, where large donors are being sold access to the leaders of the 105th Congress," said Kent Cooper, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a public-interest lobby that promotes a campaign finance overhaul.
"These are the people who will be setting the agenda for the next Congress," he said, "and their time is being auctioned to the wealthy in the guise of party fund-raising."
According to the gala fact sheets, those who give or raise $100,000 are designated "vice chairman" of the event and receive essentially the same treatment as those who give $250,000, except they are not seated at the head tables. Instead they are promised "V.I.P. seating."
Those who give or raise $45,000, dubbed "deputy chairman," get no breakfast and only "preferential seating" at the gala. A contribution of $15,000 buys a table and gets the giver on the dinner committee. The minimum amount accepted is $1,000, which buys only a general admission ticket to the gala and earns no special appellation.
The Republican National Committee is soliciting the unlimited, unrestricted donations from individuals, corporations or political action committees -- and will distribute the cash to Republicans running for the House and Senate, governorships and state legislatures in the 1997 and 1998 elections.
The event comes at a time when political donations during President Clinton's re-election campaign last year, particularly such "soft money" contributions to the Democratic National Committee, are under fierce scrutiny. The news media and Congressional committees are looking into questionable contributions, including whether the Chinese Government tried to buy influence with the White House through large contributions.
The Democrats have said they would return $2.7 million of the $210 million they received in contributions in the 1994-96 election cycle -- either because they were from foreign nationals or because the money's origin was unclear -- but they deny any deliberate wrongdoing. Despite the questions, President Clinton himself continues to participate in major Democratic fund-raising events.
Republicans have returned checks totaling just $231 of the $280 million they raised in the same period. The checks were given back when the donors volunteered to party officials that they were citizens of other countries. Campaign finance laws prohibit noncitizens from contributing to American political parties or candidates.
The only sign that Republicans have any concern over financial contributions is a new warning label -- "contributions from foreign nationals are prohibited" -- on their fundraising materials.
Still, Republicans are proceeding with the gala confident that the public is making a distinction between them and the Democrats.
"The climate that our country is in right now was generated by what was clearly an orchestrated effort on the part of the Democrat Party to solicit and receive funds from illegal sources," Ms. Crawford of the Republican committee said. "That is not a bipartisan problem."
Donors to the gala are not buying access to influence Congress, she said; they are supporting Republican philosophy and principles, like lower taxes and smaller government.
"That is a fundamental part of party-building in our political process," Ms. Crawford said.
She said the mere fact that the party was planning such a huge event this soon after a losing Presidential campaign and this far in advance of the 1998 midterm elections demonstrated its "high degree of confidence" that its fund-raising ability and its political future were sound and that it would not be blamed by the public for the money problems swamping the Democrats.
But Mr. Cooper of the Center for Responsive Politics said the event reconfirmed that influence in either party was only for the rich.
"I think the public will see this as another example of a system in which they are not being represented," he said. "If you don't have the economic wealth, you're not going to be at those events."
Mr. Cooper suggested that if the donors were interested only in the party's principles, the party would not need to use Congressional leaders as a draw.
The Republicans in the first quarter of this year raised $11.2 million and lowered their debt to $6 million from $9.75 million. Earlier this month the Republican National Committee received a single donation of $1 million, from Rich and Helen DeVos of Michigan. Mr. DeVos was a co-founder of Amway.
The DeVoses are out of the country, but their daughter-in-law, Betsy DeVos, chairman of the Republican Party in Michigan, said that her in-laws had never received or expected anything special for their many donations over the years and that she had no problem with large donations.
"Obviously neither party has a problem with large donations," Mrs. DeVos said. "It's fully reported, and as long as that's a part of the law, certainly the parties should continue to accept them."

Can Bust Be Far Behind the Boom?
Mark the moment. Today, 34 of 35 Broadway theaters are lighted, making this the most crowded April on record, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers. The Minskoff is empty with the closing of "Sunset Boulevard," and Circle in the Square and the Walter Kerr will go dark next week when "Stanley" and "Present Laughter" close, but the Broadway engine is fully cranked and revving harder than it has in years.
 Six new musicals are up and running or will open in the next 10 days. "Play On" and "Dream" have opened, to be followed, in order, by "Titanic," Steel Pier," "The Life" and "Jekyll and Hyde." "Candide," a revival, opens on April 29. 
 The straight play may be in trouble both on and off Broadway, but star turns by the likes of Christopher Plummer in "Barrymore," Antony Sher in "Stanley," Janet McTeer and Owen Teale in "A Doll's House," and Rip Torn and Shirley Knight in "The Young Man From Atlanta" have energized the season. Off Broadway, the activity is frantic, with scarcely a theater to be had.
Every spring, Broadway blooms, as shows position themselves for the Tony Awards. But this year has been very good to the theater, with gross receipts up 14 percent and attendance up 11 percent over last year. Producers and theater owners point to an improving national and local economy, a strong tourist economy and the turnaround in the fortunes of Times Square.
"There's a greater sense of excitement than I can recall in 10 years," said Rocco Landesman, the president of the Jujamcyn Theaters. "The long-term trend seems encouraging, because there seems to be a hunger for live entertainment. Not everyone is hunched over a computer or glued to a video game."
Jeffrey Seller, a producer of "Rent," said: "This is a season when six musicals are vying for four places in the Tony nominations." Actually, seven, including "Juan Darien." "It's mind-boggling," said Mr. Seller. "I think producers are back in the game."
Every game, unfortunately, has losers, and there could be a lot of them very soon. "Wait six weeks," said Emmanuel Azenberg, a veteran producer who looks into the future and sees lots of pain and suffering. "Play On" and "Dream" opened to poor reviews and are struggling. "The Young Man From Atlanta," despite very positive reviews, has its work cut out for it at the box office, underscoring the tough odds that straight plays have to beat. If the wave of new musicals fails to generate a breakout hit, Broadway could be awash in red ink. "We could see $40 million or $50 million in musicals go right down the drain," said Arthur Cantor, a producer. As the attention shifts to Broadway, and the crowds follow, Off Broadway will suffer accordingly. It's a seasonal pattern, but the sheer number of productions promises a more harrowing shakeout than usual.
For a day or two, at least, hope puts out tender shoots. The reckoning will come soon enough. "In a couple of weeks we'll know whether we've drawn a larger audience," said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization. "If we have a few hits, it will be great. If we don't, we'll all have empty theaters."
 
 
From Outer Space Down to Earth
 Alien amazon one day, mousy, oppressed housewife the next. Kristen Johnston's dance card is getting interesting. In an abrupt change of pace, Ms. Johnston, who plays a male alien trapped in a statuesque female body on "Third Rock From the Sun," winds up the television season on Monday in Los Angeles and flies to New York on Tuesday to begin rehearsals for Peter Hedges's new play, "Baby Anger," which begins performances at Playwrights Horizons on May 16. Her co-star will be John Pankow, who plays Ira on "Mad About You."
The play is a black comedy about a young couple whose baby son unexpectedly achieves stardom when he is cast in a television commercial as a girl. "This is completely different from any part I've ever played," said Ms. Johnston. "She's a young mother who, by giving birth to this child, completely loses her identity, with tragic consequences." Ms. Johnston has known Mr. Hedges since the mid-1980's, when she first started acting Off Broadway with the Atlantic Theater Company and Naked Angels. "Peter finds comedy in the sickest situations, like obesity, so he is the perfect man for this," said Ms. Johnston, whose Texas Guinan-style voice makes it a little hard to imagine her as a character she describes as "totally submissive."
"It was very much an active choice on my part to take the role," she said. "When you read one script after another calling for a vixen from outer space, you look for something different."
 
 
Footlights
 *Malcolm Gets and Davis Gaines will play the Antipholus twins, and Mario Cantone and Michael McGrath have been cast as the Dromio twins in "The Boys From Syracuse," the last musical in City Center's Encores series, which runs for five performances, beginning on May 1. Debbie Gravitte, Rebecca Luker and Sarah Uriarte are the objects of their affections. Marian Seldes will play the Seeress and Julie Halston the head courtesan. The book, by George Abbott, has been adapted by David Ives, and the choreography is by Kathleen Marshall. Susan H. Schulman directs.
*On Sunday, theatergoers will be able to buy tickets to "Chicago" for New Year's Eve 1999. The price is $200. The Greeks had a word for this: hubris. Yes, "Chicago" is going great guns now. But as the curtain closes on the 20th century, will it still have legs? Look for Barry and Fran Weissler, the producers, to refresh the cast ingeniously. Perhaps Dominique Dawes as Roxie Hart, Rosie O'Donnell as Mama Thornton, Joe Piscopo as Billy Flynn and, in a casting coup, Joanna Pacitti as Velma Kelly.
*Capitol Steps, the satirical revue at the John Houseman Theater, gets a guest star on Thursday night. David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor of New York, will take the stage for a parody of "Reviewing the Situation," from the musical "Oliver." A sample: "I'm previewing the next election/My opinion is, it really would be keen/To have a Mayor whose predilection/Is to guarantee he never would be mean." For most of the song, Mr. Dinkins gets sung at, but he will chip in a word or two, and, on cue, the line, "Too bad you can't have Dinkins back."
*An interesting name pops up in the cast for "Touch My Face," a comedy by Jan Jalenak that runs from May 8 to 24 at the Fourth Street Theater. The Amy Hart Redford who plays Cara, a lesbian bar owner, is the daughter of Robert of that ilk. Already she's ahead of Dad, whose inauspicious New York debut came in January 1959 in "Tall Story." If you blinked, you missed him. He had a walk-on part as a basketball player.
*Paula Vogel's "How I Learned to Drive" moves to the Century Theater on East 15th Street on May 6 for an open-ended run. The cast remains the same.

HEADLINE: The Great Gold Rush in Zaire

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, April 17

 BODY:
Even before the leader of Zaire's rebellion can finish off the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko and seize this country's capital, a series of major business deals may enable him to resist Western pressures for economic change and democracy.
The most spectacular of these deals, an $885 million contract between the rebellion and an American mining company, American Mineral Fields, announced Wednesday in the rebel-held city of Lubumbashi, would rehabilitate zinc, copper and cobalt mines in the country's southern Shaba Province. 
 Now, Zairian economic experts, former Government officials and diplomats here say that business like this has dramatically increased the leeway for the leader of the rebellion, Laurent Kabila, to decide whose aid and advice to accept, even when he has not won power outright.
In recent weeks, as Mr. Kabila has drawn closer to his goal of unseating Mr. Mobutu, many Western Governments have taken the view that the impending change here is bound to bring improvement to Africa's worst-governed country.
Far from a statement of faith in Mr. Kabila, a lifelong revolutionary with a checkered past, this optimism is based in large part on the notion of leverage. Although Zaire is richly endowed with natural resources, its economy is near collapse, and many assume that rebuilding the country will require huge amounts of foreign assistance.
Mr. Mobutu has been cut off from foreign aid and lending during this decade, and there has been an assumption throughout this war that Mr. Kabila, or whoever succeeds the longtime President, would be eager to ingratiate himself with Western governments in order to have access to development loans and other assistance.
"You are not going to see any kind of American aid program here before we have elections," said a senior Western diplomat. "We will not support dictator Kabila."
But starting late last year, almost imperceptibly at first, and quickly gathering steam, there has been a rush of mining companies and other economic operators out of Kinshasa, where corruption has always made business difficult, into rebel-held areas rich in minerlas, where Mr. Kabila's associates have been quick to offer advantageous terms to adventurous investors.
The first of Mr. Kabila's major deals involved the huge Kilo-Moto gold field in northeastern Zaire, which is commonly referred to here as Mr. Mobutu's personal gold mine. At Kilo-Moto, a senior Zairian mining official here said, a Belgian-South African company that was turned down last year for a $162 million in World Bank financing to rehabilitate the mine is now raising money for the project by buying gold from free-lance miners, which is exported at a handsome profit.
Officials here said that another company, the Canadian-controlled firm Sominki, which formerly mined tin in Zaire, is now investing in gold production in the region of the rebel-held east-central city of Kindu.
Where Zaire's official gold mining registry used to show receipts for several major foreign mining firms, today, in a reflection of the loss of most of the country's mineral rich zones to the rebellion, there is only one Western company that still declares its gold production -- about 200 pounds each month -- to Mr. Mobutu's Government.
Most of the other operators are believed to be already active in rebel-held zones.
Mining experts say that in recent years Zaire has had fraudulent exports of about 900 pounds of gold each month, and by sanctioning the official corruption that has been a way of life here, the rebels stand to gain an even bigger windfall from this.
"The east of our country is so rich that is does not need to have huge investments to restart the economy," said Willy Katupa, editor of the Zairian economic review Perspectives. "Just by controlling the borders and diminishing fraud, the rebellion can expect to start receiving large sums of money. The foreign investment will certainly follow."
The story here is much the same for diamonds. Until recently, Kinshasa was averaging about $20 million a month in revenues from small-scale diamond producers, and an additional $8 million a month from the state-owned industrial mining company, Miba. But with the fall of East Kasai Province two weeks ago, all of that wealth, and the cash flow it generates, is controlled by the rebels.
Many here fear that Mr. Kabila's treatment of Miba's wealth may be indicative of his broader approach to power. Although the charges are unproved, it is widely believed in diplomatic and business circles that when Mr. Kabila swept triumphantly into the diamond-mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi recently, he forced Miba's managers to hand over all the production on hand.
The director of the company, Jonas Mukamba, a longtime partner of Mr. Mobutu, was reportedly flown off to Goma where he is said to be under house arrest.
"The March diamond production was already packed up and awaiting transport to Kinshasa," said one senior mining official here, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Kabila just carted it off."
In the 1970's, long after Zaire's other early insurrections had collapsed, Mr. Kabila reportedly thrived with a small band of rebels in the Fizi-Baraka mountains of eastern Zaire by mining gold and paying off soldiers sent to wipe them out.
"This is a guy who knows a little bit about gold and corruption," said one regional military analyst.
Little, meanwhile, is known about Mr. Kabila's philosophy of government. Based on his movement's statements so far, it can be said that there is no inclination toward Western-style elections presided over by international observers.
Today, in fact, the strongest outside influences on Mr. Kabila come from Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, whom he calls a "good friend," and the Rwandan Vice President and strongman, Paul Kagame. Both leaders took power by force.
Neither Uganda nor Rwanda bear much resemblance to Western democracies, and Mr. Kabila seems to have followed Mr. Museveni's early political blueprint by saying that he will not tolerate opposition political parties during a transitional phase in power.
During Mr. Kabila's early years in revolt against Mr. Mobutu, he was known as a committed Marxist. The beliefs that he seems to have carried through the years come from Patrice Lumumba, a hero of African nationalism who was Zaire's first prime minister. Mr. Lumumba, who was assassinated in 1961 with the direct encouragement, if not participation, of the Central Intelligence Agency, strongly believed that African countries had to find their own paths and could not have their futures dictated by outside powers.
Many of those who watch Mr. Kabila expect that he will bear this same trait, making him highly resistant to demands to implement Western-prescribed economic liberalization programs or install a political system with generous guarantees of political freedoms and effective checks and balances of state institutions.
More importantly, with vast mineral wealth that is relatively easy to pluck, and foreign investors already beating at his door, he may feel no compulsion to do so.
"We are standing here watching Kabila sweep up our country, promising changes that he hasn't bothered even to describe to us," said a Zairian banker who has opposed Mr. Mobutu in the past and now fears the unknown under Mr. Kabila. "The international community has just stood by watching this, and by the time we figure out where this man is taking us, it may be too late to change the course of history."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Data and Comments On Mark Lower the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most leading currencies yesterday after the Government reported weaker-than-expected economic data and the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, expressed support for a strong mark.
But the dollar strengthened slightly against the Japanese yen after the Commerce Department reported a mild shrinkage in the monthly trade deficit with Japan. Dealers who sold yen and bought marks after Mr. Tietmeyer's comments indirectly contributed to the dollar's strength against the Japanese currency. 
 After trading had largely ended, however, the Commerce Department said it had made a mistake in tabulating the figure. It said the actual deficit was substantially lower than the initial report.
But the dollar's movements were limited in either direction, partly reflecting a reluctance to make aggressive bets before a meeting next week of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The dollar's rise this year against the yen and the mark is expected to be an important topic of discussion there. "You have a lot of uncertainty at these levels, and it just resulted in a lot of range trading today," said Richard Vullo, vice president for foreign exchange at Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank in New York.
The dollar settled at 1.7248 marks in New York, down from 1.7283 marks on Wednesday, and at 126.05 yen, up from 125.73 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6287 from $1.6244.
The dollar rallied against the mark in early dealings after the Ifo economic research institute in Munich reported a surprising drop in its monthly business confidence index, a gauge of Germany's economic climate. Later Mr. Tietmeyer, speaking at a news conference, said the mark's value "reasonably reflects fundamentals, but a further weakening of the mark wouldn't be in our interest." The dollar fell to an intraday low of 1.7225 on that news.
The dollar was put under further pressure by a Labor Department report showing that new claims for unemployment benefits rose to the highest level in nearly three months last week, and by a widely followed survey of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showing a sharp drop in regional business activity last month.

HEADLINE: Lending Influence

 BODY:
We were all set to applaud Newt Gingrich for paying his own fine. Then he announced how he would raise the $300,000 levied against him for ethics violations. It amounts to an inventive new form of influence peddling, and this time the buyer is a familiar Washington player in a new role.
Under this insider deal, Mr. Gingrich will borrow the money not from a bank but from Bob Dole. He will not have to repay Mr. Dole a dime of principal or interest for eight years, by which time he will presumably be long gone from Congress and in a position to tap some of the same sources of money he is now forswearing. 
 The arrangement might pass the smell test if Mr. Dole had not stepped into a new role as a Washington lawyer. He says he is acting for the good of the party whose Presidential nomination he won in 1996. But let's get real here. What Beltway lawyer would pass up a chance to make a Speaker of the House beholden by wrapping him in debt?
It is, in short, a winning deal for Mr. Dole and a handy bailout for Mr. Gingrich. But it is not a clean deal. The House ethics committee is in even greater disarray than it was when Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut was its leader. It is imperative that the ethics committee reconstitute itself in a hurry and tell Mr. Gingrich it will approve his deal if he gets the money from a real bank instead of the Bank of Dole.
When Mr. Gingrich announced his payment plan yesterday, he portrayed it as both a sacrifice and an ethically pristine way to repay his debt without using campaign funds or a legal defense fund. He said, for example, that soliciting donations from supporters "would simply be seen as one more politician shirking his duty and one more example of failing to do the right thing."
But the Dole deal is a dodge even though the numbers look unfavorable at first glance. The $300,000 loan comes with an interest rate of 10 percent. If Mr. Gingrich pays no interest and principal for eight years, which is his option, he will owe Mr. Dole well over $600,000 in the year 2005, assuming compounding. By then, however, Mr. Gingrich will presumably be free to use the very funds he now shuns. Republican rules require him to relinquish the Speakership after 2002. By leaving the House at that point, he can -- with no fear of political retaliation -- dip into leftover campaign funds or lean on lobbyists or the clients of Bob Dole's law firm for whom he may have done favors over the years. In the meantime, during the balance of his House career, he will have escaped any annual payments unless he chooses to make them.
The 10-point loan agreement between them stipulates that the moment Mr. Dole becomes a registered lobbyist, the agreement ends. That, too, is a charade. Though Mr. Dole may never technically be required to register, he has recently joined one of the most powerful law firms in Washington -- Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand -- which is not only in the legal business but the influence business on behalf of an impressive roster of corporate and governmental clients. From this day forward Mr. Gingrich will not be able to make a legislative move without the suspicion that he has done so at the suggestion of Mr. Dole or someone in Mr. Dole's firm.
Mr. Gingrich came close to making the smart move by going to a bank like other citizens. But something in him rebelled. We are reminded that one of his first acts as Speaker was an attempt to make himself financially beholden to Rupert Murdoch. Now he has settled on Bob Dole. We have to wonder what he has against being a freestanding Speaker.

HEADLINE: Craig Butler Tate, 51, Executive Of Colgate-Palmolive Company

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Craig Butler Tate, a corporate executive who began his lifelong career with the Colgate-Palmolive Company as a summer intern and rose to become its chief technological officer, died on Tuesday evening in a helicopter crash in the East River off Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
 In his 28-year career at Colgate-Palmolive, the multinational consumer products manufacturer that is the world's largest seller of toothpaste, toothbrushes and deodorants, Mr. Tate served in a number of executive positions, including high posts in Europe, Asia and the United States. He opened the company's first manufacturing plant in China.
As chief technological officer since 1994, Mr. Tate had global responsibility for research, product development and patents, the company said this week.
Craig Butler Tate was born on June 16, 1945, in Winston-Salem, N.C. He grew up in Omaha and received a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University in 1967. In 1969, he received a master's degree from Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.
After graduating, he returned to Colgate-Palmolive, where he had been an intern the year before, and worked in various marketing and product management jobs. In 1984 and 1985, he worked as vice president and executive assistant to Reuben Mark, the company's chief executive officer. Later, he became the vice president for worldwide new products and vice president for global marketing. Mr. Tate was elected an officer of the corporation in 1989 and in 1992 was named president of the Far East division.
He is survived by his wife, Sharon Graham Tate; four children, Christopher Graham Tate, who is studying at Stanford, Andrew Curtis Tate, Melissa Arne Tate and Carrie Elizabeth Tate; his father, John Everett Tate Jr. of Bentonville, Ark.; his mother, Mary Elizabeth Krebs of Tucson, Ariz.; three brothers, John Everett Tate 3d and Mark Taylor Tate, both of Tucson, and G. Truett Tate of Frankfurt, Germany, and a stepbrother, William Brown of Omaha.

For 8th Avenue in the 50's, 80's-Like Growth Spurt

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Construction has begun on a mixed-income rental apartment building that will fill the east side of Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, ending a seven-year lull in residential construction in the neighborhood known as Clinton, or Hell's Kitchen.
The building -- on the site of a former parking lot at 250 West 50th Street -- will have 550 studio to two-bedroom apartments and 39,000 square feet of retail space on the lower levels. Eighty percent of the 400- to 1,200-square-foot apartments will be rented at market value. The remaining 20 percent will be leased at reduced prices to tenants whose annual incomes are $17,500 to $24,500, depending on household size. 
 Jack Resnick & Sons Inc. is developing the $120 million project, which is expected to be completed by the fall of 1998. It is the first major residential construction in six years for the Manhattan-based company, as well as its first mixed-income rental.
The new building underscores renewed developer interest in the neighborhood, where gentrification began in the last decade but was cut short when the mid-80's building boom deflated and the economy faltered. But now, with the economy reviving and with 42d Street redevelopment drawing attention to the whole West Side, Eighth Avenue in the 50's once again seems ripe for renewal, industry professionals said.
And, because the area has not seen much high-rise development, there are available sites, and deals are being made, said Richard R. Pergolis, a partner at Pergolis-Swartz Associates Inc., a mortgage brokerage in Manhattan
The Related Companies -- an active developer of mixed-income rental projects, including a 180-unit building on East 84th Street at First Avenue -- is considering building another such project on a site on the west side of Broadway at 55th Street that it recently bought from Chase Manhattan Bank. And Zeckendorf Realty confirmed that it recently sold the former site of the Adonis Theater, an X-rated movie house, between 50th and 51st Streets on the west side of Eighth Avenue. Industry executives say that reports are circulating that the buyer is Harry Macklowe, who plans to build a 300-unit apartment building there. Repeated calls to Mr. Macklowe seeking comment were not returned.
The neighborhood's office market is also active. For instance, the office tower at Worldwide Plaza, the 1.6 million-square-foot mixed-use complex that occupies the entire block between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 49th and 50th Streets, is fully leased, said Tom A. Javits of Zeckendorf Realty, which manages the property. The project was built in the heady days of the mid-80's by a group led by William Zeckendorf Jr., in an effort to establish the west side of midtown as a viable corporate address. Late last fall, the Blackstone Group, an investment banking firm, took control of the office component from its mortgage holder.
All of those factors, along with Manhattan's hot rental market, entered into Resnick & Sons' decision to move ahead with its new project, said Scott N. Resnick, the company's executive managing director. He said another reason is the continued leasing activity at the Symphony House, the 480-unit rental building the company built in 1987 at 235 West 56th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.
"We felt then and feel even more so now that the evolution of Eighth Avenue has begun and is likely to continue," said Mr. Resnick. That is resulting in a demand for more rentals. He said the $17 million price for the 35,000-square-foot property, a preassembled site in an area of jumbled landholdings, was attractive.
Most of the apartments in the building, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichenstein Claman & Efron, will be one-bedrooms and marketed to single professionals who work in the office buildings within several blocks of the site, said Mr. Resnick. There will also be corporate apartments, he said.
Monthly rents are to be $1,500 to $4,000 for the market-rate apartments. Rents for the low-income units will be about $429 to $550, no more than 30 percent of tenants' income. Leasing will begin in the summer of 1998, said Mr. Resnick.
Both the Resnick building, for which ground was broken last month, and the planned Related Companies tower are to be built as so-called 80-20 projects. In return for keeping 20 percent of the apartments affordable to low-income tenants, the city or state issues tax-exempt bond financing to provide permanent financing to builders, who are also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Are Higher as Concern About Inflation Eases

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday as several weak economic reports reduced the threat of an aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 1 2/32, to a price of 94 19/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.06 percent, from 7.09 percent on Wednesday. 
 One of the reports issued yesterday showed that the United States trade deficit declined in February, to $10.4 billion, though that was still higher than the $10.1 billion deficit that economists had expected.
But the $10.4 billion figure represented a downward revision from one issued by the Commerce Department early in the day. After the markets closed, the department said it had found an error in its tabulation of the trade deficit, meaning that some investors had been placing their bets based on the erroneously high initial figure, $11.6 billion.
Economists, commenting on the higher figure, said that the relatively weak trade performance would subtract from growth in the first quarter, reducing the need for the Fed to raise interest rates substantially to head off inflation. Still, they said, one increase should be expected at the meeting next month of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the trade deficit "will continue to act as a drag on economic growth as the year progresses, as the strong dollar helps the Fed in its fight against inflation and argues for more moderate increases in interest rates than would otherwise be the case."
"Furthermore," Mr. Fine said, "the concept of a widening trade deficit vis-a-vis a shrinking budget deficit has implications for future foreign purchases of Treasury securities and will likely provide a base for the government market during the remainder of the year."
A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
In the other economic news yesterday, a report by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed a weakening of regional business activity, and a Government report showed that initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week.
Signs of a moderation in economic activity would be expected to give the market a lift because they make it less likely that inflation, which erodes the value of bonds, will reappear. But Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said, "The market saw only limited relief from the Philly Fed data."
Treasury securities prices were lifted as much by covering of short positions after reports that hedge funds, which are big investment pools, were buying into two- and five-year notes. Short-covering occurs when the market rises and forces short-sellers, who have bet on a decline by selling borrowed securities in the hopes of profiting when they buy them back for less, to repurchase the securities to limit the losses. That has a buoying effect.
Elsewhere, in when-issued trading, the two-year note to be auctioned next week was offered at a price to yield 6.44 percent, an improvement from 6.49 percent the previous day. The five-year note also improved to 6.74 percent, from 6.78 percent.

HEADLINE: High Earners Paying No U.S. Income Tax Rose to Nearly 2,400 in 1993

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Nearly 2,400 of the Americans with the highest incomes paid no Federal income taxes in 1993, up from just 85 individuals and couples in 1977, the latest available information from the Internal Revenue Service shows.
While the number of Americans who make $200,000 or more grew more than 15-fold from 1977 to 1993, the number of people in that income category who paid no income taxes grew 28-fold or nearly twice as fast, according to a quarterly statistical bulletin issued by the I.R.S. 
 The report also shows that 18,000 Americans with high incomes paid less than 5 percent of their income in taxes. And it cast doubt on the effectiveness of the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to insure that the wealthy paid at least some income taxes.
Tax lawyers and other tax experts said yesterday that the number of Americans with incomes over $200,000 who pay little or no income taxes had certainly grown since 1993.
The agency did not specify how the 2,392 individuals and couples were able to avoid paying income taxes, but figures in 24 pages of statistical tables it released indicate that three-fourths of them received tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds. Because municipal bond interest is generally not taxable, the interest rates paid to owners are typically less than for corporate bonds.
On one-fourth of the returns, a combination of interest deductions and taxes paid to states and local governments was the most frequent reason for eliminating Federal income taxes, the information shows. Income taxes paid to foreign governments, which generally are offset dollar for dollar against United States income taxes, were the primary reason no taxes were due in about one-fifth of the cases.
Losses from limited partnerships and S Corporations were also major reasons that no taxes were due. These types of business entities pay no income taxes, but money taken from them is included in the taxable income of partners and owners.
Economists and others experts interviewed yesterday said they also believed that falling audit rates were a significant factor in explaining how people making $200,000 or more could pay little or no income taxes.
Experts also said the I.R.S.'s figures raised questions about the effectiveness of the alternative minimum tax, which Congress adopted in 1969, after an outcry over the disclosure by Treasury Secretary Joseph Barr that 155 individuals and families made more than $200,000 that year but paid no income taxes.
The alternative minimum tax is a separate income tax system that allows fewer deductions and exemptions than the regular income tax. In 1986 Congress strengthened the alternative minimum tax and shut down most tax shelters.
Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist, said the 1986 changes did not go far enough to eliminate differences in how various investments were treated for tax purposes. Mr. Aaron said that having so many Americans with high incomes paying no taxes was "highly demoralizing" and will weaken support for the income tax system.
Barry Bosworth, another Brookings Institution economist, said the number of high income Americans who paid no taxes was the predictable result of "a decade of highly complex changes in the tax code and their unintended consequences."
Mary B. Hevener, a former Reagan Administration tax policy adviser and now a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, said she was not surprised that more of the Americans with the highest incomeswere paying little or no taxes.
"With diminishing audits," Ms. Hevener said, "people are realizing it is possible to save money on their taxes and they are becoming more aggressive about reducing their taxes. That is why you see this growth" in the number of high income people who pay no Federal income taxes.
Release of the latest Statistics of Income Bulletin follows by days the posting on the Internet of I.R.S. information showing that in the past decade the agency had significantly reduced its audits of people with the highest incomes while increasing audits of those with the lowest.
Audits of those making more than $100,000, roughly those with incomes in the top 5 percent, have fallen to less than 3 percent in 1995 from nearly 12 percent in 1988, figures obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University show. At the same time, audits of those making less than $25,000 increased, rising to 1.04 percent in 1995 from seven-tenths of 1 percent in 1994.
The number of Americans with high incomes who pay little or no taxes will continue to rise, the experts said, in part because in 1993 Congress gave a tax break to landlords, allowing unlimited deductions for depreciation and other accounting losses. This means that a landlord who makes a $1 million salary, but who has paper losses from a real estate investment of $1 million, can report zero taxable income and pay no income taxes.
The analysis was based on the concept of "expanded income," which the I.R.S. regards as the best indicator of how much money very high income individuals and couples make. It includes the wages, dividends and interest that are included in the adjusted gross income . But it also includes interest on tax-exempt municipal bonds, nontaxable Social Security benefits, certain foreign income and other details covered by the alternative minimum tax.
A parallel set of statistics based solely on adjusted gross income showed that 1,950 of the 993,326 individuals and couples with incomes of $200,000 or more paid no income taxes in 1993.
The I.R.S. audit data is posted on the Internet at http://www.trac.syr.edu/tracirs.

HEADLINE: Dow's Rally Ends With a Decline of 21.27

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average snapped a streak of three consecutive days of impressive gains.
While technology stocks rose for the first time in three sessions, the Dow fell 21.27 points, to 6,658.60, despite carrying modest gains into the final hour of trading. 
 For the Dow, the losses ended a stretch during which the blue-chip average had gained about 288 points, or 4.5 percent, over three days -- the best such performance in more than five years.
Somewhat troubling, though, was a report that came out after the market closed yesterday showing that cash flows into stock mutual fund continued to lag far behind last year's pace.
Although there have not been large scale redemptions this year, the pace of cash flowing into stock funds has slowed significantly since late March, according to AMG Data Services, a fund tracking service based in Arcata, Calif.
For instance, in the week ended Wednesday, cash inflows into equity funds totaled about $1.6 billion, down from about $4.1 billion a week earlier and about $5.2 billion at the comparable point last year.
Funds that invest in growth and income stocks, including the index funds that track the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, gained last week. But there were redemptions from funds that focus on technology and small-capitalization stocks -- both badly trailing the larger market this year.
Coincidentally, technology and small-cap stocks both gained yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.80 points, to 1,217.07, and the Russell 2000 index of small caps rose 0.19 point, to 340.43.
The Nasdaq was paced by gains in Intel, which rose 4, to 138, and Cisco Systems, up 2, to 49 1/2. And Dell Computer, which is now up 45 percent on the year, continues to defy the larger technology sector. Yesterday, Dell gained 1 3/4, to 77.
The S.& P. 500, however, lost ground yesterday, largely because of a late afternoon selloff that saw the Dow tumble 50 points during a 20-minute stretch just after 3 P.M.
"There were just probably some program trades pulling the market back after a 200 plus-point gain," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at Bank Boston. "But the momentum is clearly behind the interest rate move. The market fears a little less that rates will go up to 7 1/2 or 8 percent."
Early in the day, the market reacted favorably to Government figures that showed an increase in the number of initial unemployment claims filed last week, a suggestion that the economy could be moderating, rather than accelerating. That is considered good news for investors who are worried about inflation and higher interest rates.
As a result, all the big indexes received a lift, but the late-session computer-generated sell program traded about 350 Dow and S.& P. stocks, pulling down those market measures, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.
The Dow was dragged down by shares of Procter & Gamble, Sears, Roebuck and General Electric. P.& G. fell 2 3/8, to 121 1/2; Sears dropped 2, to 46 3/4, and G.E. lost 1 1/2, to 103 7/8.
Despite yesterday's losses, the Dow has gained 3.3 percent on the year. At this time last year, however, the index was up 8.5 percent. Since reaching its high of 7,085.16 on March 11, the Dow has struggled, along with the broader market, largely over concerns about rising interest rates.
"We're in one of those bona fide trading ranges," Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said. "A lot of people have placed bets on the market, and they're just waiting to see what happens."
Indeed, with mutual fund inflows trailing far behind last year's record pace, when a $221 billion came in, and with the benchmark Treasury above 7 percent, some analysts are wondering whether the market can regain its early year momentum.
But Mr. Riley at Bank Boston said that strong first-quarter earnings were already having a positive affect on the market.
"Quarterly earnings are in line with expectations and above," he said. "That has given investors confidence."

HEADLINE: Lower East Side Councilman Is 4th Candidate for Manhattan Borough Chief

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Striking the most combative tone yet in the race for Manhattan borough president, City Councilman Antonio Pagan officially announced his candidacy yesterday, declaring himself "the most independent candidate" and hurling pointed jabs at his rivals and the official he hopes to succeed.
At a news conference outside City Hall, Mr. Pagan, 38, who represents the Lower East Side, asserted that the incumbent Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, operated her office as a "political public relations machine." Ms. Messinger is running in the Democratic primary for mayor. 
 The crowded field to replace Ms. Messinger already includes Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick of Greenwich Village and two colleagues from the Council, Adam Clayton Powell 4th of East Harlem and C. Virginia Fields of central Harlem and the Upper West Side.
Another candidate, George N. Spitz, plans to enter the race today. Mr. Spitz, a retired state auditor with a reputation as a political gadfly, said his campaign would focus on eliminating the borough president's job through a referendum. If that effort fails, he said, he will reduce the office's budget by half, if he wins.
How well Mr. Pagan will do is difficult to assess, given the racial and ethnic political calculus of Manhattan. Mr. Powell, the Puerto Rican-born son of a black political icon, is expected to complicate the efforts of Mr. Pagan, who is Puerto Rican, to attract Hispanic votes.
Ms. Fields, who is black, is campaigning heavily for liberal white votes and is expected to do well among black voters. Ms. Glick, who is white, has raised the most money so far and is expected to do well among liberal white voters. And both Mr. Pagan and Ms. Glick are gay and could draw votes among those voters.
Mr. Pagan said he had played a major role in the economic revitalization of the Lower East Side neighborhoods he has represented in the Council since 1992.
"My district is now a healthy economic model for all of Manhattan," he said. "We have worked with the police and the Mayor to shut down crack houses."
For their part, Mr. Pagan's Democratic rivals have accused the Councilman of being tied too closely to the Giuliani administration, and have criticized him because real estate interests have donated large amounts of money to him. Some of Mr. Pagan's rivals have criticized him for voting three years ago to lift controls from apartments with relatively wealthy tenants.
Mr. Pagan said that he voted recently with the Council in favor of extending rent-control laws and that he was not a political tool of landlords.

That is because the 2.5 million subscribers to the Microsoft Network have been unable to send or receive E-mail since Wednesday evening -- and are unlikely to be able to before the weekend. 
 Showing that even the most influential company in cyberspace can be swamped by the rising tides of Internet traffic, Microsoft disabled the E-mail service, with no warning to users, to rush through a network expansion three weeks ahead of schedule.
Many Microsoft Network users had encountered delays in sending and receiving E-mail in recent weeks, as the company's network struggled to keep up with increasing demand.
The company said that no E-mail messages would be lost and that the service would be working by Saturday.
Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said the outage was not surprising, calling it "growing pains."
But other analysts were less sanguine.
"I would say it would be a big problem if it was down for five hours," said Patrick H. Keane, an analyst for Jupiter Communications in New York. "It would be a big problem if it was down for 12 hours. I would say it's a pretty monumental problem if it's down for a couple of days."

HEADLINE: American Trade Deficit Decreased 18% in February

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit narrowed 18 percent in February, though not as much as expected, as both exports and imports rose to new peaks, the Commerce Department said today.
The trade gap declined to $10.4 billion in February from $12.7 billion in January, which was the highest total since the department began tracking services as well as goods each month. Economists had expected the deficit to fall to $10.1 billion. 
 In an odd twist, the $10.4 billion figure was provided only after the Commerce Department said late in the day it had made a mistake in reporting the trade deficit this morning. It was first given as $11.6 billion, but that figure was discovered to have been overstated by $1.2 billion because of a miscount of oil imports.
The department said that some oil imports in months as far back as November 1995 had been included in the February total. That means that figures for previous months may have to be revised as well, in addition to tables showing trade with individual nations, particularly those from which the United States imports oil. Officials said they would release a schedule for revisions on Friday.
Donald J. Fine, chief market strategist at Chase Asset Management, said the change, though bothersome, would not have a significant effect on the financial markets, where traders make investment decisions based in part on economic reports like the one today. He said the $1.2 billion change was not big enough to greatly alter perceptions of growth in terms of the gross domestic product.
"This is very small potatoes," Mr. Fine said. "It just means the trade deficit improved a bit more than they said."
Before the figure was corrected, Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley hailed the results as displaying "abundant signs of a strong and competitive" economy, with exports buoyant despite the dollar's surge on currency markets and American consumers prosperous enough to buy cars and other foreign goods in quantity. Presumably, the revised report would only strengthen that picture.
Analysts were concerned, though, about a trade gap that remained high, and they pointed to a longer-term trend of slowing exports that, unless the dollar retreats, implied the loss of a big spur to economic growth.
With the combined January and February deficit 37 percent higher than in the comparable months last year, which ended with the widest trade gap of the 1990's, the deficit's size is again fueling protectionist sentiment in Congress. That could prove a problem for the Clinton Administration, which is seeking fast-track authority to negotiate new trade agreements and could affect the negotiations on whether to renew China's preferred trading status with the United States.
Though the deficit with China shrank to $3.4 billion in February from $3.7 billion, it is running 37 percent higher so far this year.
The deficit with Japan, largely unchanged in February at $4.3 billion, is still 11 percent above the level a year earlier, and President Clinton, according to Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, intends to raise the subject in a meeting here next week with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
But for the time being, at least, the trade picture is not entirely negative. Foreign demand is strong enough to keep factories and providers of services busy, while the dollar's rise has helped hold down the cost of imports, limiting any inflation.
Most analysts now believe that the first-quarter gross domestic product will show an increase of 4 percent or more, at an annual rate, when the results are published on April 30. Without the effect of the trade deficit, however, growth would be 5.5 percent or even 6 percent, they say, provoking interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Americans exported $73.5 billion worth of goods and services in February, 4 percent more than in January, while importing $83.9 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent more.
Aircraft sales were a major contributor, but the increase was widespread, including telecommunications equipment, machinery and computer chips.
Americans imported $11.8 billion of vehicles and parts, 5.2 percent more than in January, while the bill for imported oil declined a bit, with the help of a $1.78 drop in the average price per barrel of crude oil, from the loftiest levels since the Persian Gulf war.
The surplus in advanced technology products jumped to $2.7 billion in February, lifting the two months of 1997 surveyed so far 84 percent above last year's period.

HEADLINE: Chaim Herzog, Former Israeli President, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Chaim Herzog, Israel's outspoken President from 1983 to 1993, died yesterday at Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv. He was 78 and lived in Herzliya Pituach, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
The cause was heart failure after he contracted pneumonia on a recent visit to the United States, said Rachel Sofer, spokeswoman for the hospital. 
 Mr. Herzog, a former general, was Israel's chief delegate to the United Nations from 1975 to 1978, a critical period, after serving as Director of Military Intelligence and, in 1967, as the first military governor of the occupied West Bank.
Over the years he was also a businessman, a lawyer, an author and a Labor Party member of the Israeli Parliament.
In his two five-year terms as Israel's sixth chief of state, he strove to enlarge the President's role, which in Israel is largely ceremonial, by making public declarations on issues that leaders in Government would not, or could not, address.
Mr. Herzog argued in favor of greater rights for the Druse and Arab populations in Israel, declaring, "I am the President of Arabs and Druse, as well as Jews." He worked actively to make political pariahs of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his fervently anti-Arab Kach Party.
Mr. Herzog was also an outspoken though unsuccessful lobbyist for comprehensive change in the Israeli voting system, which has spawned a jigsaw puzzle of political parties and frequent parliamentary stalemates.

Keeping a Balance Through Arbitration
By late 1987, as his first term was drawing to a close and while a national unity Government was in power, he had probably become more influential and popular than any previous Israeli President.
This was largely because the Labor and Likud party partners in that Government were always bickering and frequently turned to him to arbitrate their disagreements. Moreover, groups of Israelis, like farmers and nurses, were always looking to him for aid that they could not get from the deadlocked Cabinet.
Through the years, Mr. Herzog also made use of the Israeli President's power to pardon convicted criminals -- and sometimes was criticized for doing so. In addition he exercised the President's power to determine, after elections, which political party got the first opportunity to assemble a Government.
His urbane, outgoing nature and his earlier roles in his country's life fitted him to serve as a symbol of Israeli unity during his years as President.
A descendant of rabbis, and a witness to Nazi concentration-camp horrors while he was an officer in the British Army in World War II, he was steeped in the splendors and sorrows of Jewish history. He was also cosmopolitan, with the trace of a brogue from his native Belfast, Northern Ireland, and an education gained largely in Britain.
As the chief delegate to the United Nations, Mr. Herzog led Israel's defense against Arab attempts to oust it. In 1975, when the General Assembly passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism, he went to the rostrum and defiantly tore a copy of the resolution in two. Seventeen years later, the Assembly repealed the resolution.
Mr. Herzog was in the Israeli Defense Force at his country's birth in 1948, rose to the rank of major general and served twice as Director of Military Intelligence, from 1948 to 1950 and from 1959 to 1962.
Then he retired, only to return as the West Bank's military governor just after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in which Israel, in an overwhelming victory, captured the West Bank and other territory from neighboring Arab countries.
He also became noted among Israelis for radio commentaries on military subjects before and during that six-day war. He used the radio to urge Israelis to stay in their air-raid shelters during alerts, and in one widely quoted broadcast he told his listeners that they were in much less danger where they were than was the attacking Egyptian Air Force.
Mr. Herzog was first elected President by the Israeli Parliament in 1983, in a rebuff to Prime Minister Menachem Begin's governing coalition of that day. By a vote of 61 to 57, with two blank ballots, Parliament chose him over the Government's candidate, Justice Menachem Elon of the Supreme Court, to succeed President Yitzhak Navon of the Labor Party.
In 1988 Mr. Herzog was elected by Parliament to a second term, the maximum permitted by Israeli law. In that balloting he was unopposed, having the sponsorship of the Labor Party as well as wide backing from the right-wing Likud bloc, Labor's partner in the coalition Government.
He was succeeded on May 13, 1993, by Ezer Weizman, a former Defense Minister and the nephew of Israel's first President, Chaim Weizmann. Ezer Weizman was elected by Parliament on March 24, 1993.
As President, Mr. Herzog was sometimes acid in his criticisms of the Israeli national voting system. In an interview in 1992, he said: "The system we have is a catastrophe. It allows for fragmentation and wheeling and dealing and gives inordinate power to small groupings."
He was also something of a gadfly on other issues. He was one of the few prominent figures in Israeli politics to comment regularly on Israel's high incidence of fatal automobile and truck accidents. By late 1992, drivers had killed 20 times more Israelis in the previous five years than had the Palestinian uprising, almost 2,300 people.
"If the enemy had slain us to this extent, the country would quake and we would be shaking in our foundations," Mr. Herzog declared then in a message for the Jewish New Year.
Earlier that year, at a time when Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied territories had taken various measures in retaliation for Arab acts of violence, he denounced vigilantism, saying in a radio broadcast, "The phenomenon of taking the law into one's hands, of attacking innocents and interfering with the dedicated work of the security forces, endangers our foundations and future."

A Vigorous Wielder Of the Power of Office
Later in the year, with Israel not able to integrate all the new arrivals from the former Soviet republics fully into its economic life, Mr. Herzog proposed setting up soup kitchens for immigrants, and was criticized for doing so.
He also caused controversy sometimes by his use of the presidential power to pardon. In the mid-1980's, he was criticized for pardoning agents of the Shin Bet security service and its chief, who was charged with commanding that two Palestinian bus hijackers be summarily executed.
In an interview in early 1993, Mr. Herzog noted that he had condemned "what had happened." But he added that Israel was locked in combat with terrorists, and that to take the security personnel "and put them on trial, and have each one bringing all sorts of evidence to prove that he wasn't the worst and so on, could have torn the Shin Bet to pieces just when we didn't need that."
In addition, loud dissent arose after Mr. Herzog commuted the sentences of members of what was called a Jewish underground organization that had tried to kill local Palestinian functionaries.
He later contended that reducing the penalties against some of the convicted members, and making them decry their deeds, had helped to shatter their group.
As President, he traveled widely. He was among the world figures who, along with survivors of the Holocaust, gathered in Washington in April 1993 to dedicate the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. There he described his horror when he came upon Bergen-Belsen and other Nazi death camps as a British officer.

Prayer of Reconciliation With the King of Spain
"No one who saw those terrifying scenes," he said, "will ever forget."
In 1992, to mark the 500th anniversary of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Mr. Herzog went to Madrid and prayed with Spain's King, Juan Carlos, in a gesture symbolizing reconciliation between their peoples.
But Mr. Herzog did not become reconciled with the nations that had presented the 1975 United Nations resolution. In the 1993 interview, while still President, he said:
"Of the three countries that presented the Zionism-as-racism resolution, one has relations with us although no embassy -- that's Benin. Two still don't have relations -- one which has relations with nobody, namely Somalia, and one which is in great trouble, namely Cuba. They were the three sponsors of that resolution, these bastions of democracy and freedom."
Mr. Herzog was born on Sept. 17, 1918, in Belfast, the son of Rabbi Isaac Halevy Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi of Ireland and later became the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, and the former Sarah Hillman.
The Herzog family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, and the future President had three years of schooling at the Hebron Yeshiva. The educational institutions where he later studied included Wesley College in Dublin, the Government of Palestine Law School in Jerusalem, and London and Cambridge universities.
In the British Army during World War II, he served with the Guards Armored Division and in intelligence on the Continent. He was discharged and then joined the Jewish underground in Palestine before Israel was founded.
Later he served as military attache at the Israeli Embassy in Washington from 1950 to 1954, as commander of the Jerusalem Brigade from 1954 to 1957 and as a staff officer from 1957 to 1959.
After his retirement from the military in 1962, he was for some years a senior executive of a conglomerate of industrial enterprises that Sir Isaac Wolfson, a British businessman, owned in Israel. In 1972, Mr. Herzog founded the Tel Aviv law firm of Herzog, Fox & Neeman.
Over the years he wrote or helped to write or edited more than half a dozen books, including "The Arab-Israeli Wars" (Random House and Vintage, 1982), "Heroes of Israel" (Little, Brown, 1989) and "Living History: A Memoir" (Pantheon, 1996).
He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Aura Ambache; three sons, Joel, Michael and Yitzhak, and a daughter, Ronit Bronsky. All his children live in Israel except for Joel, who lives in Geneva. Chaim Herzog is also survived by eight grandchildren.
In his memoirs, he wrote: "I pray that my children and grandchildren will see a strong and vigorous Israel at peace with its neighbors and continuing to represent the traditions that have sustained our people throughout the ages."

As if the Mets Really Needed More Pressure, Here Come the Woeful Cubs

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
Remember when Cubs losses were good news in Flushing? In the summer of '69, when the big scoreboard in right-center field at Shea Stadium was the main source of information at the other end of an unexpected pennant race, the latest update on the misfortune of the sliding Chicago Cubs caused eruptions in Queens.
On Wednesday afternoon, as a small, quiet crowd watched the Mets manage one hit in a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the scoreboard watching had turned ghoulish. The Cubs were beaten by the Colorado Rockies to set a National League record with 12 losses in their first 12 games, and suddenly the Mets were faced with another indignity in a season that has already held too many. 
 The 0-12 Cubs and 4-10 Mets will begin a four-game series tonight, with the distinct possibility that the Mets will become the first team to lose to Chicago this season. Teams from two of the largest markets in the nation will defy baseball's economic law that large population bases create enormous resources, which result in unfair competitive advantages.
Not here, not tonight. The Mets and Cubs, who have maintained links through some of their finest and most embarrassing moments, have demonstrated that the haves can very quickly become have-nots.
"Best 0-11 team I've ever been on, no question about it," Mark Grace said this week. He has been on the disabled list since April 4 with a strained hamstring. "Unfortunately, nothing is going our way right now; things are going lousy.
"Once we get the first win of the season, hopefully tomorrow, we'll look back on this thing and laugh."
That tomorrow brought another defeat at Wrigley Field, and the latest version of a joke on Addison Street.
"Knock, knock."
"Who's there?"
"Owen."
"Owen who?"
"Owen Twelve."
So far in this Cub season, the joke has been updated nearly every day. The problem for the Mets, a team with consistent offensive achievers that is batting .211 after 14 games, is that the laughing could now be at their expense. The appearance of the Cubs, and the inevitable distraction that will result, is the last thing the Mets need.
"It's another different thing," said Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager. "I don't know if it should affect them so much. Most of the time, I see guys get caught up in themselves. They don't get caught up in what other teams are doing. Hopefully an off day will help them collect themselves."
Each organization is contending with expectations built upon success in the 1980's and the size of their markets.
"We know that it is a perception that we battle that we are not interested in winning," said Ed Lynch, the Chicago general manager and a former Mets and Cubs pitcher. "The people who have known me in my 20 years in baseball know that I'm a pretty tough competitor. I'm in this game to win."
When Lynch arrived in the major leagues, in 1980, the Mets had been sold to the group led by Nelson Doubleday; the Cubs were sold to the Tribune Company the next year. "It was a little different then because I was young and I felt like I was happy to be there," he recalled. "Being in a major league uniform was a thrill. But this is more frustrating because I'm up here watching rather than being down in the field, where I feel I have some control."
Lynch's first major league victory ended a 13-game Met losing streak, which ties for fourth-longest in the history of the organization. There was an announced crowd of 7,259 at Shea Stadium that Saturday. The Mets began the day with 25 losses in 28 games, and were still ahead of the Cubs in the standing. Lynch held the Cubs to two runs and six hits in six innings.
And he took advantage of a first-inning Met lead that was built on some foreshadowing -- Mookie Wilson, who scored the first run that day, reached base on a play that was ruled a single after Bill Buckner, the Cub first baseman, could not handle a grounder.
Six years later, Wilson and Buckner would come together again, this time forever. But Lynch, who began the season on the Met staff, was traded away on June 30 -- to the Cubs. When the Mets clinched the National League East at home, against the Cubs, Lynch was on the wrong side.
Now he is in charge of finding solutions. The Cubs' streak has resulted partly from the misfortune of facing Cy Young Award winners four times (Greg Maddux twice, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz) plus Kevin Brown of Florida. Grace, who was injured April 3 while tripling, is due to come off the disabled list on Saturday. Ryne Sandberg required 14 stitches after he was hit in the right ear by a foul ball as he sat in the Cub dugout last Sunday.
But the problems go deeper than bad luck. A Cub record and league-leading fielding percentage of .983 last year is a distant memory. Chicago has made 21 errors in 12 games, including 3 in the record-setting loss to the Rockies on Wednesday.
"I try to stay away from the words 'disappointed' and 'frustrated,' because it comes across that I'm disappointed or frustrated in the ball club,"said Jim Riggleman, the Cub manager. "I'm not, because I know they are giving me everything they had."
 
INSIDE PITCH
PETE HARNISCH may work out at Shea Stadium today or tomorrow, according to a friend of the Mets pitcher. If he does, it would be his first contact with teammates since April 6, when he left the team to undergo physical and psychological examinations for heightened anxiety and was put on the disabled list. Harnisch, who went through a series of tests last Monday that produced no definitive answers, has lost at least 17 pounds since his symptoms began more than three weeks ago. But the right-hander has told friends he is feeling much better and is getting more sleep.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Set For Reshaping, Pleasing Helms

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Clinton today approved a plan to reorganize the State Department, senior Administration officials said, a decision that responds to a longstanding demand by Senator Jesse Helms that has snarled foreign policy decisions.
The plan, which was disclosed only hours after Mr. Helms finally agreed to allow a Senate vote on a long-delayed chemical weapons ban, would consolidate the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency into the State Department over the next two years, the officials said. 
 The United States Agency for International Development, which distributes foreign aid, would remain a distinct agency, but its director would come under the direct authority of the Secretary of State and some functions would be consolidated.
Senator Helms and other conservatives have long demanded that these agencies be brought under the direct control of the State Department, complaining that they are bloated and unaccountable and that their roles sometimes overlap with State Department functions.
Vice President Al Gore, who has overseen the Administration's efforts to reorganize the Government but who opposed a similar proposal two years ago, presented the plan to Mr. Clinton today and the President approved it, the officials said. The White House did not announce it publicly.
The President's approval of the plan, which officials discussed on condition of anonymity, came on the day the Senate agreed to schedule a vote next Thursday on a treaty to ban the manufacture, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Senator Helms, Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, had resisted allowing the treaty to come to a vote.
Although the Administration has insisted that the reorganization plan was not linked to other proposals before Congress, the idea has become entangled in the Administration's fight to win ratification of the treaty. In January Senator Helms insisted that a reorganization of the State Department be taken up before the Senate considered the treaty.
And the Senate's majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, specifically linked progress on reorganization to the Senate's consideration of the treaty.
"Obviously we hope it will improve the climate," said a senior Administration official, who noted that beyond the treaty, the plan could help a reluctant Congress approve the President's proposed increase in spending on foreign affairs.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who came to strongly support the plan, moved quickly to begin to sell it, calling and meeting with members of Congress, including Senator Helms. Upon becoming chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago, the senator proposed consolidating all three agencies with the State Department.
A spokesman for the Senator, Marc A. Thiessen, responded favorably to the outlines of the Administration's proposal, saying that on its face it appeared to be "a big victory."
"The devil's always in the details," he said. "But a lot of this sounds suspiciously like the Senator's bill. Our entire goal was to create a coherent chain of command in foreign policy."
But Mr. Thiessen said the reorganization would not affect Senator Helms's opposition to the chemical weapons treaty when it comes to a vote unless the full Senate agrees to set conditions the White House characterized again today as "killer amendments."
"There's no quid pro quo here," he said.
The reorganization plan has been in the works for a couple of months now. In her confirmation hearing before Mr. Helms's committee in January, Ms. Albright said she had an open mind about shaking up the foreign affairs bureaucracy.
A State Department official said she had come to the conclusion that the department's relationship with the smaller independent agencies was antiquated, reflecting the priorities of the cold war.
The United States Information Agency, set up by President Eisenhower in 1953, has served as America's voice abroad, overseeing cultural and information exchange programs and operating the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and the newer Radio Free Asia.
The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established in 1961 under President Kennedy to make the case for controlling the spread of nuclear and conventional weapons, independent of the diplomats at the State Department and the commanders at the Pentagon.
In each case, the agencies would now merge with bureaus in the State Department, answering to Under Secretaries of State with broader portfolios.
The United States Agency for International Development, however, would remain a distinct entity, although it would fall more clearly under the Secretary of State.
The reorganization plan, many details of which must still be worked out, would require legislation in Congress. It would generate only modest savings in the $19 billion budget for foreign affairs, which represents 1 percent of the total Federal budget.
"The functions of these three agencies -- sustainable development, nonproliferation and public diplomacy -- are now more central than they ever were before to American foreign policy," an aide to Mr. Gore said. "This reorganization is an effort to make the institutional arrangements reflect that."

HEADLINE: A Mirror on Politics in an Ex-Mayor of Chicago

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 17

 BODY:
Eugene Sawyer once sat on the vaunted fifth floor at City Hall. He could lift a phone and pull the strings, or have someone else do it for him. Doors opened for him. Big shots listened. He was, after all, the Mayor.
Now he sits in a South Side office in a modest building next to a railroad viaduct. He works for a small oil and gas company. His title is vice president. When the telephone rings, he answers it. 
 When a caller inquired about a political favor, Mr. Sawyer, the last black mayor of Chicago, explained that there was not much he could do.
"There's got to be, you see, a quid pro quo," said Mr. Sawyer, 62, who acknowledges being politically empty-handed these days, after losing the mayor's office in 1989. "That's how the system works."
Chicago, once regarded as a beacon of black electoral promise, with the stunning triumph in 1983 of Harold Washington, ultimately became a harbinger of faded fortunes among black politicians in several of the United States' biggest cities. After Mr. Sawyer lost to Richard M. Daley in 1989, whites replaced blacks as mayor in New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.
For Mr. Sawyer, life at the top was brief, and sometimes brutally painful. A week after the death of Mayor Washington in 1987, Mr. Sawyer, a longtime South Side Alderman, was chosen to take the post by the City Council, in an all-night session so charged with hostility that one Councilman put on a bulletproof vest.
Mr. Washington, the city's first black mayor, had been a folk hero to many Chicagoans. But he had been opposed bitterly by a majority of whites on the Council. That bloc of whites, along with a handful of blacks, provided the votes for Mr. Sawyer's installation.
For accepting the white support, Mr. Sawyer was vilified by many politicians. Demonstrators at City Hall hoisted signs labeling Mr. Sawyer an "Uncle Tom." A black newspaper columnist told a rally of blacks opposed to Mr. Sawyer: "Treat those black enemies like you treat the Ku Klux Klan."
Mr. Sawyer, who grew up in Alabama, had known the humiliation of Jim Crow laws. He said that if he had rejected the post of mayor, the Council would have chosen a conservative white to replace Mr. Washington.
More than the political problems, Mr. Sawyer says now, he was devastated by the personal attacks.
"There were times," Mr. Sawyer said, "that I went home at night and cried."
By the Democratic primary in 1989, Mr. Sawyer's white allies on the Council abandoned him to support Richard M. Daley, the son of Richard J. Daley, the legendary Mayor and boss of the Democratic machine.
The younger Mr. Daley today has a strong hold on the Mayor's job. He has increased his margin of black electoral support from the single digits in 1989, to more than 20 percent in his latest campaign, in 1995.
Mr. Daley will presumably be favored for re-election in 1999. There will almost certainly be no serious white candidate to oppose him. It was a split between two white candidates in 1983 -- the younger Mr. Daley and Mayor Jane M. Byrne -- that helped Mr. Washington win election. Ever since, white politicians in Chicago have vowed that such a situation would never happen again.
One black politician who might challenge Mr. Daley is Representative Bobby Rush, a former Alderman, who is black. He would clearly be an underdog. Mr. Daley already has the strong support of important black political leaders, including John Stroger, chairman of the Cook County Board, and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.
The struggles of black mayoral candidates in some of the biggest cities, experts on urban politics say, stem from the declining importance of big cities on the political landscape.
"Urban America has simply been bypassed by the suburban age -- Chicago has become a junior partner," said Paul Green, a scholar and writer on Chicago politics, noting that the suburbs here now cast twice as many votes as the city.
Mr. Green noted that one of the brightest stars among young black politicians in Chicago, Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., represents a district that is increasingly suburban as many black middle-class families move from the South Side to southern suburbs.
Ronald Walters, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, said black leaders faced unrealistically high expectations, especially from black voters. Moreover, Mr. Walters said, they were saddled with urban economies that were hemorrhaging jobs and people to the suburbs.
"The general view was that the first generation of black leaders did not deliver," he said. "And you've got general aggrievement among whites, who feel they have not benefited from government. That's why we've seen a turnover in these cities."
In addition, Mr. Walters noted that a prevailing conservative mood on race, as well as tensions between blacks and Jews over Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, have strained some old liberal coalitions.
Despite the problems in the country's biggest cities -- Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia -- black political leaders have been faring better in smaller ones, like Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, Seattle, and even Rockford, Ill.
In Chicago, the black political community has not completely healed from the divisions in 1987, when a majority of blacks on the City Council backed Timothy Evans, who is now a judge here.
For all his political troubles, Mr. Sawyer received generally favorable reviews for running City Hall. It was on his watch that the Council passed a gay rights bill, a measure that had been supported by Mr. Washington.
But Mr. Sawyer could never escape the condemnation. In a 1988 appearance with Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential candidate, at the Regal Theater, Mayor Sawyer was humiliated by being lustily booed by his constituents.
Mr. Sawyer has always maintained that too much has been made of the color of a politician.
"It should not matter if the mayor is black or white," he said, "as long as there is access to government for everybody."
He said he suffered because of his reserved, almost deferential nature, especially when compared with the charismatic Mr. Washington, a one-time boxer.
"The black community wanted a leader who came out with his fists up," Mr. Sawyer said, with an apologetic smile. "That wasn't me."
Anna Langford, one of the blacks on the Council who voted for Mr. Sawyer, described the attacks on his character as "diabolical."
"It was one of the meanest things I've ever seen in politics," said Mrs. Langford, now 79.
For his part, Mr. Sawyer said he had moved on from those "unfortunate events."
Mr. Rush, the possible mayoral challenger in 1999, was an Alderman in 1987 and a leader of the anti-Sawyer forces. At the time, he accused supporters of Mr. Sawyer of "spitting on the grave" of the late Mayor Washington.
Mr. Rush now has some regrets.
"If I could re-live those years," he said, "I would do some things differently. We should have surrounded Gene, supported him. We could have pushed through our agenda with him in office."
Mr. Rush said the election of Mr. Washington, just four years earlier, had brought about a sense of euphoria that led to overconfidence.
"There was a certain feeling of invincibility that permeated black leadership at the time," he said. "We thought we couldn't lose. We know better now."

Clinton Approves a Plan To Reorganize State Dept.
President Clinton has approved a plan that will place three foreign affairs agencies under the jurisdiction of the State Department, a reorganization that had long been sought by Senator Jesse Helms. The Senate agreed to schedule a vote next Thursday on an international treaty banning chemical weapons, which Mr. Helms had long resisted. A1
 
Major Reverses Europe Stance
Prime Minister John Major, trailing in the polls for the coming British elections, reversed his previous stance and publicly declared his opposition to current proposals for Britain's integration into Europe. Mr. Major said he would permit a parliamentary free vote, in which members need not abide by party policy, on the issue of Britain's joining a single European currency. A1
 
Netanyahu Defiant on Charges
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel went on the counteroffensive against police recommendations that he be indicted for breach of the public trust. The gravity of the charges was widely questioned; senior police officers said their verdict was based largely on the testimony of one witness. A1
 
Yeltsin Says NATO Pact Is Near
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany and indicated that a security agreement between Russia and an expanded NATO would be negotiated by May 27. Mr. Kohl pledged to insure that Western leaders consider Russia's concerns about military deployments in Eastern Europe. A3
 
Korean Ex-Leaders Lose Appeal
Korea's Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings sentencing the country's former President, Chun Doo Hwan, to life in prison and his successor, Roh Tae Woo, to 17 years. No further judicial appeals are possible for the two former generals, although President Kim Young Sam could pardon them. A4
 
Canada to Ease Fishing Ban
The Canadian Government declared that it would partially lift a ban on cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland. The ban was imposed five years ago because of the scarcity of the fish. Environmentalists, scientists and some fishermen said it was too early to lift the ban. A7
 
Alleged Arms Dealer Arrested
An Israeli magistrate ordered a businessman held in jail, reportedly on charges of exporting chemical weapons to Iran. One Israeli newspaper said the C.I.A. was helping the Israeli authorities with the investigation. A8
 
Land Mine Parts Made in U.S.A.
A prominent human rights group identified dozens of American companies that have produced components used in land mines and said that 17 of the companies had promised that they would not allow their products to be used in future production. Production of land mines in the United States ended last year. A10

Dole Lends Gingrich $300,000 to Pay Fine
Newt Gingrich said Bob Dole would lend him the $300,000 he needs to pay an ethics fine imposed on him by the House. Mr. Dole will charge 10 percent annual interest but will not demand any payments until 2005, two years after Mr. Gingrich plans to leave Congress. Democrats, caught by surprise, grumbled. A1
 
More Top Earners Pay No Tax
Nearly 2,400 of the richest Americans -- those who earn at least $200,000 a year -- paid no Federal income taxes in 1993, up from just 85 in 1977, I.R.S. data showed. How they arranged that was not clear; economists said they believed falling audit rates played a role. A21
 
F.B.I. Faulted in Ames Case
An internal Justice Department inquiry found the F.B.I. derelict in its initial failure to aggressively pursue what became the Aldrich Ames case, officials said. The inquiry found the F.B.I. did not react quickly when two Soviet officials it had recruited as spies were recalled to Moscow and executed, the officials said. Mr. Ames, a C.I.A. official, was not arrested until eight years later. F.B.I. officials said the C.I.A. had not been very cooperative at the time. A16
 
No Arms Warning, Powell Says
Gen. Colin L. Powell entered the debate over whether the C.I.A. adequately warned the military about chemical weapons in areas where American troops blew up Iraqi ammunition depots shortly after the 1991 war. No such warnings reached him or other senior commanders, he said. A19
 
Cosmic Uniformity Questioned
New measurements suggest the universe may have an "up" and a "down," scientists said. If so, current theory, which pictures the universe as uniform in all directions, would have to be rethought. Which way is up would be an arbitrary choice. A1
 
Reno Brushes Off Attacks
Attorney General Janet Reno said she was committed to doing "justice" in the campaign finance investigation. She said she was unfazed by Republican attacks on her decision not to appoint an independent prosecutor in the case. A23
 
Hawaii to Vote on Gay Marriage
A referendum that would let Hawaii voters ban same-sex marriages in their state passed a major test in the Legislature. The measure would ask voters to amend the State Constitution to overturn a State Supreme Court ruling that such a ban was unconstitutional. A15
 
Remembering the Bush Era
Former President George Bush will be reunited with many of his top aides today for a conference at Hofstra University on Long Island that is billed as the first collective look at his Administration's legacy.

Ms. McCaughey Ross, who has been allying herself more and more openly with Democrats, said she would run for something else. A1
 
. . . and Won't Face Schumer
Representative Charles E. Schumer abandoned his plans to run against Governor Pataki next year in favor of a challenge to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Most New York politicians agree that Mr. D'Amato will be the easier target. B2

HEADLINE: Speak Up for Hong Kong

 BODY:
President Clinton should use his meeting today with Hong Kong's leading democrat, Martin Lee, to open an unabashed American campaign to defend Hong Kong's endangered liberties. Until now the Administration has seemed reluctant to give high-level attention to the Hong Kong issue, presumably to avoid controversy with Beijing. Vice President Gore unwisely omitted Hong Kong from his itinerary when he visited China last month. Mr. Lee's meeting with the President was scheduled only this week, after considerable last-minute pressure on his behalf from Congress.
The Administration's low-key approach has been a mistake. The fate of this prosperous and freewheeling society of six million people as it comes under the authority of one of the world's last hard-line Communist dictatorships is a compelling human drama. Mr. Clinton's ability to influence it constructively will be a measure of his international leadership. 
 When Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping worked out the terms of Hong Kong's transfer in a treaty signed 13 years ago, there were good reasons to be optimistic. China appeared to be opening to a period of political and economic reform. It seemed reasonable that China's own interest in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity would lead it to abide by its word to respect the freedoms on which that prosperity is based.
But the crushing of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989 changed all that. Political reform in China halted abruptly. Hong Kong's huge outpourings of support for the Tiananmen demonstrators led Beijing to see the colony as a potential seedbed of democratic subversion. China's eagerness to enforce political control seemed to gain priority over its desire to assure Hong Kong's continued economic dynamism.
China still desperately wants the transition to go smoothly and uneventfully, with no rude jolts to business confidence or Chinese relations with other countries. But Chinese behavior so far has provoked fears that it will violate its treaty commitments to grant Hong Kong substantial autonomy and not interfere with its freer way of life.
Over the last year or so, China has moved clumsily and menacingly against Hong Kong's future freedoms. It designated a hand-picked assembly of Beijing loyalists to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature. Its appointee as chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, has said he will discard the colony's bill of rights and reinstitute tight restrictions on speech, demonstrations and political party activity. Chinese statements have also created doubts about the continued independence of the civil service. Weakening that independence would compromise Hong Kong's defenses against corrupt dealings by politically well-connected mainlanders.
Not all the recent signs have been bad. China has agreed to keep the top echelon of civil servants in their present jobs. Some of those elected legislators who have not identified themselves with Mr. Lee's Democratic Party have been appointed to the new assembly.
It is not clear what America can or will do if China proves determined to crush Hong Kong's freedoms. But one thing it should be doing in the crucial weeks and months ahead is speaking out plainly in defense of Hong Kong's treaty-protected rights and standing behind the efforts of people like Mr. Lee who try to exercise them.
Beijing's leaders are particularly sensitive to high-level expressions of American concern over Hong Kong. That is why the President's words today, and the language used by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she attends the handover ceremonies this summer, are especially important.
Both must make clear that they see the question of Hong Kong's future freedoms not as an internal Chinese affair, but as a test of China's intentions to honor its treaty commitments under international law.

U.S. Trade Gap Narrows; Mistake Found in Report
The United States trade deficit narrowed 18 percent in February as exports and imports rose to new peaks, the Commerce Department said. The gap declined to $10.4 billion, from $12.7 billion in January. 
 But in an odd twist, the $10.4 billion figure was provided only after the department said late in the day that it had made a mistake in initially reporting the deficit in the morning. It was first reported at $11.6 billion, but that was discovered to have been overstated because of a miscalculation on oil imports. [Page D2.]
 
The prices of Treasury securities rose as several weak economic reports reduced the threat of an aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. [D16.]
 
Stock prices were mixed, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 21.27 points, after three days of strong gains. But the Nasdaq index was up 6.80 points, at 1,217.07. [D6.]
 
Archer Daniels Chief Retires
Dwayne O. Andreas, left, retired as chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland after more than a quarter of a century at the helm and was replaced by his nephew, G. Allen Andreas Jr. The elder Mr. Andreas will remain chairman. His hopes that his son Michael would succeed him were shattered in a price-fixing scandal that has cost the company nearly $200 million in fines and settlements. [D2.]
 
Bell Atlantic Exceeds Forecasts
Bell Atlantic, citing strong demand for second phone lines, reported earnings that exceeded forecasts and showed that the local phone business remains healthy. Net income, however, fell 15 percent after a big one-time gain a year earlier. [D3.]

Ford Motor and Mazda of Japan, which Ford effectively controls, have agreed on a plan for cooperation in developing some basic designs, engines and transmissions. [D2.]
 
Digital Limits Its Profit Slide
Digital Equipment reported a 59 percent decline in profit for its third quarter as sales of its flagship computers declined. But the struggling company performed better than the low expectations of analysts, causing a rally in its battered stock. [D6.]
 
AT&T Seen Losing a Partner
Telefonica de Espana, Spain's telecommunications carrier and the largest communications provider in Latin America, plans to leave AT&T's global alliance, people close to the situation say. Telefonica is expected to join the pending combination of MCI and British Telecommunications. [D16.]
 
Sears Earnings Rise 21%
Sears, Roebuck reported a 21 percent earnings gain, beating expectations, as clothing sales rose. Still, its stock slipped. [D3.]

Continuing the drug industry's robust results, Schering-Plough reported a 14.9 percent increase in its profit. [D16.]
 
Sony Picks Former CBS Executive
Sony named Howard Stringer, a former executive at CBS, president of the company's American subsidiary, though it did not give him the broad powers of a predecessor, Michael P. Schulhof. [D6.]
 
More of the Wealthy Avoid a Tax
Nearly 2,400 American individuals and couples who make more than $200,000 paid no Federal income taxes in 1993, up from just 85 in 1977, according to I.R.S. information. The number of people earning that much grew, too, but at only about half the rate. [A21.]

HEADLINE: Michigan Professor Expected to Be Named to Fed

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Clinton has all but settled on Edward M. Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan, to fill one of two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board, an Administration official said tonight.
No official announcement is expected immediately, but the official said that the selection of Mr. Gramlich was likely. Mr. Gramlich is dean of the School of Public Policy at the university and was chairman of the Advisory Council on Social Security, which did an exhaustive study of the Government-sponsored retirement system from 1994 to 1996. 
 Reached at his home in Ann Arbor tonight, Mr. Gramlich declined to comment.
President Clinton is also reported to be close to a selection for the other vacancy on the seven-member board, but the name of the second candidate could not be learned tonight.
Board nominees undergo screening by the Senate Banking Committee, now headed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and must then be confirmed by the full Senate. Terms for regular members are for 14 years, although members seldom stay that long. The chairman's term is four years.
The Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Gramlich's nomination was "95 percent certain."
The two vacancies were created when Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed board member for five years, announced in January that he was leaving to join the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization, and when Janet L. Yellen quit the next month to head the President's Council on Economic Advisers.
With the vacancies he is about to fill, Mr. Clinton has the chance to fill five of the seven seats on the board. Last year, he renominated Alan Greenspan for a third term as chairman. He also selected his budget director at the time, Alice Rivlin, to be vice chairman, and he named a St. Louis economist, Laurence H. Meyer, to a seat.
The board serves as primary regulator of the nation's largest bank-holding companies. It also has profound influence on the country's stocks and bonds markets, mortgage rates and other financial indices that affect Wall Street tycoons, entrepreneurs and Main Street Americans.
The President has said he would like to see more debate on the board as to how much the economy can grow and still withstand inflation. But in practice, senators like to hear nominees say they will fight to hold off inflation.

HEADLINE: NYC;
When the City Was a Friend To Diplomats

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
THE defiance of posted parking regulations was blatant yesterday on East Side streets around the Russian Mission to the United Nations.
Down the block, on Lexington Avenue, 21 cars sat at expired parking meters between East 65th and 68th Streets. Along 66th Street from Second Avenue to Lexington, 31 cars were parked beneath signs that said, "No Standing." 
 A few other things were evident:
(1) Nearly every one of those vehicles belonged to a police officer. All but five had placards on the dashboard identifying them as owned by officers assigned to the 19th Precinct, which happens to sit across 67th Street from the Russian Mission. Signs on the other five indicated that they belonged to firefighters who work on the same block.
(2) Not one was given a ticket.
(3) Cars bearing diplomats' plates were parked legally in designated zones.
It is no secret that police officers treat the streets near station houses as their personal parking lots. Many New Yorkers do not like this situation. But they put up with it, chalking it up to good will, an expression of appreciation for the job that the police do.
Now, let's turn to the parking war that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has waged on the city's large, and economically vital, diplomatic community.
IN 1995, when there was no mayoral election and United Nations-bashing was not in populist vogue at City Hall, the Giuliani administration put out a brochure lauding the world organization to the heavens. It listed courtesies that the city extends to diplomats, including the following: "Diplomats are not required to pay for parking tickets."
Some diplomats actually read that, and took the city at its word. Can you imagine?
That statement, by the way, was carried under the heading, "In Appreciation of the United Nations." In appreciation. As with police officers parked in "No Standing" zones. But that was then, before Mr. Giuliani declared that Russians on 67th Street -- unlike their police neighbors -- were not above the law.
Consider this:
In 1996, diplomats racked up 134,281 parking tickets, a number often cited in City Hall's "off with their plates" rage. In 1994, the figure was 68,637. Almost exactly half.
What are we to conclude? That diplomats ran amok, suddenly becoming twice as lawless? Or maybe that someone decided it was time to sock it to them?
The Police Department said it could not answer the questions because it was not in charge of ticketing in 1994. City Hall did not respond to several requests for an explanation. But one knowledgeable city official, asked if diplomats' cars had been made targets, replied, "That's what I'd assume."
LATELY, Mr. Giuliani has gone beyond tickets to speak derisively of the United Nations in general. He wouldn't mind if it left the city, he said, calling it a snore as a tourist attraction. That real estate, he said, could be used profitably for apartments and hotels. (Never mind that the land would go to the Federal Government.)
The name-calling, some fear, has the earmarks of a spat veering out of control. Not that anyone seriously thinks the United Nations will move. But can any good come from all the harshness, which includes nasty comments about New York by representatives of France and Zaire?
It is time to turn down the heat and that goes for the Mayor, suggested Gillian Sorenson, an Assistant United Nations Secretary-General, who used to be the city's liaison to the diplomatic corps. "To speak in this way is not suitable, not appropriate and not dignified for the leader of a great city like this," she said. "He has an opportunity to be a statesman."
Several executives who do business with the United Nations recommended that City Hall re-examine its own brochure, which put United Nations spending in New York at $1.4 billion a year. The total given for all diplomats was $3.3 billion. The number of jobs: 30,700. Annual spending by visitors here for United Nations conferences: $27 million.
Can the city shrug off that $3.3 billion, as the Mayor implies, in the name of a relatively paltry $5.3 million that the parking tickets would bring in if all were paid? The same summonses, remember, that diplomats were told they need not pay as a token of the city's appreciation.
"It is largely because of the United Nations' presence that we refer to New York City as the 'Capital of the World,' " a grateful introduction to the 1995 brochure said.
It was signed by Rudolph W. Giuliani.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Mark Climbs On New Delays Seen for Euro

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday after the German mark rallied on reports that European Union officials had concluded that Italy would not qualify for the planned single European currency.
Comments on Thursday by the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, supporting a strong German currency and his suggestion that monetary union might be delayed by a few months also carried over into currency dealings yesterday and indirectly put pressure on the dollar, traders said. 
 In New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.7119 marks, down from 1.7248 marks on Thursday and the lowest level in two weeks. The dollar fell to 125.88 yen from 126.05 yen. The pound rose to $1.6332 from $1.6287.
The dollar began its slump in Japan, where Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential director of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, suggested in a television interview that Japan's record-low interest rates could soon rise, which would enhance the value of the yen.
But traders said the dominant theme in foreign-exchange trading was the renewed skepticism about the European Union plan for the single currency, the Euro, scheduled to make its debut in January 1999. Any significant news that casts doubt on the Euro timetable has tended to strengthen the mark.
"A delay is getting more credible," said Augie Floro, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Austria's New York branch. "Before it was hearsay, but now it's becoming a reality that there are problems."
The renewed monetary union skepticism derived mainly from an article yesterday in Il Sole, the Italian financial newspaper, that the European Commission was preparing a report indicating that Italy would fail to reduce its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, a prerequisite for participation in monetary union.
Although the Italian Government has taken steps to lower the deficit from last year's 6.8 percent level with additional budget cuts and revenue increases, the reports suggested the changes would not be sufficient.
Despite the dollar's retreat, traders said the underlying demand for the currency remained strong and it was poised to go higher.

China Growth Slows a Bit, To 9.4% Pace

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 18

 BODY:
China's economic growth rate slowed to 9.4 percent in the first quarter from 9.9 percent in the previous three months as companies reduced bloated inventories built up in 1996, the Government reported today.
Economists had expected a 10 percent increase in growth, calculated against the 1996 first quarter. Two interest rate cuts last year had been expected to reduce corporate costs and increase demand for new investment, stimulating growth. 
 By itself, the slower growth would be likely to eat into corporate profits. However, the inventory reduction could reduce the amount of money companies have tied up in warehoused goods, giving them more cash on hand and possibly higher profits.
Ye Zhen, a spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, said industrial inventories for all companies at the end of February were more than 14 percent higher than a year ago but lower than at the start of 1997.
Chen Xingdong, an economist in Beijing for Crosby Securities, said: "This is an inventory adjustment period. I expect it will continue to hold back growth until the third quarter."
The bureau said consumer prices rose 5.2 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, slower than rates of 9.6 percent in 1996's first three months and 8.3 percent for all of last year.
"The low inflation rate could be a concern if it means demand is weak," said Nicholas Kwan, Hong Kong-based senior economist with Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. He said last year's record grain harvest of at least 480 million metric tons contributed substantially to the slower inflation rate.
Industrial output in the first quarter rose 11 percent from the year before. Retail sales, the main measure of consumption, rose 12.6 percent, after adjustment for inflation.
Growth in the quarter was driven in part by a 25.7 percent increase in exports, to $35.5 billion. Imports slipped 1.8 percent, to $28.8 billion. Mr. Ye of the statistics bureau said the comparisons were somewhat skewed by last year's relatively low exports and high imports.
"I don't expect exports to keep growing at this rate for the whole year," he said.
China's trade surplus with the United States is causing growing concern in Washington.

HEADLINE: In Clinton's Words, a Stark Choice for the U.S.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's opening statement at a news conference today on the chemical arms treaty before the Senate and on the budget, and from his exchange with reporters:
 
From Opening Statement 
 Good afternoon. Less than two weeks from today, the Chemical Weapons Convention goes into effect -- with or without the United States.
The bottom line is this: Will the United States join a treaty we helped to shape, or will we go from leading the fight against poison gas to joining the company of pariah nations this treaty seeks to isolate?
With this treaty, other nations will follow the lead we set years ago by giving up chemical weapons. Our troops will be less likely to face poison gas on the battlefield. Rogue states and terrorists will have a harder time acquiring or making chemical weapons. And we'll have new tools to prevent and punish them if they try.
But if we fail to ratify, other countries could back out as well. We won't be able to enforce the treaty's rules or use its tools, and our companies will face trade sanctions aimed at countries that refuse to join. . . .
I welcome yesterday's unanimous agreement by the Senate to bring the treaty to a vote, and I thank Majority Leader Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Helms, and Senator Biden and all the members of the Senate from both parties for their efforts.
By going the extra mile, we've reached agreement on 28 conditions that will be included in the treaty's resolution of ratification -- for example, maintaining strong defenses against chemical attacks, toughening enforcement, allowing the use of riot-control agents like tear gas in a wide range of military and law enforcement situations, and requiring search warrants for any involuntary inspections of an American business.
These agreed-upon conditions resolve virtually all of the issues that have been raised about this treaty, but there are still a handful of issues on which we fundamentally disagree. They will be voted on by the full Senate as it takes up the treaty next week.
We should all understand what's at stake. A vote for any of these killer amendments will prevent our participation in the treaty. Let me quickly address four of them.
The first would prohibit the United States from joining the treaty until Russia does. That is precisely backwards. The best way to secure Russian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves. Failure to do so will only give hard-liners in Russia an excuse to hold out, and hold on to their chemical weapons.
A second killer condition would prohibit us from becoming a party until rogue states like Iraq and Libya join.
The result is we'd be weaker, not stronger, in our fight to prevent these rogue states from developing chemical weapons because we would lose the ability to use and enforce the treaty's tough trade restrictions and inspection tools. No country, especially an outlaw state, should have a veto over our national security.
A third killer condition would impose an unrealistically high standard of verification. There is no such thing as perfect verifiability in a treaty, but this treaty's tough monitoring, reporting and on-site inspection requirements will enable us to detect militarily significant cheating. Our soldiers on the battlefield will be safer. That clearly is an advance over no treaty at all.
Finally, the opponents would force us to reopen negotiations on the Chemical Weapons Convention to try to fix two concerns that have already been resolved. . . .
Now we must lead in bringing this bipartisan treaty to life and enforcing its rules. . . .
Now let me take this opportunity also to say a few words about the budget. Yesterday my economic team briefed me extensively on the full range of issues that are now being discussed as we continue serious, high-level talks on the balanced budget. The progress we've made so far is encouraging. . . .
There is no question that serious differences remain. But if each of us is willing to compromise our sense of the perfect, I know we can reach an agreement that advances the greater good and we can both do so without compromising our deeply held values. . . .
 
Questions and Answers
Q. Mr. President, what is your outlook for ratification of the treaty and how much of a quid pro quo was there with Senator Helms on reorganizing State Department?
A. . . . There was no linkage. Senator Helms came to see me personally at the White House last year sometime -- I don't remember when -- and we met up in my office in the residence for an extended period of time, with just a few of his staff members, a few of mine. He was going over his plan for reorganization of the agencies and why he thought it was right. I promised him that I would seriously consider the issue, that I thought there ought to be some reorganization. I had a slightly different take on it.
And, actually, since that time, but especially in the last few weeks, we have been working very, very hard to reach a consensus within the Administration on an alternative proposal. . . .
I can tell you that there was no linkage between these two issues. . . .
Q. Mr. President, in the summer of 1994, you met at the White House with James Riady. And then a little bit later you met at Camp David with Webb Hubbell. And about that same time, the Lippo Group started paying Mr. Hubbell $100,000. What do you recall about the conversations with those two gentlemen?
A. Well, as I -- I don't have anything to add to what I've already said about both of them. Mr. Riady was there in the White House for 5 or 10 minutes. It was basically a social call. We had a -- we exchanged a few comments and he said nothing about Mr. Hubbell that I can remember; I don't believe he did.
And when Mr. Hubbell came to Camp David, my recollection is we played golf and I took a walk with him and asked him point-blank if he had done anything wrong, and as he has said now in public, he told me that he hadn't. . . . There was no correlation between the two. . . .
Q. What is your current view of the performance of the F.B.I. and its director, Mr. Freeh?
A. Well, let me say about the crime lab, obviously I'm concerned about the lab. But I think that you have to give the Justice Department, the Attorney General and Mr. Freeh credit for doing what I think should be doing -- in any organization you're always going to have some problems.
I was impressed with the fact that they did what I want the Pentagon to do on the sexual harassment issue. I mean, the matter was looked into, the facts were laid honestly before the public, and now I think it's important that all appropriate corrective action be taken.
Q. One more on the budget. Do you share the view of many in Washington that the next week or maybe two weeks is really a make-or-break period on the budget?
A. Well, let me say, as you know, there is also a view directly contrary to that.
Q. Yeah. What's your view?
A. . . . I believe we'll get a balanced budget agreement this year because it is so important to the country and to our future. We've got this unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent. Inflation seems to be dropping again. If we passed a balanced budget, I think it would remove a lot of other lingering fears about inflation out there.
I think it would give a new jolt of confidence to the economy. I think it would keep the recovery going. And I think it would be very good for the long term, especially if it also protected the Medicare trust fund for a significant numbers of years in the future, and if it contained investment. . . .
I expect it to happen this year. I'm very optimistic, and I am hopeful that it can happen sooner rather than later, and I am committed personally to doing everything I can to put it together.

HEADLINE: Can You Say 'G'day, Mate' In Japanese?;
Down Under, Tourism As the Growth Industry

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: KINGSCOTE, Kangaroo Island, Australia

 BODY:
It's 4 P.M.: pelican-feeding time. Mitsuru and Noriko Inawashiro, Nikons at the ready, look down from rocks above the golden and indigo bay as a bearded man in waders flings fish heads and tails at the squawking, hovering birds.
The honeymooning couple from Morioka, Japan, both civil servants, have already seen the seals, sea lions, fairy penguins and koalas that also abound on this wildlife paradise south of Adelaide. 
 "We love nature," says Mrs. Inawashiro, 38. Next stop, Tasmania and lengthy bush walks. Asked why they haven't chosen Hawaii, long a favored destination for Japanese honeymooners, Mr. Inawashiro, 39, grins mischievously. "Too many Japanese," he says.
In the hotly competitive global tourist market, Australia sells itself as a "country of surprises" -- a pitch that worked for the Inawashiros and nearly a million other Japanese tourists over the last year. In traipsing about this dazzling land, they are not only taking business away from Hawaii but also rejuvenating a complex and at times caustic relationship.
Although World War II and the mistreatment of Australian prisoners of war left its legacy of bitterness, which still rankles veterans' groups a half-century later, the rise in tourism has spurred a different kind of relationship that is helping set a course of partnership.
"Japan and Australia, the north and south anchors of the western Pacific, are finding increasingly that they need each other," said Purnendra Jain, director of the Center for Asian Studies at Adelaide University.
The interdependence is most dramatic in the nuts and bolts of trade. Australia exports products like wheat, coal and other minerals that Japan needs. Japan exports the cars, laptops and other finished products that Australia needs.
But the two Governments see tourism as the cement of their new partnership. They are in continuing talks about reducing the relatively high air fares that have kept even more Japanese from visiting Down Under, as well as increasing capacity on the routes between Japan and Australia.
The first results came on April 1, when Qantas Airways Ltd. cut fares on its north-south routes an average of 6 percent, while the smaller Ansett Australia reduced its discount economy fares, which most travelers use, by up to 4 percent.
Both Japanese and Australian officials say the issue of further increasing tourism may well arise during the April 28-29 visit here of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, the first visit of a Japanese leader here in four years.
The trip, which points up the growing importance of the overall bilateral relationship, has been timed to mark the 40th anniversary of the first postwar Australian-Japanese trade treaty, which made Australia a preferred supplier in Japan's industrial expansion.
The formation of regional trade blocs like the European Union and the North American Free Trade Association has only increased the two countries' reliance on each other.
"Australians feel abandoned by Europe," Professor Jain says. "Their future lies in Asia, and Japan is now both a democracy and the powerhouse of the region."
Although the World War II years are sometimes seen as the defining ones in the relationship, this scholar points out contacts that reach well back into the 19th century, when the Japanese set up Australian trading companies in wool and rice. The two countries were on the same side during World War I.
While resentments have arisen against Asians, who have been allowed into Australia in greater numbers since a White Australia Policy ended in 1972, there seem to be no hard feelings against the prosperous and free-spending Japanese, who love to visit foreign countries but prefer to live at home.
As the Inawashiros and their compatriots are getting better known here, their spending on hotels, meals, postcards, T-shirts and bus tours has become one of Australia's biggest sources of foreign income.
Last year Japanese tourists spent $2.7 billion and numbered 813,000 -- one out of 20 Japanese who journeyed abroad last year. In 1980, just 49,000 Japanese came here, or one out of 125. By 2001, the year after the Sydney Summer Olympics, the Australian Tourist Commission projects that the number of Japanese visitors will reach 1.3 million.
"Our market research tells us the Japanese see Australia as the place they'd most like to visit," says John Morse, managing director of the commission, the Government's tourist promotion office in Canberra. "Our job is to translate intentions into more visitations."
In terms of travel time, Australia competes head on with Hawaii. A flight from Tokyo to Honolulu is about the same eight hours as to the northern Australian beach resorts.
Although higher Australian air fares make tour packages costlier than to Hawaii, Australia has managed to grab a big chunk of the lucrative honeymooner business. In 1995 the Australian Embassy in Tokyo issued its five millionth visa to Japanese honeymooners. Australia is also popular with groups of young single Japanese women.
If the Inawashiros were in Cairns, in the far north, or on the glitzy Gold Coast south of Brisbane, theirs would be a more Hawaii-like experience. Not only are there considerably more Japanese in big beach-side hotels -- many, in fact, owned by Japanese -- but many signs and menus are in Japanese.
Daikyo Inc., a leading Japanese real estate developer, has upward of $1 billion of investment in Cairns and the Gold Coast, making it one of the biggest players in the Australian tourist market. Last year it pumped an additional $330 million into Australia to improve properties like the Cairns International, Matson Plaza and Gold Coast International hotels, two island resorts, a cruise company and the Paradise Palms Golf Course.
But while Daikyo's cash flow is helped by the flood of Japanese and other tourists in Australia, falling property prices in Japan and a huge debt load have threatened to put its Japanese operations under water. Daikyo is counting on the surge of tourism here to help in any bailout.
Meanwhile, Hawaii is feeling the effect of Australia's pull on tourists. It had been projecting 4 to 6 percent growth in Japanese visits this year. But in late January, citing the soft Tokyo stock market and weakness in both the yen and Japanese consumer confidence, it officially revised the projection to zero growth.
"The situation in Japan is rapidly becoming a crisis," said Paul Casey, former president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, who left on March 31 to become Hawaiian Airlines' president and chief executive.
Visitors to Hawaii spend more than $11 billion a year and feed nearly $850 million into the state's tax coffers. Japanese visitors account for at least 35 percent of the total.
But tourist officials in Hawaii, which for the last half-dozen years has been the No. 1 destination for Japanese, acknowledge still another factor -- the intensification of competition from Australia. "We make a pretty good lightning rod standing out there all by ourselves," said Barbara Okamoto, director of marketing research at the Hawaii bureau. "Australia is trying to knock us off."
For their part, tourist officials here marvel at Hawaii's ability to sell itself, and take such comments as high praise.
"If they look at us and say we've done a good job, well then that's great," said Julie Lithgow, marketing manager in the international marketing group of the South Australian Tourism Commission. And the Australians seem determined to do even better.
Riho Okagami, assistant general manager for corporate planning for the Japan Travel Bureau, the leading packager of tours from Japan, said from her Sydney office that the average Japanese tour of Australia -- perhaps five or six days -- costs from $1,000 to $3,000, depending on stopovers and the accommodations.
But the Japanese can visit Hawaii for the same number of days for as little as $800.
"The Australians have great nature, a relaxing atmosphere, good safety and because it's a north-south trip, roughly the same time zone, so no jet lag," she said. Hawaii, by contrast, is five time zones away.
But three-quarters of the Japanese visitors are here for the first time, while Hawaii, the mainland United States and Europe, she said, attract "repeaters."
She and other tourist officials said the big push now is on luring repeaters not only by lowering fares but also marketing new destinations besides Sydney and the Gold Coast -- like parts of western and southern Australia.
The state of South Australia has had such success promoting Kangaroo Island and other locales that Japanese tourists soared to 31,100 in 1996 from 8,700 in 1995, the state tourism office said.
One initiative, called Sensational Adelaide, gives away a bottle of South Australian wine, a walking map of the city in Japanese and a round-trip tram ticket to Glenelg, the local beach resort.
One private Adelaide tour operator, Scott Ireland, managing director of In Front Travel, which caters to the Japanese, offers a tour to ocean farms cultivating southern bluefin tuna, which are exported in great quantities to Japan.
The farms, which look like big swimming pools in the ocean, are off Port Lincoln, a 50-minute plane ride west of Adelaide. Mr. Ireland then flies an Adelaide chef to Port Lincoln to treat the Japanese tourists to a sashimi dinner.
South Australia and other states also fly in Japanese journalists and travel executives to familiarize themselves with the potential. The hope is they'll spread the word. They usually do.
Peta Cramey, a marketing coordinator at the South Australian Tourism Commission, flings open the Tokyo monthly Nile's Nile to a glowing article with pictures about wine growing and restaurants in the Borassa region 50 miles northeast of Adelaide, and says, "That's easily worth a half a million dollars of advertising."

Treasury Bond Prices Show Slight Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged higher in a quiet session yesterday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32, to 94 24/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.05 percent from 7.06 percent. 
 For the week, the yield on the 30-year bond fell 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Bond prices were bolstered this week as reports on initial weekly jobless claims, manufacturing and housing construction suggested the economy might be losing steam. Further, the Government said consumer prices barely budged last month.
The reports mean the Fed may not have to follow last month's rate increase with another 25-basis-point move when policy makers next meet on May 20, investors said. The target for the Federal funds rate is now 5.50 percent.
"Signs of moderation in the economic numbers counter the overwhelming pessimism in the market two weeks ago" that the Fed was poised to move again in May, said Robert Alley, a bond manager at the Houston-based AIM Advisers.
Gerald Thunelius of the Dreyfus Corporation said he was not convinced that the Fed would raise rates again next month. "I foresee a better bond market," he said. He said he bought three-year notes on Monday, when yields were at nine-month highs, and "We did very well on them this week."
Bonds pared gains yesterday after traders said the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 101 in April, from 100 the month before. The index showing consumers' assessment of current economic conditions rose to the highest since the survey, which is released only to subscribers, began in 1946.
"The number fits into the big picture of strong consumer confidence," said Matthew Alexy, bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Still, investors are more interested in how that confidence is reflected in actual spending and prices, he said.
Traders said a dearth of economic information next week would focus investors' attention on the Treasury's $29.5 billion sale of two- and five-year notes on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The next big economic reports arrive the following week. The Government issues its quarterly report on labor costs -- the Employment Cost Index -- on April 29, and the monthly jobs report on May 2.

HEADLINE: Man Knowingly Exposed 62 Women to AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill., April 15

 BODY:
His world knew him as Boss Man, the slender possessor of a kind of devilish charm. He cruised this bedraggled riverside slum in fancy cars, dazzled impressionable girls with roller-skating pyrotechnics, and mysteriously flitted back and forth across the Mississippi River to St. Louis.
But Boss Man, Darnell McGee, had a deadly secret, one he did not share with his dozens of casual girlfriends. He was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. And yet, despite persistent rumors about his illness, the whirl of his flashy skates and his ready money proved irresistible. 
 So today, officials in Missouri and Illinois are struggling to contain a small-scale but unmistakable public health disaster: 62 women, by latest count, have been exposed to the AIDS virus as a result of Mr. McGee's exploits, and 13 have tested positive for the virus so far. The St. Louis health department has been flooded with calls from anxious women. And health investigators are knocking on doors in some neighborhoods, looking hard for more.
Boss Man McGee will not be helping in the search. On the afternoon of Jan. 15, as the smooth-talking 28-year-old drove through a gritty North St. Louis neighborhood, his latest conquest by his side, a man flagged the car down, walked up to the driver's window and shot him dead. The girl fled down the boarded-up block; the man rifled Mr. McGee's pockets and disappeared.
The killing may have been connected to drug dealing, which several of Mr. McGee's friends say sustained him. Or it may, as the police suspect, have been revenge, exacted on behalf of one of his sexual partners.
Under that theory, the list of suspects would be long. What makes Mr. McGee's case so unusual, public health officials say, is that he exposed -- perhaps deliberately -- a large number of women and girls to the virus. He had been diagnosed with it in 1992, had received counseling and was being sought by health officials when he was killed.
"The amount of partners is very high," said Beth Meyerson, chief of the Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the Missouri Health Department. "That's what's different. He's in a class by himself."
The malicious spreader of AIDS is a contemporary urban nightmare, more mythic than real. In his 1987 book, "And the Band Played On," Randy Shilts said that scientists had retraced the sexual activity of a Canadian airline steward, Gaetan Dugas, who died in 1984, and suspected that he had played a major role in spreading AIDS to homosexual men in the United States.
In Dallas six years ago, a young woman created panic with a letter to a magazine claiming that she was spreading the AIDS virus. But the letter turned out to be a hoax. Mr. McGee, health officials here said, may have been the real thing.
More than 96 percent of people with the AIDS virus in Missouri never expose another person to it. Only 0.3 percent in Missouri knowingly expose another to the virus, Ms. Meyerson said. "He knew what he was doing," she said. "I think this was a clear issue of gender power-practice."
The story of Boss Man is about the power of flash, money and athletic prowess in a poverty-stricken environment where these attributes, even in limited amounts, will go far. This is a quiet town, the vice suburb of St. Louis, with vacant, derelict buildings, boarded-up storefronts and little traffic. One of the few smart-looking buildings here is a brick funeral home. And the biggest business is a riverboat casino. Two-thirds of the 40,000 residents are on some form of public assistance, and the unemployment rate of 8.7 percent is more than three percentage points higher than the state average.
Mr. McGee, the youngest of 14 children, lived with his deeply religious mother and at least one brother in a shabby house, next to a burned-out diner and a burned-out gas station, on a side street rutted with deep potholes. Mr. McGee's family refused to talk about him, except to say that he was an unemployed high school graduate, and did not share his health problems with the household -- an assertion disputed by one former girlfriend.
"Why just pick his name out?" his brother Charles, 33, asked angrily. He was standing on the rickety plywood front porch. "Take Magic Johnson. These things happen nationwide," he said, before demanding that a visitor leave.
But health officials here, as well as those who knew him, said Mr. McGee had an instinct for vulnerable targets in this depressed landscape and the financial means to snare them. Although the source of his money is unclear, he owned several cars, dressed flashily and took his girlfriends on shopping expeditions to malls both here and in St. Louis. Some of those girls were very young, barely into puberty; most were just emerging from adolescence.
"You think of the environment in which these young people must live," said Gracie Hutchinson, Assistant Administrator for Nursing in the East Side Health District. "So many of these kids have nothing to feel good about. So here's someone who may give you a little attention. And these were such young girls."
The girls who knew him feel certain he was intent on spreading the virus. "He did it on purpose," said Angie, a heavyset 21-year-old, described by herself and others as a close friend of Mr. McGee. He got the virus from someone else, she said, "so he wanted to give it to everybody else."
"That was his attitude," said Angie, who refused to give her last name. She was standing at the edge of a trash-strewn driveway, on a bluff overlooking the main road out of town. "Oh, Boss Man, Boss Man," she sighed. "He was a lunatic. He knew he was going to die. He was going to take as many people with him as he could."
At the Skate King, a long cinder-block shed by the railroad tracks, all the teen-age girls knew Boss Man. Inside the darkened roller skating rink, watched over by armed security guards, the attendants spoke of seeing him drive off with young girls, after a night of twirling and pirouetting. "He was always skating in here, looking for all the women," said Erica Frison, 20. "It was the weak ones he took advantage of."
And they couldn't help noticing him. "He was like magic on wheels," said Dan Williams, a security guard.
When Denise, 19, first saw him at a rink in St. Louis, her mother had just died of AIDS. Mr. McGee seemed to share her grief, crying sympathetically. With indulgent grandparents providing for her, she did not need his money, she said, like some of the other girls he took on shopping trips.
To her, Boss Man had other attractions. At the skating rink, he put everyone else in the shade, she said.
"It's like, he got out there on the floor, and he was in another world," she said, so brilliant she begged him for instruction. And his car stereo was powerful and new. " 'When I come, I'm gonna be playing this song,' " he would say, " 'so when you hear this song, come outside.' "
Last week, Denise tested positive for the AIDS virus.
In an interview at a Washington University clinic for female AIDS patients, Denise recalled why she decided to break up with Mr. McGee. She took his pager home one day last fall and found the telephone numbers of 25 different women in it. She had already confronted him about rumors that he was infected, but he always denied it, she said.
Wednesday was support-group day at the clinic, and as Denise spoke several other uneasy-looking young women, former girlfriends of Mr. McGee, dropped by.
For some weeks last fall, Denise lived at the small house here with Mr. McGee and his mother. When health workers came by looking for him, Denise said, Mr. McGee would hide in the basement, and his mother would tell them she did not know where he was.
" 'If I did have it, would you still go with me?' " Denise said he would ask plaintively. "I think he was angry with himself. He wanted everybody else to feel the pain he knew he was going to feel sooner or later."

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Were Up Last Week

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
The number of people filing for first-time unemployment benefits rose last week, according to the Labor Department.
It said 332,000 Americans submitted initial claims for jobless benefits in the week that ended last Saturday, up from a revised 324,000 in the previous week. Wall Street economists on average had been expecting 317,000 claims.
 
 The four-week moving average of claims -- viewed as a more reliable gauge of jobless trends because it smooths out weekly fluctuations -- rose to 319,750 last week from a revised 315,250 in the previous week.
 Total benefit rolls climbed to 2.32 million in the week that ended on April 5, the department said. Jobless claims stood at 2.3 million in the previous week.

HEADLINE: Clinton Meets a Thorn in China's Side

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
President Clinton met today with a prominent Hong Kong democratic politician and warned Chinese leaders that they should "live up to their agreement" to protect Hong Kong's economic, political and civil liberties after the British colony returns to Beijing's sovereignty on July 1.
"The United States has to make it clear that Hong Kong is important to us -- the people of Hong Kong are important," Mr. Clinton said after meeting with Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party and a prominent critic of China's effort to change Hong Kong's laws, even before the handover. 
 Mr. Clinton made no new policy today, but his meeting with Mr. Lee,who has traveled widely to point out the risks to Hong Kong of the world's inattention, was an important symbol of closer American attention to the colony's fate.
Mr. Clinton, asked what he would do if China cracked down on Hong Kong, called the question hypothetical, then said: "We believe it's an important matter, and we expect that they will live up to their agreement. And it's our policy, strong policy, that they should."
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, expanded on Mr. Clinton's position. "There would be consequences for any erosion of the freedoms and liberties that are currently enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong," he said. But he was careful not to define those consequences.
The chief executive Beijing has chosen for Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, has already proposed restricting public protests and free association in a move he described as a "balance between civil liberties and social stability."
American officials often say that Hong Kong will be "a benchmark" in relations that cannot "reach their full flowering" if China continues to repress dissent at home, let alone begin to do so in Hong Kong. "Clearly any diminution of the freedoms enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong would be a serious impediment in the relationship," Mr. McCurry said.
Last year, Mr. Lee met with Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, and Vice President Al Gore dropped by.
But this year, after Mr. Gore was widely criticized for not going to Hong Kong on his visit to China last month -- and House Speaker Newt Gingrich was widely praised for going there -- the Administration decided that Mr. Lee would meet Mr. Gore, and Mr. Clinton himself would "drop by."
Mr. Lee had 45 minutes with Mr. Gore, and Mr. Clinton stopped by for 25 of them, said Mr. McCurry. The center of the discussion was the 1984 treaty between Britain and Hong Kong, in which China promises to preserve Hong Kong's way of life, a policy the late Deng Xiaoping called "one country, two systems."
Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with Mr. Lee and then announced she would, as Mr. Lee had requested, accept a joint British-Chinese invitation to represent the United States at the handover ceremony in Hong Kong.
Mr. Lee, a serious, polite lawyer who is a member of the elected legislature that China will abolish on July 1, in favor of a chosen group that is already discussing future legislation, called the conversation "warm and frank and constructive." China will have new elections by July 1998, but under regulations Mr. Lee says he believes will restrict free choice.
"I have no doubt at all after this meeting and of course last week's meeting with Secretary of State Albright that the U.S. Government will defend Hong Kong's freedoms," Mr. Lee said.
Congress has paid increasing attention to Mr. Clinton's China policies and the fate of Hong Kong, which will go back to China about the time Congress is debating the annual extension of most-favored-nation trading rights to China. Last week, Mr. Lee was received warmly by Congressional conservatives, adding pressure on the White House to arrange today's meeting.
Mr. Lee's activities are highly irritating to both Beijing and to Mr. Tung, who has postponed his own planned visit here next month.
In a news conference earlier today in Hong Kong, Mr. Tung said he hoped Mr. Lee would "present a real picture" to Mr. Clinton of what is happening in Hong Kong.
Mr. Clinton is unlikely to meet another sensitive visitor to Washington next week, however. The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, will meet with White House officials "at some level," Mr. McCurry said today. China has repressed the Dalai Lama's followers in Tibet and accuses him of being a political leader who is trying to split China.

HEADLINE: Whitman Plans Late Push For Her Plan on Borrowing

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 18

 BODY:
With Senate passage of her plan to borrow billions of dollars for the state pension system far from assured, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said today that she would call Republican lawmakers this weekend before the scheduled vote on Monday.
"I am confident that there will be votes for it, because it is a very good proposal," Governor Whitman said. "I certainly intend to let everyone know how important I think this is, because it is good policy." 
 But the Governor must overcome a hurdle. All 16 Democratic senators are firmly opposed to the proposal, and at least 6 of the 24 Republican senators have expressed opposition or deep reservations. She needs 21 votes to send the proposal to the Assembly, where passage is all but certain.
"I think that we have a way to go before we have the necessary 21 votes," said Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., a Republican from Middletown who supports the plan and will present it to the Republican caucus on Monday. "It is incumbent upon the Governor and other proponents to make the case and urge its passage."
Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco said today that he would also be talking with members to try to win their support. "It is listed for a vote on Monday," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "Our goal would be to pass it on Monday. But I haven't had a frank and open discussion of the bill with all of my members, so I am unable to predict the outcome."
The proposal to borrow $2.75 billion over 35 years to help close a deficit in the state pension system is the cornerstone of Governor Whitman's election-year budget, and has generated more opposition from voters and lawmakers than any other economic proposal she has presented since taking office in 1994. The borrowing would enable Governor Whitman to balance her new state budget by reducing this year's scheduled pension payments to $40 million from $687 million.
After the Governor agreed to make significant changes to the borrowing proposal and to meet some of the demands made by leaders from the state's largest public employee union, the Senate Budget Committee voted on Thursday night to release the bill to the full Senate without recommendation.
As part of an effort to win the support of two Republican senators whose legislative districts include large numbers of state employees, the Whitman administration has been negotiating with labor leaders whose members' pension system would be affected by the borrowing plan.
Those senators, Peter A. Inverso, a Republican from Hamilton, and Richard J. LaRossa, a Republican from West Trenton, are members of the Budget Committee. They voted the legislation out of committee, but they both reserved the right to vote against the plan in the full Senate.
It was unclear today whether the agreement that the Whitman administration struck with the Communications Workers of America, the state's largest public employee union, with 36,000 workers, would be enough to win the support of Mr. LaRossa and Mr. Inverso.
Five of the eight presidents of locals representing the 36,000 workers said that they did not support the agreement. And the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Public Employees Council, which represents a half-dozen other public employee unions, is opposed to the plan, arguing that the agreement did not go far enough to protect the pension system from continuing to be used by elected officials to help balance their budgets.
Under the agreement, the pension contributions from public employees would be lowered to 4.5 percent of their pay from 5 percent for the next two years, and whenever the administration used the pension system's investment gains in the future to offset its regularly scheduled contribution. The administration also agreed to guarantee that if benefits were reduced in the future, employees with five years on the job would not be affected.
The Whitman administration also agreed to hold down the number of layoffs of state employees for the new fiscal year. The largest number of layoffs will occur at two state institutions for the developmentally disabled that are scheduled to close this year.
To help clear the Budget Committee and win support among some of the more fiscally conservative lawmakers, Governor Whitman agreed with Republican legislative leaders to reduce the amount of borrowing to $2.75 billion from $2.9 billion. She also agreed to revamp the schedule for paying off the debt.
Under the old payment schedule, payments on the borrowing over 35 years would be about $100 million in the early years and then steadily climb until they reached $1 billion in the year 2031. The new payment schedule would require a total of $150 million more in debt-service payments for six years, beginning in 1998, which state officials said would lower the payment in the year 2031 to $500 million.
The Whitman administration plans to use the $2.75 billion to help close a $4.2 billion deficit in the state's pension system, covering state workers and teachers. The deficit arose during the last two decades because the state has not been putting enough money aside to cover pension benefits.

Citicorp Official to Retire; String of Departures Grows
Joining a string of high-level executive departures at Citicorp, Roberta J. Arena, the head of the bank company's huge but embattled credit card business in North America and Europe, announced that she intended to retire by the end of this year. Ms. Arena, 49, had reported directly to John S. Reed, 58, Citicorp's chairman, and had been seen as a possible successor to him. 
 However, Mr. Reed merged her card operation with the worldwide branch-banking business run by William I. Campbell, whom he hired last year. Ms. Arena, who had clashed with Mr. Campbell over the last year, chose to retire rather than report to him, people familiar with the executives said. [Page 34.]
 
A.A.R.P. Revises Health Plan
The American Association of Retired Persons revised a sharply criticized plan to endorse selected health maintenance organizations, dropping a plan to collect royalty payments for each of its members who joined an H.M.O. Government officials and industry experts had suggested that the proposed royalties might violate Medicare anti-kickback laws. Under the revised plan, payments to the association would be based on the number of potential A.A.R.P. members in the market area of a participating H.M.O. [1.]
 
Kerkorian in Talks to Buy Orion
Kirk Kerkorian, the reclusive billionaire who acquired MGM for the third time last year, is in talks to acquire Orion Pictures from John W. Kluge for about $300 million, a person close to the discussions said. A purchase would give MGM the small, but valuable, libraries of Orion and of the Samuel Goldwyn Company. Also, Seagram's Universal Pictures unit is negotiating to buy October Films, an independent New York-based company. [34.]
 
Live Entertainment agreed to be acquired by the closely held investment group Richland, Gordon & Company for at least $150 million in cash and assumed debt. [35.]
 
China's Economic Growth Slows
China's economic growth rate slowed to 9.4 percent in the first quarter from 9.9 percent in the previous three months, as companies reduced bloated inventories built up in 1996, the Government reported. Economists had expected a 10 percent increase in growth, as a result of two interest rate cuts last year. Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. [35.]
 
Microsoft Restores Electronic Mail
Microsoft Network's electronic mail service was restored after a one-and-a-half-day shutdown to double its capacity, but the on-line service said backed-up messages could take until today to be delivered. [34.]
 
Bond Yields Off With Economy
Bond prices were bolstered this week, as reports on initial weekly jobless claims, manufacturing and housing construction suggested the economy might be losing steam. Further, consumer prices barely budged last month. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, ending at 7.06 percent, sending its price up to 94 24/32. [36.]
 
Dollar Falls Against Mark and Yen
The dollar fell after the German mark rallied on reports that European Union officials had concluded that Italy would not qualify for the planned single European currency. In New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.7119 marks, down from 1.7248 marks on Thursday and the lowest level in two weeks. The dollar fell to 125.88 yen from 126.05 yen. [32.]
 
Wheat Futures Prices Surge
Wheat futures prices surged, as some crop forecasters said last weekend's freeze in the Plains had done more damage than previously thought. Elsewhere, coffee prices rose. [32.]
 
Taiwan's Pork Industry Is Ravaged
Many Taiwan pig farmers suspect that an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease now ravaging their pork industry is an act of economic sabotage by China. The outbreak is leading to the greatest animal slaughter since "mad cow" disease struck Britain. So far, more than 1.5 million of Taiwan's 14 million pigs have been destroyed, and more than a million more are scheduled for execution. [5.]

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT PRESSES FOR BUDGET DEAL AND ARMS TREATY

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
President Clinton today appealed for Congressional support on two crucial tests of his leadership: a bipartisan agreement on the Federal budget and a vote, scheduled for Thursday, to ratify a treaty banning chemical weapons.
Brushing aside Democratic requests that he force the Republicans to put forward their own budget proposal, Mr. Clinton urged negotiators to conclude an agreement "sooner rather than later." 
 But even as he called for "honorable compromise" to continue the deficit reduction he sees as central to his legacy, Mr. Clinton sought to satisfy Democratic critics by emphasizing his commitment to a budget that includes more money for education, health insurance for poor children and the environment.
On Thursday, Senate Democrats angrily told Administration officials that they were being too quick to compromise. To allay their fears and quell a revolt against the Administration's strategy, Mr. Clinton's budget negotiators have agreed to meet often with the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, and the President plans to meet with them in the middle of next week.
Reporters were called to the White House briefing room today for an abruptly scheduled appearance by Mr. Clinton. Before taking questions, he urgently asked for Congressional support on the chemical weapons ban and then pressed for progress on the budget, his first such appeal on that subject since last month.
In linking those two issues, Mr. Clinton was trying to summon an atmosphere of bipartisanship, his aides said. The President perhaps hoped that his stated willingness to compromise on the budget would encourage some Republicans to compromise in turn on the chemical weapons treaty -- or at least present him as the more flexible, open-minded party in the disputes.
The treaty comes up for a vote on Thursday. Today, Mr. Clinton outlined -- and raised -- the stakes in that fight by warning that, without ratification, the United States would "go from leading the fight against poison gas to joining the company of pariah nations." [Excerpts, page 5.]
"America should stand with those who want to destroy chemical weapons, not with those who would defy the international community," he added.
Here again, Administration negotiators have been working to line up support, and Mr. Clinton has telephoned undecided Senators.
On Thursday, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, agreed to drop his longstanding opposition to a vote on the treaty, which outlaws making, stockpiling or using chemical weapons. Only hours later, the Administration disclosed that it was planning to consolidate some foreign-affairs agencies under the State Department, one of Mr. Helms's cherished aims.
Mr. Clinton denied today that the two moves were linked. "I do not expect Senator Helms to vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention," he said. "I would be elated if he did."
Instead, Administration officials are hoping to sway the 10 to 15 Republican Senators who they believe remain undecided. Officials said most of those undecided Senators appeared to be watching the majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to see if he will support the treaty.
The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, said today that he rated the chances for ratification at 50-50.
In hopes of rallying public pressure, Mr. Clinton has been speaking out about the treaty for two weeks. Today Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sat for interviews about the treaty that were beamed by satellite to local television news programs around the country.
Even if the Senate chooses not to approve the ban, which was signed by the United States during the Bush Administration, it will go into effect on April 29.
"If we fail to ratify, other countries could back out as well," Mr. Clinton said today. "We won't be able to enforce the treaty's rules or use its tools, and our companies will face trade sanctions aimed at countries that refuse to join."
The Administration believes that it has allayed more than two dozen concerns expressed by Mr. Helms and other opponents of the ban. Mr. Clinton said it did so not by making concessions, but by clarifying what certain provisions meant.
But opponents of the ban still plan to seek votes on several proposed modifications that Mr. Clinton called "killer amendments."
For instance, opponents insist that Russia ratify the treaty first. "That is precisely backwards," Mr. Clinton said. "The best way to secure Russian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves. Failure to do so will only give hard-liners in Russia an excuse to hold out, and hold on to their chemical weapons."
In response to questions on other subjects during his 20-minute appearance, Mr. Clinton said he was not worried by statements by the independent prosecutor in the Whitewater investigation that he had developed new evidence. "We did not do anything wrong," he said.
And Mr. Clinton joked about Bob Dole's decision to lend Speaker Newt Gingrich $300,000 to pay his penalty to the House. "I was thinking of calling Senator Dole this afternoon," he deadpanned. "You know, Chelsea's about to go off to college, and it's pretty expensive."
He added that he would not comment on the propriety of the loan. "This is a matter that has to be decided by the House," he said.
On the budget, Mr. Clinton indicated that he was sticking with his strategy for negotiations. Some Senate Democrats have urged the Administration to seek a confrontation over the budget that might force the Republicans to put forward unpopular spending cuts to pay for the deep tax cuts they are proposing.
Instead, Mr. Clinton spoke the language of compromise. "If each of us is willing to compromise our sense of the perfect," he said, "I know we can reach an agreement that advances the greater good."
He thanked Congressional Republicans "for working so hard and in such good faith with our economic team." But he also pointedly noted, in the wake of the contentious budget meeting on Thursday, that he would cooperate with Democrats in the House and Senate. "We're working closely with Senate and House Democratic leaders and Budget Committee leaders as we move forward on this issue," he said.
The first of the new meetings between the Democratic Senators and the Administration budget team -- including Franklin D. Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Gene Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council -- took place today in Senator Daschle's office.

HEADLINE: Central Americans Feel Sting Of New U.S. Immigration Law

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: INTIPUCA, El Salvador

 BODY:
At the height of the civil war here, as the United States was spending billions of dollars to prop up El Salvador's military, hundreds of people from this small town fled the violence that engulfed their country and made their way to Washington. They took jobs at hotels and construction sites or as household help for members of the United States Congress.
Now, as a result of a new American immigration law that went into effect April 1, many of them, like hundreds of thousands of other Central Americans who sought refuge in the United States in the 1980's, are being told they must return to the land of their birth. For poor countries still struggling to recover from civil wars, the prospect of suddenly having to accommodate those returnees -- and having to do without the money they send home -- has caused consternation. 
 "This is the worst danger we have faced since the war ended" five years ago, said Domitila Velazquez de Blanco, 53. Three of her children are among those who ended up in Washington, including a daughter she says is a cook and housekeeper for a United States Senator.
"Everyone here counts on the money their relatives send back from the United States, and if they deport all of them, as they say they are going to do, we will be left with nothing," she said.
Many of those who fled the conflict here have now lived in the United States for up to 15 years, and have children born there. They include applicants for political asylum, those seeking permanent residency by other means and some who still live clandestinely after entering the country illegally or overstaying their visas.
Because the United States armed and financed the army whose brutality sent them into exile, few Salvadorans were able to obtain the refugee status granted to Cubans, Vietnamese, Kuwaitis and other nationalities at various times. The new law regards many of them simply as targets for deportation.
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua also found themselves pulled into the East-West conflict that was played out on battlefields in Central America, and are greatly affected by the new measure too. But because of the severity of the fighting here and the resulting economic devastation it inflicted, El Salvador has the largest contingent in the United States, an estimated one million people, at least one-third of whom are subject to the new law.
As a result of the refugee outflow, money sent home by Salvadorans living abroad is now the largest single source of income for this country of 5.8 million people, accounting for 12 percent of the gross national product. According to official figures published by the Central Reserve Bank, remittances last year totaled more than $1.25 billion, a sum larger than El Salvador's combined exports.
"This is a problem that profoundly worries us, and I have talked with President Clinton about it on several occasions," President Armando Calderon Sol said in a recent interview at the Presidential Palace in San Salvador when asked about the new law. "Mr. Clinton is a man with a high degree of sensitivity to human problems, and he has asked us to remain calm and understanding and assured us that there will not be mass deportations."
Mr. Clinton is to meet with the presidents of five Central American countries on May 8 and 9 in Costa Rica, and the topic is sure to be broached again there. Already, Central American foreign ministers have flown to Washington to meet Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and plead with her to take steps to lessen the measure's impact.
On April 10, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a statement promising a "hold on deportations through September 30" for a category of immigrant that applies to many Salvadorans. The announcement was being made, the agency said, "because confusion about this assurance appears to have arisen in Central America and among the U.S. immigrant community."
But in what was interpreted here as an indication that any reprieve would be temporary, the statement also cautioned that "this does not mean the law, or any of its provisions, has been or will be suspended for any specific nation or group of people." The immigration service's "enforcement priorities remain the same under the new law," the statement also said.
Even before the statement was issued, officials throughout Central America had been skeptical of assurances that no systematic deportations would take place. As Eduardo Stein, Guatemala's Foreign Minister, said in an interview, "All the indications that we have encountered point to the contrary, and that is what alarms us."
Guatemala's civil war came to an end last Dec. 29, after 36 years of fighting between an American-armed military and leftist guerrillas that killed more than 100,000 people and forced a million more into exile or out of their homes. A peace accord brokered by the United Nations requires the Guatemalan Government to carry out sweeping agrarian, social and educational reforms, a process that is expected to cost more than $2.5 billion.
"We have our hands full," Mr. Stein said. "We have serious problems of displaced people, refugees in camps in Mexico, and 3,000 guerrillas who are disarming. If they suddenly send back 65,000 people from the United States, for us that creates very grave concerns."
Unlike the estimated 2.7 million Mexicans who are in the United States illegally, many, if not most, Central Americans say they are refugees who fled the civil wars that racked the region for a generation. During a conflict that lasted from 1979 until 1992, more than 70,000 people were killed in El Salvador, most of them by the American-backed army and the death squads it in turn supported, and hundreds of thousands more were displaced.
"The war forced many people here to flee to the United States," explained Amilcar Morales, 60, who says his household of eight people could not survive without the $200 that his brother and children in the United States send back each month. "They were unjustly accused of being guerrillas when they were not, and they had to leave to save their lives."
Once they reached American soil, though, Salvadorans found the Reagan Administration unwilling to grant them political asylum. To continue providing the Salvadoran Government and military with aid that, at its peak, exceeded $1 billion a year, the State Department had to certify to Congress that human rights were being respected in El Salvador, and the claims of refugees seeking political asylum contradicted that assurance.
Facing deportation as "economic refugees," Salvadoran and Guatemalan asylum seekers in 1985 filed a class action suit, winning a settlement with the immigration service five years later. That agreement allowed them to continue living and working in the United States while their claims were being heard, and together with legislation passed in 1991 raised hopes among them that, even if they were denied asylum, they would eventually qualify for permanent residency.
But the new immigration law makes it far more difficult for Central American refugees to win such rights. Much of the time they have accrued in the United States does not count toward eligibility for permanent residency, there is an annual worldwide numerical cap of 4,000 on the number of "suspensions of deportation" that can be granted, and hardship to immigrants is no longer a consideration.
"When these people should have won asylum, they were denied it for all the wrong reasons," said Lisa Reiner, a lawyer who works at Central American Legal Assistance, an immigrant rights group in Brooklyn. "Now the floor moves again, and they are being told they can't even apply for suspension of deportation, which once more makes them victims of poorly applied immigration laws."
Many here contend that the United States is merely reaping what it sowed, and that it has a moral debt to repay to this country. In an editorial, the conservative newspaper Diario de Hoy argued that "it should not be forgotten that the problem of illegal immigrants derives from the interference of the United States in our region."
In towns like this, the principal concern is with the material, rather than moral, consequences of the law. Thanks largely to money emigrants have sent back from the United States, this highlands town of 16,000 people has several two-story houses, private bus service to the provincial capital and other amenities not often found in the Salvadoran countryside.
"Every improvement you see here is a result of money that has come from the United States," said Lazaro Guardado, 66, who has four children living in the Washington area. "People who used to own just a little horse now have four-wheel drives, and people who lived in little wooden shacks now have houses made of brick, and all because of the remittances."
Studies done by Salvadoran sociologists indicate that the poorest families are most dependent on money sent from the United States. Sitting in front of the wooden hut that is her home, Petronila Ramirez said that without the $130 sent each month by two grandchildren working in Virginia, her family would not be able to afford school fees for her 14-year-old granddaughter, Digna, and would have to cut back significantly on purchases of food.
But the difficulties of those who have come to depend on money from the United States would not be the only problem the country would confront, said Robert Rivera Campos, an economist at the Salvadoran Foundation for Social and Economic Development, a private research institute in San Salvador. El Salvador would also have to accommodate a 6 percent increase in population almost overnight, with all the social strains that implies.
The country already suffers a significant shortage of housing, schools, hospitals and jobs, all of which would be worsened by large-scale deportations from the United States.
"We simply do not have the capacity to absorb everyone all at once," President Calderon Sol said.
The Salvadoran currency, whose exchange rate has held steady since the end of the war, would also collapse, diplomats and economists here predicted. The United States has pressured Mr. Calderon Sol to open up the Salvadoran economy, but foreign investment and trade have not grown as rapidly as hoped.
"The colon would sink like a stone, the balance-of-payments deficit would balloon and inflation would rise quickly, undoing much of the effort this country has made to put its house in order," one Latin American diplomat here warned. "And the ultimate result, obviously, would simply be to encourage more people to immigrate to the United States for lack of opportunity here."
