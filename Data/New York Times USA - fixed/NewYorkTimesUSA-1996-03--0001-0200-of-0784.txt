HEADLINE: David Durand Is Dead at 83; Was Statistics Pioneer at M.I.T.

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
David Durand, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a pioneer in applying statistical tools to problems in financial markets, died on Monday at the M.I.T. Infirmary in Cambridge, Mass. He was 83 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
The cause was aplastic anemia, a blood disorder, his family said. 
 As a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., Mr. Durand applied sampling analysis to subjects like consumer loan defaults and farm mortgages.
He Durand developed the statistical explanation for why long-term bonds usually have a higher yield than those with shorter terms. "Everyone understands that today, but he was the first to document it," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and fellow M.I.T. professor. said.
Working in the 1950's, when computers were still primitive, Mr. Durand used punched-card equipment for statistical tabulation. As eagerly as he constructed mathematical models, colleagues and former students said, Mr. Durand used the results as an aid to judgment rather than the final answer. "Frequently this did not endear him to those enamored of a model," said Don Lewin, a former doctoral student of Mr. Durand and now a consultant in York, Pa.
Mr. Durand wrote a textbook on statistical techniques, "Stable Chaos" (General Learning Press) and was for many years an associate editor of Financial Management.
He was reared in Ithaca, N.Y., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Cornell University in 1934. He received his master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University.
Before joining M.I.T. in 1953, he was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
He is survived by his wife, Edith Durand of Lexington, and a daughter, Marie Durand of Princeton.

Little Change In Treasury Prices in Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday in trading buffetted by mixed signals from economic reports and by comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested the central bank might not be prepared to cut interest rates soon.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32, to 9327/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.46 percent, from 6.47 percent on Wednesday. But he price of the two-year note fell 15/32 , to 9915/32 , driving its yield up to 5.41 percent from 5.36 percent. 
 An auction of new one-year bills yesterday generated disappointing demand, traders said. The Treasury sold $18.75 billion of the bills at an average discount rate of 4.98 percent.
Treasury prices fell sharply after an unexpected drop in claims for initial unemployment benefits suggested to some market participants that the job market was improving.
Jobless claims fell 23,000, to 359,000, last week, a bigger decline than economists expected. The drop in claims stemmed in part from the Washington's Birthday holiday last week, which gave unemployed workers less time to file, analysts said.
Bonds later pared their losses after a report showing slower manufacturing in the Chicago area eased concerns that the economy was growing fast enough to exacerbate inflation.
The Chicago Purchasing Management Association's report on manufacturing activity fell to 44.9 in February from 50.9 in January, suggesting economic growth is still plodding.
"Numbers like the Chicago purchasing managers index really tells you like it is, which is that the economy really stinks," said Andrew Brenner, senior trader at Nomura Securities International in New York. That suggests bond yields should be headed lower, he said, adding, "I don't know when it will be, but this market will turn around."
But expectations of lower rates ahead were shaken after Robert Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said he expected the economy would soon pick up steam. That assessment was echoed by Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, who said the economy's fundamentals "are strong."
Taken together, their comments reduced the odds that interest rates would be cut when Fed policy makers meet on March 26, traders and analysts said.
"The Fed will be on hold until we get a clear direction on the economy," said Peter Greig, who helps manage $1 billion of bond funds at Financial Counselors Inc. in Kansas City, Mo.
At the University of California at Davis's Graduate School of Management yesterday, Mr. Parry said: "I don't think we're going to see this slowing continue. I think we're going to see a pickup in the economy."
Mr. Parry also said in an interview with Dow Jones that current monetary policy was "reasonably accommodative." He added, "I'm really quite comfortable at this point with monetary policy."
Separately, Mr. Lindsey said that while economic growth has recently been weak, the "fundamentals of the economy are strong."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Stocks Down Again, With Dow Off 20.59

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks extended their losing streak into a fourth session yesterday as the market focused again on the Presidential election and the prospects of a United States default in March if no action is taken by Congress to raise the nation's debt limit.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 20.59 points to end at 5,485.62, which brought its four-day loss to 146 points. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances, 1,474 to 900, on active volume of 453.2 million shares on the Big Board. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 7.50, to 1,100.05.
"The political uncertainty has cast a shadow over the market," said Bill Meehan, analyst at Prudential Securities. "As the Presidential campaign rolls around, no one is talking about reining in the deficit."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told the House Ways and Means Committee that the Government could default on its obligations by March 21 if Congress did not increase the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling.
"His comments didn't help" stocks, Mr. Meehan said.
The threat of a default has contributed to the recent surge in long-term bond interest rates.
In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury edged up 1/32 , and its yield held virtually unchanged at 6.46 percent from Wednesday's close at 6.47 percent after climbing early in the day to 6.53 percent -- the highest level in five months. In mid-February, the yield was just 6.03 percent.
After the close, the House majority leader, Dick Armey, said Republican House leaders planned action on the proposed debt ceiling increase next week.
Birinyi Associates Inc., which tracks the market-making program traders, noted that for the first time since Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange's curbs on program trading were not activated.
The so-called collars are brought into play when the Dow industrials rise or fall by 50 points.
But stocks were again whipsawed by the wild gyrations of the bond market.
"Bonds set the tone and stocks follow," said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago.
Stocks and bonds fell at the opening on news that weekly jobless claims fell to 359,000, from a downwardly revised 382,000 the previous week, a sign that the economy could be stronger than expected.
Later, the markets recouped their losses on news that the Chicago urchasing managers index for February -- a measure of business activity -- was at 44.9, sharply below the expected 51.5.
The regional data suggested that the economy was weaker then expected, which suggested that the central bank could lower interest rates when the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on March 26.
A broader measure of the economy will come from today's release of the National Association of Purchasing Management index.
Among individual issues, LSI topped the Big Board active list and tumbled 3 7/8, to 27 5/8, after warning that its first-quarter earnings will be weaker than expected.
Other semiconductor equipment makers fell in sympathy, with Applied Materials off 2 3/4, to 35 3/4; KLA Instruments down 1 3/4, to 24, and Lam off 2 1/8, to 36 7/8.
Other initial public offerings also drew buying interest. Engineering Animation, a three-dimensional animation products producer, soared 7 3/4, to 25 3/4, and Indus, a client/server enterprise management software company, leaped 7, to 22. Sithe soared 8 5/8, to 14 1/2, on news that Japan's Marubeni would acquire a 29 percent stake in the company for $15 a share.
Oil stocks rose in response to rising crude prices. Exxon gained 1 1/4, to 79 1/2. British Petroleum rose 2 1/8, to 100 3/8, and Mobil added 1 3/4, to 109 5/8, after the two companies agreed to combine European refining and fuel marketing operations.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 4.32 points, to 640.43. The American Stock Exchange index was off 4.66 at 562.00.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks lost 1.82, to 342.80. The average share was down 21 cents.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: LOOKING ABROAD;
Forbes Offers View of His Foreign Policy Stands

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 29

 BODY:
If Steve Forbes could change the world, he would give Taiwan a seat in the United Nations, split Rwanda into two countries with Hutus on one side and Tutsis on the other, and see to it that the President of Serbia was indicted as a war criminal.
He would also shore up the Mexican peso, make northern Iraq a trusteeship of the United Nations and draw "a line in the water" if China threatened to cross the straits and attack Taiwan. 
 With his ambitious flat tax plan for America, the magazine publisher turned Presidential candidate has been regularly accused of pitching only one issue on the campaign. ("If you ask him about Bosnia, he gives you the flat tax message," Senator Bob Dole said recently.)
But with Mr. Forbes's recent resurgence following primary victories in Delaware and Arizona, and the contest next week in New York, where voters have a habit of bringing up touchy subjects like the Middle East, Mr. Forbes is starting to talk more about what he would do if he won the title of commander-in-chief.
After Cuba shot down two civilian aircraft this week, Mr. Forbes called Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro, a "bloodthirsty dictator" and said that the shootdown proved why the United States had to fulfill Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" dream of building a defense system in space against nuclear missiles. Mr. Forbes acknowledged that Mr. Castro did not have any nuclear weapons to defend against, but said that he would surely use them to attack America if he did.
Two interviews and more than two decades of magazine columns reveal a candidate with a comprehensive, if idiosyncratic world-view. He even has opinions on why global environmentalists who attack the use of Pampers should be ignored ("They don't want the rest of us enjoying ourselves") and why the United States should not mint one-dollar coins (British one-pound coins "are a pain to deal with").
"People say they don't know where he stands, but he has a paper trail 22 years long," said former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, the honorary co-chairman of Mr. Forbes's campaign, the chairman of Forbes Inc. and one of his foreign policy mentors.
Mr. Weinberger insists that Mr. Forbes's written record is a political plus, saying, "It's very good for the public to know."
The candidate himself is not worried that his words will haunt him. "It's fun having your own pages," he said in an interview. "And they're always going to find something on you."
Mr. Forbes sees himself as a Ronald Reagan-style optimist, a believer in old-fashioned principles like global freedom, a strong defense and the unlimited potential of the human imagination.
Indeed, his full-color campaign brochure includes a photograph of Mr. Forbes and Mr. Reagan, who once appointed him to the largely ceremonial job of chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting, which oversees Radio Free Europe. No modesty here. The brochure claims that the global radio station "helped bring down the Iron Curtain."
In his columns, Mr. Forbes has called President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia "Hitleresque," North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, "loony" and Syria's Hafez al-Assad a "terrorist," descriptions that he said still fit today.
Years before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, when he was still a friend of the United States, Mr. Forbes described the Iraqi leader as a "gangster" with "a thirst for blood and violence." After the Gulf war was over and the Emir of Kuwait restored to his throne, Mr. Forbes said that the Kuwaiti leader had been more interested in "room service than in governing" and predicted his abdication.
"Too bad you can't sell international leaders short the way you can stocks," he wrote.
Last April he wrote that Pamela Harriman, the American Ambassador to France, was an "A-list natural" should President Clinton ever decide to fill the post of Secretary of State. Just what would make her a good Secretary of State? "She just seems to have more verve and energy than our current one," he said in an interview.
His us-against-them attitude is best illustrated by his determination to use force to defend Taiwan if China attacked the island nation it claims as its own, even though the United States has no legal obligation to come to Taiwan's defense.
He compared Defense Secretary William Perry's recent refusal to state that the United States would defend Taiwan against China to Secretary of State Dean Acheson's statement on the eve of North Korea's invasion of South Korea that the United States would not necessarily come to its defense.
"We have to make clear that we will use force if China uses force," Mr. Forbes said, adding he would "draw a line in the water."
Mr. Forbes insisted he could somehow adhere to the "one China" policy by which the United States recognizes Beijing's claim to Taiwan, and at the same time push for Taiwan to become a member of the United Nations -- a move that Beijing would regard as an act of war.
And in a Forbes Administration, Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, would be welcome to make private visits to the United States, despite the fact that the Clinton Administration's decision to allow him to visit Cornell University, his alma mater, last year caused a major rift with Beijing that has not been mended. He would not be invited to the White House, but Mr. Forbes might agree to meet him on neutral ground like a college campus, "if he receives an honorary degree, and I receive one at the same time."
Mr. Forbes opposes the stationing of American troops on the Golan Heights should Israel and Syria make peace ("Using American troops as a trip wire there would not be wise to do").
He favors the expansion of NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- but not Russia. "Then you wouldn't need NATO," he said.
There is also a streak of we-are-the-world libertarianism in his writings.
Although he began calling last fall for tougher enforcement against illegal immigrants, a decade earlier he criticized proposals to crack down on illegal immigrants by punishing employers who hired them. "An important portion of this country's prosperity is now dependent on illegals," he wrote. "The American southwest would suffer a depression without them."
In April 1991, he argued in favor of allowing Puerto Rico to hold a plebiscite on its political future, chastising those on Capitol Hill who opposed such a move because the island might vote for statehood.
In his view, there is nothing sacred about international borders. In an April 1991 column, more than a year after the end of the Gulf war against Iraq, Mr. Forbes argued that the ouster of Saddam Hussein was more important than the disintegration of Iraq. "The breakup of Iraq?" he asked. "So what?"
As for Rwanda, Mr. Forbes would have the French take the lead in splitting the country in two, even though the French gave arms and political support to the Hutus in the years before the 1994 massacres, would never be trusted by the Tutsis and have rejected a new peacekeeping role in neighboring Burundi.
But in crafting a foreign policy, Mr. Forbes simply cannot get away from the issue that remains dearest to him: the flat tax. In his writings, Israel's biggest problem seems not to be Palestinian self-rule or the eventual status of the Golan Heights, but the fact that the country does not have a flat tax.
If Israel were to enact a flat tax and combine it with serious deregulation, he wrote last June, it "would instantly have Israel's economy performing the way its legendary army and air force have done since independence."
And which country is a model for much of the rest of the former Soviet Union? "Estonia is particularly impressive," he wrote last August. "It has instituted a flat tax."

Plan to Mix Oil With Oil In Europe

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
In an effort to cut costs in Europe where demand for gasoline has been declining while refining capacity has been increasing, the Mobil Corporation and the British Petroleum Company said yesterday that they would combine their refining and marketing of fuels and lubricants.
If the step is approved by the European Commission, the two companies will create a huge new force that would control about 12 percent of the European fuel market and 18 percent of the lubricant market. 
 Under the agreement, Mobil's red, white and blue trademark will be replaced by B.P.'s green and yellow colors at 3,300 Mobil stations, and 5,600 B.P. stations will carry the signs for Mobil lubricants.
"This is a monumental event," said Fred Leuffer, an analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company, suggesting that other major oil companies were considering similar moves.
He said that most major oil companies had exhausted more traditional ways to cut costs, like layoffs and spinoffs of assets.
The next phase, he added, would be for the highly competitive industry to begin creating partnerships in refining and marketing.
"I think every major oil company is looking at this," he said.
"We're doing this with Mobil because our attitudes are similar," John Browne, the chief executive of British Petroleum, said. "It takes searching after mutual advantages, recognizing that someone else is doing something better."
The combination will be a complex pooling of $5 billion worth of assets -- $3.4 billion from B.P. and $1.6 billion from Mobil. The partnership projects annual sales of $20 billion.
John D. Hervey, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the combination would create a marketing group that would be in the same league with Europe's two refining and marketing giants, Esso and Shell.
The fuels and lubricants business in each country will be run by combined management teams. Other departments, like information technology, human resources, legal and accounting, are also to be merged.
The companies estimated that about 2,000 to 3,000 jobs will be lost from their combined work force of 17,500 -- not including the gas stations -- and that they would save about $400 million to $500 million a year, beginning in about three years.
In contrast to the United States, where fuel consumption has grown as less efficient sport utility vehicles have taken a major part of the new- car sales and people are driving faster, European fuel efficiency is still improving.
Sluggish economies and economic changes in Eastern Europe have also cut demand for oil products.
Meanwhile, Europe has not shut many older refineries, which has caused a surplus of capacity, keeping profits down on refined products.
British Petroleum owns or has an interest in eight European refineries with a combined capacity of 760,000 barrels a day. The company said recently that it would sell its Lavera refinery in the South of France, which would bring its capacity down to 575,000 barrels a day.
B.P. took an exceptional charge of $1.12 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect its intention to sell that refinery and one in Lima, Ohio.
Mobil owns or has an interest in six European refineries with a capacity of 350,000 barrels a day.
Under the agreement, B.P. would control 70 percent of the combined refineries and 8,900 service stations and operate them. Mobil will control 51 percent of the lubricant business and operate it.
Mr. Brown said that European consumers were also attracted to stations that sell more than gasoline, creating pressure to upgrade stations. That is also a strong trend in the United States, where oil companies are building new stations that combine convenience stores with fast-food outlets.
Also the marketing of gasoline is changing rapidly, with customers tending to buy at stations where they have a credit card, especially if it can be used to pay at the pump. Mobil is among the companies that have been aggressive in promoting its credit card and upgrading stations to accept cards at the pump.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall in a Shorter Workweek

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 29

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled last week, but economists said today that the sharp drop did not signal any drastic improvement in the labor market.
The Labor Department said that first-time applications for unemployment pay fell by 23,000, to 359,000, far exceeding Wall Street economists' forecasts for initial claims of 380,000 in the week. 
 The shortened workweek because of the Washington's Birthday holiday probably contributed to last week's decline, which put the number of applicants at its lowest level since the week that ended Jan. 13, when claims stood at 316,000.
The closely watched four-week moving average of claims, which is considered a more accurate barometer of the labor market because it irons out weekly volatility, decreased by 8,250, to 372,500.

HEADLINE: Power Shopping in Los Angelas;
Bloomingdale's Pushes Into a Crowd

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Standing in the middle of the designer sportswear department at Nordstrom, Lisa Razin ticked off the differences between the department stores in the Southern California bazaar. Bullock's is her place to buy cutting-edge fashion, while Nordstrom is where she goes for cosmetics and party dresses. Robinsons-May has no clear-cut image at all.
And then there is Bloomingdale's, which is about to storm into the Southern California market. "I have no clue about it," said Ms. Razin, 30. "I'm a total West Coast person. I am not sure I need another shopping option. But I do know to know that it's cool." 
 Federated Department Stores Inc., the largest department-store company in the nation, is betting that the Bloomingdale's name, and all that it represents, will be enough to drag shoppers by the tens of thousands out of Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue and into its aisles.
The company bought the 82-store Broadway chain last year for $1.6 billion, with plans to change the stores to its own in a pre-emptive strike against other potential West Coast competitors. Federated had already acquired the Macy's chain, with its Bullock's and I. Magnin divisions -- all chains with California presences. Federated plans to convert the Bullock's stores to Macy's.
This West Coast invasion is the most recent and pronounced effect of the consolidation that has reshaped the department-store business over the last decade. The strongest and biggest companies have gobbled up weaker regional competitors, eliminating them from the food chain.
The upheaval has turned department stores, dismissed only a few years ago as outdated, overpriced dinosaurs destined for extinction, into one of the few areas of retailing that is actually gaining ground. By developing carefully honed fashion images and relying on economies of scale in buying and merchandising, the most successful companies have overcome the heavy cost of acquisitions to invade not just the turf of other department stores but also to strike back against the specialty retailers that once threatened to nibble them to death.
And Southern California, which is finally emerging from its worst economic downturn in decades, is ground zero of the store wars. "California is an extremely important state to have a large position in," the chairman of Federated, Allen I. Questrom, said in a recent interview. "It has one of the most dynamic economies in the United States. It is close to the Pacific Rim. And in the long run, it will continue to be a major economy."
Federated's collection of Broadway stores will be sliced and diced, depending on regional demographics. Stores in locations with few wealthy consumers will be sold to companies like Sears and J. C. Penney. At least 40 are to be converted into Macy's -- a name familiar to many Southern Californians because of the chain's presence in the San Francisco Bay area -- that will be aimed at middle-market consumers.
But the big bets will be placed in four prime Broadway locations, Beverly Center and Century City west of downtown Los Angeles, Fashion Island along the coast in Orange County and Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. There, the Broadway stores will be gutted and turned into Bloomingdale's. (Federated will also open a Bloomingdale's in the Bay Area in Palo Alto.) Federated, which is based in Cincinnati and which last year had sales of $15 billion, estimates that the entire Broadway conversion will cost $525 million, a number that many analysts say is quite a bit less than what it will ultimately take to remodel stores that were perhaps best known for their previous owner's neglect.
For now Wall Street is keeping the leash loose on Federated, overlooking the big debts that give it a highly leveraged balance sheet, in hopes that the expansion will generate a huge flow of cash once it is completed. But the new Bloomingdale's and Macy's stores here will need to turn profits quickly to keep the financiers from turning on Federated stock.
"Federated way overpaid for those stores," said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst at NatWest Securities. "It was too much for an operation that was one foot from bankruptcy court. Given their high cost of entry, I think this acquisition will haunt them for years."
But other analysts believe that the company had little choice if it ever wanted to be a major player in California. "If you're an investor in Federated, you have to look at the long term," said Jeffrey S. Stein, a retail analyst at McDonald & Company Investments in Cleveland. [Federated's stock closed at $30.25 Thursday, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.]
To justify its investment, Federated hopes to break into Southern California by offering jaded consumers a different way to shop. But that will not be easy. Bloomingdale's up-to-the-minute, acid-green spring dresses and distinctive designer lines -- the things that set it apart in New York -- are already well known in the chic West Side and Orange County Gold Coast shopping districts that Bloomingdale's is about to invade.
To make its 59th Street magic work 3,000 miles away, Bloomingdale's will also need to bring to the party everything from its eye-catching fixtures and designer lines to that intangible yet essential something known in the industry as the "shopping experience."
Part of the Bloomingdale's sensibility is to entertain, and there seems to be no better city in which to do that than Los Angeles, which has attracted New York exiles for decades but which thrives on a more casual way of life, where even grocery shopping is supposed to be fun. Though Bloomingdale's has had trouble translating the ambiance of its New York flagship store to suburban malls on the East Coast, its executives believe that its Manhattan fashion shows, presentations on Italy -- covering everything from olive oil to leather sling-back chairs -- and colorful window displays are just what Southern Californians are waiting for.
But like transplanted New Yorkers, exported stores can both benefit from and suffer for their East Coast mystique. "Bloomingdale's has much more of a New York mentality," said Kirk Palmer, a retail consultant in New York. "The institution does not have the same meaning to a California customer. I would say it will be a while before they can approach what they do in East Coast business."
Indeed, for all the common ground between New Yorkers and Angelenos, the Southern California consumer is also very different. Merchandise assorted for the Hollywood-style casual set, which considers jeans at dinner a power statement, will be critical.
"When Bloomingdale's went to Chicago, it was a disaster," said Kurt Barnard, the editor of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "Millions flocked to see it, and after they saw it, they went right back to Marshall Field's."
Mr. Questrom of Federated seems to have big Hollywood dreams. A tiny silver bracelet on his right wrist shimmered as he spooned dry oatmeal at a breakfast interview in New York and talked about the important impact of television and movies on the American shopper.
"Everyone is seeing the same movies, looking at the same television programs," he said. "We spend a lot of time thinking about what the shopper wants and what we want her to want. We're the nicer side of life."
Federated's timing is fortuitous. After a protracted recession, the Southern California economy is back on its feet and growing strongly again, much of it because of the bottoming out of the aerospace collapse and the boom in entertainment and technology.
"The California economy is clearly turning around," said Carl Steidtmann, an economist at Management Horizons in Columbus, Ohio. "It is starting to show real signs of improvement, including an increase in retail sales."
Department stores enjoy a particular advantage in Southern California. In a city where it is socially declasse to walk farther than a frisbee can be thrown, the mall department store is de rigueur. And unlike consumers in much of the rest of the country, many Angelenos have the desire to spend a lot of money on fashion.
That's why Southern Californians tend to take their cues from department stores, where an entire look is put together in one place.
"I think there is an expertise in a department store that people here need," the designer Isaac Mizrahi said in an interview a few minutes before he dressed three women in a new line on a stage at the Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.
"They rely on department stores to move them in the right direction, to tell them, 'This is what you wear to dinner.' "
Conversely, designers need department stores. Foot traffic is not a big part of Los Angeles shopping: The designer Anna Sui opened a shop in Hollywood two years ago, only to shutter it because there was no parking nearby.
"As a designer, you need that department-store powerhouse behind you," Mr. Mizrahi said.
Equally as important as fashion is the nesting trend. Bloomingdale's and Macy's offer housewares and stylish furniture, popular among baby boomers, with a sensibility like that offered in their clothing aisles.
In the middle market, the Robinsons-May chain, owned by the May Department Stores Company, which declined to comment for this article, is clearly the target Macy's is aiming at. But with the Broadway chain out of the picture -- and no longer undercutting everybody with its fire-sale prices during its death throes -- several analysts argue that there is enough room for Macy's to throw its weight around without damaging its main rivals. "I think the market is going to actually get less competitive," said Linda Kristiansen , a retail analyst at Schroder Wertheim.
Meanwhile, Bloomingdale's is going after the same customers who now shop at upscale stores like Nordstrom; Neiman Marcus, which is owned by Harcourt General Inc., and Saks, which is owned by Investcorp. "These stores will undoubtedly run more promotions and more ads, and do special events that Bloomie's is known for," Mr. Barnard said. "Bloomie's will take some of the spotlight away and they will try to get it back by creating sideshows."
With all that competitive fire among the department stores, the big losers could well be the mall specialty stores. "Specialty stores are going out of business," Mr. Stein, the retail analyst in Cleveland, said. "The vacant stores in the malls are not likely to be replaced by apparel stores, and those sales have to go somewhere."

HEADLINE: Economic Yeast for a Stale Industry;
New York Tries to Stem Loss of City Bakeries

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
The time passed long ago when the ovens of hulking bread factories like Silvercup and Taystee Bread in Queens filled pockets of the city's landscape with the robust aroma of fresh-baked bread. The Silvercup factory, hard by the East River in Long Island City, is now a television studio. Taystee's huge logo in Flushing beckoned to a web of highways before Stroehmann Bakeries closed its plant in 1992 and converted it into a Home Depot.
Since the 1970's, felled by a weak economy, large bakers have been leaving the city for more affordable settings in Connecticut, New Jersey and parts south. 
 "The baking industry in New York City is an endangered species," said Andy Gioe, quality coordinator at Fink Baking Corporation, which has been operating in Long Island City for more than 100 years and has conducted a study of the industry with the Manhattan Borough President's office. "Ninety-five percent of all the bread consumed each year in New York City is baked out of state. If you had more bakeries, you'd have more jobs."
But now the city and state have turned a new and friendlier face to bakeries to stanch the flight, and this week, flanked by loaves of Wonder Bread and Beefsteak Rye, officials gathered to herald a comeback for an industry that once called New York home.
The Interstate Bakeries Corporation was threatening to close its 180,000-square-foot plant at Douglas Avenue and 168th Street in Jamaica, Queens. Instead, it held a ground-breaking ceremony on Tuesday to announce plans to expand its plant and increase the 400-member work force by 100 when a new line of Wonder Bread hamburger and hot dog buns and "heat and serve" rolls is offered in October.
The announcement came after months of arduous discussions with city officials to prevent the company from closing the 100-year-old Jamaica plant. Interstate, whose headquarters are in Kansas City, Mo., acquired the former Continental Baking Company on the site last year. It determined that it could not maintain all its Northeast plants because they were producing more than they could sell, said Charles A. Sullivan, chairman of the company.
After months of analysis, Interstate decided that instead of closing the Jamaica operation, it would close one in East Brunswick, N.J., eliminating 500 jobs when it shuts down tomorrow. "Part of that analysis was who is pro jobs," Mr. Sullivan said. "Who will work with you and who won't. East Brunswick did absolutely nothing, nothing, zero to keep us. New York City did and we generally don't get that kind of reception in other states."
In East Brunswick, Raymond W. Stone, the township's Business Administrator, said he was shocked that Interstate considered officials uncooperative. "We met with them on one or more occasions," Mr. Stone said. "We were almost pleading with them to tell us what needed to be done, but we were assured that it was an economic decision."
In the end, Interstate Bakeries was tempted by a $4.9 million benefits package over 25 years from the city and state, with utility rate cuts promised by Brooklyn Union Gas and Con Edison. Talks were begun by the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency whose officials grew alarmed at hearing the plant could close.
Some 35 years ago, New York City had 370 bakeries employing more than 20,000 workers, according to the Empire State Development Corporation, a state development agency. Today, because of urban flight as well as automation, only 5,900 workers are employed by the city's roughly 200 licensed bakers, which range from mom-and-pop muffin-makers to conglomerates.
Concerned over the dwindling industry, Rudy Washington, Commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services, formed the Baking Industry Development Corporation two years ago. The corporation, which has about 50 members, offers tax counseling, advice on seeking utility subsidies, and ways to wend one's way through the process of acquiring city and state operating permits. The regulations include strict limits on smokestack emission of ethanol fumes, which are produced by leavened bread.
Commissioner Washington formed the agency after the Fink Bakery, a family-owned company, lost a contract to a New Jersey company to supply baked goods to the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
In a bitter dispute, Fink, which had won the contract for 20 consecutive years, was outbid by Harrison Baking of New Jersey. Fink officials argued that they had not received the special consideration usually given to local companies, and urged the city to reopen the process. The city refused.
"It had become so tense that I decided to intervene," Mr. Washington said. "The people at Fink thought that no one in government cared about them because they only provided 400 jobs."
The baking industry pays salaries of $200 million in New York City, which has 40 percent of all bakery employment in the state, according to the Empire State Development Corporation. New York State, once the center of the industry, now ranks second to California in production of bread and other bakery products, except cookies and crackers. Outside the city, which has 75 major bakeries, the industry is concentrated on Long Island (home of Entenmann's), around Buffalo (home to Lender's bagels) and around Albany (home to Freihofer's).
For years, Queens held the title of the baking borough because of its brand-name products like Silvercup and Taystee Bread. In a highly publicized shutdown, Taystee, once the largest bakery in the nation, closed even as the city offered financial assistance. Silvercup shut down in 1975. Bread shipped in from out of state slowly killed off business at the company and it could not compete.
Brooklyn now has the largest percentage of the city's licensed bakers, about 40 percent, according to the study by the Manhattan Borough President's office and Fink. Smaller bakeries struggling to survive have moved to Brooklyn neighborhoods like Brighton Beach, where they serve specialized products to growing numbers of Russian immigrants and the East Indian population in East Flatbush.
Interstate Bakeries produces more than 2 million pounds of bread a week, including Wonder Bread and Beefsteak Rye. Hostess Snack Cake products are also distributed from the plant in South Jamaica, a mostly minority neighborhood that is being revitalized after long being considered a symbol of urban neglect. The expansion will retain a $12 million payroll in the community, and add $2.5 million. The area is a State Economic Development Zone, intended to help distressed communities by giving tax breaks to businesses, in Interstate's case $2 million.
James Ragin, 56, of Harlem, has worked for Wonder Bread since 1965, starting out as a machine operator bagging bread and moving on to a receiving clerk, organizing bulky bags of buck flour, soybean oil and other ingredients.
"Technology has made a big change," Mr. Ragin said. "It was good and bad in a way as far as manpower. Two men used to do the job that now only one does."
Signs of a changing industry can be seen throughout Interstate's clamorous four-story plant in Jamaica: wall-to-wall barrel mixers, ovens as large as an average living room that can bake scores of loaves, and conveyor belts lined with loaves that are automatically thrust into bags and sealed.
A wave of nostalgia swept over William Shroba, 61, on Tuesday as he stood in the garage, which is to be converted as part of the $8 million expansion into the production center for hamburger and hot dog buns. Loaves of bread, cupcakes and pies surrounded the podium, where speakers praised Interstate Bakeries for staying in the city.
"In the 1950's and 1960's, there used to be five bakeries in a 10-mile area," said Mr. Shroba, a truck driver for the company. "I started out in this business when I was 18, and something about it just grows on you. I don't know if it's the aroma or the thrill of knowing that you watched it come off the racks and loaded into the truck for delivery, but it's something about it that I just love."
Mr. Sullivan, the chairman, made a pledge of sorts. "This industry has changed a lot in the 14 years that I've been involved," he said, "but we intend to survive and we're not going to become a Home Depot."

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Brokers are reporting a surge in demand for midpriced apartments in Manhattan.

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
WHILE the biggest, most desirable prewar apartments on Fifth and Park Avenues have been rising in price for more than a year, real estate brokers in Manhattan are now reporting a surge in sales of midpriced apartments elsewhere.
Bidding wars, multiple offers to buy at the full price and sealed bids have not been seen in this market since the late 1980's. While such interest is not the norm, agents say it is definitely on the upswing. 
 "It's Economics 101: supply and demand, and the inventory has shrunk," said JoAnne Kennedy, president of Hunt-Kennedy's East Side office. "Nobody is saying the market has reached the peaks of 1988, 1989 -- the press shouldn't say that, because sellers will start overpricing and the market will slow down again -- but the good brokers are looking at the last sale of a similar apartment and adding 10 to 15 percent" to the asking price.
Faced with a rise in multiple offers and bidding wars, the Real Estate Board of New York approved procedures for multiple-bid situations last month, according to Deborah Beck, vice president of the realtors group. The new procedures require that the exclusive agent tell the seller of all offers and recommend that the seller inform any other co-brokers that there are other offers. "The dollar amount of competing bids need not be disclosed to the co-brokers," the procedures state.
"This isn't just happening in the million-dollar apartments," Ms. Beck said. "It is particularly evident in the $350,000 to $800,000 level."
Ms. Kennedy said the mid-market "racheted up since Jan. 1." Postwar one- and two-bedroom apartments with ordinary layouts and nonspectacular views are the exception, and are still trading at relatively low figures, Ms. Kennedy said. Dark apartments, even if they are prewar, are another exception, other brokers say, adding that studios and one-bedrooms, while doing much better than they were a couple of years ago, are still not an easy sale.
Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group, said brokers were concerned that in a rising market, they were making pricing mistakes.
One such mistake was the price on a medium-sized two-bedroom, two-bath apartment on East 79th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
A floor plan shows a 12-by-22-foot living room, a 12-by-16 master bedroom, a 9-by-11 second bedroom sandwiched between the living room, kitchen and dining alcove, and one main exposure. The building has a doorman, and the apartment had been restored. The maintenance was $1,037, with 75 percent financing.
The sales agent, Constance Fahey, thought it would sell for about $290,000; she priced it at $325,000.
The apartment went on sale on a Thursday. By Friday afternoon, there were two full-price offers. Another customer was ready to bid and later placed a full-priced offer.
Ms. Fahey had advertised an open house for Sunday, so she asked the seller if she wanted to accept one of the offers or wait for the open house. The seller chose to wait.
"A year ago, we might have gotten 10 or 12 people to show up at the open house," the agent said. "We got 60."
And five more full-price offers.
At that point, the seller invited the eight bidders to make their highest and final offer, and to enclose a letter about themselves and whether the transaction would be all-cash.
By Monday night, two bidders had dropped out. Of the six remaining, three were all-cash bids: $359,000, $360,000 and $360,132.

HEADLINE: The Republican Doldrums

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
Whatever its outcome, the South Carolina Republican primary leaves a visitor with the powerful image of a political party treading water. This condition is, presumably, reversible before the August convention in San Diego. But between the Iowa primary and South Carolina's, the four major candidates have failed to give their prepackaged platforms the sort of programmatic jolt that might make one or the other a credible alternative to Bill Clinton. Maybe that is why a different G.O.P. winner pops up in each primary.
There is, of course, Pat Buchanan, who surely offers a clear alternative to Mr. Clinton, not to mention his discomfited Republican competitors. But whether he is a credible alternative is another matter. Even in the very state where he helped Richard Nixon launch his Southern strategy, Mr. Buchanan seems stuck with the same 25 to 30 percent of the Republican vote that has been his all along. The base he has built with his forceful defense of bedrock family values and economic nationalism may have reached its limits. 
 The other three seem just as stuck, which accounts for the impression of four guys going backward, taking their party with them. Given a chance to strut new stuff in a one-hour debate yesterday, they produced a few testy exchanges but not one new idea. There was Steve Forbes with his flat tax, Lamar Alexander with a domestic agenda that seems to require the devolution of every known Federal program to the states, Mr. Buchanan with his customary prescriptions on trade and abortion, and Mr. Dole with a promise of better management and an avuncular plea to his colleagues to focus on the task at hand, beating Bill Clinton.
Mr. Dole is most in need of fresh energy and ideas. He is sometimes indecisive, as on the abortion issue yesterday, and he is neither an innovator nor an orator. Take the way he and Mr. Buchanan chose to dramatize the jobs issue. This campaign is about many things -- class, cultural values, leadership style -- but here, as in New Hampshire, it is also about economic fears and hopes. With that in mind, Mr. Buchanan delivered his economic message in a driving rainstorm in front of the Clearwater Finishing Company, a sad, shuttered brick hulk that once provided 1,000 jobs for local textile workers.
Never mind that Richard Gephardt had stood before the same textile plant, preaching protectionism in his failed effort to win the Democratic nomination in 1988. Never mind the little irony that Bob Dole himself unsuccessfully played the protectionist card here against George Bush the same year. This is Pat Buchanan's issue now and he is addressing it with verve, railing against corporate downsizers who have jilted the American worker for cheaper labor abroad.
Mr. Dole, painfully slow in New Hampshire to grasp the potential of Mr. Buchanan's argument, seemed determined to do better here. He made his pitch at a gleaming, humming, high-tech BMW plant that has created 2,000 new jobs in less than three years. But it was not much of a pitch. Surrounded by his handlers of the moment -- including Phil Gramm and Carroll Campbell, the former Governor who did much to bring foreign business like BMW into the state -- Mr. Dole managed a few comments about the dangers of building a tariff wall around America. These comments, inaudible to bystanders, were clearly designed for the evening news -- which paid absolutely no attention.
To anyone who covered campaigns in the 60's and 70's, it was clear that the sound-bite revolution had taken its toll. The situation begged for a fuller response. It is hard to imagine that a Richard Nixon or a Hubert Humphrey or a Bill Clinton would have passed up the opportunity to deliver a weighty, coherent speech containing sympathy for the dispossessed but pointing out the downside of Mr. Buchanan's ideas -- the loss of high-paying export jobs, for example, or the fact that Mr. Buchanan's working-class supporters would end up paying higher prices for shoes and VCR's.
A speech like that would certainly set Mr. Dole's agenda apart from the simplicities offered by Mr. Forbes and Mr. Alexander. It would also be a welcome antidote to Mr. Buchanan's entertaining but unexamined bombast. ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

Blue-Chip Losing Streak Extended on Debt Worries
Blue-chip stocks extended their losing streak into a fourth session as traders reacted to testimony by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that the United States could default on its debt by March 21 unless Congress raised the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 20.59 points to end at 5,485.62, bringing its four-day loss to 146 points. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 7.50, to 1,100.05. [Page D6.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed as traders reacted to mixed signals from economic news and Fed officials. [D13.]
 
Farm Program Overhaul Is Voted
The House voted to overhaul American farm programs. The $46 billion measure would end 1930's policies that pay farmers not to plant certain crops and replace many subsidies with fixed payments that would end after seven years. The Senate approved a similar, but slightly more costly bill earlier, and a compromise is expected. [A1.]
 
TV Industry Pledges Ratings
President Clinton summoned 30 entertainment industry leaders to the White House and was rewarded with an industry pledge for a voluntary TV ratings system by next January. Leaders of both political parties have harped on the need for keeping children from viewing shows with too much violence or sex. [A1.]
 
Bosch to Buy Allied Signal Unit
In a $1.5 billion cash deal, Allied Signal Inc. agreed to sell its money-losing light-vehicle hydraulic and anti-lock brake business to Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. of Germany. [D2.]
 
Nippon Telephone Breakup Asked
In Japan, noted for high telephone rates and over-regulation, a Government advisory committee called for the breakup of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the world's largest telephone company, into one long-distance provider and two local phone companies. But the proposal faces formidable obstacles. [D3.]
 
A Dramatic Leap in Sending Data
Making a dramatic leap in speed, three separate research groups have transmitted information at a rate of 1 trillion bits a second by optical fiber -- that is equal to transmitting 300 years' worth of daily newspapers in a single second. The groups were Fujitsu Ltd., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and a team from AT&T Research and Bell Laboratories Lucent Technologies. [D2.]
 
Mobil and B.P. in European Deal
Mobil and British Petroleum plan to combine their refining and marketing of fuels and lubricants in Europe, creating a huge new market force and saving $400 million to $500 million a year, in about three years. [D3.]
 
Teledyne Rejects Sweetened Bid
Teledyne rejected a sweetened $1.78 billion bid from WHX, contending it was "worth far more than $32 a share." WHX had increased its offer to that level from an original $30. [D4.]
 
Stroh Brewery to Buy G. Heileman Brewing
Stroh Brewery announced a complex deal to buy the G. Heileman Brewing Company for some $275 million to $300 million. The deal would put Stroh, the nation's fourth-largest brewery, close to third-ranked Adolph Coors. Its 10.1 percent market share is dwarfed by Anheuser-Busch's 44 percent and Miller Brewing's 22.6 percent. [D2.]
 
Trader Settles S.E.C. Changes
A former Bankers Trust trader agreed to pay $50,000 to settle S.E.C. charges that he misled Gibson Greetings on the value of derivatives it bought. The trader, Mitchell A. Vazquez of Greenwich, Conn., also consented to a four-year ban from the securities industry. [D4.]
 
Arrests in Computer Chip Raid
In a sweeping raid that involved more than 500 police and Federal officers, dozens of suspected thieves of computer components have been arrested in Silicon Valley. [A10.]
 
WMX to Buy Brooklyn Company
WMX Technologies' Waste Management unit, the nation's biggest recycling company, agreed to buy Resource N.E. of Brooklyn, one of New York City's largest recycling and trash-collection companies for $200 million. New York is known as a tough market. [B5.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEBATE;
As Rivals Take the Stage, Sniping Abounds

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 29

 BODY:
The four major Republican Presidential contenders competed today to deliver the starkest appeals to Southern conservatives in a fast-paced debate that was marked by testy exchanges.
And in a new format, the contenders were asked to critique their rivals' television commercials and defend their own, an exercise that led the candidates to dispense with any pretense of Southern civility as they interrupted and shouted over one another. 
 Senator Bob Dole, who leads in the most recent polls in this state, followed by Patrick J. Buchanan, sharply cut off Steve Forbes after he and the others ridiculed him for supporting tax increases. "Don't malign my integrity here," Mr. Dole snapped, noting that he fought for President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts.
"Well," Mr. Forbes shot back, "it's a typical Washington game."
With no clear national front-runner, the hourlong noontime debate before an audience of business executives, televised nationally this evening by CNN and C-Span, often degenerated into a game of revolving targets. It was perhaps the candidates' best opportunity to score points with South Carolina voters -- from defending the Confederate flag to excluding women from the all-male Citadel Academy -- before this state's crucial primary on Saturday.
Seeking to stand out as the most outspoken firebrand on the stage, Mr. Buchanan, a former commentator, asserted that flying the Confederate flag over the statehouse was a symbol of defiance and courage, not racism. "My friends, if there is room in America for the fighting song of the civil rights movement, 'We Shall Overcome,' then there's got to be room for 'Dixie' as well." He also said, "It didn't fly over slave quarters -- it flew over battlefields."
The others did not touch the question, saying it was a matter for individual states to decide. But they all took issue with President Clinton and argued that the all-male Citadel should not have been forced to admit a woman.
A striking undercurrent that surfaced repeatedly was how resentful Mr. Forbes's opponents have become over how the publishing magnate, who entered the race late, has altered the campaign with his millions of dollars in advertising.
In one of the most bitter clashes, Lamar Alexander criticized Mr. Forbes for asserting in a commercial that the former Tennessee Governor grew rich by using his political connections.
"Steve, you haven't learned a single thing in your whole campaign -- you know that's not true," Mr. Alexander said. He told Mr. Forbes, "You should be ashamed of yourself -- smearing me, smearing the other candidates."
Mr. Forbes replied that "that was a charitable ad -- that ad did not talk about some of those cozy business deals you did as Governor."
"You just wait a minute," Mr. Alexander said, shouting, and pointing at Mr. Forbes. "My ethics have never been questioned." He told Mr. Forbes that "you should go practice your dirty business on a race for the school board before you try for the Presidency of the United States of America."
Mr. Dole intervened, declaring, "Time out! Time out!"
The Senator, in perhaps his feistiest debate performance this year, was also barely able to contain his bitterness at Mr. Forbes. At the start of the event, Mr. Dole gave him the title, "King of negative advertising." The comment only encouraged Mr. Alexander, who piped in, "If Steve is the King, Senator Dole is the Prince."
Between his attacks on his rivals, Mr. Dole tried to play the role of leader, and sought to turn the attention to defeating President Clinton in November.
"I don't know what these other guys are running for," he said. "I want to be President of the United States. I don't want an ad agency, never wanted an ad agency. I don't run a magazine. But I do know how to make Congress work. I know how to reach out to people. I know what the country needs. That's strong leadership. We need to defeat Bill Clinton."
But Mr. Dole's rivals did not spare him, noting that he too was responsible for many negative commercials. Mr. Buchanan said the Senator's commercials attacking him revealed the "hollowness of your campaign."
Mr. Alexander sought to sugar-coat his attacks on the Senator by calling him "one of our finest public servants."
That prompted Mr. Dole to interject, "You keep saying that, but then you have a little hooker in the end there."
Mr. Alexander then said, "Why don't you tell us where you want to take the country instead of calling Pat Buchanan names and distorting my record? While I was keeping taxes low, you raised taxes."
"Amen to Alexander," Mr. Buchanan said.
Mr. Dole then turned to Mr. Forbes, "Steve, you've got to defend me -- someone has to defend me," he said, a plea that brought chuckles from the audience.
But Mr. Forbes only joined in the attack, saying with a smile, "Well, Senator, you've been on the public payroll for 35 years; if you can't defend yourself now, I can't help you."
The debate, sponsored by the South Carolina Business & Industry Political Education Commmittee, moved quicker than others this year, possibly because the format called for succinct answers and because only the top four finishers in the New Hamphire primary were allowed to take part. That led Alan Keyes, one of the long-shot contenders, to protest by staging a hunger strike.
Mr. Buchanan, who was a prominent target at a debate last week in Arizona, today drew less attention, perhaps because his campaign suffered a setback in the voting there. For that reason, and because Mr. Buchanan's barebones campaign has spent far less on advertising than the others, he had more opportunity to press his conservative themes. He promised not to pick a running mate who supported abortion rights, saying the 34 million abortions we've had in this country is the greatest atrocity and travesty and horror in our country's history."
And Mr. Buchanan emphasized his protectionist trade position, saying that 300,000 American jobs have been lost because of trade policies that were "a metastasizing cancer in the belly of America."
But Mr. Alexander accused Mr. Buchanan of being all show, and of supporting a trade policy that would damage this state's economy, which is now more dependent on foreign investment. "You're good at what the problem is," he said, "but you don't have one single solution."
Responding to the only question on foreign policy, the candidates all portrayed themselves as tougher on Cuba than Mr. Clinton, but stopped short of sending American forces there to retaliate for the downing of two private planes.
"If they try to shoot down civilian planes again, they should be put on notice that we are going to shoot them down," Mr. Forbes said. "We should put them on notice right now. They go up, they get shot down."

HEADLINE: A Fighter For Rights Is Treated For Cancer

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

 BODY:
His voice was raspy and tired, but Kwame Toure, better known to most Americans as Stokely Carmichael, answered the phone from his hospital bed with the phrase he had used for over 20 years: "Ready for the revolution."
Kwame Toure (pronounced KWAH-may TOO-ray), 54, the fiery civil rights leader who coined the slogan "black power," was released from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday, where he had been undergoing tests since Feb. 8. 
 Later, at a news conference at a friend's Harlem home, Mr. Toure's doctors said he had prostate cancer.
"We expect him to do quite well," Dr. Barbara Justice, Mr. Toure's physician, said, adding that he had had radiation treatments during his hospital stay.
Mr. Toure was in New York to help recruit for the Washington-based All-African People's Revolutionary Party when he complained of pain in the right leg. He has been living in Guinea in West Africa since 1969, but word of his illness has brought hundreds of calls from old civil rights hands.
"It's a gathering of the clan," said Judy Richardson, who visited from Washington and had worked with Mr. Toure in Mississippi and Alabama when both were members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the early 60's. Known as Snick, the organization sent hundreds of Northern whites and blacks to do the dangerous and difficult work of registering disenfranchised blacks in the South.
Now, friends from that time are coming together to help Mr. Toure raise money to pay for his medical expenses. William Hall, a friend of Mr. Toure's from the early days, said yesterday that they had started the Medical Fund for Kwame Toure and set up a post office box so friends could write (Bowling Green Station, P.O. Box 386, New York, N.Y. 10074-0301).
Among those who phoned Mr. Toure during his hospital stay were Florence Tate, once an S.N.C.C. liaison; Charles Cobb, a National Geographic writer who went South as a 17-year-old; Robert Moses, now head of the Algebra Project, a program to teach science and math in urban schools; Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington and his former Deputy Mayor, Ivanhoe Donaldson, and Courtland Cox, the director of the Civil Rights Office at the Department of Commerce. Ruth Chambers, an S.N.C.C. veteran who is now a teacher and potter, came from Washington.
A staff member for Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a moderate who headed S.N.C.C. before Mr. Toure did, said he planned to call to wish Mr. Toure well, but there was no indication whether an old schism had been healed. Mr. Lewis had favored integration in the civil-rights movement, while Mr. Toure had taken a stance of self-determination that some believed was anti-white.
Miriam Makeba, the South African singer who was once married to Mr. Toure, also telephoned to inquire about his health, as did his estranged second wife, Marlyatou, a Guinean physician by whom he has a son, Boca Biro, 14.
Yesterday's gathering seemed in many ways a 60's reception. Soft bossa nova played in the background and incense filled the air. Many guests dressed in African garb. Mr. Toure's lean frame was swathed in a flowing white boubou, his shoulders covered in a black jacket. He did not speak to the press at the gathering, and had declined an interview from his hospital bed.
Mr. Toure, whose college degree was in philosophy, has spent much of his life in what he once described as perpetual movement, traveling to African countries, Europe, the United States and the Caribbean, making speeches on Pan-Africanism and third-world solidarity.
Friends say Mr. Toure remains committed to the idea that blacks must work with blacks for their cultural, economic and political liberation. They say he continues to see Africa as a unifying force for blacks around the world despite divisions there.
"He was talking about Pan-Africanism back in the 60's," Mr. Cox said. "Now we call ourselves African-Americans, but he had started that discussion of trying to make sure that African-Americans had a sense of Africa and of their being a party of a total community even then."
Mr. Cox, who organized the seventh Pan African Conference a few years ago, said Mr. Toure had asked him to think about organizing another conference later this year.
"He hasn't mellowed," Mr. Cox said. "He has a tremendous intelligence, commitment and sense of adventure. At the Organization of African Unity, he's given the kind of respect that is due him as a person articulating the Pan-African view. No, he hasn't mellowed at all."
For those, like Ms. Richardson, who came of age during the 1960's civil rights movement, Mr. Toure epitomized the liberation struggle and its evolution from integrationist tactics to self-sufficiency.
Mr. Toure, who was born in Trinidad, was raised in the Bronx. His radicalization came slowly, starting after he graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1960. As a student at Howard University in Washington, he brought Malcolm X, with his black separatist message, to campus to debate Bayard Rustin, the socialist who espoused integration.
Fresh out of Howard in 1964, Mr. Toure joined S.N.C.C. and injected a note of militant impatience into the struggle to overturn legal segregation in the South.
He emerged as a dynamic leader. As an organizer in Lowndes County, Miss., Mr. Toure helped raise the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600, 300 more than the number of white voters. Disappointed in the Democratic and Republican responses to black demands, he organized the all-black Lowndes County Freedom Organization, taking as its symbol the black panther. The logo was later adopted by the Black Panther Party.
Increasingly, by the late 1960's, Mr. Toure embraced the philosophy that all black people worldwide should work together for their own liberation without white help.
Friends say Mr. Toure's adherence to his ideals is one reason for the outpouring of affection.
"That's why a lot of people are coming together around him," said Mr. Richardson, who now works for Blackside, a black film company that produced "Eyes on the Prize," the public television series about the civil rights movement.
While not speaking during the news conference yesterday, Mr. Toure did say one thing afterward to a reporter.
"I know," he said, "that my people love me."

HEADLINE: U.S. Fixation on Castro May Do Us No Good

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the crisis over Cuba's downing of two private planes from Florida, too many judgments on United States official responses have been shaped by their impact on the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and not on their impact on the United States. 
 Many Cuban-Americans want vengeance on Mr. Castro, his overthrow and influence in any successor regime. Given Cuba's history, that is understandable. But a Castro-based approach is not an appropriate basis for United States policy.
Most Americans know and care little about Cuba. They believe that Mr. Castro has been in office too long, but they are unwilling to pay a big price to see him gone. Their agenda is not the agenda of many Cuban-Americans.
The main United States national interest in Cuba is a negative: that the United States not be drawn into any violent military conflict in Cuba.
If civil war were to break out in Cuba, the pressures for United States intervention would be greater than in Grenada, Panama or Haiti. The costs in blood and money would be large, and occupation would be a morass. The political price abroad would be great.
The United States has had economic interests in Cuba. Some United States traders want to trade, and investors want to invest. Cultural exchange interests should not be ignored, either. The debate on Cuban policy needs to be recast. Let's think first of what's good for the United States, not what's bad for Mr. Castro.

HEADLINE: Don't Build Rural Prisons for Urban Criminals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Feb. 26 news article on rural New York communities that are clamoring for new prisons: 
 Although African-Americans and Hispanic Americans make up less than 25 percent of New York State's population, they represent 83 percent of the inmates confined in the state's prisons. Seventy percent of those incarcerated in the state's correctional institutions come from New York City.
A distressing blend of politics and economics has developed. Upstate, mainly Republican officials press for harsher sentencing laws and expensive prison construction not because such measures will prevent crime, but because they translate into a job development strategy for rural and predominantly white communities. Low-income minority inmates provide the flesh-and-blood grist for this legislative pork-barreling.
Serious problems result. Prisoners have difficulty maintaining family ties -- an important ingredient in an inmate's ability to cope with the prison experience or to make a crime-free adjustment upon release -- because their loved ones often cannot afford to visit a prison hundreds of miles from their homes. Clashes and racial tensions become inevitable between the white correction officers from small-town backgrounds and the black and brown prisoners from an urban environment.
Prison expansion has too many troublesome consequences for it to be practiced as an economic development program.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against the Yen On Outlook for Japanese Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen yesterday, bolstered by expectations that Japanese interest rates would remain low.
The dollar gained after the Bank of Japan released its quarterly survey of business sentiment known as the Tankan. The survey indicated that the economy was slowly improving. 
 "The Tankan totally wiped out the recent overblown market expectations for a policy change and restored rationale to market sentiment," said Yuji Shimanaka, a senior economist at the Sanwa Research Institute in Tokyo.
Those expectations had been fanned by Japanese financial officials who surprised the markets last month by saying an increase in interest rates should be considered.
The report "helped to give the dollar some upside," said Dave Glowacki, a senior trader at the NBD Bank in Detroit. "But I think the market was ready for something like that to jump on the dollar."
Indeed, the dollar's advance against the yen has been bolstered by repeated market interventions by the Bank of Japan in recent weeks. Traders estimated that the Japanese central bank had bought several billion dollars in the market to support the dollar against the yen.
The central bank released figures yesterday showing that its foreign reserves jumped $17 billion in February, although it declined to disclose how the money was acquired.
The United States stock and bond markets, which ended the day higher, were an additional source of strength for the dollar.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar settled at 105.41 yen, up from 105.25 on Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.4773 German marks from 1.4730 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5269 from $1.5315.
The dollar rose all week against the mark, partly because of expectations the German central bank would eventually lower interest rates, which would make German assets and currency less attractive to investors.
In addition, some European countries have been showing increased political stability, diminishing the mark's appeal as a safe-haven currency.
The Spanish peseta and the Italian lira in particular strengthened at the expense of the mark.

East Village Story

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In an age when almost every show-biz event is predigested and presold by the media long before the public can decide for itself, the truly spontaneous pop-culture phenomenon is almost extinct. Almost but not quite. Two weeks ago, at a 150-seat theater in the East Village, a rock opera called "Rent," written and performed by unknowns, came out of nowhere to earn the most ecstatic raves of any American musical in the two decades since "A Chorus Line." And now the world is rushing to catch up: "Rent" will quickly move to Broadway to accommodate the insatiable demand for tickets, even as Hollywood titans fight to bring it to the screen.
"Rent" is all the critics say it is. There's a moment that often comes early in thrilling musicals -- call it the "Something's Coming" moment, in honor of "West Side Story" -- when a performer steps forward, grabs the spotlight and demands what he wants from life, no matter the obstacles. In "Rent," which loosely transposes the story of "La Boheme" to Manhattan's present-day downtown bohemia, that moment arrives when a young, H.I.V.-positive punk rocker sings of how he lives only for "one song/ glory/ one song/ before I go." Such is the naked yearning of this anthem that it would induce chills even if you didn't know that its lyrics proved eerily prescient: Jonathan Larson, the 35-year-old author of "Rent," is dead. 
 The story of Mr. Larson's death on the eve of the triumph for which he had hungered all his life is unspeakably sad. He died suddenly and inexplicably of an aortic aneurysm a month ago, hours before his show's first performance. As Michael Greif, who directed "Rent," recalled in an interview punctuated by tears this week, Mr. Larson had sacrificed his life to his work, waiting on tables for years, sustaining himself with the "sunny belief" that his talent would one day lead to his breakthrough. "He wanted it bad," said Mr. Greif. "It's cruel that he's not here to enjoy it."
Yet the significance of "Rent," the phenomenon, derives not from its author's tragic death, or from what the show may say about the American theater, or from its superficial resemblances to "Hair." For all the talk about how "Rent" speaks for the cyber-AIDS-Doc-Martens Generation X of Alphabet City as "Hair" allegedly did for 60's flower children, Mr. Larson's songs are bigger than their milieu. Stephen Sondheim, who became the young songwriter's mentor, this week recalled how he "welled up" when he first heard Mr. Larson's work on a tape -- in part because it was "generous music," lovingly merging the musical theater traditions of past generations, including Mr. Sondheim's own, with rock.
The night I saw "Rent" at the New York Theater Workshop, few theatergoers in the house demographically matched the castoffs on stage. But neither did the audience seem like the desperately hip on a slumming expedition. People were riveted, as I was, by the raw exuberance of characters who keep fighting and creating and reaching out no matter how strong their fears -- whether of death in a plague or of marginalization in the ruthless new post-industrial economy that frightens many Americans on the lower rungs, not just those living on the edges of St. Mark's Place.
If anything, some of the turn-of-the-millennium fears given powerful voice by the dispossessed bohemians of "Rent" resemble those of what we now call Pat Buchanan voters. Brilliant artists and politicians do, after all, share the ability to divine and then articulate the unspoken hopes and fears of the society around them, moving audiences powerfully as they do so.
But Mr. Larson's artistry doesn't leave the audience angry, as Mr. Buchanan's demagoguery does. The songwriter takes the very people whom politicians now turn into scapegoats for our woes -- the multicultural, the multisexual, the homeless, the sick -- and, without sentimentalizing them or turning them into ideological symbols or victims, lets them revel in their joy, their capacity for love and, most important, their tenacity, all in a ceaseless outpouring of melody.
At so divisive a time in our country's culture, "Rent" shows signs of revealing a large, untapped appetite for something better. It's too early to tell. What is certain is that Jonathan Larson's brief life belies the size of his spirit. In the staying power of his songs, he lingers, refusing to let anyone who hears his voice abandon hope.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Surge on Purchasers' Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday after the nation's purchasing managers reported tough business conditions in February and investors saw yet another reason for the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates next month.
The 30-year bond rose by 110/32 , to a price of 956/32 to yield 6.36 percent, down from 6.46 percent on Thursday and its lowest yield in more than a week. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 45.2 in February from 44.2 in January, with any reading below 50 indicative of a soft manufacturing sector. Economists had forecast a rise to 48.3.
Analysts said the data showed that the economy was still contracting in February although at a lesser extent than in January. Strong new orders and deliveries ran counter to the overall index.
Another survey, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for February, was reported at 88.5, down from 89.3 in January, and that also helped the market.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors of Columbus, Ohio, said the market got an early lift from overseas buying that was inspired by an article in the latest issue of Business Week; it argues that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, is leaning in the direction of another easing, possibly as early as the March 26 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
"In a strange way," Mr. Chan said, "I believe that one can easily argue that the recent rise in rates does present Mr. Greenspan with an opportunity to ease sooner rather than later because the higher rates recently observed may have dampened the growth outlook for the U.S. economy somewhat."
Mr. Chan said a bullish signal was emitted by the Commodity Research Bureau's index of prices, long considered to be an important minute-to-minute gauge of future inflationary trends. "Although our work questions the reliability of this index as a good long-term barometer of inflation," he said, "market participants love to watch it, and even I had a hard time ignoring the steep 4.05- point decline at midday."
By the close of the market the index had fallen steeply to 244.46, down 4.31 points.
Looking ahead, Mr. Chan said market participants would be concentrating on next week's employment report for February. The nonfarm payrolls, scheduled on Friday, come after January's 201,000 drop amid Government shutdowns and the East Coast blizzard. Virtually all economic indicators over the last two months have been clouded by some aberration.
"Since most market forecasts are incorporating a 150,000 to 200,000 recovery in jobs due to the effects of weather, along with a 75,000 to 150,000 jump due to regular factors, it seems as though almost no employment number will be able to faze the market," Mr. Chan said.
Thomas W. Synnott 3d, chief economist at the United States Trust Company of New York, pointed to the extensive price gains already realized in the market. "The point I would make is that we had a unique combination of circumstances in late fall that powered this extremely strong rally in bonds prices," he said.
He cited reports that the Bank of Japan apparently decided not to permit the yen to decline beyond a certain point against the dollar to prevent deflation in the Japanese economy. "As the market realized that the Bank of Japan in effect was stabilizing the dollar, it created a one-way street for interest rate arbitrage," Mr. Synnott said. And then with strong hopes for a balanced budget agreement in the United States, people were encouraged to buy longer maturities, he said. "The budget agreement we know has not happened, and arbitrage positions are unwinding and the market is back to feeding on itself," he added.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Sluggish Industrial Activity

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing sector slowed for the seventh consecutive month in February, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday, although the rate of decline was down slightly from January.
The survey of purchasing managers at major manufacturing companies showed slight growth in the overall economy last month, the association said, reversing the contraction in January. 
 "Purchasing executives' comments in February on current business conditions continued the pattern of recent months by being more negative than positive," said Ralph G. Kauffman, head of the association's Business Survey Committee.
The association's index of manufacturing activity rose to 45.2 in February from 44.2 in January. Even with that rise, the index remained below 50, which is considered an indication of contraction in the overall economy. A reading above 50 is taken as an indication of expansion.
"This report suggests that the rebound from the blizzards in January is tepid," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities.
The manufacturing sector contracted for the seventh consecutive month in February, with production, new orders, order backlogs and employment all indicating decreased activity. But new orders and order backlogs decreased at slower rates than in January.
"I think basically the purchasing managers are telling us that the factory sector is experiencing what the Fed called very uneven business conditions," said David Munro, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
In February, 27 percent of the companies polled reported lower levels of new orders, compared with 32 percent in January. At the same time, fewer members reported diminished order backlogs in February, with the association's index of backlog orders rising to 43.5 percent, the highest level since September 1995, when it was also at 43.5 percent.
In a sign that inflationary pressures remain moderate, the association said only 9 percent of purchasing executives reported paying higher prices, the lowest percentage since an identical number was recorded in November 1992.
And the inventories index fell to 43.9 percent in February from 47.7 percent in January, indicating that inventory reduction is being pursued more vigorously.
The report is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of purchasing executives in more than 300 companies.

HEADLINE: A Bad Bill on Cuba

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has done many things right and one thing terribly wrong in response to Cuba's shootdown of two unarmed planes flown by Miami-based exiles.
Providing a Coast Guard escort to accompany an exile flotilla to the site of the downing today registers American determination to protect the security of international waters and airspace. Equally important, it minimizes the risk of either the exiles' or Havana's provoking a new incident. The Administration's decision earlier this week to suspend charter flights to Cuba and to impose travel restrictions on Cuban diplomats in this country made clear that Havana had attacked not just anti-Castro activists but international law itself. 
 However, the Administration is about to make a huge mistake by signing into law a bill, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan Burton, that aims to coerce other countries into joining the American embargo of Cuba. By dropping his opposition to the bill, Mr. Clinton junks his own balanced policy for encouraging democracy in Cuba and signs on to an approach that will inevitably slow the opening of Cuban society and pick a pointless quarrel with American allies.
The bill threatens foreign companies with lawsuits and their executives with exclusion from American soil if they use any property in Cuba ever confiscated from anyone who is now a United States citizen. Some of its provisions appear to violate international law and trade treaties, and the Administration had been saying since last summer that it would veto the measure unless these provisions were removed.
The United States is the only country that maintains an economic embargo against Cuba, an outdated policy that has failed in 35 years to topple the Castro Government. Trying to coerce other countries to join the embargo is offensive to American allies and unlikely to succeed.
Backers of the Helms-Burton bill believe the Cuban economy has been so enfeebled by the loss of subsidized Soviet trade that the Castro regime can be brought down with one final shove. But Cuba's economy, though hurting, has already revived from the depths of the early 1990's. Its recovery has been built on austerity, limited reforms and new trade relationships with the rest of the world. It is unrealistic to think that a reinforced American embargo would bring Mr. Castro down.
What Havana really worries about is the resurgence of opposition in Cuba itself. Opposition groups have been invigorated by Cuba's widened contacts with the outside world. They are also encouraged by a more supportive attitude on the part of Miami-based exile organizations. These used to view all Cubans who remained on the island, even opposition activists, with suspicion. Now groups like Brothers to the Rescue, the organization whose planes were shot down last week, see opposition groups on the island as a key to political change.
The Castro regime is alarmed by this potential link between domestic opponents and outside support groups, heralded by Brothers to the Rescue's previous airborne leafletting of Havana. Indeed, Havana's concern over this prospect may have been a factor in last week's missile attack against the exiles' planes. Washington should be doing everything it can to promote opposition within Cuba by encouraging more human interchange between the island and the outside world, not less.
The Helms-Burton Act is not an appropriate response to Cuba's murderous deed. It is a wholesale policy reversal that weakens America's ability to encourage democracy in Cuba. Mr. Clinton should return to his original sound position.

HEADLINE: No Caps on Damages for Railroads

 BODY:
The recent rash of train accidents makes this a most inappropriate time for Congress to set limits on the damages railroads must pay to victims of proven negligence. Yet the Senate will soon consider a bill that may include caps on punitive damages, and the House has already approved a measure capping both "pain and suffering" and punitive damage awards. Congress should eliminate these damages provisions before passing the broader Amtrak bill of which they are a part.
Private damage lawsuits give teeth to laws and regulations by compensating those injured by safety lapses and punishing organizations whose negligence caused an accident. How well the protective regulations work is the subject of Senate Commerce Committee hearings into several crashes and derailments, including collisions in New Jersey and Maryland that killed 14 passengers. Senators will also be investigating the effectiveness of agencies like the Federal Railroad Administration. 
 That makes it untimely to enact the House-passed caps on damages above compensation for medical expenses. The House would limit awards for pain and suffering, including such non-economic factors as disfigurement, to $250,000. It would also limit punitive damages, designed to punish gross negligence, to $250,000 or three times the proven economic damages, whichever is greater.
Those ceilings are similar to limits in "tort reform" legislation that has passed both chambers in different forms and has not been moved to a Senate-House conference. Lobbyists for corporations, insurers and other commercial concerns seek relief from litigation on the grounds that lawsuits stifle commerce and industrial progress.
But injured consumers also have rights that need protecting, including financial relief from the consequences of accidents involving faulty products. Those issues demand much more public debate than Congress has given them.
Amtrak needs Congressional reauthorization to help secure its future. The House measure contains a reasonable plan to phase out Federal subsidies by 2002, but Amtrak will then need alternative financing. The Senate is considering a permanent endowment for capital spending. Unfortunately, to move this bill, senators have agreed to sidetrack a meritorious proposal to give Amtrak an annual half-cent per gallon out of the Federal gas tax -- a proposal vigorously resisted by highway and mass commuter transit interests.
It is of paramount importance to find a way to sustain Amtrak. Congress should focus on that question and drop the mischievous idea of capping civil liability. Americans need a rail system that is not only financially secure but safe.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Unexpectedly Strong Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 1

 BODY:
Most auto makers reported strong February sales today, an early indication that the economy may be shrugging off a slow fourth quarter of 1995 and the effects of January's snowstorms.
The General Motors Corporation said sales of its cars and light trucks rose to 399,383 last month, up an unexpectedly large 5 percent from February 1995. The Chrysler Corporation sold 207,839 cars and trucks last month, 20 percent above the previous February. 
 Chrysler had been widely expected to post a bigger percentage jump in sales than G.M. because a much larger fraction of Chrysler's vehicles are mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, all of which are selling well at present. The Ford Motor Company is expected to announce its February sales results on Tuesday, and a company executive said its sales also appeared to have been strong.
Industry executives, car dealers and Wall Street analysts pointed to three reasons for the unexpectedly large rise in sales. Consumer confidence was up in February, suggesting that people became more willing to spend. East Coast car buyers who were snowed in during January returned to dealerships in force. And with the partial exception of General Motors, auto makers were offering hefty discounts, particularly on cars but also on some pickup trucks.
Robert A. Lutz, the president of Chrysler, said earlier this week that some of his company's strength "may have been due to the fact that we put some added incentives on." Chrysler sold more cars last month than it ever has in the month of February.
Auto sales figures are closely watched because they are the first statistics available on the economy's performance in the previous month. The numbers today were consistent with recent surveys showing that consumer confidence jumped sharply in February.
Wall Street was pleased with the results. "This is the kind of positive surprise that you like to see," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers. "We thought they would be up, but they're up more than we thought they'd be."
Mr. Phillippi said he was particularly impressed by General Motors' strong car sales because cars have been selling sluggishly, compared with trucks. General Motors' car sales rose 5 percent, as did the company's light-truck sales.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Chrysler's shares rose $1.125, closing at $57.50, while General Motors' shares jumped $1.375, to $52.625. Ford's shares gained 25 cents, to $31.50.
Mr. Phillippi said Chrysler would soon run short on inventory and might ask its employees to work more overtime this month as a result of the strong sales. If other auto makers follow suit -- General Motors might not because it already has very large inventories -- then the overtime pay could lead to greater spending by the workers and a small boost for the overall economy.
The auto makers reporting today had total sales of 880,707 vehicles last month, up 7.4 percent from the corresponding period last year. The percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate, because showrooms were open one more day last month than in February 1995.
The foreign-based auto makers posted mixed results today. The Honda Motor Company sold 63,357 vehicles in February, up 19.6 percent from the year before and a record for the month. Sales at the Nissan Motor Corporation rose 8.3 percent, to 57,662. But for the Toyota Motor Corporation, sales slipped eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 76,485. And the Mazda Motor Corporation reported a 20 percent decline, to 19,107.
Auto industry executives predicted at the beginning of the year that the industry would sell about 15 million cars, mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks this year, which would represent a fairly strong but not spectacular level of sales. Some doubt had crept into their predictions when sales slowed in January, but they were a little more optimistic today.
On Ford's outlook for the year, the vice president for finance, David N. McCammon, said he was encouraged by the preliminary figures he had seen as Ford prepares to report on Tuesday. "Just a couple days ago I was up to date; it was going O.K., consistent with 15 million or maybe slightly higher," he said.
Sales of pickup trucks and the Mercury Sable, both of which were recently redesigned, have been particularly good, he added.
Chrysler officials were cautiously upbeat today. "One month doesn't make a year, I guess, but it is definitely a good signal that there is underlying demand out there," said James P. Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing. "We are comfortable that we don't have a problem going into spring."
Spring is the most important selling season for the auto industry.
Auto dealers had mixed views, with some expressing worries. "It hasn't been the best of Februaries," said John Chapman Morris Jr., a Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Geo dealer in Fillmore, Calif. He said sales had been sluggish partly because G.M. had been slow in sending cars and trucks to his dealership.
But H. Gary Ackerman, a Ford and Porsche dealer in Las Vegas, Nev., said, "Our February was up about 15 percent over February a year ago."
Two models are selling particularly well, he said, the recently redesigned 1996 Ford Taurus and the 1997 F-150 pickup. "The new pickup truck is just a home run out of the ball park," Mr. Ackerman said. "They have a shelf life of about 24 hours."
John O. Stevenson, a North Carolina dealer with Acura, Honda, Mitsubishi, Jeep, Eagle, Hyundai, Suzuki and Nissan franchises, said sales of new cars slowed as used-car sales rose. "I think what we are seeing in buyers is obviously resistance to price," Mr. Stevenson said. The vehicles that sell well are those offering manufacturer's rebates, he said.
"If the manufacturers stay aggressive and don't think that this spring market is going to happen by itself, the spring market is going to be good," he added.

HEADLINE: Clinton Declares That Colombia Has Failed to Curb Drug Trade

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
President Clinton declared today that Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer, had failed to cooperate in the fight against illegal drugs, a determination that not only stigmatizes it but also makes the country ineligible for most American economic aid.
In the same finding, Mr. Clinton certified that Mexico, an important free-trade partner, was cooperating with international efforts to stop such narcotics trafficking, even though it has become a major conduit for illegal drugs smuggled into the United States. 
 The determinations were made under a law requiring the President to report each year which countries linked to narcotics are fighting the problem and which are not. The final decisions were made this morning after weeks of heated debate within the Administration over what to do about Colombia and Mexico.
Mexico's certification as cooperative drew immediate criticism from some members of Congress who charged that Mexico did not deserve exoneration because it has not done enough to staunch the flood of drugs through its territory. In this election year, the Clinton Administration has been particularly sensitive to charges that it has favored Mexico because of Mexico's special status as a neighbor and equal member in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and because Washington had arranged for $12.5 billion in loans to shore up Mexico's economy after the peso collapsed in late 1994.
This decision also dismayed law-enforcement agencies, which felt the Clinton Administration had rejected recommendations that Mexico at least be reprimanded because of Mexico's weak performance in combatting narcotics.
Colombia has arrested several important drug cartel members in the last year, but officials here point to evidence of widespread corruption in the Colombian Government and its failure to reduce its role as the leading producer of processed cocaine and a leading grower of coca leaf, opium and marijuana.
The Colombian Government angrily rejected the American action as unjust. In Bogota the Foreign Minister, Rodrigo Pardo, said, "We consider unacceptable this interference in our internal affairs."
The certifications coincided with the State Department's release today of its International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, a 598-page report on the state of narcotics around the world in 1995, with details about what more than 140 countries have done or failed to do about drugs. The United States, the world's foremost consumer of illegal drugs, is omitted.
Belize and Cambodia were added this year to a list of 31 countries identified as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries. Twenty-two of these, including Mexico, were certified today as working sufficiently to solve the problem.
But Colombia joined Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria on the list of countries judged to have failed to cooperate in the fight against narcotics.
Lebanon, Paraguay and Pakistan also failed certification but were only warned, under a provision that lets the President waive the penalties if he decides that doing so is in the "vital national interests" of the United States. Colombia received such a warning last year.
"Some countries may find the results hard to swallow," said Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, "but we believe we cannot solve problems without first being honest about them and identifying them."
By punishing Colombia, the Administration registered its displeasure with President Ernesto Samper, who is accused of knowingly taking millions in campaign contributions from the Cali cocaine cartel.
President Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, denied that the decertification was intended to force the Colombian President out of office. Mr. McCurry noted that "President Samper is under pressure already" from investigations at home.
But Mr. McCurry said President Clinton was aware that "this decision will likely have some impact on the public debate in Colombia."
The certification statement acknowledged that Colombia did make some progress last year, notably the capture or surrender of six of the seven leaders of the Cali drug syndicate, one of whom later escaped. It also praised the national police of Colombia for its ambitious cocaine crop eradication program. But it said that the Government had failed to make progress in other areas and had not increased the penalties for drug trafficking or taken steps to protect the confidentiality of information provided by the United States.
Colombia will not suffer immediate hardship even though its flourishing economy benefits in part from drug profits. Robert S. Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics, said that the United States assistance to Bogota consists almost entirely of counter-narcotics programs, which will continue if the Colombians want them.
But American business executives investing in Colombia will no longer qualify for credits from the Import-Export Bank or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The United States will also vote against any loans requested by Colombia from a half-dozen development banks, including the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, though this may not prevent such loans.
Mr. McCurry said the decertification of Colombia could affect up to $750 million to $1 billion in Export-Import Bank commitments and $50 million in loans and $540 million in insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
President Clinton also retains an option to apply trade sanctions, which could close United States markets to imports of coffee, flowers and other legitimate Colombian goods, Mr. Gelbard said.
As the first President to decertify Colombia, President Clinton scored points with Congress. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, had prepared legislation to override any waiver given Colombia this year.
His spokesman Marc Thiessen said Senator Helms was extremely pleased that President Clinton had sent "a strong message to Mr. Samper that his collusion with drug traffickers is unacceptable." If President Samper resigned, Senator Helms said, the government that replaced him in Colombia should be given a clean slate.
By contrast, Clinton Administration officials described President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico as honest and sincere in trying to curb his country's involvement in narcotics, despite evidence of a widening role of Mexico in the production and sale of drugs and corruption in Mexican law enforcement.
Mr. Gelbard said an important difference between Colombia and Mexico was that President Zedillo's Government was cooperating while President Samper's had tried to undermine efforts to stop narcotics. "The test of the law is whether there is cooperation on the part of the government," Mr. Gelbard said.
But Mexico's certification was criticized by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who said Mexico should have been given the same warning that Colombia received last year.
Mr. Thiessen said Senator Helms, too, felt "the Administration made a mistake" with Mexico and that he and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, would introduce a resolution in the Senate demanding that Mexico be decertified.
Administration officials denied today that the certification process was influenced by political considerations. "We look at what happens as a country either cooperates or fails to cooperate in the fight on drugs," Mr. McCurry said.
The State Department's report on international narcotics sometimes sounded implicitly more tolerant of Colombia and critical of Mexico than the President's certification implied. It said that "the two countries that have struggled the longest against the drug trade -- Mexico and Colombia -- are also those that have had to face the drug corruption that has crept into the uppermost reaches of Government."
The report described Mexico as "the principal transit route for cocaine entering the United States as well as a major source country for heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana." It also said that "drug traffickers used their vast wealth to corrupt police and judicial officials as well as project their influence into the political sector, as recent Mexican investigations have revealed."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Keeping Corporate Score;
In South Africa It's Even Hard to Find the Players

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
The South Afri can economy is Teddy Roosevelt's nightmare what America might look like if the trusts had never been busted, John D. Rockefeller had won the Standard Oil case and the unions still had to deal with Andrew Carnegie, the autocratic steel magnate.
Nearly 80 percent of private industry is controlled by five super-conglomerates. Cartels in some industries, like diamonds, operate openly. In staples like beer and sugar, one or two producers dominate the market and set prices. Goods that Americans take for granted, from steaks to new cars to televisions, are so expensive that the average South African cannot afford them. 
 The man who rails most loudly against all this is a former sugar-company executive who works out of his home in the Magaliesberg Mountains with an ostrich farm next door and leopards and baboons prowling past his yard. Ninety minutes away, in downtown Johannesburg, the fat book that Robin McGregor puts out each year, "Who Owns Whom," is the standard reference work on South African business.
It is dull reading, and the way he compiles it is prosaic. He buys one share in every company in southern Africa, collecting all the annual reports and poring over them. He also clips virtually every article in the nation's financial press.
With this information, he is able to pierce the ranks of dummy companies -- 450 at last count -- that rich South Africans erect to conceal what they own.
By his calculations, which are widely accepted, more than 75 percent of the capitalization represented on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is controlled by five corporations: the Anglo American Corporation; the South African National Life Assurance Company, or Sanlam; Rembrandt Group; the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society, or S.A. Mutual, and Liberty Group.
They often exercise that control through bewildering webs of cross-ownership that Mr. McGregor illustrates with charts he calls "organograms." In one common version, the owners of an enterprise will sell off 49 percent, form a holding company to take possession of the remaining 51 percent, sell 49 percent of the second holding company, then repeat the process several times.
If Mr. McGregor's prose can be heavy going, there is nothing dull about what he does with his information. He is a professional gadfly, attacking the evils that he sees stemming from concentrated ownership: price-fixing, excessive secrecy, stultifying bureaucracy, lackluster research, protectionist tariffs.
He is not popular in corporate board rooms. But President Nelson Mandela's Cabinet largely agrees with him. "There's the irony of the new South Africa," said Steve Rubenstein, the research director for Fergusson Brothers, Hall, Stewart & Company, a big South African brokerage firm. "McGregor was a crusader who made a career out of bashing big business, a small operator promoting his own product. Now he's a hero in the eyes of the African National Congress," the ruling party.
Ismail Lagardien, a spokesman for South Africa's Trade and Industry Ministry, calls Mr. McGregor "a constructive whistle-blower" and says "people ought to listen to him more often." The ministry has appointed Mr. McGregor to a panel to draft changes in corporate laws.
One of the changes Mr. McGregor favors -- full disclosure of stock ownership -- would essentially put him out of business. But he says it would be worth it to end the current obfuscation. As an example, he cites Sasol Ltd., a $5.7 billion corporation that turns the country's abundant coal into gasoline and petrochemicals. It was created by the former white-ruled regime in 1979 to outflank any attempt at an international oil embargo and was later sold to private interests.
Recently, it hired Mr. McGregor to find out who actually owns it. "I wrote 250 letters, one to every anonymous 'nominee company' that owned at least 10,000 shares," Mr. McGregor said. "Ten told me who the underlying owners were. About 20 said they wouldn't. The rest didn't bother to reply. It's bloody ridiculous -- the chief executive can't find out who owns his company. If an asset-stripper came in from Europe or America, he could slowly buy the company through nominees, and no one would know he's there."
Mr. McGregor denies harboring any bias against big business, and acknowledges its role in making South Africa a regional economic powerhouse. Instead, he calls himself "anti-concentration." That gives him plenty of leeway to attack South Africa's biggest company, the Anglo American Corporation, which oversees the world diamond cartel, mines much of the world's gold and generates 25 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Anglo American, controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, owns the De Beers and Minorco mining companies; First National, the country's biggest bank; Southern Life, one of the biggest insurers; numerous office parks, and at least one significant player in every sector of the economy. "Anglo is absolutely as much about control as it is about making a profit," Mr. McGregor said.
Like Standard Oil of old, Anglo's core -- mining holdings -- is vertically integrated. "They own their suppliers: steel, tools, explosives, even paint," he says. "Their subsidiaries have so little competition that they aren't efficient."
He argues that it would be far more profitable if it were broken up into smaller companies. "I've said this many times," he adds. "And when I do, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo's chairman, will say, 'Who is this bloody fool telling us what to do?' And of course, it is bloody arrogant of me. But the effect of all this concentration is that South Africa has built bureaucrats in the private sector. You look at the streets -- people go home at half-past 4 o'clock. There's no competitiveness. There aren't any entrepreneurs."
Michael Spicer, an executive director of Anglo American and a frequent spokesman for big business, says he is "absolutely, fundamentally, 100 percent in dispute" with Mr. McGregor's characterizations. He calls Anglo a "highly decentralized" company where tens of thousands of employees at a subsidiary might report to a mere dozen or so executives at the head office. He denies that Anglo's suppliers are uncompetitive and says he doubts that shareholders would be richer if the company was broken up as AT&T was in the United States in 1984.
Told that some American executives who have worked at Anglo subsidiaries say they find the central control stifling, he said, "Well, I beg to differ." He then trots out a favorite argument of defenders of the corporate status quo here: a country with an economy the size of Belgium's needs mega-corporations like his to compete in international markets.
Mr. McGregor counters by noting that two other conglomerates, Sanlam and S.A. Mutual, have shrunk their head offices and let presidents of subsidiaries operate independently. Their profitability rose, he said.
The son of a British Petroleum plant manager and a paralegal, the 66-year-old Mr. McGregor puts out his annual book himself, as his wife, Anne, and sons Andrew and Simon run McGregor Information Services, a 10-year-old on-line news service that combines the book's data base with information about the companies in it.
A warm man who likes to fix lunch for visitors, he laughs at the suggestion that his book, of which he sells 2,500 copies a year for $120 each, and his on-line service, which generates five times as much revenue, have made him rich, though he is probably on the way there.
If nothing else, he could be kept poor by feeding his three Great Danes. "They're the only ones big enough to hold their own against the leopards," Mrs. McGregor said.
For someone who espouses very American ideas like aggressive antitrust laws and wide-open disclosure rules for publicly traded companies, Mr. McGregor knows very little American business law or economic history.
He has never visited the United States. When first interviewed, he had never heard of 10k's, the annual reports that publicly traded companies in America must publish to relay key information to shareholders. Likewise, he was surprised to hear that executives of publicly traded American companies have to disclose their salaries, and he did not know that many of the biggest American oil companies, from Exxon to Chevron, were spun off from John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly in 1911.
Perhaps that is not surprising. Most white businessmen in South Africa were educated locally or in Britain. But there is a new wind blowing in Mr. Mandela's Government, with its large quotient of former political exiles. While some of those African National Congress leaders were studying military tactics with the Soviet Army, others were studying economics at Harvard.
Mr. McGregor's interest in piercing corporate veils began when he was managing a small sugar mill in South Africa's Natal province. The owners in London wanted to acquire some of the mill's 22 rivals. "So we went to local mills and said, 'Right, fellows, we want to buy you,' " he said. "They wouldn't tell us who owned them -- and I found it impossible to find out who did. I realized there was an interest in this kind of thing."
Later, a job running a fruit cooperative gave him a taste of monopolistic price-fixing. "I was negotiating for apple cartons with three suppliers," he said. "The quotes I got were the same down to the seventh decimal place. They didn't even try to disguise it."
While Messrs. McGregor and Spicer are of pointedly different minds about the nature of big business in South Africa, they do agree on one thing: the nation's economy will have to undergo a rapid restructuring to adapt to a new business environment that includes increased foreign investment and competition, the privatization of many state-run businesses and the gradual elimination of foreign-exchange controls.
"I think things will go the American way," Mr. McGregor said. "There will be antitrust laws, and the conglomerates will unbundle. There will be major changes."

HEADLINE: Bogota Leader Assails U.S. And May End Cooperation

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 1

 BODY:
In a televised address tonight, President Ernesto Samper called the United States decision to decertify Colombia as an ally in the fight against drug trafficking "deplorable," and vowed that Colombia would "re-examine and re-evaluate the terms of bilateral cooperation in the anti-drug fight."
Mr. Samper, who is battling for political survival against allegations that he solicited more than $6 million from Cali drug figures to finance his 1994 election campaign and engaged in a cover-up afterward, said that not he, but "the Government, the institutions and the Colombian people" had been "condemned" by the decision. 
 "As President, I will not accept any foreign intervention in the solution of our crisis," he said in an emotional speech. "We Colombians will find a definitive solution to our crisis."
He said Colombia would seek other allies in the fight against drugs. "We are going to seek international support where there exists cooperation with our fight," he said.
"I already have the only certification I need, which is the one issued to me by the Colombian people when they elected me."
His remarks raised the possibility of an open diplomatic conflict between Colombia and the United States, which has been steadily pressing this Andean nation to crack down on drug smugglers, using Mr. Samper's alleged ties to drug traffickers as tacit leverage in gaining cooperation.
The State Department, in a statement explaining the decision, said the strides Colombia had made in dismantling the leadership of the Cali cartel last year were largely the work of two men, Gen. Jose Serrano, the chief of police, and Alfonso Valdivieso, the chief prosecutor, whose successes were "particularly noteworthy given the lack of strong support and commitment from the Government."
But their work may be made considerably more difficult if the Government openly opposes any cooperation with the United States. Colombia supplies 80 percent of the cocaine that ends up on American streets.
"I don't think it'll help the situation," Robert Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, said in a telephone interview after Mr. Samper's address. "It would concern us if they tried to take steps to retaliate."
Mr. Gelbard also denied that the Administration had interfered in Colombia's domestic affairs with its decision.
"What we're trying to do is simply focus on the fact that there's been significantly less than full cooperation," he said, adding that Mr. Samper "is trying to use this as a way to rally nationalistic support."
Washington's decision appeared to have taken business and political leaders here by surprise, further demoralizing a country that has been mired in the presidential scandal.
The economic consequences of the decision remained unclear, for the State Department is still studying the fate of trade preferences and of more than $750 million in loan guarantees to Colombia that had been authorized but not yet drawn by the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Gelbard also raised the possibility that the United States would follow up with trade sanctions should Mr. Samper make good on his threat to end cooperation.
Last year, the Administration recognized the weaknesses in Colombia's efforts to eradicate drug trafficking, but granted the country a "national interest" waiver. Today's step gave Colombia the dubious distinction of becoming the first democracy to be decertified. Among Colombians, the injury was far greater than the dollars that may be lost.
"I feel ashamed to be decertified," said Jorge Ramirez Ocampo, executive president of the National Association of Exporters. "It is a very clear blow to us."
Mr. Ramirez, who was in Washington a few weeks ago to lobby for recertification, said decertification "sets back all of us who are trying to build up the commercial, legal economy."
He and others took issue with the decertification process, which they said amounted to interference in Colombia's internal affairs.
In Mexico, though the decision to certify that country was welcomed, the process itself also came under criticism.
In a statement, the Mexican Government said, "Cooperation with the United States ranks very high in our priorities." But it called the certification process itself an irritant to cordial relations.
As if to underscore Mexico's anti-drug dedication, the Government sent army and police forces into several neighborhoods in Tijuana, on the border south of San Diego, and one in Mexcio City, to search houses said to have been used by Benjamin and Ramon Arellano Felix, the heads of one of Mexico's largest drug mafias.
The operations yielded no arrests, though in one house in Tijuana, soldiers found sophisticated radio equipment. In a middle-class residence in Mexico City, the soldiers found several weapons, the Attorney General's office said in a statement.
The magnitude of the operation in Tijuana, which began before dawn when hundreds of helmeted soldiers swept through five of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, was unusual, and it led to suspicions that the raids might have been timed to attract publicity. Juan Rebolledo, Mexico's Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, denied that, however.
Here in Bogota, the American decision plunged the country into a new chapter of uncertainty.
But Senator Hugo Serrano, a supporter in Mr. Samper's Liberal Party, also predicted that the President would grow stronger, "because the lower classes will rise in favor of him."
Javier Fernandez, president of the National Association of Financial Institutions, disagreed. "The only rational explanation is that the U.S. Government wants to pressure Samper to fall," he said. "It wouldn't bother me if he did."

HEADLINE: RUSSIAN AIDE CALLS FOR HIGHER TARIFF, RENEGING ON VOW

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 1

 BODY:
Contradicting assurances made to the International Monetary Fund only a week ago, Russia's Finance Minister has proposed a broad increase in import tariffs.
The plan, which would raise tariffs by an average of 20 percent, appears intended to boost the political fortunes of President Boris N. Yeltsin by raising revenue for new social spending. It could also placate angry farmers and industrialists hurt by foreign competition. 
 But in trying to soothe a disgruntled electorate, Russian officials have alarmed the I.M.F., which has promised to lend Russia $10.2 billion on the condition that it continues market reforms and reduces trade barriers.
A senior I.M.F. official warned tonight that if it carried out the plan, Russia could jeopardize the loan, which Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, described as necessary to insure that economic reforms were "irreversible."
Perplexed Western officials said today that the Finance Ministry plan might be a sign of disarray in the Government, with some Russian officials pushing ways to increase spending while others make commitments to Western bankers.
Alternatively, the plan could reflect Moscow's calculation that the I.M.F. is so determined to help Mr. Yeltsin's re-election that it will loosen its requirements. Less than four months before Russia's presidential elections, polls show the Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, with a clear lead.
In any case, the plan for broad tariff increases runs counter to promises made to the fund.
In a confidential statement on economic policy, which Russia provided to the fund, the Government promised to reduce the average tariff by 1998. It also pledged that the average tariff would not be increased before then, according to Western officials.
With Communists promising to protect domestic producers, Mr. Yeltsin is under pressure to adopt more protectionist policies before the election.
Farmers, for instance, have complained that much of the food sold in Russia is imported. And last week, the Government responded to the concerns of Russian poultry producers, whose sales have declined by 40 percent, by threatening to ban American poultry imports as of March 19, ostensibly because of concerns over the levels of chemicals and bacteria in American chickens.
That move, which would block more than $500 million in annual sales by American companies, has provoked sharp protests from Washington. Concern in Western capitals has risen further in recent days as senior Russian officials have talked of even broader protectionism.
Vladimir G. Panskov, Russia's Finance Minister, sparked the worries by saying on Thursday that his ministry "has proposed to the Government that it raise import tariffs by an average of 20 percent."
Also on Thursday, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin added his voice to the growing protectionist choir, though without endorsing specific tariff rates. "A range of protectionist measures will be introduced in the field of foreign trade," Mr. Chernomyrdin said.
The United States and the European Community have warned that tariff increases could jeopardize Russia's bid for membership in the World Trade Organization, which is dedicated to free trade.
"Raising tariffs would be a step back from liberalization and would likely prove an ineffective means of strengthening Russian industry, as protectionist measures have proved elsewhere in the world," said Charles Blitzer of the World Bank's Moscow office.
It also worries the I.M.F.
"The I.M.F. is still trying to determine all the facts in the matter," a senior fund official said of the Finance Ministry plan. Before any loan money can be disbursed, it must be formally approved by the fund's board, which is expected to meet by mid-April.
Clinton Administration officials said the United States would have a strong response if Russia followed through with broad-based tariff increases, although they declined to be specific. It is unclear whether the Administration would use its influence with the I.M.F. -- as the largest contributor to the fund it has the single biggest vote -- to push for the loan payments to be suspended if the new tariffs were imposed.
"Most important, protectionism is bad for Russia," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said. "It is also bad for American business and for the American-Russian economic relationship. We will resist it strongly and will respond appropriately."
Under Moscow's commitments to the fund, Russia may increase some tariffs as long as it reduces others so that the average tariff does not increase. The I.M.F. official warned that a 20 percent increase in the average tariff, as proposed by Mr. Panskov, "could be a serious concern in terms of approval" of the loan.
Some specialists say the Finance Ministry plan may reflect not only growing protectionist sentiment, but also a desperate search for revenue.
Raising revenue to pay for expanded social spending is a serious problem for the Government. That problem has been complicated by Russia's promise to the I.M.F. to phase out tariffs on the export of oil and gas.
But the answer, Western economists say, is to tighten tax loopholes, establish effective excise taxes and strictly enforce the collection of existing tariffs, not create higher ones.

A TWILIGHT STRUGGLE
American Power and Nicaragua, 1977-1990.
By Robert Kagan.
Illustrated. 903 pp. New York: The Free Press. $37.50.
 Eight months after Ronald Reagan's 1981 inauguration, Thomas Enders, a tall and imperious American envoy, traveled to Managua to deliver a blunt message to Nicaragua's revolutionary head of state, Daniel Ortega, and to a group of his Sandinista comrades: Come to accommodation with the United States or we will smash you. Militarily, if need be. 
 "All right, come on in!" shot back Bayardo Arce, one member of the Sandinistas' directorate, succinctly expressing what became his revolutionary Government's official response to the Reagan Administration's demands. "We'll meet you man to man. You will kill us, but you will pay for it."
 With that encounter, the lines were drawn between Washington and Managua in the harsh struggle that came to dominate American foreign policy in the 1980's. President Reagan and his advisers demonized the Sandinistas, telling the nation that they were converting Nicaragua into a Soviet beachhead on the American mainland and committing virtual genocide against their own citizenry. As a result, the United States spent the rest of the decade obsessed with a country of fewer than four million people and a gross national product considerably smaller than the annual revenues of the Coca-Cola Company.
 Yet in 1990, after losing a free election organized by his Government, President Ortega congratulated his challenger, Violeta Chamorro, and turned over Nicaragua's Government to her. And early last year Mr. Ortega's brother, Humberto, stepped down as army chief. If the Ortegas and their comrades were such unredeemable Stalinists, then how was it that they gave up power so peaceably? Now that the cold war is over and the age of anti-Communist hyperbole has passed, it is possible to ask: How dangerous were the Sandinistas and their revolution anyway?
 These are some of the riddles with which Robert Kagan wrestles in "A Twilight Struggle." During the Reagan Administration Mr. Kagan was a deputy to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, and as such helped carry out Nicaragua policy. He has spent the seven years since he left government meticulously researching the struggle between Washington and Managua, which actually began, he argues, during the Carter Administration, a couple of years before the Sandinistas drove the dictator Anastasio Somoza from power, and ended with Ms. Chamorro's 1990 election victory.
 Mr. Kagan has not written a personal memoir, and has tried to avoid being an apologist for the Administration he served. Instead, he has sought the role of dispassionate historian, even if his portrayal of the Sandinistas and their relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba supports the arguments put forward by the Reagan Administration. He argues that the Sandinistas, far from pursuing the non-aligned policies many of their defenders attributed to them, made a clear choice from the beginning of their revolution to put themselves in the Soviet camp, eagerly following in Cuba's path. "We wanted to copy in a mechanical way the model that we knew -- which was Cuba," Mr. Kagan quotes Humberto Ortega as saying in 1991, during one of several interviews he conducted with the former Sandinista army chief.
In another 1991 interview with Humberto Ortega, Mr. Kagan probed the reasoning that led the Ortega brothers and other Sandinistas to throw in their lot with the Soviets just a few years before the collapse of Communism. "Remember, this was the strong Soviet Union," Mr. Ortega answered. "We thought it would last."
 According to Mr. Kagan, it was only after years of attacks on Nicaraguan farms and towns by the contras, the rebel army organized by the United States, that the Sandinistas sought accommodation with Washington and with their neighbors. Even so, he insists, the Sandinistas would never have organized free elections in 1990 had they realized that the balloting might bring their own defeat. Instead, they miscalculated, partly because they were under tremendous pressures to democratize, and not only from Mr. Reagan and the contras, but also from American liberals and the Central American presidents led by Costa Rica's Oscar Arias. Ms. Chamorro's election, he concludes, "was widely recognized as a success for American policy, but who deserves credit for it has been the subject of much debate."
 Mr. Kagan seeks to apportion "credit" for the Sandinistas' downfall evenhandedly. The Reagan Administration's support for the contras was essential, he says, but he acknowledges that the role played by American moderates like Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma also contributed by nudging the Sandinistas toward democratic compromises they would never have accepted as impositions from the White House. He offers backhanded credit to the Bush Administration as well, arguing that "the evident sincerity of Bush's desire to be rid of the Nicaraguan mess convinced the Sandinistas that the risk of the elections was worth taking."
 This attempt to distribute praise is part of what appears to be a broader effort to produce, in effect, a reference work, one that tries to tell the whole story of American-Nicaraguan relations in this century, leaving out nothing of importance. The result is what Mr. Kagan himself calls a "fat" book, and although he thanks an editor for pulling it back from obesity, it has turned out overweight nonetheless: it has six sections, plus conclusions, divided into 65 chapters; the notes alone run to 138 pages.
 The result is an account that is consistently authoritative but only sometimes fresh and occasionally downright ponderous. For instance, Mr. Kagan devotes 18 pages to a detailed retelling of one now-obscure series of Congressional maneuvers in 1983, including this passage: "Before any vote was taken, an amendment to Mica's amendment was hastily drawn up by a New York Democrat, Stephen Solarz, and presented in the name of Congressman Boland. The trickiest proposal yet offered, the Boland-Solarz amendment to the Mica substitute amendment for the Young amendment to the Boland-Zablocki amendment turned Mica's proposal on its head."
 Mr. Kagan has based his research on a reading of the scores of books that have already appeared on the Nicaraguan conflict, as well as on an analysis of thousands of press articles and Government documents and on interviews with key leaders on both sides. The interviews, though not extensive, gave him some groundbreaking insights; his sessions with Humberto Ortega were especially fruitful.
 Mr. Kagan occasionally puts his own policy making experience to good use as well, as when he acknowledges that even Reagan Administration insiders grew skeptical about the central thesis underpinning their policy: that revolutionary Nicaragua was a threat to American security. "By late 1987 the geostrategic aspect of the Administration's Nicaragua policy remained a potent element of its rhetoric," Mr. Kagan writes, "but the genuine fear of Soviet expansion in Central American that had initially inspired Reagan officials in the early 1980's had passed. Reagan officials did not really believe the Soviets under Gorbachev would attempt to establish bases in Nicaragua. They did not really believe the Soviets would deliver MIG's to the Sandinistas, no matter what the Soviets promised. . . . The struggle against the Sandinistas, meanwhile, had taken on a life of its own, independent of the Soviet threat."
 That passage supports the view shared by many of the Reagan Administration's critics, who believed American policy to be driven by a bullying fixation on a pitiful Latin country, rather than by any genuine concerns about American security. And it makes Mr. Kagan seem somewhat opinionated when he concludes about Washington's actions:
 "They were the policies of a great power exercising its will, however harshly or mildly, to enforce certain principles of behavior in both the external and internal affairs of a small, troublesome neighbor. Nothing could be more natural than such behavior by a great power, and Nicaraguans from the Somozas to the Sandinistas have seen American hegemony as the natural, if not necessarily desirable, state of affairs."

Speak My Name
Black Men on Masculinity and the American Dream.
Edited by Don Belton.
272 pp. Boston: Beacon Press. $24.
 A S America's cities are transformed from centers of manufacturing to centers of service and high technology, and as America's corporations send their low-skill jobs to third-world countries, the black working class is being hit very hard. The resulting poverty has created social breakdown in our inner cities on a huge scale -- the all-too-familiar problems of alienation, drug abuse, violence, teen-age pregnancy, family disintegration, record arrest and incarceration rates, AIDS, homelessness and endemic joblessness. 
 Strikingly, since men are the ones generally charged with the responsibility of providing for the welfare of their families and communities, many people have reached a simple conclusion: There is something terribly wrong with the black man. His moral fiber, his common decency, his very masculinity are being called into question. In any discussion of prisons, welfare, joblessness, family desertion, crime, violence or drugs, his name is invoked. Shopkeepers fear him. Taxi drivers refuse to pick him up. Given these negative associations, it has become easy to grumble that he is the reason for our nation's problems. And some politicians have responded by ignoring economic and structural realities, threatening to turn back a generation of racial gains.
 In these circumstances, black men have begun to stir. Overwhelming numbers of them were willing to be counted in the Million Man March, whatever their feelings about Louis Farrakhan. Clearly, many black men believe the time has arrived to look seriously at themselves and their experience in America.
 In "Speak My Name," the novelist Don Belton has responded to these issues by assembling a group of black male writers to reflect on the social world of the contemporary black man. In the foreword the playwright August Wilson sets the tone by testifying to the positive presence of the African-American male on American soil. He briefly traces black manliness from the accomplished "mule trainer, singer, shaper of wood and iron" to Charlie Burley, a prizefighter he knew, pleading for black males to fulfill the promise of their past. Given the powerful odds stacked against the black man, his mere survival might seem to be his crowning achievement. Yet in reality, Mr. Wilson continues, the black man does something more than simply survive; he thrives. But he thrives on his own terms, no one else's, and often in a style that the rest of the world is ready to view as grotesque.
 The position enunciated by Mr. Wilson sets the stage for what follows. The stories, essays and personal narratives in "Speak My Name," by various authors pursuing various themes, represent a kind of collective testimony bearing witness to the value of black cultural life, with special attention to the black male. They reveal both the complex reality of black men and the many ways in which black men have been integral to American society, contributing much of what we define as "American."
 The list of writers in "Speak My Name" reads like a Who's Who of the African-American literary world: Henry Louis Gates Jr., Amiri Baraka, Walter Mosley, John Edgar Wideman, among many others. Each contributor essentially does his own thing, but while the pieces may be uneven in tone, they are almost all insightful.
 If there is an organizing principle here, it is the following: Black men live in a social world made extremely difficult by the forces of racism, yet they remain ordinary (albeit soulful) creatures, real individuals who are born, eat, sleep, mature, love, pray -- and work -- just like everyone else. To the detriment of the black man, this simple truth is too often ignored by the wider white society, and with this anthology Mr. Belton wishes to set matters right.
 He succeeds admirably. The writers demonstrate the remarkable range of black life. Particularly memorable are Henry Louis Gates's "Playing Hardball" (adapted from his memoir, "Colored People"), Houston Baker's "On the Distinction of 'Jr.' " and Robin D. G. Kelley's "Confessions of a Nice Negro, or Why I Shaved My Head." Many of the articles are being published here for the first time; others are excerpts from previously published work.
 Among the recurring topics are the social scarring associated with growing up black and poor in America, sibling rivalry and the place of the black man in America. There are pieces about the complicated relationship between a young man and a father figure, about the relationship between a young man and his mother, and about a young man's coming of age. The reader is treated to intimate accounts of ordinary black family life, with relationships that succeed and others that do not. At times, male friends stand in for physically or spiritually absent fathers, as at times do older brothers, male cousins or even the man next door.
 AN underlying but persistent concern of the collection is the link between hard work and moral value, and in this regard the contributors seem peculiarly American. Most of the accounts are quite positive, at times even romantic, in their portrayals of how various individuals come to terms with the common struggles of making a living, raising a family and trying to find meaning in life.
 To be sure, some pieces recount personal experiences with prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion. Here, particularly to the unsympathetic or the uninformed, the collection risks sounding like simply a series of personal reflections on racial suffering and male bonding (often with the subtext of good prevailing over evil). But the writers are only acknowledging a reality of America's troubled race relations. The very title of the anthology, after all, is in one sense a challenge to speak the truth.
 At the present time, with so many pressures on the black male, the public dialogue that Mr. Belton hopes for is sorely needed, and I commend him for a job well done. But if we are to make significant progress in understanding what too often seems an intractable problem of this society, it must also be said that it is not enough to present accounts of the world in which the black man lives, struggles and survives. Ultimately, the issues of economics and social structure are going to have to be addressed as well.

HOT AIR
All Talk, All the Time.
By Howard Kurtz.
407 pp. New York: Times Books/Random House. $25.
 What's the difference between Ted Koppel, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera? The joke is on Mr. Koppel, because the answer for many people seems to be, not much. According to a Harris poll cited in Howard Kurtz's "Hot Air: All Talk, All the Time," when Americans were asked to name their favorite talk show host, Mr. Koppel was lumped right in with Oprah and Geraldo, Letterman and Leno, even Regis and Kathie Lee. In an interview with Mr. Kurtz, a miffed Ted Koppel castigated the public for its lack of "discrimination." But doesn't that smack of blaming the victim? 
 "Nightline" may have been born during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980, and it may have staked out the journalistic high ground with globe-trotting investigative reports and hard-hitting political interviews, but in recent years it has been infected by the same fluff-in-mouth disease that has degraded the news media as a whole. The O. J. Simpson trial alone, Mr. Kurtz reports, occupied nearly half the air time of "Nightline" during one seven-week stretch in 1995. As recently as the late 1980's, what made a journalist radical (and rare) was a willingness to challenge the basic assumptions of the political and economic elites whose doings dominate most news coverage. Now, simple intelligence is a radical thing.
 "We have become a talk show nation," Mr. Kurtz announces on the first page of "Hot Air." And although he applauds some aspects of the recent talk show explosion -- talk radio has broadened the nation's political conversation beyond that traditionally sanctioned by the major networks and newspapers, while television programs like "The McLaughlin Group" illustrate that "news doesn't have to be dull" -- he plainly believes the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. Talk shows, he writes, have become "a powerful vehicle that trumpets the most extreme and polarizing views, that panders to sensationalism, that spreads innuendo and misinformation with stunning efficiency." Talk shows are enemies of complexity, fairness and journalistic accountability. What's more, their "collective racket seems to grow more deafening each week."
 Mr. Kurtz, the author of "Media Circus: The Trouble With America's Newspapers," supports his charges with ample reporting, much of it undertaken in his capacity as the media reporter for The Washington Post. That perch undoubtedly helped him secure the interviews with Mr. Koppel, Larry King, Rush Limbaugh and other talk show bigwigs who animate his text. A wealth of anecdotes, personality sketches and behind-the-cameras eavesdropping makes his book smooth and undemanding reading. What is lacking, unfortunately, is depth and rigor. For example, the author seems to believe that only direct quotations require documentation. As a result, "Hot Air" resembles a series of extended newspaper articles whose occasional flashes of insight are undermined by a pervasive superficiality.
 Many of the gravest shortcomings Mr. Kurtz attributes to television talk shows -- their unswerving reflection of the mind-set of official Washington, the astronomical salaries that insulate their regular panelists from the daily realities of average Americans, the unmistakably rightward tilt of their pundits -- have, in fact, long been evident in the news media as a whole. Yet Mr. Kurtz fails to explain how these important flaws have been transformed in the talk show era, and why. Nor can he convincingly assert that talk shows are the new kingmakers of American politics without providing more concrete, checkable facts than he does. Indeed, one could argue from his own reporting that Washington insiders, for reasons of ego, vastly overestimate the true influence of television talk shows.
 In the case of radio, Mr. Kurtz reports that large majorities of talk show listeners voted Republican in a number of 1994 elections, helping the party capture Congress. That sounds plausible. The problem is, there is no way to evaluate this claim without knowing what percentage of all voters listened to talk radio. Likewise, it is interesting to read about House Speaker Newt Gingrich briefing Mr. Limbaugh in order to galvanize his audience against President Clinton's crime bill. But quoting conservatives who orchestrated a barrage of phone calls is not proof that the calls were what defeated the bill.
 The most hard-hitting material in "Hot Air" exposes how David Gergen, Sam Donaldson, William Safire and other pundits routinely accept many thousands of dollars in speaking fees from corporations with keen financial interests in the issues they discuss. The stock defense of the talking heads -- that such payments are a private matter, and in any case have no effect on their views -- "would be laughable if made by a politician," Mr. Kurtz writes. And even if it is mere coincidence that, for example, George Will and Fred Barnes took health industry cash while publicly arguing that the health care crisis was exaggerated, there is a deeper problem, Mr. Kurtz suggests. The journalists' "privileged status invariably skews their view of the world," predisposing them to believe that, like them, most Americans need not worry about rising insurance premiums, decaying public schools or Nafta-inflicted job losses.
 Six- and seven-figure incomes for reporters were unthinkable, Mr. Kurtz notes, "before the unholy union of journalism and televised entertainment." So, one might add, were many other blemishes on our news media. Sympathizing with the decision to replace a "Nightline" story about the Mexican peso crisis with yet another wallow in the O. J. mud, Mr. Kurtz speculates that "ABC executives didn't want too many viewers surfing over to Letterman and Leno." Such tabloid-style maneuvering is a logical consequence of two powerful factors that unfortunately go all but unmentioned in "Hot Air": first, the vastly increased economic concentration within the journalism industry, and second, the deregulation of broadcasting that took place during the Reagan era, which effectively told the industry that it could downgrade news without risking license renewals. Critics warned at the time that deregulation plus oligopoly would maximize profits while impoverishing the nation. But what did they know?

HEADLINE: A Man Who Dreams of Bubbles to Mars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL McGOVERN 

 BODY:
ASK most people what they think of bubbles and they'll recall the sweet summer days of youth, running through the grass, plastic bottle of soap solution in hand, dipping, then lifting the wand to the lips to blow, watching and giggling as one by one the shiny spheres floated, then burst with a splash. For most people, that's pretty much the end of bubbles.
But ask James Ossi of Darien about bubbles and he'll tell you about science, art, Mars, failure, his father, a young man's suicide, architecture, success and dreams. 
 It's hard to put a label on exactly what James Ossi does. He's a scientist whose work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan, the Humphrey Gallery in SoHo and the Summit Art Center in New Jersey.
And he's an artist whose work has been studied by physics and math students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and displayed in the Boston Museum of Science and Japan's Saibu Gas Museum.
"My favorite thought," said the rather mischievous inventor, when pressed to define himself, "is blowing bubbles on the surface of Mars. I guess I'm a Martian architect, but since there are no Martians, I have no clients, therefore, I am a philosopher." In 1979, after 15 years of what he described as "constant failure," Mr. Ossi finally perfected a marriage of science and art which achieves the impossible -- square bubbles.
Now, another 15 years later, three of these bubble sculptures are on loan to the Maritime Center in South Norwalk, where they will be displayed through March before likely moving on to a permanent home at the University of Florida.
From his home studio-laboratory, Mr. Ossi turns out about one of the bubble-making machines a year, which in their various incarnations have ranged from 8 to 25 feet in height, with over 2,000 pounds of switches, motors and brightly colored wires. He has been selling them to museums and shopping malls for about $65,000 each.
One of his earliest machines sits in the lobby of the physics building at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass. Originally purchased in 1981 as comic relief for overly intense students after one committed suicide over a failing grade, the machine now serves an academic purpose as well as being used to study physics, optics, fluid dynamics, math, light, color and area-minimizing surfaces.
It was while he was at the Parsons School of Design in New York in the late 60's that Mr. Ossi first became dedicated to intermingling science and art. The school gave him his own lab in which to indulge his creative fantasies, then inspired by the highly ornamental style of art and architecture known as Art Nouveau, which had been popular in late 19th-century France.
So Mr. Ossi dragged in an old bathtub he'd found on the street and filled it with salt water and liquid polyester, two immiscible liquids.
"I was fascinated with the movement of the two liquids within each other," Mr. Ossi said, "and I decided to bottle it and sell it as sculpture."
After a little tinkering, Mr. Ossi developed a line of rectangular-shaped, brightly colored acrylic sculptures filled with liquid polybutane, which was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection in 1970. Over the next few years, Mr. Ossi sold thousands through art galleries, museum gift shops and department stores, giving the inventor his first taste of artistic success and the inspiration for the bubble machine.
At about the same time, like his father Peter before him, whose paintings hang in the Smithsonian, Mr. Ossi resolved "never to have a boss."
"I think it was in June of my second year at Parsons when I went to visit my father at his studio in Paterson, N.J.," Mr. Ossi said. "There was a small handwritten note on the door which read 'Gone for a ride. Be back in September -- maybe.' I admired his freedom.
"If you fail a course in economics, you are an artist and that's all you can ever be. But if you pass you're a normal person. I'm viewed as an artist in the scientific community and that's a handicap. And by the art community I'm viewed as a scientist. Either way I'm distrusted," said Mr. Ossi, who sometimes describes himself as a "gizmologist."
Mr. Ossi playfully calls the Maritime Center piece "Russian Constructivism Via Venice Beach." Constructivism is for the type of geometry-as-art popularized by post-Russian Revolution painters, sculptors and architects of the early 1920's, and apparent in the machine's exposed steel beams, girders, nuts and bolts. And Venice Beach is a nod to the vivid bubbles, which the inventor says remind him of "the attitude of the bright, Lycra-clad Rollerblading chicks on Venice Beach, Calif."
Each machine is designed, the inventor said, so that every half hour a waterfall starts a new show. The soap solution is forced to the bottom, where air is blown in, propelling bubbles upward through panes of glass set three inches apart.
"Bubbles want to take the absolutely minimum shape they can be," Mr. Ossi explained. "A bubble in air will be a sphere because that's the minimum shape it can be and still encapsulate that much air."
Pointing to a sculpture, he continued, "Here a bubble membrane wants to get from the front surface of the glass to the back -- so it will be a plane."
As the bubbles stretch across the glass, they form a honeycomb of hexagonal cells in which each adjoining angle measures 120 degrees.
The rectangular walls of each cell start out relatively thick -- giving them a clear look. However, as the soap bubbles stretch outward and upward, Mr. Ossi explained, the walls thin to the point where 1,000 lined up side by side could fit in a single groove of a human fingerprint. As light bounces off both the front and rear surfaces of the soapy membranes, the refracted colors mix -- creating iridescent shades rare in nature's palette.
While Mr. Ossi is happy with the joy his bubble creations presently offer in earthbound settings, their future, he said, is in the stars. Scientists are soon going to build a space station, he said, in the classic nut-and-bolt style. "But space is different; there is no gravity, it's hard to turn a nut and bolt there."
"There's no doubt in my mind that we're going out there," Mr. Ossi said, pointing skyward, "but I don't think we should bring post-and-beam architecture."
Take liquid glass up into space in a shuttle, Mr. Ossi said, "add a little air pressure and it's like blowing a balloon in a vacuum." It could have a wall thickness of a few inches and a diameter of about 100 feet, he said.
Spin it fast enough, the inventor suggested, "and it becomes a disk shaped by centrifugal force. Instantly it will break into two objects -- a doughnut shape surrounding a sphere in the middle. Throw away the sphere, let the hollow doughnut cool and harden and there: instant space station! Put an atmosphere in it and spin it at the desired rate to create artificial gravity.
"Studying soap bubbles is a whole area of science, though scientists wouldn't tell you that. But I wonder," Mr. Ossi said as a smile crept across his lips, "if there's anybody working for NASA who started out as a philosopher or a dreamer."

Room Enough to Stretch the Imagination

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
MARLO THOMAS HAD A LOT to answer for in the late 1960's. Young single women streamed into Manhattan, demanding that real estate agents find them decent apartments they could afford. After all, if Ann Marie, the chronically unemployed actress played by Ms. Thomas in the ABC series "That Girl," could afford a pretty little one-bedroom that was clearly on a town-house block in the East 70's, why couldn't they? Ann was apparently paying the rent with her earnings from waitressing and handing out product samples at department stores.
Middle-class New Yorkers have been apologizing to out-of-town friends and relatives for decades because of what television tells America about local real estate. ("Mom, I really am making $70,000," says the real-life New Yorker. "Lots of people live in one room. With a roommate. In Queens.") 
 Things were different before "That Girl." In the 1950's, on "The Honeymooners," the Kramdens appeared to live in a large, ugly kitchen in Brooklyn, the best they could afford on Ralph's salary as a city bus driver. And on "I Love Lucy," the Ricardos' Manhattan apartment was a pleasant but unspectacular one-bedroom, which they could afford as not-so-young-marrieds because Ricky Ricardo was a bandleader and then a nightclub owner.
Housing has sometimes looked tougher in other cities. Despite Mary Richards's good job as an associate producer at WJM-TV on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she lived in a studio, and that was in affordable Minneapolis in the 1970's.
Movies, by contrast, with the advantage of real locations, have shown a little of everything. Woody Allen generally puts his characters in homes they can afford, from a prostitute's one-bedroom in a postwar high-rise to a prosperous actress's rambling co-op on Central Park. On the other hand, few newly divorced women with part-time jobs have the luck of Jill Clayburgh in the 1978 film "An Unmarried Woman." She signs a lease on a light-flooded garden apartment with two fireplaces and great moldings, telling a friend apologetically that it's the best she can afford.
These days, television has become somewhat more realistic about New York apartments, but there are still pockets of fantasy, not to mention some dangerous lapses in home security for these digs.
NBC's "Friends," of course, wins the Ann Marie Award for the 90's. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica (Courteney Cox), a coffee-bar waitress and an unemployed assistant chef, respectively, are mysteriously able to afford their funky but spacious Greenwich Village apartment with terrace. (A "spacious 1 BR" with "sun and charm" in their neighborhood was recently advertised for $1,750 a month.) The hope is that viewers will "suspend disbelief," says a series spokesman.
TWO OTHER CHARACTERS IN "Friends," Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), were sharing a two-bedroom until a few weeks ago. After being offered an apartment with "park views and high ceilings," Joey moved out, announcing, "I'm 28 . . . and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
NBC, which currently has at least five series with New York apartment settings, wins points for greater credibility on the others. The producers haven't made the apartments smaller, darker and more depressing; they've simply given the characters more money.
Jerry Seinfeld (the character) on "Seinfeld" is at least a moderately successful stand-up comic. Recently he surprised his father with a gift of a new car (a Cadillac, no less). Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) was shocked: "I had no idea you had this kind of money." No wonder. She was standing in Jerry's painfully modest Upper West Side one-bedroom, which has a kitchen along one wall, a bathroom that can be seen from the living room and no real storage space (a bicycle hangs on the wall).
Caroline Duffy (Lea Thompson) on NBC's "Caroline in the City" is also a single, successful New Yorker. She's a nationally syndicated cartoonist whose Midwestern hometown named a park for her, so she can probably afford the loft in which she lives and works. The show's producers say it's in TriBeCa and that the blond-wood staircase leads to Caroline's rarely seen bedroom and a bath. Like many sitcom New Yorkers, and real-life loft residents, Caroline has a kitchen in the living room. It contains a sure sign of her financial well-being: a Sub-Zero refrigerator ($2,850 and up). But why, with even a small loft running to 1,200 square feet, do she and her colorist, Richard (Malcolm Gets), work at a partners' desk in the middle of the living room?
IN SOME CASES, THE NET works have made apartment dwellers a little older and toned down the decorator ambiance. On "The Single Guy," the West Village apartment occupied by the title character (Jonathan Silverman), whose friends are afraid he'll never marry, is refreshingly dumpy. The living room is furnished with an undersize sofa, a television that the cable installer made fun of and a dining table that doubles as a desk.
The tenants' association appears to have the power of a co-op board; not long ago it (briefly) dismissed the building's one doorman, who incidentally wears a uniform that would look more at home on Park and 72d. The creator of the series, Brad Hall, swears the building is inspired by one he lived in on Cornelia Street.
Jamie and Paul Buchman's (Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser's) one-bedroom Village apartment on "Mad About You" seems realistic for a two-career couple in their mid to late 30's. He's a documentary film producer, doing well enough to have had Yoko Ono approach him with a project. She's a public-relations executive, although she recently quit to go back to school. The apartment's rent or maintenance has never been mentioned, but the building's garage recently went condo.
Jamie and Paul clearly took the apartment because of the kitchen. This huge, windowed room, with nooks, crannies and an island (large enough for the Buchmans to have used it for a romantic encounter), belongs in a renovated classic six on Riverside Drive.
The Buchmans share a quirk with their prime-time New York neighbors: they never double-lock their door. Sometimes television Manhattanites don't lock their doors at all. On "Seinfeld," Jerry's apartment door wears an impressive array of hardware, but he never seems to put the locks to use. This is probably for the same reason that other series leave apartment doors unlocked: so the zany next-door neighbor can barge in, without tempo-slowing buzzers and bells.
How can sitcom characters be so careless in the big, bad city? In the case of "Caroline," whose title character recently left for a movie and dinner date without locking up, high security makes the difference, says Tom Azzari, the show's production designer. "It's a secure building with an intercom," he says. "You know who has access. You pretty much know who's there." (Well, yeah, until the pizza guy gets buzzed in by the apartment next door and decides to stop by for Caroline's jewelry on his way out. And as old fans of "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" know, you can't even count on a doorman to stop suspicious visitors.)
Building security may be a less serious issue in Metropolis, where citizens can often count on Superman to catch burglars in the act; otherwise the place looks a lot like New York. In all fairness, Lois Lane's apartment has always posed problems for set designers. Lois is just a hard-working reporter at The Daily Planet, but she needs a balcony where Superman can make graceful landings. In the 1978 film "Superman," the designers gave Lois a terrace the size of Montana.
On ABC's "Lois and Clark," the apartment that Lois lives in has one of those glamorous kitchen-in-the-living-room layouts, good closet space (big enough for a visiting robot) but a fire escape instead of a terrace. She reaches it, however, by walking through what look like French doors. (Getting a great apartment was easy for Clark Kent, a k a Superman. He just signed a lease on a dump, then renovated it one afternoon with his superpowers.)
The series that makes the most important statement about Manhattan housing may be Fox's "Ned and Stacey," which was created on the premise that New Yorkers will do almost anything to get a fabulous apartment at below-market-value rent. In the pilot episode, Stacey, a writer for The Village Voice, enters the apartment of Ned, an advertising executive, furious. But she stops mid-rant when she notices the wall of windows looking out on Central Park and the skyline beyond. "Nice apartment," she says. "One bedroom?"
It turns out to be a spacious Upper West Side rent-controlled two-bedroom with large terrace for only $1,500. The primary tenant is an elderly woman who lived there for 30 years, is now in a nursing home and has sublet to Ned under the mistaken impression that he's her nephew. Ned's employer gives promotions only to family men, so Ned is looking for a wife, fast, just for appearances. Stacey sizes up the place, knowing she'll never get anything else like this for $750. She's in her wedding dress before the credits roll.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Dr. Ronald D. Valenti;
The Juggling Act of Paying for Schools

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
ANOTHER year, another round of cuts in state aid for school districts. This year, Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget cuts general state aid and calls for school districts to pay millions more to educate and transport special-education preschoolers, services that had mainly been paid for by the state and county governments.
With more of the burden of financing education being shifted to property owners -- and organized antitax groups resisting property-tax increases -- school officials know that things have to change. 
 But how? Dr. Ronald D. Valenti, Superintendent of the Harrison schools and president of the Lower Hudson Council of School Superintendents (representing 76 districts in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Dutchess Counties), said the answer is multifaceted.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Valenti, who headed the council's study on financing education:
Q. Define the problem.
A. Everyone seems to agree on the problem. If you go back to December 1990, there was a dramatic reduction in state aid to all districts in New York State. At the time, then Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature decided to cut back aid dramatically to districts throughout the state. Westchester districts sustained upward of a 50 to 60 percent reduction in their state aid. This was done because of the dire fiscal straits of the state at the time of a national recession. The fundamental problem is the lack of available dollars from Albany as well as throughout the region to continue to fund education at the appropriate level that is necessary for student learning. Also, there has been a Federal retreat on education. These cutbacks have forced and driven property taxes on the local level higher.
The second component of the problem is the entire inequity that we have in terms of funding school districts. We have a state school-aid formula that no one can adequately understand and a question of whether the property base should be the only source for the funding of education. The property base needs some dramatic surgery if it's going to continue to fund schools. Specifically, we think there is a need for uniform assessment rates throughout New York State. And the tax certiorari problem has to be addressed so that property owners who can claim they have been overtaxed only receive refunds prospectively, not retroactively. Along with that we think senior citizens and wage earners on fixed incomes need some relief.
The third major component of the problem is what everyone calls mandates -- mandates from Albany and/or Washington, but usually Albany, where in effect there are unfunded requirements to carry certain programs or perform certain activities or provide certain services.
When you combine those three things, we find that New York State is really racing down a fiscal collision course.
Q. What are your solutions?
A. Our first solution with respect to state aid is that we insist that the children of New York State receive their fair share of state aid. While there are other legitimate needs in New York -- and everyone knows health services and welfare and prison, and so forth, are legitimate needs -- it's our belief that the children should not be experiencing the brunt of this diminution of resources. We would argue, minimally, to get us back to the levels that we had in December 1990.
Q. But that isn't going to happen, is it?
A. Well, look: we have to take a position. You have to begin somewhere. To give a very specific example, back in 1990, for every dollar we spent in Harrison on education, 12 cents came from Albany. The state has to decide what role it wants to play, and fund it accordingly.
Other recommendations we are making are for building aid and increased assistance with special education aid. We're serving a growing proportion of youngsters who have remedial and special needs and rather than have the state retreat on that front, they have to take a more active and aggressive role in that area.
Also, the last two proposals: We are looking for a regional expense factor to be included in the state-aid formula, to help areas such as Westchester where it's more expensive to live, where teacher salaries are higher to reflect that. And finally, we strongly support efficiency study grants. We're very much committed to cutting out any kind of costs that are unnecessary. And we would like the state to assist districts to find ways to share services in the interest of efficiency and economy. We have done a good deal in this area, but we want to do more.
Q. Of all your suggestions, probably the last one has some political reality of happening, wouldn't you agree?
A. I think the latter certainly has some political reality, but don't forget that related to the others may be relaxation of some of the mandates. For example, transportation aid was a major casualty five years ago. Before then, our transportation expenses were reimbursed about 90 percent. Now we get 5 to 6 percent. We believe one of two things now has to happen: either the state must increase its share of aid for transportation or the state legislation ought to be changed to no longer make transportation a state mandate for children who live two to three miles or more away from the school.
Q. What is your position on school district mergers?
A. We, as school superintendents, have been supporting that notion where a community is prepared to support it. There are superintendents that have really gone out on a limb trying to get a community to take a hard look at it. I think the taxpayers will have to confront that reality if dollars can be saved. There is an awful lot of support here for individual districts. I think it will be a pocketbook issue that overcomes the emotional issues.
Q. Many people still seem to feel that the schools can absorb more cuts -- if the money were better spent, if perhaps there were changes in tenure laws, control of teachers' salaries.
A. I think you have to look at the historical trend. We know that teachers were grossly underpaid if you go back many years ago. Now, over the last several years, the salaries of teachers have been improving and increasing. If you look at recent teacher salary increases, most of the increases that I have seen are in the 2 to 2.5 percent range. I think we've become much more realistic in terms of what the economy can bear. However, fulfilling the mandate of treating teachers as professionals is absolutely necessary.
Q. Most professionals don't have tenure.
A. In my judgment tenure is not protecting the incompetent. It's to protect the academic freedom of a teacher. Following that logic, I know many districts that have taken actions against incompetent teachers, some of them successfully, some of them unsuccessfully. We've fought for changes in the law to make the due process more simplified so that we can address it. I think districts have to be assertive and at times aggressive in going after teachers believed to be incompetent, and an enlightened teachers' union will be supportive of that.
The converse is that in the absence of tenure, would one's academic freedom be challenged? Would a district be able to be arbitrary and capricious with respect to a particular teacher, particularly when that teacher's salary reached a point where the district could say, I could buy two teachers for the price of that one?
Q. Governor Pataki has proposed that school budgets that include an increase not in line with the cost-of-living be passed by a 60-percent majority. What do you think of that?
A. We take very serious issue with his proposal for a supermajority to pass budgets. I would offer him a challenge: if he's prepared to put the state budget out for a public referendum under the same supermajority vote, certainly I would do the same. I have never been able to vote on the state budget nor on the county budget nor on a local budget. The only time people get to vote on a budget is the school district budget. A supermajority requirement is an open invitation for tyranny of the minority.

HEADLINE: ART;
Over Their Shoulders, an Iron Hand

BYLINE: By AMEI WALLACH; Amei Wallach's "Ilya Kabakov: The Man Who Never Threw Anything Away" will be published by Harry N. Abrams in May.

 BODY:
IT HAS BEEN TWO decades since the first historical survey of Hitler's official art raised such an outcry that the Frankfurter Kunstverein, which mounted the exhibition, found it necessary to publish a book of the outraged reactions.
Since then, the Soviet Union has crashed, exposing dreary truths about the art of yet another repressive regime. American museums have begun to snap up bargains in Soviet-era Lenin statues. And architectural revisionism has recast the reputation of Hitler's chief architect, Albert Speer. 
 A half century after American troops marched into Buchenwald, a swastika is as likely to decorate a mystery novel as to appall. Only a handful of exhibitions have taken on the explosive issue of whether art in the service of totalitarian regimes can be art at all. Yet "Art and Power: Europe Under the Dictators 1930-45," which is traveling around Europe and opened Tuesday at the Center of Contemporary Culture in Barcelona, received a curiously bloodless response from both press and viewers at its first stop in London this winter.
A review in the London newspaper The European, for example, called it "a collection of vivid images from a cruel but fascinating period in European history" and said, more jauntily, "There is a marvelous line in Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' where he says, with hilarious understatement, 'And I, for my part, decided to go into politics.' "
Meanwhile, Rafael Ramos of La Vanguardia in Barcelona, wrote, "The exhibition navigates through the waters of cultural and political controversy by openly questioning widespread theory that totalitarian and modernist art had nothing in common except a coincidence in time."
The huge compendium of more than 470 paintings, sculptures, film clips, graphics and architectural projects produced in Berlin, Moscow, Rome and Madrid under totalitarian rule has been underwritten by the Council of Europe, an organization formed at the start of the cold war to remind Western European nations of the cultural values they share. Her Majesty's Government was invited to prepare this show because Britain had fended off totalitarian takeover.
In Barcelona, where Generalissimo Francisco Franco's reign ended 21 years ago, "the subject of the exhibition is very, very interesting for the public at this moment," said Berte Sureda, coordinator of the exhibition in Barcelona. "For people in Spain it was very hard in those years, the hardest that we can remember."
In particular, Ms. Sureda expects Jose Maria Sert's monumental painting, "Ste. Teresa, Ambassadress of Divine Love to Spain, Offers to Our Lord the Spanish Martyrs of 1936," to hit a nerve. Sert is best known in New York for the mural he was commissioned to paint as a replacement for Diego Rivera's Rockefeller Center fresco, which had been deemed politically unacceptable because it depicted Lenin. Painted in glazes on gilt, "Ste. Teresa" hung in the Vatican Pavilion at the Paris International Exhibition in 1937.
Nearby, in the Republican Government's Spanish Pavilion, Picasso's "Guernica" expressed his horror at the bombing of civilian populations by Franco's Nationalist allies. In contrast, Sert employed every grandiloquent artifice of drapery and foreshortening to present Christ on His cross, hovering horizontally like a military bomber, welcoming the souls of Nationalist martyrs.
"Art and Power" begins with the 1937 International, at which art and architecture were positioned at the center of the struggle for power, and Albert Speer's German Pavilion and Boris Iofan's Soviet Pavilion faced off on the banks of the Seine. In many ways, Speer and Soviet architects like Iofan steal this show with their megalomaniacal master plans, though these are represented only by drawings and models.
REDUCED VERSIONS OF THE sculptures that topped and dominated their Parisian buildings introduced the "Art and Power" installation at the Hayward Gallery in London: Vera Mukhina's Soviet-era set piece "Industrial Worker and Collective Farm Girl," hammer and sickle held high, steps briskly into the future toward the immutable menace of Speer's eagle, its talons gripping a shield adorned with a swastika.
Even in the films on view -- the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, a 1939 Moscow sports parade that takes a hint from Busby Berkeley -- the esthetic differences between Moscow and Berlin are apparent. Both intended to mislead in order to control. But Soviet art and architecture insisted on vigor and rosy optimism to create a dream of euphoria that would blunt the reality of daily deprivation and death. The Nazi dream was of stability and resolute authority to shroud past economic and political chaos, and the present reality of brutality and war.
This exhibition pits independent artists more interested in examining reality than in controlling it -- Picasso, Miro, Oskar Schlemmer and Kathe Kollwitz -- against the likes of Stalin's court painter, Aleksandr Gerasimov, and Hitler's star film director, Leni Riefenstahl. In London, the organizers seemed to be counting on the differences to be so obvious that they could mix and match without explanatory texts.
Sepp Hilz's "Red Necklace," an academic fantasy of peasant beauty, shared a room with Felix Nussbaum's "Secret," in which bulging eyes and endless corridors, rendered with hyper-reality, suggest culpability and dread. Hilz was collected by Hitler; Nussbaum, an Austrian Jew, was killed at Auschwitz in 1944.
In "Art and Power," distinctions are not always clear between those who served the dictators, those who continued in perilous protest, those who emigrated and those, like Georg Kolbe, who stayed. Kolbe was a lithely classical German sculptor of bronze nudes whose uncharacteristically bombastic "Proclamation" was a focal point of the 1937 German Pavilion. That year, his sculpture was also included in the inaugural exhibition at the House of German Art, where Hitler displayed the art he approved, not in the "Degenerate Art" exhibition in which the confiscated work of most of Kolbe's friends was derided.
When the war ended and Kolbe was reduced to trading sculpture for cigarettes, he made "The Liberated Man," an extraordinary perversion of Rodin's "Thinker," head in hands, in infinite guilt and despair. In the "Art and Power" installation, "Liberated Man" echoes the pose of "Crouching Prisoner in Saint-Cyprien," Nussbaum's firsthand news from the concentration camps.
Totalitarian art is customarily posited as the triumph of muscles over modernism, but "Art and Power," and its accompanying catalogue of essays, suggests a more complex reading of power struggles. Goebbels at first promoted German Expressionism as Nordic Expressionism, suitable as an official Aryan style. In the Soviet Union, Socialist Realism triumphed over the avant-garde artists who had disdained the Realists at the start of the Revolution.
In Italy, Mussolini generally suffered the enthusiasms of the Futurists, and Ambrosi's startling portrait of Il Duce overlays his head on the city of Rome in a filmic dissolve. On the other hand, the independent sculptor Julio Gonzalez indulged in self-censorship, replacing his Cubist totem intended for the 1937 Spanish Pavilion with a stirring, representational peasant woman.
THE BRITISH ORGANIZERS at the Hayward Gallery had invited a consortium of curators to mount shows within shows, in the Guggenheim Museum manner, with a result that sometimes calls to mind divas singing in different keys. Defanged by this evenhanded approach, some of the art and architecture that for so long had been a monstrous secret came across as merely ridiculous to the largely young audience that thronged to the exhibition in London.
"I find some of it quite humorous," said Andrew Eaton, an actor four years out of Oxford. "Over the top," agreed Ilaria D'Elia, an actress recently graduated from the University of London. And Mr. Eaton added: "Hitler's a comic character in Britain. There's a whole song about him."
To Laian Shaw, a university student at Darby, "1930 to 1945," as he dismissively put it, just seems so long ago and far away. "If you consider we are near the end of the millennium, in 50 years there will be a time to do a Yugoslavia show," he said.
In the end, context is essential to an exhibition that asks tough questions about art in the service of power. However hesitant "Art and Power" seems in approaching those questions, they will be thrown into high relief when the exhibition travels to Berlin starting in June. But Lutz Becker, who organized the film portion of the show, would also like the work to be seen in Washington. "That way," he said, "you can contrast it with the Holocaust, the real art of Hitler at the Holocaust Museum."

HEADLINE: STYLE;
Couture Lives!

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach 

 BODY:
Some random thoughts on the recent round of fashion shows in Paris:
A friend sent a note after seeing her first haute couture presentation. "I must admit I was shocked," she wrote, "by the ethics of spending so much money on one outfit while poverty, misery and unemployment surround us on every street corner." This is neither the time nor the space for entering into the perennial debate over the morality of the haute couture. I bring it up only because I'm struck by the fact that though I've heard this objection to fashion a thousand times, I've never heard anyone voice the same outrage over, say, a car. As in: "I've just seen the new Porsche, and I think it's scandalous that in this age of homelessness and destitution . . . ." 
 Karl Lagerfeld's decision to stage the Chanel collection in private suites at the Ritz, rather than on a runway, was unanimously hailed as a return to presentations on a more intimate scale; at such close range, it becomes obvious that the clothes are to a large extent about the workmanship. Designers in Paris seem to feel a sense of responsibility toward the crafts people, coming up with ideas that will keep them employed and their techniques alive. But here in America, when a craft is endangered, we let it die a natural death: if the market can't support it, it's no longer relevant.
Feminist film critics write about the "male gaze" and its power to objectify women. At the men's shows (for spring 1997) that followed on the heels of the haute couture, the male models looked decidedly ill at ease, unaccustomed to being scrutinized the way female models are. Furtive, shy, they shoved their hands in their pockets, took them out, put them in again, their eyes darting from the floor to the ceiling to the exits. The sole exception was Jean Paul Gaultier's models, who, with an air of mock gravity and defiant pride, paraded the red-carpet path laid out between gilt chairs in a suite of rooms in an 18th- century mansion. Titled "Homme Couture," Gaultier's collection offered an outfit for every activity (gardening, horseback riding, bargain hunting) and every occasion (a winter cruise, a gallery opening, a funeral), each with a quaint title and an effusively poetic description. The sheer fuss of it all poked affectionate fun at the haute couture shows we'd just seen -- their fragile magnificence, their precious intricacy, their depiction of Woman-as-Faberge-Egg.

HEADLINE: The Longest War In the World

BYLINE: By Bill Berkeley; Bill Berkeley writes frequently on Africa. This is his first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
THE BORDER REGION BETWEEN Kenya and south Sudan is a harsh, dry, fly-ridden semidesert inhabited by nomadic cattle herders. The Kenyan village of Lokichokio sprouts up incongruously, a surreal boom town where growling cargo planes lift off from a world-class landing strip and sunburned Europeans and Americans populate a steadily expanding metropolis of safarilike huts and trailers. Lokichokio is the staging ground of Operation Lifeline Sudan, the United Nations' long-running, $2-million-a-week relief program that year after year brings precious little relief to the famished victims of Sudan's civil war, the longest war in the world.
On a slow afternoon in Lokichokio, a half-dozen jaded relief workers are sipping Cokes in "the clinic," a thatch-roof, gravel-floor canteen with dartboards and a Ping-Pong table. The talk is angry, demoralized, frankly cynical. It is about the Big Men in south Sudan, the myriad chiefs and warlords and rebel faction leaders with whom the U.N. and independent relief agencies engage in an insidious dance. "They use our food to fuel their war," someone says. "It's a racket with the chiefs. It's like a business cartel." 
 The worst offenders are the two main guerrilla faction leaders, Riek Machar and John Garang. "They don't care how many people die," an American laments. "The lesson they have learned is that if you keep fighting, the West will keep feeding you." An exasperated Brit has an idea: "Has anybody said to Garang or Riek, 'Here's a million dollars. Please go away'?"
Sudan has been at war for 30 of the last 40 years, 13 of the past 17 decades. The current round of fighting is entering its 14th year, with no end in sight. The best guess is that 1.5 million have died since 1983; 85 percent of south Sudan's population has been displaced. South Sudanese, with a mixture of sorrow and shame, reckon they've been bludgeoned back to the Stone Age.
Sudan's war is usually explained as a clash between the Arab and Islamic north and the long-subjugated, Christian and animist black African south. There is truth in this view. But another way of looking at Sudan is as a textbook case of big men using little men, a handful of elites endlessly maneuvering for power and booty while millions perish.
For generations of Sudanese, war has become a self-perpetuating industry. Many suffer, but more than a few are benefiting. Politicians, soldiers, merchants, warlords, gangsters and famine profiteers -- all tirelessly jockey for advantage, heedless of the suffering they cause.
Sudan is a laboratory for disorders common to many of the world's intractable sectarian and ethnic conflicts, from Northern Ireland to Afghanistan to the strife-torn republics of the former Soviet Union. Sudan's big men personify a ruinous symbiosis of religion, ethnicity and organized crime. I have come here to meet some of these men: Garang and Riek, and in the northern capital, Khartoum, Hassan al-Turabi, perhaps the biggest man in Sudan -- the cast of characters at the top, on all sides, whose interests and machinations and evasions of responsibility might illuminate the pathology of an endless war.
SLOUCHING LANGUIDLY IN ITS DESERT isolation at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, dusty, dilapidated, oven-hot Khartoum seems a universe apart from the war in south Sudan. Aside from the moonscape of fetid refugee camps on its distant periphery, where a million displaced southerners languish in humiliating beggary, Khartoum does not have the feel of a capital at war. The edge in its otherwise somnolent air derives from the pervasive presence of informers for Hassan al-Turabi's secret police.
Turabi greets his visitors in a plain stucco villa on a quiet side street near the center of Khartoum, the headquarters of his power base, the National Islamic Front. "Islam is a current," he says. "Islam means submission to God exclusively, submission to a higher power." He is the brains behind the military regime of Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who seized power in 1989 and has ruled Sudan ever since through sheer terror. Turabi has achieved international notoriety because of his alleged support for terrorists and because of his avowed ambition to lead an Islamist crusade from Algiers to Damascus. But his power is rooted in the skeletal remains of Sudan. It was at a rare moment when peace appeared to be at hand, in the spring of 1989, that Turabi's Islamists took control of the Government and reignited the war. They have scuttled all efforts to end it ever since.
Turabi is a diminutive man with soft hands and a white wisp of a beard. A lawyer by training, with a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne, he speaks with a nervous giggle and has an ingratiating smile. "There is a vacuum now," he tells me. "That vacuum is being filled by an Islamist spirit. I just happened naturally to have been on the track where history is moving." Embittered Sudanese have another explanation for Turabi's years-long, ruthlessly cunning rise to power. "Islamic Leninism," they call it, a vicious little police state operating under a cloak of piety.
Turabi's National Islamic Front is ideally suited to the demands and opportunities of permanent war. It is an ingenious hybrid, a cross between a theocracy and a Mafia syndicate. True believers provide the cannon fodder, in the form of a heavily indoctrinated Islamist militia modeled after Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Meanwhile, an elite cabal of generals, Islamic bankers, arms merchants, currency swindlers, land appropriators, cattle raiders, oil prospectors and outright slave traders -- through the patronage of their godfather, Turabi -- muscle their way into the profits of war.
Sudan's big men have excelled in their peculiar environment by mastering two intertwined requirements of power. The first is the art of manipulating potent symbols, masking one's personal agenda in a larger, legitimizing cause. It must be a cause that justifies extreme measures, and for which people are willing to sacrifice their lives.
The second requirement is to attach this larger cause to the economic forces that predominate in conditions of total anarchy. In the war-ravaged wilderness of south Sudan, where most of the country's natural resources lie, the challenge for the successful power broker is to ride the predatory elements: to harness them, tax them if possible, arm them if necessary and amass enough power to liquidate them before they can liquidate you.
For Turabi, the mask is Islam. Religion has long been the political lever of last resort; economic crises and interminable war have all but completely eroded the legitimacy of the state. In the north, Islam is the one potent symbol Arab political forces have been able to rely on for popular support.
The 19th-century Sudanese nationalist known as the Mahdi first invoked Islam as a unifying force in the popular uprising against Turko-Egyptian rule, which yielded Sudan's first theocratic state. The British, in turn, during their subsequent half-century of colonial rule, cultivated Islamic sects as the basis for rival political parties. When the regime of Gen. Gaafar al-Nimiery began to crumble in 1983, the dictator played the Islamic card, declaring Sharia, or Koranic law. This relegated Sudan's four million non-Muslim southerners to second-class status, starting the current round of war.
War legitimizes an Islamist regime with a cause that faithful Muslims cannot oppose. Turabi's relentless and highly sophisticated propaganda portrays the war as a Western and Zionist plot against Islam. A recent fatwa, or religious decree, exhorted the faithful to jihad, or holy war, on the grounds that southern rebels "directed their major efforts toward the killing of Muslims, the sabotage of mosques, the burning of the Koran and its desecration with filth. . . . Zionists, Crusaders and the Arrogants incited them to do this and provide them with arms and supplies."
Then of course there's money to be made, particularly petrodollars. As far back as the 1970's, Turabi and his allies, deftly applying Saudi-backed financial favors and ideological indoctrination, began systematically insinuating themselves into key institutions, notably the military and the banking system. Through Islamic banks, they now exercise a virtual monopoly on access to capital.
Turabi, alas, is bored with my questions about the war. As we talk, the Sudanese air force is bombing refugee camps in south Sudan, scattering 200,000 into the bush. Turabi would rather not dwell on it. "Now, I'm really not too involved in the south," he sighs, waving aside my questions with his soft hand. A war in his own country, one of the great humanitarian catastrophes of the late 20th century -- but Turabi has bigger fish to fry.
 FROM THE WINDOW OF A 10seater prop plane circling high over south Sudan, the village of Akobo, on the Ethiopian border, appears to be an orderly constellation of circular huts with straw fences. As the plane begins its descent, you see signs of the malignancy that brings us here. Rows of blackened, roofless huts come into view, and the surrounding fields are abandoned. More than 24,000 people have been scattered from their homes recently by internecine fighting among local clans.
A blizzard of flies wafts over us as we disembark on a sodden grass landing strip. Faces press all around: taut with hunger, wide-eyed and expectant, electric with the promise of manna from heaven. Operation Lifeline Sudan has sent this plane to deliver medicine for the local clinic.
The big man in Akobo is Riek Machar, leader of a breakaway faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the South Sudan Independence Movement, which once controlled nearly all of south Sudan but now has lost most of it to the Government. In August 1991, Riek, as he is known, made a fateful bid to seize control of the S.P.L.A. from its founding leader, John Garang. It didn't work. Instead, Riek's failed coup metastasized into a catastrophic war between the Nuer and the Dinka, the two largest ethnic groups in south Sudan. Thousands were slaughtered; several hundred thousand died in the resulting famine. The rebels were split in two, then in three, then four.
"I really don't have any regrets," Riek assures me. We are sitting now in his dirt-floor, mud-wall compound, swatting the flies, guarded by a dozen listless teen-age rebels in shorts and flip-flops, Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders. Riek is an attractive man in his 40's, smoothly affable, a little cocky. He, too, has a Ph.D., from the University of Bradford in England. He wears pressed fatigues with a red beret and bright red monogrammed shoulder boards that set him strikingly apart from the rabble around us. A barefoot attendant shines the big man's combat boots as we talk.
"Garang was responsible for the ills of the movement," Riek continues. "It's his leadership that was responsible, not mine." A particularly wanton massacre by Riek's troops was "unfortunate," he admits, but it wasn't his fault. "I don't feel responsible for the deaths. We all went to fight for our liberation. So we pay a high price." Riek once promised to investigate the massacre. The result? "If any atrocities were committed, it was not necessarily sanctioned by the leadership." Anybody held accountable? "In a big fight, you don't know who did this. It was a big fight."
If Turabi's mask is religion, the symbolic cover for Garang and Riek is race. Theirs is the cause of black southerners against a historic injustice. At least since the Ottomans instituted slavery in the 19th century -- in parts of Sudan, it flourishes to this day -- northern Arabs have dominated all spheres of Sudanese life: politics, development, the civil service, education. Black southerners do the dirty work -- not least in war. In the Sudanese People's Armed Forces, the Government army, 90 percent of the rank and file are southerners, while 96 percent of the officer corps come from northern or central Sudan. In the first five years of the current war, when three-quarters of a million southerners died, only 3,000 northern government troops were killed. Ninety-five percent of the combatants on both sides were southerners who fought for a variety of reasons, from paychecks to outright coercion.
Still, most southerners readily identify with the southern cause. Garang and Riek undoubtedly believe in it, too. Yet for them it is not just a goal worth fighting for but an inoculation from any personal accountability. Garang, when I ask him about the suffering of south Sudanese, tells me: "The Islamic Arab agenda is the cause of the war and the source of the suffering. It is a choice between slavery and freedom. What is life worth to be at peace when you are a slave in your own country?"
Garang and Riek both talk a good game. Yet they, no less than Turabi, rely on utter ruthlessness to survive in it. Like Turabi they are masters of the Machiavellian arts: of purges and shifting alliances, playing rivals off against one another -- and riding the criminal class. Like Turabi's National Islamic Front, the S.P.L.A. is a well-adapted hybrid, at once a genuine liberation movement and a loose confederation of ethnically based criminal gangs. The 1991 split, with its bifurcation along ethnic lines, was akin to what happens when Mafia dons fall out. When the big man's survival was at stake, ethnicity became useful.
"I was with Garang for eight years," Riek tells me. "I have witnessed the lack of democracy, his dictatorial measures. I have seen the abuses of human rights."
It took him eight years to see the light, but Riek is right about Garang. The S.P.L.A. began its war against the north in 1983 with broad popular support across the south. But its character was shaped by its principal backer, the former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, and by Mengistu's backer, the Soviet Union. Garang now discounts his pact with the devil as a "marriage of convenience," given Khartoum's cold war alliance with the West. Based in Ethiopia, the S.P.L.A. never developed the grass-roots support of a classic guerrilla struggle. Across the south in its heyday the S.P.L.A. behaved like an occupying army. Civilians remain the main military targets. All factions seek to destroy communities presumed to be supporting their opponents. In far-flung scorched-earth sweeps, minimally trained, totally illiterate, heavily armed fighters torch villages, steal the livestock and food, plant land mines, conscript the young men and boys and rape the women and girls.
Garang's explicit strategy was to render south Sudan ungovernable, and in that he succeeded. The south today is not only ungovernable but virtually uninhabitable. Garang, to exculpate himself, will tell me that "for every 100 men I recruit, I may have two thieves." He has recruited roughly 180,000 men over the last 12 years. That would mean 3,600 thieves. Heavily armed by Garang and deployed in conditions of absolute lawlessness, many have become powerful thieves indeed.
It was the collapse of Mengistu's regime in Ethiopia in 1991 that precipitated the split in the S.P.L.A. The new Ethiopian regime kicked the S.P.L.A. out, and a power struggle ensued. It became the Nuer chief, Riek, against the Dinka chief, Garang. Khartoum pumped in guns and bribes, doing everything in its power to provoke and exploit ethnic divisions. "Aktul al-abid bil abid," they say in Khartoum. The phrase is from 19th-century Sudan, when Arab slave traders dominated the state and decimated the south by pitting one black African tribe against another. It means "Kill the slave through the slave."
 THREE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF AKOBO, John Garang holds court in a makeshift, thatch-roof-and-canvas guerrilla command post in the rugged bush near the Kenyan border. The S.P.L.A. commander is reachable after several hours of bouncing and lurching in a four-wheel-drive along dirt tracks through the remote mountain reaches of south Sudan. After four years of fighting with Riek's breakaway faction and renewed Government offensives, Garang's turf for the moment is reduced to a tenuous sliver on the southernmost frontier with Kenya and Uganda. "Of course, we are not trying to achieve a military victory," Garang tells me. "We cannot win this war."
Garang is a bearish man in pressed camouflage fatigues, charming, smart, even funny. His Ph.D. comes from Iowa State University. He certainly doesn't talk like a thug. He says things like: "The engine which drives the war is injustice. The regimes since independence have failed to evolve a sociopolitical commonality that transcends localism. Governments have moved toward parasitism, Arabism, Islamism."
Yet when I ask Garang about the rampant criminality of troops under his command, he dodges and weaves, blames Khartoum and changes the subject. "We are certainly not angels," he finally admits. "You will hear these charges. You will also hear about the popularity of the S.P.L.A. There are positive things, and there are negative things. There are individuals who rape and steal. But what I want to underline is that it is not the movement."
Does Garang have any regrets? "I don't believe so," he says. "War is regrettable. It results in destruction and suffering. But human beings have gone to war from time to time. People have fought for ideals that are worth fighting for."
The latest news is that Riek is in retreat and that Garang is on the rebound. Garang's forces recently attacked the Nuer village of Ganyliel, killing 210 villagers, including 127 children, according to Human Rights Watch/Africa. In a new offensive, his forces have recaptured parts of the south from which they were expelled three years ago, advancing to within 20 miles of Juba, the southern capital. Garang is being rearmed with help from Sudan's neighbors. Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Egypt all fear Khartoum's support for armed Islamist groups; Egypt, for one, blamed Turabi for last year's attempt to assassinate its President, Hosni Mubarak.
Few doubt that the Clinton Administration has had a hand in Garang's revival -- he passed through Washington just before Christmas. Last month, the Administration withdrew its Ambassador and embassy staff from Khartoum, accusing Sudan of providing sanctuary for some of the world's most violent terrorist groups. The U.N. has warned of economic sanctions unless the Government surrenders the suspects in the Mubarak assassination attempt, and the International Monetary Fund is threatening to expel Sudan for falling in arrears on its staggering $16 billion foreign debt.
The United States and Israel share an interest with Sudan's immediate neighbors in containing an aggressive Islamist regime. So the pressure is on Khartoum, and policy makers may believe that arming Garang could increase it. But surely that is just pouring more fuel on the fire. The big men will adjust their calculations; the little men will keep on dying.
As our truck bounces back through the bush toward the Kenyan border, I find myself thinking not of Riek, or Garang, or Turabi but of a 24-year-old U.N. radio operator named Peter Gatreak, who had been my guide in Akobo. He was a delightful companion, warm and curious, and like so many in this part of the world, physically striking: tall and thin as a toothpick, pitch-black, with huge teeth and four parallel scars across his forehead -- the markings of the Nuer. Like everyone in Akobo, Peter's life has been one long series of uprootings and losses. He was a refugee in Ethiopia for seven years. His father was killed in the war. His mother died from hunger. Aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, in-laws, cousins, friends -- "so many" also died. "We are suffering indeed from hunger," Peter tells me. He has never been to school. He has no memory of peace. He has no ambitions for his week-old son, beyond, he says, "I hope he will survive."

HEADLINE: L.I. a Key to Future Of 3-State Region

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND'S fate is inseparably wedded to the future of a three-state metropolitan region that faces irreversible economic, environmental and social decline over the next 25 years, the Regional Plan Association is forecasting.
The association, with headquarters in Manhattan, said sweeping steps that it outlined last month in a $75 billion plan would avert the decline and make the region globally competitive, instead of a victim of growth and congestion. 
 In broad terms, the plan argues for creating greenswards, transportation changes like new tolls or taxes that would combat congestion, the revival of downtown centers and suburban rezoning to create new centers. The plan also calls for additional commuter and freight rail service, with new regional and national connections.
For employment, the study champions education and job training for an "information-based economy," an increased sense of links between economic advances and social equity in housing and jobs for a region that will be less than half white by 2020 and governmental changes to weld the region into a cohesive economic and social unit.
If even partly adopted, the plan could inspire significant changes in land use, driving, rail service, education, government and life in general on Long Island and throughout the region. It argues for recognition that Nassau and Suffolk, like other counties surrounding New York City, are part of an intertwined megametropolitan region that has to begin to work as one or wither.
Putting the plan into effect would require major support from influential private and public groups, broad public backing and a long series of government actions on virtually all levels.
In one of five "calls to action," the plan proposes reserves for Long Island covering the Atlantic Coast, Long Island Sound, the Peconic Estuary, the pine barrens, farmland and selected open spaces. The reserves, part of a system of 11 reserves that the plan proposes for the entire region, would be intended to protect natural resources and water, as well as provide a natural and recreational setting to retain and attract residents and business.
"To insure our economic foundation, we need to lock in quality of life," the executive director of the group and a co-author of the plan, Robert D. Yaro, said. "What's changed in the world economy is that people and companies are no longer bolted down in a region. Now they can go anywhere, and they will go where the quality of life is best."
The plan organization said that an agreement in June among builders, environmentalists, planners and other officials that created a 100,000-acre pine barrens preserve on eastern Long Island was the prototype for the other reserves, as well as additional initiatives. The association took part in formulating the plan for the pine barrens.
Describing Long Island as choked by traffic congestion, the association advised against building or expanding roads because of historical evidence that such projects only increased traffic. Instead, it suggested the electronic collection of tolls on thoroughfares like the Long Island Expressway, with the money helping to finance road maintenance and mass transit.
The tolls could be collected at peak times, to encourage off-peak traveling, car pools and ridership on mass transit.
The system, which the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and some bridges are testing, would have roadside or overhead transmitters to bounce signals off sensors on windshields or elsewhere on the front of the vehicle. Computers would debit drivers' accounts, and vehicles would not have to reduce speed.
Mr. Yaro said such an approach, called market pricing, reflected the true public cost of using roads and was similar to telephone or utility rates that varied according to the time of day. "What we use now," he said, "is the old Soviet bread-line approach -- get to the end of the line."
"We are not asking people to throw away their car keys," Mr. Yaro added. "We are simply suggesting that for trips to congested places during peak hours you need to give people alternatives."
The plan predicted a 700 percent increase in the number of employees who work at home, using computers, rather than commuting to central offices.
Mr. Yaro said it was unclear whether such a trend would mean less road congestion or have other unexpected effects. "Nobody really knows what the effect of computers and the Internet will be," he said. "It could be larger than we expect."
He said congestion that delayed commuters and trucks cost an estimated $6 billion a year in the region.
Toll revenues would go to an infrastructure bank, to assure that they would not be diverted.
Mr. Yaro said an alternative would be a 10-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. "Quite honestly," he said, "the gasoline tax is the obvious one. Gas is cheaper than Perrier. People wouldn't even notice a 10 percent gas tax."
But some critics have begun to speak out about the long-term plan.
"It flies in the face of current political trends," the president of the Long Island Association, Matthew T. Crosson, said. "At a time when people are complaining about excessive taxes the plan proposes tolls on roadways or a 10-cent gasoline tax. People feel they are overtaxed already. So this is a very heavy lift. Tolls on the Long Island Expressway would be wildly unpopular."
Mr. Crosson said the assessment of the future was overly gloomy but valuable as a wake-up call.
The executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Lee E. Koppelman, said financing for the $75 billion program was within the grasp of the governing bodies without their having to resort to tolls or new taxes. "Seventy-five billion dollars over 25 years is $3 billion a year," he said. "New York alone has a budget of $66 million. What's $3 billion a year to three states?"
Mr. Koppelman said parts of the plan that dealt with Long Island were "the same thing we have been saying and doing for years."
"The importance of the plan is not that there are new ideas," he said. "What they are really saying is that if the Northeast doesn't make investments in infrastructure we are going to be in trouble."
The plan proposed new rail links to provide a "seamless" regional passenger system and expanding freight service. Such steps might include connections for Long Island Rail Road passenger service to Grand Central Terminal, the phasing out of changes at Jamaica, a rail line from Jamaica to Kennedy International Airport and connecting the Port Washington line to the subway tunnel at 63d Street in Manhattan. That line might offer service from 57th Street to downtown, including City Hall and the World Trade Center.
The West Hempstead and Oyster Bay lines would be converted to a Cross-Nassau Light Rail operation,"to provide higher degree of access along a north-south spine through Nassau County."
The proposals for freight include a tunnel between New Jersey and Long Island or a tunnel from New Jersey under Manhattan to Long Island. The plan also suggested examining an increase in freight movements over the Hell Gate Bridge in Astoria.
Long Island would also have "double-stack" container trains.
"There has been a revolution in freight movement in this country," Mr. Yaro said. "Nationally 40 percent of freight is moved by rail."
But the revolution ended at the Hudson River, he said, because of a lack of crossings and because "the Long Island Rail Road is not well connected to the national freight system."
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is pursuing the sale of the L.I.R.R. freight service to a private operator. The railroad cut back on efforts to expand freight service after having suffered financial losses.
The plan is the third by the Regional Plan Association. The group issued its first in 1929, a study that recommended major roads and other public works to accommodate growth outward from the city.
The 1996 effort envisions revitalizing downtown areas like Hicksville and Mineola, refocusing commercial and residential cores near railroad lines and "filling in" decentralized and more recently developed areas like Hauppauge to create full-service regional centers.
The new centers would reduce the average seven car trips that Long Island drivers make daily to shop, go to work, attend school and perform other tasks. The plan calls for educational changes and job training to groom a work force "with the skills demanded by an information-based economy" and to "allow low-skilled, minority and immigrant workers to fully participate on the mainstream economy."
Changes in local governments and regional authorities are required, the group said, to build and manage "a world-class infrastructure," cut regulations and taxes and focus on regional, not purely local, needs.
A globally competitive economy fueled by public investment, a protected environment that offers recreational and amenities and social equity among ethnic groups and income groups would be the foundation for quality of life.
The plan defines the region as 31 counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with 20 million people and a $500 billion annual economy.
The region, the association said, has to function as an aggregate to take advantage of its immense wealth and global significance, and the report added that studies showed that regions suffered when cities in their midst declined.
"Economists," the study said, "recognize that metropolitan regions -- not cities, not suburbs, not even countries -- are the building blocks of the 21st century and that regions that will thrive are regions that have strong centers, as well as healthy suburbs."
Noting that employment in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region increased 8 percent from 1982 to 1992, as compared to 46 percent in the Seattle-Tacoma and Atlanta areas, the report said:
"The question posed is whether the next 25 years will represent the final chapter in the period of prosperity and momentum that dates to the settlement of Manhattan in the 17th century. The warning is that modest growth in the next few years could mask the beginning of a long, slow and potentially irreversible and tragic decline."
Long Island lost 93,000 jobs from 1988 to 1992, according to the State Labor Department. The diminishing military industries in the recession, coinciding with the end of the cold war, accounted for many losses, planners and economists have said.
The plan proposed steps that many competitors have already taken, Mr. Yaro said. "Virtually all of the recommendations in this plan," he added, "are being implemented in one way or another from Atlanta to Los Angeles to Tokyo to London."
Mr. Yaro, who often visits his father in Southold, said efforts to preserve greenswards on Long Islandwere close to his heart. "I watched this island get paved," he said. "So much of it has been destroyed. And yet so much of it is still here."

HEADLINE: Longer Perspectives on the Moses Epoch

BYLINE: By ELLEN KIRSCHNER POPPER 

 BODY:
USING drawings, models, photographs and original artifacts, many of them never displayed, an exhibition at the Museums of Stony Brook, "Robert Moses and the Shaping of New York," chronicles the life and work of the man who had a profound influence on Long Island life.
Master Builder, or Power Broker? as Robert Caro called him in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography. 
 Those born after 1967, when Moses' power began to wane, probably do not have much awareness of his influence.
"I was kind of surprised, but people under 35 don't even know who Robert Moses was," said the chief curator, William Ayres, who developed the exhibition with Alison Cornish, director of the Bridgehampton Historical Society.
To complement the show, which is on view through May 12, a symposium of architects, planners, scholars and others will convene on Saturday in Stony Brook to discuss "Robert Moses: The Long Island Legacy.
The conference is being held at a time when planners contend that unless priorities shift toward improving public transportation and preserving open space, the New York metropolitan region may suffer crippling economic decline.
Critics fault Moses for neglecting to provide for public transportation. Defenders credit him with creating Long Island's spacious public beaches and parks.
Mr. Ayres said he hoped that the conference would "encourage meaningful, respectful and thoughtful dialogue about the issues."
"There are people who think Robert Moses was God, especially older people and people who might have worked with him or known him in some way," Mr. Ayres added. "Then you get other people who think he was a demon. Hopefully these people will at least listen to the other side."
In his 50-year career Moses held 14 state, regional and city offices, some concurrently. He built parks and playgrounds, beaches and bridges, highways and housing.
Mr. Ayres said he conceived of the exhibition while working with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on an exhibition about art in the subway. "I stumbled on Robert Moses artifacts that had never seen the light of day," he recounted. "Some wonderful renderings of proposals that the T.B.T.A. had are in this show."
The M.T.A. administers the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an agency that Moses created.
Mr. Ayres asked Ms. Cornish, who was recently curator of a show about historic beaches of Long Island, to assist him.
The display includes objects like a wood-and-canvas beach chair and an umbrella in the signature green-and-orange stripes of Jones Beach and Moses' signature felt fedora.
It was as president of the Long Island State Park Commission, a post he held from 1924 to 1963, that Moses exerted his greatest influence on the local landscape.
From that tenure stems the legacy of Jones Beach, Heckscher State Park, Sunken Meadow State Park and a scenic network of winding parkways -- the Northern State, the Southern State, the Wantagh and the Meadowbrook -- that connect the parks.
Some critics contend that his work on Long Island also produced one of its most pressing problems, perpetual gridlock on the roadways that were at the core of his designs.
"For mass transportation, Robert Moses had a complete and utter disregard and disdain," Mr. Ayres said. "When he talked about subways his face would go into an absolute sneer."
The failure to plan for public transportation is a major weakness of Moses' work on the Island, said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "However," Mr. Koppelman said, "whether one would fault Moses for that -- when I look across the country, post-Henry Ford, this country had such a massive love affair with the automobile that I don't know if you could fault Moses. He was just reflecting the public policy from the national Government on down."
Mr. Koppelman is one of five speakers at the conference who will place Moses in a broad historical and cultural context. "When I grew up, Moses was like the second coming of Moses," said Mr. Koppelman, who both in his current post and also as director of the Suffolk County Planning Commission worked closely with Moses from 1960 until Moses officially resigned and then informally until Moses' death in 1981.
"In 1960 my first relations were when Moses put through the New York State Land Acquisition Bond Act," Mr. Koppelman said. "I prepared the plan for Suffolk County and worked very closely with him and his staff. And Suffolk County got the lion's share of the money allocated for all the counties of the State of New York, thanks to Moses."
Even Moses' harshest critics consider Jones Beach, which opened on Aug. 4, 1929, to be one of his finest achievements. But by today's environmental standards, the park destroyed precious natural wetlands.
"It's unfair to criticize him for that," said R. Marc Fasanella, assistant professor of graphic design and visual communication at Southampton College who will speak on "Moses, Jones Beach and Ecology."
. "Radical environmentalism didn't exist then." Instead, the country was in the grip of a "machine mentality."
Moses dredged the bays and dumped 14 feet of sand on top of the existing beach to prevent washouts, Mr. Fasanella said, adding: "Jones Beach is not a natural landscape. It looks natural, but it is man-made. Moses obliterated the natural landscape, but he kept it public."
The alternative, Mr. Fasanella said, would have been unchecked development similar to that in Long Beach. In the design of the bathhouses and pavilions Moses promoted "the quality of architecture that we should be striving for today," Mr. Fasanella said, commenting: "By current ecological standards Jones Beach is an abomination. But by the standards of his time it was progressive. We have to judge him according to the conservation concepts of his time."
John Kriskiewicz, a lecturer at the School of Professional Studies at the Cooper Union in Manhattan, will discuss "Long Island's Historic Parkways: Past, Present and Future." His talk will focus on the genesis and execution of the parkway idea.
"Moses conceived of the parkway not just as a means to get from point A to point B, but as a linear park," Mr. Kriskiewicz said. He plans to showcase "the designers whose work we enjoy every day but don't even know their names."
They include landscape architects like Gilmore D. Clarke and Clarence Coombs and architects like Herbert Magoon.
"Other areas that suburbanized during the same period have the same problems with the roadways," Mr. Kriskiewicz said, "but they don't have the things that the parkways did give. The parkways did preserve the feeling on Long Island of a rustic, rural simplicity. I often say that without the Long Island parkways Long Island would be New Jersey."
Peter R. Bales, a history professor at C. W. Post, said, "I'll be talking about one of Moses' rare failures," a plan to build a bridge between Oyster Bay and Rye in Westchester County.
"It was supposed to be the crown jewel of his construction projects," Professor Bales said. "But community opposition and changing times made it impossible to do. The days when someone like Robert Moses could have enough power just to build where he wanted to build -- those days were gone."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Port Richmond, S.I.;
Eclectic Housing, Traditional Diversity

BYLINE: By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
PORT RICHMOND is but a country village now . . . A trolley runs along the shore and one runs up [Port] Richmond Ave. . . . Standing in front of this building there are 18 houses in sight."
This excerpt of a note written by 19-year-old Edmund Joseph Nolan in 1904 was found in a citrate of magnesia bottle when the back wall of the Port Richmond Library was torn down to expand the structure in 1938 as a W.P.A. project. (The project also included the recently refurbished Faber Park Pool just north of the library). The letter is exhibited to commemorate the library's 90th year. 
 The description remains accurate regarding Port Richmond's location on Staten Island -- abutting the Kill van Kull on the North Shore.
But today a visitor sees many more houses, several churches, a park, a school and a senior-housing center surrounding the library, and the Martin Luther King Expressway off the Bayonne Bridge defining its western border. Buses have replaced trolleys, but the village square design is preserved.
And so is much of the housing stock. "More than 50 percent was built prior to 1938," said Kathleen Bielsa, housing development coordinator of the Northfield Community Local Development Corporation. Such architectural styles as Italianate, colonial, Victorian, Second Empire, Gothic Revival and urban rowhouse are represented.
The corporation is helping residents take their first steps toward defining some of the area as a historic district, meeting with the borough's Preservation League. The corporation's first forays into historic preservation were quite successful; the senior residence is housed in a former public school building.
The reclamation of this 1891 building, which the Board of Education had abandoned and the city had condemned, began with its becoming a city landmark. The name of the 43-unit Parkside Senior Apartments refers to its proximity to the village square's Veterans Memorial Park.
"I took a tour in the area with the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Corporation, and they were amazed that every block has housing representing different eras from historical to recently built," Mrs. Bielsa said.
The community's commercial strip, Port Richmond Avenue, specializes in home improvement, with such stores as Antique Brass Works and Enjo Architectural Mill as well as cabinet makers, furniture, lumber and home-decorating establishments.
"These stores cater to personalized needs with customized products," said Michael Accornero, vice president of the Port Richmond Board of Trade and owner of Community Hardware.
This focus on serving merchandising niches is hard won for merchants here; before the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge or the mall were built, Port Richmond Avenue was considered the Fifth Avenue of Staten Island.
The Staten Island Mall's location at the gateway of the island's South Shore signaled a shift in population. With housing developments rising in the middle and south end of Staten Island and the declining interest in downtown shopping avenues, Port Richmond saw stores move away or close.
But the area came back with large strip centers, anchored by Pathmark and Waldbaum's supermarkets.
Along the southern boundary of Port Richmond, residents refer to the stores as Port Richmond Center or Forest Avenue Shoppers' Town.
There are many fast-food outlets to satisfy the busy shoppers in the strip centers. But for leisurely dining, perhaps the best-known restaurant is Gene's, serving Italian cusine.
And in the summertime, Ralph's Famous Ices at Port Richmond Avenue and Catherine Street is a mecca for those wanting to beat the heat.
CONVENIENT stores and lower house prices -- about 20 percent less than the south shore's mostly newer stock -- have attracted younger families to the neighborhood. Rachel Gannon, who owns Rachel Gannon Realty, said young families from the South Shore were leaving town houses with no storage space and looking for detached houses with yards. "Single-family detached homes predominate, with two-families and a few semidetached newer homes in spots," she said.
Single-family houses can cost from a low of $79,000 for a "fixer-upper," according to Mrs. Gannon, to as high as $225,000 for "a big Tudor."
Single-family houses now listed or recently sold, said Patricia Turvey Dellomo, owner of Turvey Dellomo Associates, range from $130,000 to $162,000, with two-family houses at $150,000 to $189,000.
These prices are attracting city employees like firefighters and sanitation workers. "They're in their price range," said Mr. Accornero, noting that a fireman and two sanitation workers and their families had moved to his block.
This is reversing the declines of the 60's, 70's and 80's, which hit their nadir 5 to 10 years ago when schools were shutting down because of a lack of students.
Public School 20 abandoned its old building for a new one. St. Mary's of the Assumption Roman Catholic School saw its population plummet from 268 in 1973 to 78 in 1988 and in 1989 the building was converted to an early childhood center for 3- and 4-year-olds. But St. Roch's Catholic School held on and still serves students from kindergarten to fifth grade.
Now grade schools have to cope with crowding.
Cheryl Accornero, Michael's wife, is president of the Parents Association for P.S. 21, which Amanda, 10, and Justin, 7, attend. "When Amanda was in kindergarten, the school's population was 250 and now it's 435," she said.
The school is scheduled to receive prefabricated buildings for September and is considering leasing a Montessori school two blocks away.
ALL the children at our school walk to school -- there's no busing -- so we want to keep kids close," Mrs. Accornero added.
The Accorneros live at 54 Homestead Avenue in a three-bedroom colonial with a frontyard and a backyard for children to play in. "But we also like to use the playground behind I.S. 51," Mrs. Accornero noted.
Intermediate School 51, with 1,200 students, has one computer lab with 33 computers and a computer in the library for research.
"We're getting a second computer room in September, increasing the total to 67," said the principal, Arnold Raffone.
Port Richmond High School added a wing, which opened two years ago, and has been renovating the rest of the school, replacing stairways, tiles, the auditorium, gym and classrooms, even adding new paint to match the new wing, said Robert Mathews, president of the school's alumni association and a former teacher who taught there for 30 years. The school opened in 1928.
"We're in the last phase -- the school will be finished in September," said Charles Appelblatt, the assistant principal. That opening will show off the school's television production studio, robotics lab and universal weight room.
"I'm a great believer in public education and I'm delighted that my children are growing up with Mexicans, Albanians, African-Americans, Asians and Indians," Mrs. Accornero said. The ethnic diversity of the schools reflects the neighborhood's.
Ninety percent of Port Richmond High's graduates go on to college.
Newer immigrants have been attracted to the area by rentals in its older four- and five-story walk-ups as well as by cottage-style one-family homes.
The newcomers follow an earlier influx of Scandinavians who were drawn to the community as shipbuilders during World War I. By the early 30's, many shipyards were forced to close and some Scandinavians returned home. In the 30's, the neighborhood library, referred to locally as the Port Richmond League of Nations, added collections in Norwegian, German, Spanish, Polish and Italian.
In 1937, the Directory of New York State Manufacturers listed 34 medium and large concerns in the Port Richmond area. And by 1942, the shipyards were back, working 24-hour shifts, before their demise in the 50's.
The Scandinavian Lutheran Zion Church, which was built in 1921, was sold in 1966 to become the St. Phillips Baptist Church, with a predominantly black congregation. The area's other houses of worship include Temple Emanu-el, built in 1907, and the Reformed Church, built by the Dutch in 1715, destroyed by fire during the Revolutionary War and rebuilt in 1787. The current structure is its third, built in 1844. Its burial ground dates to 1704.
"This is an area that doesn't give up," said Joan Catalano, executive director of the development corporation."There's lots of community spirit -- it's a community working together." Arthur Cappabianca, the president of the Decker Avenue Civic Association, which was started in 1948, agreed, adding:
"Everybody knows everybody and knows that, if they have a problem, we're just a phone call away."

HEADLINE: The Continuing Fallout Of Business Downsizing

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
FORECASTS for Connecticut's economy have been as chilly as a gale in winter, with economists anticipating that most areas will be suffering for another year. And economic indicators are only part of the picture. A recent study reveals worsening social problems in the state and a gloomy attitude about the future.
"There's a conspiracy of silence about the real issues affecting people in Connecticut. The decline in social health is greater in the state than it is in the nation," said Marc Miringoff, director of the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy and author of a report entitled "The Social State of Connecticut '95." 
 The report, commissioned by the General Assembly as a guide for shaping public policy, contains results of a study of the state's quality of life. Indicators like unemployment, wages, health care costs, child abuse and adolescent suicide were used to evaluate social health.
State Representative Patricia Widlitz, a member of the Legislature's Planning and Development Committee, disagreed with Mr. Miringoff's "conspiracy of silence" view.
"I'm not aware of any silence out there," she said. "People are painfully aware of what's happening to things like their health care, which they can no longer take for granted." But, she said, middle-class people have certainly been hit hard by shifting economic forces.
The bright spot, it is agreed, is small business, largely service and information industries, but sometimes farming and related operations, which are attempting to diversify.
Many residents surveyed in the study said their standard of living had worsened substantially, and they expected it to continue deteriorating or stay the same over the next five years. The study found improvement in four categories: infant mortality, teen-age parenthood, average weekly wages and affordable housing. But there were problems in seven other areas: child abuse, adolescent suicide, high school completion, unemployment, health care costs, violent crime and the gap between rich and poor. The study also made the following points.
* Workers face the prospect of stagnating incomes. Though manufacturing wages have risen, manufacturing business has dwindled and is hiring fewer workers. The service sector, where wages are lower, has taken on a steadily growing proportion of the work force since 1970.
* The average per capita cost for hospital care, physician services and prescription drugs has risen from 4.8 percent of per capita income in 1970 to 8.1 percent today.
* The number of people without health insurance rose sharply -- from 9.7 percent of the state's population in 1992 to 12 percent in 1993.
* While the housing market has improved, rental costs remain high. The average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in 1994 was $793, which represents 111.4 percent of minimum-wage pay. Connecticut ranked second highest, behind only Hawaii, in rental costs compared to income.
* The gap between rich and poor is widening, with the difference in personal income between the poorest and richest counties increasing sharply between 1992 and 1993.
There was a connection between the state's economic growth and social health between 1959 and 1973. But a new pattern emerged between 1973 and the present, said Mr. Miringoff. The gross domestic product continues to rise, but social health drops. The greatest distance between economic growth and social health occurred in 1994.
"An encouraging economic forecast doesn't necessarily mean the quality of life increases," Mr. Miringoff said. "You have economic recovery in the numbers, but it's not lifting the quality of life as it once did. This has to be heard by sympathetic ears in the corridors of power. There has to be public recognition of the true condition and a public voice."
The study recommends adoption of a law requiring a council of social policy advisors to the governor, an annual report on the social health of the state and a committee of the General Assembly to conduct hearings on the report.
A bill requiring an annual report on social conditions in Connecticut as well as the council of advisors and the hearings was introduced last year; the bill passed the House but died in the Senate. The Human Services Committee expects to approve the bill again in the current legislative session, said State Representative Christel Truglia, a committee member.
Ms. Truglia said she was not surprised by the report's findings. "I think we are aware of it every day, although we need to be accountable to the public," she said. "A report is one way to do that and to evaluate funding and priorities."
By last October, Connecticut had regained only about 20 percent of the jobs lost during the recession. Other New England states have gained back 40 percent to 140 percent of jobs lost, said Donald Klepper-Smith, a corporate economist for Southern New England Telecommunications.
One reason for the state's slow recovery, he added, is that its industries, including insurance and military contractors, have been particularly vulnerable to continued downsizings and mergers. Another reason is that business costs, which have the greatest influence on job growth, have been nearly 10 percent higher than the national average for the last decade.
In 1993, the study showed, 32.4 percent of the unemployed were out of work for more than 27 weeks. That figure is lower than in 1992 but far higher than in the past. This situation forces more people to accept part-time work because they cannot find full-time positions. In 1993, 26.8 percent of the part-time work force consisted of people who would have preferred full-time jobs. The result is a less stable work force and more insecurity for employees.
Economists say they expect small businesses to play a major role in reviving the state's economy. Over the last three years, small businesses accounted for 86 percent of new, nongovernment employment, Mr. Klepper-Smith said. Most of the growth is in retail and services, as Connecticut shifts from traditional types of manufacturing toward a service- and information-based economy.
But the state lacks an overall strategy for moving the economy forward, said John Carson, president of the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that supports various studies. "There's a malaise that has to be broken," he said. "We haven't united behind a leader who will say, 'Enough of this. We're going to put the best heads together and come up with a game plan.' "
Lawmakers fail to focus on ways of dealing with social trends, said State Representative Jefferson Davis, House chair of the Legislature's Planning and Development Committee. "Everybody develops his own narrow political agenda. There aren't that many interested in the total picture."
Mr. Davis said a distance exists among people in general. "They're concerned about their lives and jobs and how to protect what they have.
"It's hard to attract them to a debate about what's happening as a whole."

HEADLINE: 'Portraits in Words' Chosen For Museum Lecture Series

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
EVERY two years the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College offers thematically twinned programs that bring acclaimed speakers to the county. This year, the Yaseen Lecture Series, as the programs are called, will address the topic "Portraits in Words and Images." The painter Chuck Close will speak today at 2 P.M., and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin will speak next Sunday at 2 P.M.
Both lectures will be held in the college's Performing Arts Center. Tickets range from $10 to $18 for the series and from $6.50 to $9 for a single lecture. Tickets may be ordered by calling the Performing Arts Center box office at 251-6200. 
 The Yaseen lectures, which began in 1974, have explored other themes like creativity, futurism, the nature of time and "culture watching." The talks were endowed by the late Leonard C. Yaseen and his wife, Helen, residents of Larchmont who financed a similar series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Patricia Greenhill, manager of marketing and communications at the Neuberger, said the museum wanted to recall the family behind the name. She said endowments like theirs were increasingly necessary today, when cultural groups can no longer count on funds from the National Endowment for the Arts and other agencies. "This may be the only way to get things done now in the arts," she said.
Barbara Yaseen Tiffany, the couple's daughter, described her father as "a very creative man" who essentially invented a new field after the Depression: that of recommending new factory sites to manufacturing companies. "He changed the entire economic geography of the country," she said. "He moved industry out of the North and into the South. He was very innovative."
Ms. Tiffany, a furniture designer who lives in Philadelphia, said her mother's passion for art influenced her father to become involved. He helped begin Friends of the Neuberger Museum of Art, an advisory board, and became the group's first president. "My parents really wanted to do something for the community that would be ongoing," Ms. Tiffany said. "Their vision was toward lectures that would stretch the imagination and that otherwise wouldn't be offered."
Mr. Close, a leading art figure, is known for his large-scale portraits, which that have been executed with grids. Ms. Goodwin is the author of "No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt," for which she won the Pulitzer Prize, "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys" and "Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream." She will discuss the qualities that make a leader successful.
For more information about the series, the number to call at the Neuberger Museum is 251-6100. ROBERTA HERSHENSON

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
A Leaner Army Leaves a Town Behind

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
TWO miles up the road is a sprawling military base with a budget of more than $1 billion, where 4,750 people come to work every day. But you don't see much indication of this on the main streets of Dover, a blue-collar town left behind in an increasingly white-collar military economy.
Welcome to the forlorn outskirts of today's military-post-industrial complex. In a small town like Dover, which borders the 6,500-acre Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, the issue of military jobs has largely gone the way of the battleship-gun shells that once were manufactured in Picatinny's shops. 
 "During the 60's and 70's, this town was alive with people who had arsenal jobs," said Anthony Negri, a barber who has been cutting hair in Dover since the end of World War II. "Now, they could shut the arsenal down tomorrow. It wouldn't make a difference."
"The arsenal used to be the major local employer, but that's a long time ago," said Rob Barth, a local graphics designer who had stopped by Mr. Negri's quiet shop to chat. Though his father retired from Picatinny, few people in today's hard-pressed Dover find work there, despite its proximity, Mr. Barth said.
"They're not much into manufacturing anymore," Mr. Negri said.
"Which means you don't need as many hands," Mr. Barth added.
Mr. Barth had chosen his word precisely: hands. The changes that have occurred at Picatinny Arsenal, which has an annual payroll of $280 million, are remarkably like those that have transformed the economy of northwestern New Jersey in the past 15 years.
Manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs disappeared, while new industries hired technicians and scientists and the small-town work force expanded into a region linked by new highways. Today, only about 1,700 of the civilian employees at the arsenal even live in Morris County. (The base has about 100 military personnel.)
And now, in step with the rest of the region, layoffs are on the way. "Sometime within the next 30 days, we are anticipating issuing layoff letters to about 200 employees," said Peter Rowland, a spokesman for the arsenal.
The long-rumored cuts will be across the board, he said. But civil service unions anticipate that clerical, service and maintenance workers will be most affected.
Even more than in the civilian economy, defense layoffs always kick up a furor. As Americans try to arrive at some consensus on how much of a shrinking national budget to devote to the Pentagon, the debate invariably gets sidetracked into the deep political quagmire of jobs. "Both the Administration and Congress increasingly view defense as a Federal jobs program," Lawrence J. Korb, of the Brookings Institution, wrote recently in the policy journal Foreign Affairs.
United States military spending is now about $260 billion annually, and projected to rise while spending on discretionary domestic programs goes down. Last year, all other NATO members combined spent $150 billion on the military, and the Russians spent $80 billion, Mr. Korb said.
At Picatinny, about half the employees now are scientists, engineers and technicians. Most work on major military contracts, some of which are developing high-tech weapons for the global arms market, as well as products for the civilian sector.
"There's a lot of brainpower at work here," said Representative Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a Republican whose district includes the arsenal. Representative Marge S. Roukema, the Ridgewood Republican who has been a major defender of Picatinny during the recent Pentagon base closings, also extolled the arsenal's "unique collection of research and engineering skills."
Now that the base is losing only a few hundred jobs, there's also a lot of talk at Picatinny of things like facing tough challenges in a global economy.
The military commander, Brig. Gen. James W. Boddie Jr., recently set up a new office to "focus on marketing Picatinny Arsenal and sell its products and services." The base newspaper, The Voice, described the effort as "an extremely broad-marketing campaign using advertising, public relations as well as the World Wide Web" to expand the world market for the arsenal.
It shouldn't be a surprise, then, when a military economy starts behaving like the civilian economy, and the layoff notices go out to beef up the bottom line. As Mr. Negri, the barber in nearby Dover, said with a shrug, "It's just a business."

HEADLINE: Growth When Resources Are Slim

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
MICHAEL AND DALE SMYTH didn't let a bad economy prevent them from fulfilling their dream. After years of dairy farming, Mr. and Mrs. Smyth have established an independent dairy. They own and operate Trinity Farm in Enfield, one of only seven farms in the state that process, bottle and sell their own milk.
Mr. Smyth said he took advantage of a new market that grew out of recent publicity about dairy cows injected with artificial growth hormones. "People are becoming concerned about what they're feeding their kids and are looking for something healthy," he said. 
 Customers arrive at Trinity Farm carrying their own jugs in which to take home what the Smyths' 40 Holsteins have produced. Some 15 specialty grocery stores and several independent food markets have begun carrying Trinity Farm's products, which include whole milk, raw milk, low fat and skim milk, chocolate milk and heavy cream.
Mr. Smyth, who is 47, grew up on his grandfather's dairy farm in Enfield. He recalled that his grandfather, who started the farm in 1912, delivered milk in a horse-drawn wagon. "In the early 1920's, he was one of the first to pasteurize his milk," said Mr. Smyth. "All the local doctors told their patients to buy their milk from him."
Mr. Smyth's father took over the farm in 1950. At the peak of its operation, the dairy delivered milk to 2,000 homes and employed 15 men. After graduating from the University of Connecticut in 1970, Mr. Smyth was ready to take over. But the demand for home-delivered milk was dying out, and small farms were not able to compete with the low prices offered at supermarkets.
His father sold the property in 1974, and Mr. Smyth went to work at other farms in the area. "I had my own business in mind, but I wanted to make sure I had all my skills," he said. He started Trinity Farm in 1984 on another piece of land belonging to his family. He has put up four buildings on the property since then and is able to produce 10,000 quarts of milk a week.
Mr. Smyth found that he was not generating enough income with traditional marketing methods -- selling milk in bulk -- and began looking for financing that would enable him to process, bottle and market some of the milk himself, he said. He applied for loans from agricultural lenders, commercial banks and state agencies. But banks, battered by losses during the recession, were unwilling to take a chance on a new agricultural business. And there was no state financing available.
"The frustration was terrible," Mr. Smyth said. "It puts a lot of stress on the people operating the farms."
Finally, Mr. Smyth found a private investor willing to finance his venture. "The investor looked at the plan and had faith in what Mike was doing," said Francis Barillaro, a business consultant who handles Trinity Farm's financial and marketing operations. "The investor thought it was a risk worth taking, and he felt that Mike would see the project through."
Trinity Farm's new business is only about two months old. "It's been painstaking, but I'm very encouraged by what I see," Mr. Smyth said.
The work is backbreaking, and the rewards do not always seem equal to a day that starts at 5 A.M., when he milks and feeds the cows, and usually ends around 6 P.M.
The Smyths' five children -- Bridget, 24; Daniel, 23; Anne, 17; Peter, 11, and Samuel, 6 -- help out with the chores. And there is a part-time farm hand in the afternoon. Mrs. Smyth, who is expecting their sixth child in September, provides home schooling to Anne, Peter and Samuel.
Among the older children, Daniel is learning to operate the processing plant on the farm, where the milk is pasteurized and bottled. Anne, who plans to enter the animal science program at the University of Connecticut after high school, is raising Suffolk sheep and dairy cows. Peter delivers milk to a dozen regular customers at $1.75 for a half gallon and cares for a team of work steers, which he enters in competitions at local fairs.
"We're trying to make something worthwhile for them to do," Mr. Smyth said. "We certainly won't pay for this in my lifetime."
Promoting Trinity Farm's products has become as important as the farm work, said Mr. Smyth, who adds that he hopes the business will break even after the first year. "We have financing, a plant and good cows," he said. "Now, we have to convince people this is an exciting product."
To encourage new customers, Mr. Smyth drops samples off at food stores and is setting up a dairy counter in one of the buildings on the farm. Dairy farmers recognize the need to diversify in order to survive, he said. Some are opening dairy stores. Others are interested in making cheese or raising crops.
Oddly enough, he said, "Thirty years ago, a dairy like Trinity Farm wouldn't have survived. But now there's a niche of people who will pay extra to have you deliver that glass bottle."

MAPLE SUGARING
Teatown Lake Reservation in Ossining has sweetened its maple-sugaring program this year with a dollop of personalization. People who sign up for the program, called rent-a-bucket, will have a sap bucket tagged with their family name and receive a map directing them to its location. 
 Bucket renters may visit during sugaring season to keep tabs on the amount of accumulated sap and watch the process of moving it to the sugar house and turning it into syrup. At the end of the season each bucketeer will receive an eight-ounce bottle of Teatown Grade A Maple Syrup and two tickets to the yearly pancake brunch on March 30. The fee is $30.
Syrup-making demonstrations are open to them and the public today and next Sunday at 1, 2, and 3 P.M.
Those who wish to attend the all-you-can-eat pancake brunch may reserve space at 8:30, 9:45 and 11 A.M. and 12:15 P.M.
Tickets are $7, $4 for children younger than 12. The number to call for reservations or more information is 762-2912. The Teatown Nature Preserve and Education Center is on Spring Valley Road.
 
MUSIC OF BLACKS
A family concert at the Pelham Art Center today at 3 P.M. will trace the history of black music. It will be performed by Vishnu Wood, bassist, and his ensemble of jazz musicians, whose programs are offered under the banner of Mr. Wood's Safari East Cultural Presentations.
New Orleans jazz, the call and response of Southern field workers, the blues and the Caribbean beat make up the four categories covered, along with the instruments used in each. The audience will be invited to join in demonstrations of various rhythms, melodic lines, harmonies and improvisation techniques related to each category. Tickets are $7, $5 for students. Call 738-2525 for reservations or more information. The center is at 155 Fifth Avenue.
 
MIDEAST PANEL
Three scholars who have studied the Middle East will take part in a colloquium on "Muslims, Jews, Christians: Roots of Intolerance" at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers on Tuesday at 4 P.M. Free and open to the public, it will be held in the Francis Ann Cannon Theater. Dr. Bernard Lewis, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, will open the proceeding with a talk about "Prospects for Discord and Concord in the Mideast." Dr. Lewis received his bachelor's degree and doctorate at the University of London, and he holds nine honorary doctorates.
His most recent book, "The Middle East: 2000 Years of History From the Rise of Christianity to the Present Day," will be published in May by Simon & Schuster.
"Possibilities for Reform and Liberalization in Islam" will be the topic of Prof. Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Taught at the Beirut College for Women, Dr. Haddad earned advanced degrees from the University of Wisconsin and Boston University and a doctorate from the Hartford Seminary.
The third speaker, Prof. Fawaz A. Gerges, is a faculty member at Sarah Lawrence. He received his master's degree from the London School of Economics and his doctorate from Oxford University. He and Dr. Haddad are published authors of books on Mideastern values and policies and relations between Mideast countries and the West.
Melvin Jules Bukiet, who teaches writing at the college, will close the program with a reading from his own short stories, a collection of which won the 1992 Edward Lewis Wallant Award for best Jewish-American fiction.
Another program at Sarah Lawrence will take place tomorrow at 5:30 P.M. in Titsworth Lecture Hall, when Kathryn Kish Sklar, a professor of history at SUNY Binghamton, will speak on "The Political Culture of Reform in the U.S. Women's Suffrage Movement, 1900-1920." Dr. Sklar has received 20 fellowships and grants, written many articles and three books on women's rights and political development and served on the editorial boards of American Quarterly, Journal of American History and Ms. magazine.
For more information on either program, call 395-2411.
 
KISS OF THE SPIDER
That nasty, fuzzy little creature called the tarantula, whose bite inspired the frenetic movements of the tarantella, is the basis for I Giullari di Piazza's newest production, "The Dance of the Ancient Spider," to be performed on Saturday at 8 P.M. at Caramoor in Katonah.
Apparently the only troupe in the country dedicated to reviving traditional Italian music, dance and theater, I Giullari creates its own productions and music, using indigenous instruments including the mandoloncello, oud, chitarra battente (Renaissance guitar), Italian bagpipe, shawn and a variety of drums.
"The Dance of the Ancient Spider," in which young girls are possessed by the spider, then exorcized, had its premiere at Lincoln Center last year. Tickets at $12.50 can be reserved by calling 232-1252.
 
'SOUTH AFRICA TODAY'
Waldemar Zastrau, Deputy Consul General of the South African Consulate, will give a free talk on "South Africa Today: Changes, Comparisons and Challenges," tomorrow at 7:30 P.M. at the Rye Y.M.C.A., 21 Locust Avenue.
Over the last two decades Mr. Zastrau has represented South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs in Rhodesia, Canada and the United States. Call 967-6363 for more details.
 
HISTORY INTO DANCE
Women's History Month will be celebrated at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers today at 1:30 P.M. with a dance drama titled "Fall in Line," performed by the Debra Weiss Dance Company of Nyack, specialists in converting American history into dance idioms.
The story line follows the 72-year effort by American women to get the vote and commemorates the 75th anniversary last year of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which gave them that right. The title was taken from a ragtime march composed by Zena Hawn, a New York suffragist.
"Niagara," the second number in the program, is an examination of what prompted Annie Taylor in 1901 allegedly to become the first person and the only woman to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and live to tell about it. She was a schoolteacher who couldn't swim.
Admission is free with museum admission of $3, $1.50 for people 62 and older and children younger than 13.
The museum is at 511 Warburton Avenue, and the phone number for more information is 963-4550.
 
CANCER STRATEGIES
Families and individuals dealing with cancer may find a program at Wainwright House in Rye helpful. Scheduled on Wednesdays from 10 A.M. to noon through May 1, two-hour meetings will offer strategies for handling physical, emotional, nutritional, legal and family questions.
Doctors, nurses, social workers, nutritionists and clergy and cancer survivors will speak on mind-body techniques to control pain, medical issues and other topics for 45 minutes, followed by discussion.

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
I WANT to go to Princeton," says Amory Blaine, the young hero of F. Scott Fitzgerald's "This Side of Paradise."
Over the last 250 years those six words have been uttered, one way or another, by everyone from James Madison to John F. Kennedy to Queen Noor of Jordan to Fitzgerald himself, who romanticized Princeton all the more because he flunked out not once but twice. But Amory Blaine would not have had a Princeton to dream about -- and Princeton would not have a 250th anniversary to celebrate this year -- if Yale had not kicked out a divinity student named David Brainerd. 
 Brainerd is not commemorated by a statue, a lecture hall or a dormitory on the campus that Fitzgerald called a "riot of Gothic architecture." Nor was he mentioned at the opening of Princeton's $3 million, 16-month anniverary celebration last month, which included speeches by Princeton's president, Harold T. Shapiro, and Governor Whitman. But Aaron Burr Sr., who stepped in as Princeton's president when it was six months old and struggling, recorded Brainerd's place in history. "If it had not been for the treatment received by Mr. Brainerd at Yale College," Burr wrote, Princeton "never would have been erected."
Brainerd's sin, in Yale's view, was to criticize a professor. His expulsion angered several Presbyterian laymen who believed that Yale had lost its way in the religious and philosophical turbulence that was buffeting the colonies.
In the 1740's they chose the theologian Jonathan Dickinson to lead what they called the College of New Jersey, and they turned Dickinson's parsonage in Elizabeth into the college's first building. The students moved into Burr's parsonage in Newark when Dickinson died before making a third and final move, to Princeton, in 1757.
Not until a century and a half later, long after Princetonians had played in the first intercollegiate basketball and football games and earned their first doctorates, did the university officially change its name to Princeton.
Only Princeton would celebrate its 250th birthday with an 18-letter word, bicenquinquagenary. (Mercifully, it was abbreviated "BCQ" on bottled water served at an alumni lunch last month.) Princeton is looking forward to fireworks in June, the Olympic torch in July, a commemorative postcard in September and what Dr. Shapiro calls "the centerpiece event" in October, marking the 250th anniversary of Princeton's charter.
To mark the occasion, the university has also published a full-color book, "Princeton University: The First 250 Years," written by Don Oberdorfer, who graduated in 1952 and retired as the diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post. The first half of the 272-page volume focuses on turning points from 1746 to 1946. The second half looks at changes since World War II, including coeducation and the increasing diversity of the student body.
It is a student body that is less preppy than it used to be but no less loyal: some Princetonians pride themselves on never missing a reunion, and an unusually large percentage of graduates contribute to their alma mater. Already, Princetonians have given $12.7 million toward the university's $23 million goal for this year, which is part of a campaign to raise $750 million by the year 2000.
Even at Princeton, though, money is not everything. Among the gifts received in its 250th year is a specially made 130-pound manhole cover, from the Class of 1945.
Another measure of Princetonians' loyalty: they have the only alumni magazine in the country that comes out as often as it does, though not quite so often as its name suggests. The Princeton Alumni Weekly became a biweekly in 1977 and now publishes 17 issues a year, timed to coincide with the academic calendar.
As if a magazine in their mailbox every couple of weeks were not enough, 4,000 alumni have registered for the university's Tigernet on-line service and will soon be assigned permanent Princeton E-mail addresses. Yes, permanent, meaning lifelong. "No matter where they move," said Luther T. Munford, the chairman of the university's Alumni Council, "Princeton will be able to find them."
Of course, the 250th anniversary has a serious side. Woodrow Wilson, who was a politics professor and president of Princeton before he got into politics, coined the term "Princeton in the nation's service" in a speech during Princeton's 150th celebration. For its 250th, the university said it wanted students and alumni to take part in 250 community service projects.
Mr. Munford said 190 such projects had been arranged so far. The Classes of 1976 and 1981, for example, are selling posters to raise money to save endangered tigers and to support Princeton students and professors involved in conservation and environmental research. The Class of 1948 is raising money for a Red Cross disaster vehicle for the Princeton area and encouraging classmates to donate blood.
JAMES MADISON'S undergraduate years (long before coeducation) convinced him that there was "no place so overstocked with old maids as Princeton." Kennedy wrote in his application that "to be a Princeton man is indeed an enviable distinction" but dropped out because of illness. (When he was well enough to go back to school, he enrolled at Harvard.) Queen Noor graduated as Lisa M. Halaby in 1973.
Presidential candidates? Adlai Stevenson graduated in 1922, Steve Forbes in 1970.
Governors? Thomas H. Kean, who graduated in 1953, succeeded Brendan T. Byrne, who graduated in 1949.
Actors and actresses? James Stewart graduated in 1934, Brooke Shields in 1987. Dean Cain, who was a superb safety on the Princeton football team before becoming Superman on "The New Adventures of Lois and Clark," on ABC, graduated in 1988.
And not a Ph.D. in the bunch. Princetonians take pride in their college -- the undergraduate part of the institution. Harvard has a host of graduate schools that are at the same level on the organization chart as its undergraduate college. Yale, too, puts a heavy emphasis on graduate studies, an important magnet for Federal research grants.
But Princeton's Graduate College is separate from the main campus, a second Gothic fortress beyond the fairways of the Springdale County Club. With 1,700 graduate students, Princeton has the smallest graduate enrollment in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton triangle; Harvard has 6,200 and Yale 2,800. Princeton got $77 million for research from the Federal Government in 1994-95, compared to $234 million for Harvard and $198 million for Yale.
But the tradeoffs between faculty research and teaching, and particularly the labor-intensive teaching of undergraduates, are a perennial concern. Charles Gibson, who graduated in 1965 and is a host of "Good Morning America" on ABC-TV, recalls what he learned when he returned to Princeton on a brief fellowship in 1992.
"You eat with students at every meal," he said. "I spent the time asking them what was wrong with Princeton. There were a lot of things said. They did not have exposure to the star faculty. That was the single most disturbing thing to me, and I thought that, in the long run, imperils exactly what is the great strength of the university."
It is a strength university officials are committed to preserving if not improving. "Our strategic planning process emphasized Princeton's determination to be second to none in both the quality of its scholarship and research and in the quality of its teaching programs," said Dr. Shapiro, an economist with a doctorate from Princeton who was president of the University of Michigan before his installation in 1988. "That process identified a need to do a better job of teaching in several areas."
He has sanctioned expanding freshman seminars, developing new ways to teach science and math to non-majors and revising the general education requirements. The university is setting up a $25 million fund "for innovation in undergraduate education," which Dr. Shapiro said would provide "venture capital for new ideas in teaching." It is also earmarking $12 million for four visiting professorships and $13 million to support jobs, programs and equipment at the Center for Teaching and Learning.
In a report recommending the changes, Nancy Malkiel, co-chairwoman of the university's committee on the course of study, said the center would be a kind of oasis "where faculty come together to talk about, devise and test teaching innovations, where graduate students develop their teaching skills, and where undergraduates draw on new technologies and new strategies for effective learning to supplement the work they do in their classes." It will have an expanded language laboratory, a multimedia computer cluster and a writing center with computer work stations.
Ms. Malkiel's committee also recommended changing Princeton's vaunted distribution requirements -- courses undergraduates are required to take -- for the first time since World War I. Courses have been regrouped by content rather than department, and the requirements for liberal-arts students were expanded to include two more courses.
 
WHAT hits me every single day is how beautiful Princeton is," said Abby Durden, a sophomore from Winston-Salem, N.C. Describing her life in Blair Tower, which looms over the middle of the campus with its arch and its steep steps, she said, "It's like living in a castle in some fairy tale."
Princeton is different from urban campuses like Harvard's or Yale's or Columbia's. Until about 15 years ago, when office parks started pressing in from Route 1, Princeton was still pretty much the splendid, isolated stretch of emerald-green fields woods that Fitzgerald remembered from his undergraduate days before World War I.
"Sordid Trenton sweats and festers" only a few miles from the campus, he wrote in a 1927 essay, but Princeton seemed far away, connected by a little shuttle train from the Penn Central's Main Line in Princeton Junction.
It used to be undergraduate folklore that the only reason Princeton had its own train was that the president of Penn Central lived there. The Penn Central is long gone, but the Dinky, as the little train is called, still bounces to a stop at the edge of campus.
But the boundaries have shifted. "Princeton is the area between Trenton and New Brunswick," said David Knights, director of marketing for the Princeton Forrestal Center, a 2,200-acre office and research park on land owned by the university in Plainsboro. "To a real estate person, when you say Princeton, that includes West Windsor, Plainsboro, South Brunswick and Lawrence. Even if it's just the road into Princeton, the real estate guys want to get Princeton into the name."
Of the Forrestal Center's 100 tenants, only one declined a Princeton mailing adddress. Most months there is a waiting list for mailboxes in the post office across Nassau Street from the campus.
From there, a five-minute walk beneath spires and gargoyles leads to Nassau Hall, which at one time was the college: classrooms, dorms, library and all. It quartered troops during the Revolution, and later served as a meeting place for the Continental Congress.
And it was almost christened Belcher Hall.
Gov. Jonathan Belcher, who issued the university's second charter in 1748, said no. "Just imagine if they had called it Belcher Hall," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, who graduated in 1976. "The notion of legions of Princeton graduates ending a school cheer that way would do something magnificent for the university's stuffy reputation."
WHAT became of David Brainerd, whose troubles at Yale led to it all?
He became a missionary, first in the Berkshires and later in Freehold. His influence on the 18th- and 19th-century missionary movement was felt far beyond his own Presbyterians: John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, published an abridged version of his diaries in 1768. Brainerd died in 1747 at the home of Jonathan Edwards, who later became Princeton's third president. Brainerd, who was 29, was engaged to Edwards's daughter.
PRINCETONIANS have long been fascinated by what Fitzgerald called "the enigma that faced you at the end of senior year as to what Princeton was and what . . . it really stood for." A similar question overshadowed Geoffrey Wolff's 1990 novel "The Final Club," which revolved around a Jewish underclassman in the mid-1950's who was rejected by the school's eating clubs.
The concerns remain: the feeling that Princeton is still male-dominated, and still too white. In other words, the old reputation.
The figures suggest that the mix is changing. Princeton had 350 black students in 1979; the number dipped to 270 in 1988 but has climbed to 300 this year. It enrolled 209 Hispanic students in 1980; the figure went as low as 174 in 1988 but has been rising since 1990 and stands at 277 this year. The number of Asian-American students has tripled in the last 15 years, to 474.
"I'm always aware that I'm from Singapore, because of words or idioms I use," said Keith Tan, a junior from Singapore, "but on the other hand, everyone at Princeton has left home; everyone has made a symbolic break by coming here. I think that freshman year, we all experienced the same feelings of homesickness and loneliness."

Fluidity Is The Key

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I am happy to have been included in Andy Meisler's discussion of theater professionals who also work in television, I worry about the larger assumptions of his article ["When Theater Turns Out to Be Just a Stage," Feb. 4]. The implication that working in television or film means abandoning the theater even temporarily is not true for me and many others. 
 Theater, film and television are all modes of storytelling, and many of us are fortunate enough to move freely among them without feeling that we've "left" or need to "go back" to one or the other. In fact, if the theater is to avoid a "brain drain," this kind of fluidity is increasingly necessary.
I continue to consider myself primarily a playwright. I also write for television and film. These are states that coexist happily. I haven't gone anywhere.

A Co-op Regains the Road to Financial Recovery

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
ONE fall day in 1990 Rebecca Doggett and her husband, Joseph Thomasberger, bought their co-op at Crescent Park, a 266-apartment building in East Orange modeled on the grand Art Deco style of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach.
But recent events have been anything but grand for the couple and other residents at the 18-story white brick building on South Harrison Street. For 1990 was also the year that the sponsor defaulted on its mortgage, pushing Crescent Park into a financial free fall and to the brink of foreclosure. 
 Five years and three legal battles later the co-op is on the road to recovery. Its co-op corporation, Crescent Park Owners, has taken over most of the 160 unsold apartments, refinanced the building's mortgage and won $1.3 million in cash settlements, helping it regain fiscal health.
"There was so much to lose," said Ms. Doggett, now president of the co-op board, "not just financially. People love this building and we just refused to give up the fight." There was also the specter of deconverting to a rental, she said, referring to a 197-apartment co-op in East Orange that never recovered and whose residents lost their investments. In co-ops, shareholders must meet an underlying mortgage on their building as well as their home loans and monthly charges. They can lose their investment through their building's foreclosure, while remaining liable on their home loans.
The plan at Crescent Park is to make improvements and rent the vacant apartments, from studios to three-bedroom units, and switch to selling them in the future. That prospect is helped by signs that the co-op market, hard-hit in the real estate recession when values dropped by 40 percent, has rebounded slightly. "Prices are stable and it's easier to get financing," said Charles Oppler of Oppler-Ketive Realtors in Fort Lee, which specializes in co-ops.
Those involved in Crescent Park's recovery say it could be a model for other co-ops. "The key was perseverance and the resolve of shareholders to gain control of their destiny," said Kerry Brian Flowers, a lawyer with the Woodbridge firm of Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith, Ravin & Davis, who represents Crescent Park Owners.
The co-op form of ownership, while widely used in New York, has struggled to gain acceptance west of the Hudson River except in areas like Fort Lee, where New Yorkers familiar with the concept would be expected to buy. Some housing analysts and real estate lawyers said the financial woes that arose when the mid-80's boom deflated could affect the growth of co-ops in the state.
Those woes included defaults on loans by sponsors, nonpayment of monthly maintenance by shareholders and foreclosures by banks. But advocates of co-ops counter that the concept, though tarnished, is a viable form of ownership.
Since 1978 some 90,000 rental units have been converted to condos or co-ops, with about 25,000 of them co-ops, according to state figures.
New Jersey did not see the same level of sponsor defaults as in New York City, and it is generally agreed that the worst problems are over. How many buildings are still under financial strain is unclear because the state does not monitor them.
But Mr. Flowers said 10 percent of all co-ops were "still struggling with some financial difficulty." Crescent Park, he added, was "a glaring example of what could go wrong."
THE sponsor at the time of the building's conversion in 1987 was Crescent Jersey Associates, a partnership led by Aaron Ziegelman, a New York converter. Over the next three years about 120 of the apartments were sold at an average sales price of $95,000. Of the remaining unsold apartments held by the sponsor about 50 were vacant and the rest leased to rent-controlled tenants.
"In 1990 the problems exploded," Mr. Flowers said. The sponsor, now barred from selling in New Jersey, "dropped off the keys, stopped paying monthly maintenance on its units -- ultimately accumulating arrears of $1.5 million -- and walked away," Mr. Flowers said. But, he added, the co-op had been doomed from the start, and the Achilles heel was real estate taxes.
When the building converted, two wraparound mortgages had been added to a $3.4 million underlying loan from the Beacon Federal Savings and Loan Association -- a tactic used in New York by sponsors to create capital for themselves while adding debt to resident shareholders. A fourth, $2.4 million mortgage was also tacked on for a total of $11.4 million.
But New Jersey's tax system, Mr. Flowers said, allows mortgage debt to be assessed as added value, pushing up real estate taxes, which at Crescent Park went from $250,000 to $1.2 million. "They didn't plan for that and the budget went haywire," he said, adding that slow sales in a soft market pushed the debt-burdened building over the edge.
Beacon filed to foreclose on the building. A year later the S. & L. failed and was seized by the Resolution Trust Corporation. In 1992 the co-op filed for bankruptcy to stay the foreclosure. It also sued to take over unsold units from the sponsor and from delinquent shareholders, as well as for breach of fiduciary duties by the building's former lawyer and management agent, among others.
That case resulted in a 1994 settlement in which the co-op gained control of 140 apartments plus $1.3 million in cash. Half of the 100 shareholders also bought back their home loans and now own their units free and clear, Mr. Flowers said.
"It was the first sign we could win," Ms. Doggett said.
Then under a 1995 bankrupcty settlement the junior mortgage holders forgave $8.5 million in debt in exchange for 20 apartments and Resolution Trust lowered the $3.4 million underlying mortgage, which was due, to $3.25 million, extended it seven years and forgave $2 million in interest. Mr. Flowers said that as part of the reorganization the mortgage would be cut further to $3 million and the taxes reduced to about $250,000.
The co-op, helped by Wilkin & Guttenplan, an East Brunswick accounting firm, also decreased its expenses by $150,000 a year. That, along with the new mortgage, led to a 20 percent maintenance decrease, or an average monthly charge of $844.
To rebuild value at Crescent Park, the co-op hired the Solomon Organization of Mountainside, which owns or manages 3,630 co-op units in the state. In the last six months, 30 of the apartments, from 900 to 2,000 square feet, have been rented for $750 to $1,450 -- all the while "improving the building's economic conditions," said Marc Solomon, a partner. The building has such amenities as a 24-hour doorman, garage parking and Manhattan views.
MR. SOLOMON said an offering plan was being filed with the state and, once accepted, the building would begin sales by the spring of 1997 "if the market calls for it." The goal is to sell units at a price averaging $50,000 so owning one costs little more than renting it, he said, adding "we are leasing to people who are candidates for homeownership and creating a built-in market." The firm will also help buyers get home loans.
Tenants are moving in. Stanley Mims, an education administrator, and his wife, Annette, a teacher, relocated from Atlanta to a 1,800-square-foot apartment. "We wanted space and Crescent Park gave us that and more for our money," Dr. Mims said. "The board is in control, the building is moving forward and its future is secure. We can't wait to buy."
Though encouraged by the leasing pace, Ms. Doggett said she knew there were struggles ahead. "No, we will not recoup our investment initially," she said, "But we are bringing equity back to the building and over time values will rise."

HEADLINE: A First-Time Buyer's Primer and Road Map

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IT won't be too long before pachysandra emerges from hibernation, azalea buds ripen, trees sprout new leaves and a fresh crop of "For Sale" signs appears on lawns across the land.
Indeed, with interest rates low, real-estate brokers are hoping for a bumper crop of home buyers this spring. Among them will be a freshman class of first-time buyers making their maiden voyage on the road to the American Dream. 
 As anyone who has been down that road before already knows, the process of becoming a homeowner is at various times terrifying, mysterious, exciting, daunting, frustrating, confusing, confounding and, for most at least, ultimately rewarding.
"This whole thing seems so overwhelming," said Bart Lucash, a 27-year-old Eatontown, N.J., resident who along with his fiancee Kim Vigus, 21, is in the process of buying what will become the couple's first house -- a three-bedroom colonial in Howell Township.
"It's scary," Mr. Lucash said. "When we came back from signing the contract we just looked at each other and said, 'Can you believe what we just did?' "
More than a few first-time buyers have asked themselves that question after plunging into what may be the most significant investment of a lifetime. Then they wonder: "What happens now?"
Here, then, is a road map and survival guide for those embarking on the road to home ownership.
"Remember this," said David Clurman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and former chief of the real estate financing division of the New York State Attorney General's office: "Anything you sign could very well turn out to be a binding contract."
In most cases, Mr. Clurman said, a buyer who wants to make an offer on a property will usually be asked by a broker to sign either a binder or a contract. Customs vary from state to state and even within states, Mr. Clurman said.
For example, in New York City, brokers will usually ask a buyer to sign a binder -- a document that contains the essential terms of the offer including price, deposit, down payment and mortgage amount. In other areas of the state, however -- and in New Jersey and parts of Connecticut as well -- a broker will often ask a buyer to sign an actual contract, usually on a form approved by a state real estate board. In most cases, the contract contains a clause that permits both buyer and seller to have the contract reviewed by a lawyer within a certain time period.
 
The Contract
Sign Here Or Lose the House
 
 In either case, Mr. Clurman said, a signed, written agreement that contains all the necessary elements of a valid contract could legally be considered a valid contract even if it is called binder. And while most lawyers cringe at the thought of clients signing any documents without their prior approval, most clients seem to be less concerned than their lawyers.
"They sign them all the time," Mr. Clurman said. "They're so afraid they're going to lose the deal that they'll sign anything just to hold it."
Such concerns are at times, it seems, warranted.
"It's a stressful process," said Cynthia Kaplan, a Westchester County resident who with her husband, Gavin, recently made an offer on a property in Scarsdale. "We came close to the asking price and then somebody else came along and offered even more than the sellers were asking."
The Kaplans, who are now renting a house in Rye Brook, have been scouring the market for nearly a year. And if they have learned anything from the process, Mrs. Kaplan said, it is that the best deals rarely wait around while buyers consult with their lawyers.
"The good houses go fast," Mrs. Kaplan said. "You have to move very quickly."
So, then, what does a prudent buyer do when a deal depends on signing a binder or contract on the spot?
"Fax it to your lawyer," said William Selsberg, a Stamford, Conn., real estate lawyer.
Even if a contract permits an "attorney review period," Mr. Selsberg said, there are strategic reasons for involving a lawyer in the negotiating process early on. For example, he said, sellers who might be inflexible regarding the sale price might nevertheless be willing to negotiate on other matters -- such as repairs or the inclusion of personal property. That willingness might evaporate, however, if over-eager buyers quickly sign a contract just to keep from losing the deal.
"These could be people who have never even negotiated buying a car," he said. "They need someone to keep them calm."
And while the real estate broker may appear to be looking out for the interests of the buyer, the broker's contractual loyalties and responsibilities typically lie with the seller.
Mr. Selsberg said a good real estate contract should include a clause permitting an inspection of the property by a home inspection expert or engineer. The inspector should thoroughly check the house and its systems, including the roof, heating plant, plumbing system, electrical system and structural elements.
The contract should also permit the buyer to have a water and septic test, a termite inspection, a radon test, and a check for the presence of asbestos-containing materials, lead paint and urea formaldehyde insulation. In addition, if the house was ever heated by oil, an inspection should be conducted to check for possible ground contamination caused by leaking underground oil-storage tanks.
Most important, Mr. Selsberg said, the contract should specify what happens if the results of any of the tests are unsatisfactory to the buyer -- preferably giving the buyer the right to cancel the contract.
"If you deal with these things beforehand," Mr. Selsberg said, "you're in a better position to negotiate later on."
Finally, he said, buyers of residential property should also consider obtaining a survey of the property.
"I tell my clients that I'd rather see them live with sheets on the windows if that's what it takes to afford a survey," Mr. Selsberg said, adding that it is not uncommon to find that a driveway or a fence crosses a property line. "I tell my buyers that if they find a problem now, it's the seller's problem. If they find it later, it's theirs.' "
Mr. Selsberg said a survey can cost anywhere from $600 to $1,200, or perhaps more.
Once the contract terms are negotiated, the buyer is usually required to provide the seller with a deposit -- usually expressed in terms of a percentage of the purchase price.
Eric M. Davis, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in real estate, said that a typical deposit can range from 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price and will usually be held by the lawyer representing the seller. One question that often arises, he said, is whether the deposit earns interest.
"Generally, deposits are kept in noninterest-bearing trust accounts," Mr. Davis said. "But if the anticipated interest is going to exceed $100, then it is advisable to deposit it in an interest-bearing account."
In most cases, Mr. Davis said, "interest follows the deposit," -- meaning that whoever ultimately ends up with the deposit also gets the interest, usually the seller. An aggressive lawyer, however, will attempt to negotiate for at least a portion of the interest to be paid to the buyer.
"It never hurts to ask," he said.

The Mortgage
The Bank Becomes Your Senior Partner
A major question on the mind of most first-time buyers is: "How much can I borrow?"
Gregg Winter, president of Winter & Company Mortgage Services in Manhattan, said that generally, a lender will allow a borrower to spend about 28 percent of the gross household income on "housing expenses" -- a term that generally includes mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, hazard insurance, private mortgage insurance (needed when the down payment is less than 20 percent) and maintenance or common charges in co-ops or condominiums. When other recurring debts are taken into consideration -- things like credit cards and car loans -- the maximum limit increases to about 36 percent.
Accordingly, a buyer with good credit and total household income of $50,000 would probably qualify for a mortgage that would cost roughly $14,000 a year, or $1,150 a month. With interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now at about 7.5 percent, that would translate into a mortgage of about $125,000 to $150,000. (It is impossible to be precise because included in the monthly payment are real estate taxes which vary widely.)
In most real estate transactions, the first stop buyers make after signing the contract is a bank or a mortgage company. Typically, the contract contains a "mortgage contingency clause," which gives the buyer a fixed period of time -- typically, 30 to 45 days -- to get a commitment from a lender for the mortgage that will be needed.
"The minute I signed the contract I contacted the mortgage company," said Peter W. Cheng, a media company vice president who is moving from California to an Upper West Side condominium he bought about two weeks ago.
For Mr. Cheng, the mortgage application process was quick and painless.
"I filled out the application, they gave me a list of stuff that I had to send in, I went back to California, sent the stuff in, and a couple of weeks later I had a mortgage," he said.
For many first-time buyers, however, the process can be intimidating, confusing and often frustrating.
"A lot really depends on the down payment," said Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a Manhattan mortgage broker. Buyers who can afford a down payment of 20 percent of the purchase price, she said, will have an easier time than those putting less money down.
"There are a lot of first-time buyer programs around," Ms. Scott said, explaining that there were mortgages available for buyers who can put up as little as 3 percent of the purchase price as a down payment.Such mortgages,, however, typically take longer than the conventional loan process.
"That can be very discouraging to a seller," Ms. Scott said, explaining that sellers typically prefer buyers who will be applying for conventional financing.
Moreover, Ms. Scott said, a buyer whose down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price will usually have to obtain private mortgage insurance -- which insures the lender for the difference between the lower-than-usual down payment and the 20 percent typically required.
Such insurance, she said, can cost a buyer several hundred dollars a year.
"It's roughly the equivalent of adding three-eighths of a percent to the interest rate of the mortgage," she said.
First-time buyers often turn to adjustable-rate mortgages because they appear to cost less. Such mortgages are usually 30-year loans with interest rates that can increase after an introductory period of one to 10 years.
While such mortgages contain rate caps, Ms. Scott said, buyers should think long-term. If they plan to keep the house beyond the introductory period, it might be advisable to pay a slightly higher fixed-interest rate to avoid higher payments if interest rates rise.
One of the most common sources of confusion for first-time buyers, Ms. Scott said, involves the issue of points.
"It makes for wonderful cocktail party conversation to say, 'I paid no points on my mortgage,' " she said. "But there are times when points can be a good thing."
A point, Ms. Scott explained, is equal to 1 percent of the amount being borrowed. Most lenders charge a specific number of points in conjunction with a specific interest rate for a loan. (The mortgage broker typically earns one point out of the total charged by the lender.)
Usually, the higher the number of points charged, the lower the interest rate, and vice-versa.
"There's a rate-point trade-off," Ms. Scott said. "If you're going to be in your dwelling for three years or less, I recommend that people pay as few points as possible. But if you expect to be there longer, you might want to pay more points up front to get a lower interest rate, which, in the long run, will save you money."
In addition, she said, points are tax deductible in the year they are paid.
Neil Bader, chief executive officer of Skyscraper Mortgage, in Manhattan, said that it takes about two and a half weeks for a borrower to get a firm mortgage commitment from a lender.
That, however, assumes that all of the required paperwork -- including credit reports, income verifications, income tax returns, and property appraisals -- gets to the lender on time.

The Closing
The Final Act With a Large Cast
Once the commitment is issued, the stage is then set for the lawyer representing the buyer to order title searches and other documents required by the bank to schedule a closing.
"The most misconceived notion among buyers and sellers alike is that the closing date is written in stone," said Ronald Sher, a real estate lawyer in White Plains.
Ordinarily, Mr. Sher said, to avoid spending a client's money unnecessarily, a buyer's lawyer will hold off ordering the title search until the mortgage commitment is issued.
In most cases, however, the commitment is only good for 45 to 60 days, after which the interest rate set in the commitment could be subject to change. Additional credit reports involving additional time and expense may be required, or the commitment itself can expire.
As a result, the coordination of receipt of the title search with the commitment expiration date and the closing date set in the contract often ends up being something of a juggling act.
"Normally, you don't end up closing on the date specified in the contract," Mr. Sher said. "In most cases, both parties are entitled to a reasonable adjournment."
The title search, Mr. Sher said, is usually conducted by an agent for a title insurance company who searches through official records to ascertain whether there are any claims against title to the property.
Potential claims, he said, can include rights of previous owners, court judgments against past and current owners, and existing easements and rights of way that give others the right to use or traverse portions of the property.
If the title insurance company determines that title to the property is clear -- that no other parties have rights that supersede the rights of the current owner -- the company will issue a policy of title insurance to both the buyer and the lender.
"The title policy is essentially an insurance policy covering the bank and the owner in the event someone else claims title to the property," Mr. Sher said. "If the title is found to be defective by a court, then the title company pays the bank and the owner for their loss up to the purchase price of the property."
Additional coverage -- which insures the market value of the property as opposed to the purchase price -- is also available, Mr. Sher said.
When the closing date is finally set, the buyer's lawyer will typically advise the buyer to revisit the property on the closing date and inspect it closely. When the day of the closing arrives, purchasers should come prepared for some heavy-duty paperwork.
"I tell my clients to be ready to sign as many as 100 pieces of paper," said Mr. Davis, the Manhattan lawyer. "And there are also a variety of payments that have to be made."
In fact, Mr. Davis said, one of the primary purposes of the closing, aside from the seller signing the deed and the buyer signing the mortgage, is to account for the various payments and adjustments that must be made.
Included in the charges a buyer would typically pay on the day of closing, he said, are the balance of the down payment, adjustments for real estate taxes, charges for title insurance and the title search, hazard insurance, lawyer's fees, and the fees due to the mortgage company.
That can include points, prepaid interest on the loan, tax and insurance escrows, appraisal fees, credit report fees and even fees that may be required to pay the lender's lawyer for preparing or examining the buyer's paperwork.
"In many cases, I have my clients come to the closing with 10 or 20 checks," Mr. Davis said. "And some have to be certified." Generally, Mr. Davis said the amount that the buyers will have to bring to the closing, not including the balance of the down payment, can range between 2 and 10 percent of the purchase price, with most about 5 percent.
The last thing that's done at the closing, Mr. Davis said, is the tying up of loose ends before the money and the deed are exchanged.
Included in that category are all the things that have been otherwise overlooked -- like the chandelier the buyer thought would stay and the seller thought would go.
Or the oil in the tank that the buyer thought would go and the seller thought would stay. Or the dings in the wall that mysteriously appear only after furniture is moved.
"It doesn't matter whether you are talking about a million-dollar mansion or a studio apartment," said Mr. Davis. "Buying a home is an intensely emotional experience. So the best way to have a smooth closing is for everyone to check their emotions at the door."
 
Getting the Seal Of Pre-Approval
WHEN shopping for real estate, nothing makes sellers more eager to negotiate than a buyer with an all-cash offer. But since such a luxury is out of the question for most first-time home buyers, the next best strategy is to have a mortgage commitment in place before sitting down at the bargaining table.
"It's called pre-approval," said Neil Bader, chief executive officer of Skyscraper Mortgage Company in Manhattan. "It's like saying to a seller, 'Hey, I'm a serious buyer.' "
There is a difference between pre-approval for a mortgage and pre-qualification -- another term used widely in the industry. Pre-qualification, Mr. Bader said, typically refers to situations where a mortgage broker or real estate broker, using income figures provided by a buyer, estimates the maximum mortgage that the buyer should be able to obtain.
A pre-approval, on the other hand, means more than just "maybe."
"A pre-approval is an actual certificate that the bank will give you to certify that you qualify for a certain mortgage amount," Mr. Bader said.
A pre-approval, however, is not the same as a mortgage commitment because before a commitment can be issued the bank must be able to appraise the property being mortgaged.
"But it can certainly be used as a tool," Mr. Bader said. "From the seller's perspective, it's almost as good as cash."
 
The Added Hurdle in Co-op Buying
WHILE co-ops are homes in the same sense that houses are, the process of buying a co-op is distinctly different.
"Most co-op contracts of sale contain two conditions," said Eric P. Gonchar, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. "One is that the purchasers obtain a written loan commitment within a certain period of time and the second is board approval."
The first condition is usually no more onerous for co-op buyers than for others. The second, however, is something else indeed.
"I always advise my clients in writing that when they're not buying from an original sponsor, they're always subject to board approval and that there is always the possibility that the board can deny that approval," Mr. Gonchar said. "I also advise them that their rights are very limited when that happens."
Accordingly, Mr. Gonchar said, prospective buyers of co-ops are faced with the cumbersome distinction of having to do everything usually required to buy an apartment without knowing whether they will be permitted to buy it or not.
For example, Mr. Gonchar said, a co-op buyer must hire a lawyer to review a contract of sale and then conduct a "due diligence" examination of the co-op's books, records, by-laws and proprietary lease. At the same time, the buyer must apply for a mortgage and then submit to the board an approved commitment along with an array of highly detailed and personal information and an application fee of as much as $500, which may or may not be refundable..
Then they buyer must wait for an invitation for an interview, which may or may not come. "A purchaser who has been declined can always challenge a board decision by starting a lawsuit against the co-op," Mr. Gonchar said. "But the case will probably be lost unless they can prove discrimination based on factors such as race, color, creed, or sexual preference." Typically, he said, rejected buyers adopt a more realistic approach. "They accept the decision reluctantly and move on," he said.
 
Buyer's Agents vs. Seller's Agents
THERE is one professional whose efforts and influence follow and sometimes carry the deal from beginning to end: the real estate broker.
But who is the broker working for?
"There's an inherent anomaly here," said Eric Davis, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. "Although most brokers are technically working for the seller, they usually develop a greater rapport with the buyer."
That unusual relationship, however, can at times present problems.
For example, a broker who has developed a relationship with a buyer might know things that the buyer might not want a potential seller to know -- like how much the purchaser is actually willing to spend. The broker, however, more often than not has a duty to disclose such information to the seller since most brokers are really working for the seller.
As a result, 44 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have adopted some form of "agency disclosure rule" under which a real estate broker must disclose to a customer whether that broker is a "seller's agent" who is working exclusively for the seller, a "buyer's agent" who is working exclusively for the buyer or a "dual agent" who is essentially working as a middleman for both buyer and seller.
Hiring a broker as a "dual agent" may have its own built-in tensions.
"It's hard to serve two masters," said William Colavito, a Manhattan lawyer who is chairman of the real property section of the New York State Bar Association. "Just as it would create a problem for a lawyer to represent both sides in a transaction, it could create the same problem for a broker." Generally, Mr. Colavito said, a buyer would get the most protection and the best advocacy by dealing with a buyer's broker. One consideration, however, is that in some circumstances the buyer might have to pay the buyer-broker's commission directly, rather than the typical situation in which the broker's commission is paid by the seller.
The solution?
"Caveat emptor," Mr. Colavito said.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Charity-Care Retread: The Jobless Fund, Again

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The moribund proposal to raise the cigarette tax to help pay for hospital care for the poor might actually have been more politically palatable than the latest proposal making the rounds of the State House: continuing a regressive payroll tax on employees and higher unemployment insurance-tax rates for employers.
No matter what they do, the Republican majority can't seem to get away from the word "tax," which is part of the reason the cigarette-tax proposal dried up. But unlike a tax on smoking -- which at its best carried with it a sense of promoting better health -- the current proposal turned out to be a retread of an unpopular idea vociferously rejected by an unusual alliance of business and labor. 
 The Legislature rejected the cigarette-tax increase in December, in part because its leaders felt it would reflect badly on their anti-tax stance. But in the two months since then, lawmakers have come up with nothing to replace it except a plan very much like the one that expired Dec. 31 -- taking another $1.1 billion in tax revenues intended for the unemployment insurance fund for charity care. (The legislation would gradually reduce the state's dependence on the fund over the next four years, after which charity care would be fully paid for from the state's operating budget.)
Both the business community and organized labor have considerable political clout and they are unhappy that the Whitman administration and the Legislature have failed to come up with alternatives, as promised, to cover the cost of the state's annual $400 million charity care bill.
While all sides agree that New Jersey's decision to pay for hospital care for the poor is good social policy, business and labor leaders question whether continued reliance on the unemployment fund is good fiscal policy. The state has diverted $1.6 billion from the unemployment fund for hospital care for the poor from 1993 until the state's authority to use the fund expired on Dec. 31.
While Governor Whitman's proposal to raise cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack would have generated only about $125 million a year, it would have reduced reliance on the unemployment insurance fund, making it possible for business and labor leaders to consider supporting a smaller diversion. But Republican lawmakers refused to go along with the cigarette tax because their fellow Democrats would not agree to also vote in favor of it. (Democrats have been reluctant to support any tax increase since they were badly punished by the voters for approving former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 million income tax increase.)
But lawmakers and Mrs. Whitman now find themselves battling charges that continued dependence on the unemployment fund amounts to a hidden payroll tax on both employers and employees.
Governor Whitman gained national attention by cutting income-tax rates as part of her effort to reduce the tax burden on residents, as well as create a more competitive business climate in New Jersey.
Yet the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents 14,000 companies around the state, contends that its members have been hit with higher unemployment-insurance tax rates since the state first began to use the unemployment fund to pay for charity care. Unemployment-insurance tax rates are determined by the level of reserves in the fund, which pays about $1.2 billion in unemployment benefits a year. The fund's cash balance has fallen from $2.8 billion in 1991 to $1.7 billion this year, which employers say has resulted in higher tax rates.
Workers, meanwhile, argue that the $331 million in payroll taxes they paid last year should be used to increase unemployment benefits or provide for an extension of benefits for those having difficulty finding a job.
To win labor's support, legislative leaders are now considering 13 more weeks of unemployment benefits for out-of-work New Jerseyans for a total of 39 weeks.
New Jersey is one of only four states that imposes a payroll tax to help cover the cost of unemployment claims. It is a regressive tax, with workers paying .625 percent on the first $18,000 earned in taxable wages. So, employees earning $20,000 and $100,000 pay the same amount, about $112.50 a year. That totaled $331 million last year alone in payroll taxes from workers in New Jersey. None of that money went to pay for unemployment claims. All but $13.7 million for a state job training program was earmarked for charity care. Since the state first began using the unemployment insurance fund, workers have paid a total of $900 million in payroll taxes for health care for the uninsured.
During that same time, the state's employers contributed a total of $3.2 billion toward the unemployment fund since 1993, with $700 million allocated for charity care.
As the debate over how the state will fulfill its obligation to pay for charity care, hospitals have continued to provide medical treatment to the uninsured without payments from the state. Some hospitals have imposed a hiring freeze and cut back on supplies and payments to vendors to make ends meet. The state missed its first payment this month and lawmakers and Governor Whitman are under pressure to find a quick solution before the next payment is due, March 16.

HEADLINE: STAY ON THEIR BACKS

 BODY:
Paul R. Krugman's "Stay on Their Backs" (Feb. 4) was a breath of fresh air. The idea that suddenly, out of nowhere, American industry has found the philosopher's stone to substantially increasing productivity strikes me as farfetched. Computerization has been going on for years. 
 What is new is the firing of thousands of middle managers. This has temporarily boosted corporate earnings, just as bloodletting would temporarily cause a dieter to lose weight. Whether corporations are now lean and mean or really lean and sick remains to be seen.

THE SWORD OF IMAGINATION
Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict.
By Russell Kirk.
Eerdmans, $34.99.
 Russell Kirk's "Conservative Mind" (1953) was the first full-length survey of the history of Western conservative thought since Edmund Burke. As such, it played a key role in the postwar revival of conservatism in the United States, and is still the best book of its kind. Nothing Kirk wrote, said or did between the publication of "The Conservative Mind" and his death in 1994 at the age of 75 was of comparable influence, partly because his brand of conservatism (in which economic considerations played virtually no part) became increasingly unfashionable on the American right and partly because many of his contemporaries found his personality uncomfortably quirky. These quirks are on display throughout "The Sword of Imagination," an autobiography written in the third person and clotted with coyly self-conscious archaisms. Kirk clearly thought himself a great man, and had little patience with those who disagreed. The result is a memoir whose immodesty borders at times on megalomania: "Why, from time to time a good many people told him that chiefly he had set in motion a train of ideas, that he had reminded a generation of the existence of permanent things in morals and politics, that he had struck the errors of socialism a dolorous blow and had chastened liberalism's presumption." Anyone seriously interested in the early days of the conservative intellectual movement in this country will need to read this book, but few will be able to do so without squirming. Terry Teachout

Bear Markets: Fierce, Yes, But Fleeting

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Even though investors keep piling into stocks, many are fretting about the next bear market.
When will a bear market come and how bad will it be? The timing is unpredictable, says H. Bradlee Perry, a consultant and former chairman of David L. Babson & Company, investment counselors in Cambridge, Mass., and advisers of the Babson mutual funds. 
 He pointed to some of the worst declines in recent years as a sign of the capriciousness of bear markets. In 1962, the stock market fell 29 percent after President John F. Kennedy took on the steel companies for raising prices. In 1973-74, the market lost about half its value when inflation soared because of the Arab oil embargo. In 1990, the market dropped 20 percent after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
It is true that before each decline, the stock market had become highly valued, leaving it vulnerable. But before the bad news, valuations had been high for three, four or five years without problem.
But the good news is that bear markets have been relatively short-lived. In the last 40 years, the Standard & Poor's 500 has dropped 15 percent or more 14 times, Mr. Perry pointed out. The average decline has lasted eight months, and 75 percent of the loss was recouped in seven months. Full rebounds took just over a year, on average.
As swift as the declines seem, the ensuing rallies have been exceptionally strong. And missing the first phase of the market recovery has proved costly. Overall stock prices, for example, jumped 42 percent in the first three months of the bull market that began in the fall of 1982. Similarly, the market surged 26 percent from a low in October 1974 until the end of January 1975. And it rose 31 percent in the four months after the October 1990 low.
Mr. Perry concludes that the greatest risk to investors is not being caught in a falling market, but being out of stocks when the market starts to soar.
People who attempt to time the market -- selling when prices are at a peak and buying when they are at bottom -- are hamstrung in part because they have to make not just one, but two extremely difficult calls.

Those Instructions Aren't Always Correct
The byzantine tax rules concerning fund income always give investors a headache. But the headache could be bigger than usual this year for some shareholders in the Vanguard Group of funds.
A slip-up by Vanguard could cost shareholders tax penalties and unwanted run-ins with the Internal Revenue Service.
The problem is a couple of misplaced sentences in the instructions from Vanguard to help investors complete their tax forms. The goof could cause shareholders to understate their total dividend income.
Two situations can cause trouble. The first is not attaching a Schedule B. Take a look at Form 1099-DIV, which Vanguard mails to investors and which shows total dividends and other distributions for 1995. If you received more than $400 in gross taxable distributions from Vanguard -- that's in Box 1a -- and less than $400 of ordinary dividends -- Box 1b -- and follow Vanguard's instructions precisely, you will complete your Form 1040 correctly but will fail to attach the required Schedule B, listing interest and dividend income, to your return.
The second problem arises for investors who receive more than $400 of gross taxable distributions and ordinary dividends. Here, Vanguard's instructions will lead you to understate your dividend income by the amount of your capital gains distribution. A result: you won't pay enough tax to Uncle Sam.
The advice? Disregard Vanguard's instructions and use the instructions that come with Form 1040. Or call Vanguard's customer service department at (800) 662-2739 for a corrected copy.
A Vanguard spokesman said that the error in instructions was not a big deal and that investors who had been misled have plenty of time to correct their returns. Early birds who have already filed returns can send in amended returns before April 15 without penalty.
Only people who hold shares in taxable accounts are affected; retirement account owners can rest easy. Most important, the numbers on all Form 1099-DIV's mailed to shareholders are correct, Vanguard said.

A Pie Has Changed, But Not the Slice
The nation's 5,789 funds held $2.82 trillion at the of 1995, according to data recently released by the Investment Company Institute, the trade group in Washington.
Sounds like a lot? From 1953 to 1965, American households kept a third to 40 percent of their financial assets in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, according to the Federal Reserve. Today, they have about 35 percent, so the portion, at least, is not really out of whack.
At the end of the year, the fund money was split among 2,222 stock funds (which held 45 percent of the money), 2,567 bond funds (28.3 percent) and 1,000 money funds (26.7 percent).
Mutual funds owned 13.1 percent of America's $7.4 trillion in corporate equities, according to the Federal Reserve's latest estimate, up from 12.5 percent last year.
A third of all fund money was stashed in retirement accounts at the end of 1994, mostly in individual retirement accounts ($361.2 billion) and defined contribution pension plans ($236.5 billion).

New Funds
Warburg Pincus Japan Growth is a new nondiversified fund that aims for long-term growth of capital by buying growth stocks traded on major exchanges or over the counter in Japan. Being nondiversified means the fund can concentrate its investments, thereby increasing risk.
AARP Global Growth, the first global fund in the AARP Investment Program from Scudder, will invest in established companies in 20 or more countries. It will own stocks from at least 100 companies in various industries. The Scudder program is designed especially for members of the American Association of Retired Persons.
 
Manager Changes
Ron Chapman, formerly of the Northern Trust Company, Chicago, has joined the Dreyfus Corporation as head of international equities.
David Evans, research analyst and co-manager of Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth, takes over the fund from Bob Czepiel, who retired.
Fidelity has shuffled managers of three of its Select Portfolios. John Porter, a Fidelity equity analyst, has taken over Fidelity Select Multimedia from Stephen Dufour, who continues to run Select Transportation. Katherine Collins, an equity research analyst, succeeds Deborah Wheeler, who is taking a temporary leave, as manager of Select Leisure. Larry Rakers, who manages Select American Gold, has taken over Select Paper and Forest Products from Scott Offen, who continues with Fidelity as an equity research analyst.

In Brief
Oberweis Emerging Growth was renamed Emerging Growth Portfolio, and its annual 12b-1 fee, which covers marketing costs, was reduced to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent of the amount invested.
Smith Barney Precious Metals and Minerals becomes Smith Barney Natural Resources, and its investment objective has changed to reflect long-term appreciation by investing in natural-resource areas like oil, gas and timber, in addition to gold and other minerals. The sales charge is 5 percent.
Value Advantage Plus is a new variable annuity from the brokerage firm Jack White & Company. Insurance expenses amount to 0.45 percent of invested assets. Investors can choose among 21 options from well-known fund companies -- Alliance Capital Management, Federated Investors, Lexington Management, Massachusetts Financial Services, Montgomery Asset Management, Strong Funds, Twentieth Century and Van Eck Global -- and 10 fixed-rate accounts with maturities of 1 to 10 years. No sales charges or surrender charges apply. The annuity is underwritten by the Fortis Benefits Insurance Company, St. Paul.
Investors who open accounts in the Blanchard Growth and Income fund by June 30 will receive a $100 cash bonus as long as they keep the required minimum of $3,000 for at least 90 days. The offer is limited to first-time investors in the fund and to one account a household.
The No-Load Analyzer from Value Line Publishing is a computer program for Windows that includes data on more than 1,800 funds sold with no charge or a very low one. The program lets investors sort funds, track performance and create portfolios. A trial offer for $29 includes the software plus two monthly updates on a CD-ROM or 3.5-inch disks. A year's subscription costs $95 if you want quarterly updates, or $149 with monthly updates. Call (800) 284-7607, ext. 5922.
Founders Asset Management is offering a free guide to overseas investing (800 525-2440).

Should You Invest? Kick the Tires First

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
EVEN before they open for business, some chains of used-car stores are dreaming of going public.
Whether the chains' concept -- shopping on a vast lot and not haggling over the price -- appeals to the car buyer in you, the investor in you should know that some similar efforts have been a losing proposition in the past. 
 To be sure, sales of used cars are growing and prices are rising while dealers face tighter profit margins on new cars. Dealer sales of new cars and used cars were virtually even in 1990, but last year, used-car sales, at 18.5 million, exceeded new-car sales, at 14.8 million, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
But for any dealer trying to garner a bigger share of the business, one big obstacle remains -- getting a steady supply of good cars. That basic fact has some car industry experts wary about the investment potential of the new stores.
One big chain is up and running: Car Max, a unit of Circuit City Stores Inc., has four locations and ambitious expansion plans. Coming soon are stores from Auto Nation USA, whose investors include H. Wayne Huizenga, the former chairman of Blockbuster, and Driver's Mart Worldwide Inc., formed last month by nine big car dealers. Other small outfits already operating include Car Choice, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and HPR Automotive Superstore of Springfield, Ill.
The only company with publicly traded stock is Circuit City. Its four Car Max stores are dwarfed by its 412 electronics stores, so the stock price barely reflects its car sales. Circuit City has no plans to spin off the car subsidiary and expects to finance further expansion with the cash from its electronics stores, said Richard L. Sharp, the chairman and chief executive of Circuit City. "If we reach the point in time where it seems appropriate to do that, to sell some or all of Carmax to the public, we will evaluate that -- it's clearly too early," Mr. Sharp said. "One criterion might be when it starts making money."
Thomas W. Eggleston, a former Amway official who is chief executive of Driver's Mart, said his chain might issue stock in as soon as three years. "We don't see it as a near-term step," he said. "We do recognize in establishing our own finance company, as that grows, we will have to look for sources of capital."
Auto Nation, which has the backing not only of Mr. Huizenga, but also of James Moran, a wealthy car distributor in Deerfield Beach, Fla., plans to open its first store this summer. While company officials say they have no plans to go public this year, they have not ruled out doing so next year.
Because a steady supply of good used cars is essential for the new superstores to succeed, the ones affiliated with new-car dealers are expected to have an edge. The dealers take many trade-in cars and have exclusive access to auto makers' used-car auctions.
The track record of used-car chains has been mediocre. One unsuccessful experiment was Urcarco Inc., which catered to low-income consumers, many with poor credit histories. A corny name did not save the company during the recession of the early 1990's. It left the used-car business, changed its name to Americredit and switched to making loans to used-car dealers.
Urcarco primarily sold older cars with substantial markups at small dealerships. The new superstores intend to sell late-model cars to fairly affluent buyers and to rely on high turnover rather than steep markups for profits.
Besides Urcarco, the Ford Motor Company jumped briefly into the used-car business in 1991, setting up four dealerships to sell its own cars. Ford closed the unit within a year, after receiving complaints from its new-car dealers and after having trouble finding enough cars. Since then, the popularity of car leasing has made more late-model vehicles available to the auto makers.
But some auto industry experts still say a shortage of low-mileage, late-model used cars will prove to be the Achilles' heel of the superstores. For cars, the superstores depend heavily on individuals, dealers and finance companies not tied to the car makers.
As more and more companies and new-car dealers jump into the used-car business, and as car leases grow longer, competition will soon be fierce for a limited number of low-mileage, late-model used cars. For a prospective investor in these businesses, that is cause for concern.
"I would be extremely cautious unless it's going to be a very short-term investment," said Art Spinella, the general manager of CNW Marketing Research Inc. in Bandon, Ore. "It's going to be incredibly volatile after 1997."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Pushing Goodyear To Focus Abroad

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
CAN Samir Gibara keep the good news rolling at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company?
Mr. Gibara, known as Sam, is the Egyptian-born executive who succeeded the near-legendary Stanley Gault in January as the company's chief executive. Mr. Gault, 69, retires as chairman in June, and the Goodyear board has signaled that Mr. Gibara will get the additional title. 
 Mr. Gault's tenure has been a good one for Goodyear stockholders. Their shares were a bit over $10 when Mr. Gault took over in June 1991, and they closed Friday at $49.375. Dividends on the common stock have increased fivefold.
Of course, after such a run-up and with the departure of the executive credited with it, investors might understandably be skittish. They may be even more nervous that their company is in the tire industry, a slow-growing, rough-and-tumble game with three global giants, of which Goodyear is the smallest. Its competitors, Japan's Bridgestone Corporation and France's Groupe Michelin, had tire sales of $12.4 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, last year. Goodyear trailed with $11.3 billion.
Nonetheless, many analysts are decidedly upbeat. Goodyear's earnings, which have increased for 19 consecutive quarters, will continue steadily upward and support a higher stock price, they say. In a survey by First Call, a Boston research firm, the consensus of analysts is that earnings this year will reach $4.49 a share, up from $4.02 in 1995. And the consensus estimate for 1997 is $4.97 a share.
"The stock was up about 35 percent in 1995, which makes it a market performer," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "But if the earnings are up in 1996 and 1997 as expected, there is some upside room. It is selling at a discount to the market."
Despite the earnings optimism, the company's current price-earnings ratio of 10.37 is well below the 19.28 ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks. In part, this stems from the overall market's low regard for low-tech products like tires -- an attitude that can spell a profit opportunity.
That may be one reason large investors are accumulating stock in the company. In 1995, the 15 largest Goodyear investors bought, on average, 5.2 million more shares than they sold in 1995.
Among the 10 that increased their positions were Alliance Capital Management and the Travelers Group.
But there are other reasons they may be buying, including confidence about Mr. Gibara's centerpiece strategy: overseas growth. Not surprisingly for someone who spent the bulk of his 30-year Goodyear career far from the company's headquarters in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Gibara thinks globally. "The opportunities are in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, China and India," he said in lightly accented English, one of the five languages he speaks. "Even Japan is becoming more open. Because of the long recession there, Japanese customers are willing to consider foreign products if they are more affordable."
Indeed, offshore is where the money is already. In 1995, Goodyear's sales outside the United States amounted to 45 percent of sales and 56 percent of its gross profits.
Mr. Gibara wants to set up more plants abroad as well as more sales abroad -- and analysts like the double value of foreign sites.
As Mr. Heinbach noted, Goodyear's investments in plants yield a source of low-cost exports as well as access to the local market. "If sales drop off in Brazil, then it becomes a platform for exports," he said.
Analysts also like Goodyear's work in developing new tire models.
"A key part of their plan is to enrich the mix as well as grow market share," said Saul H. Ludwig, an analyst with McDonald & Company Investments in Cleveland. "If you introduce new products, you can get better pricing." The reason: "With a new product, you do not have anything to compare with."
Goodyear has moved aggressively on this front, introducing the premium-priced Aquatred for wet roads, special tires for off-road vehicles and the Infinitred, which has a lifetime tread-wear warranty.
And the company, which posted a 7.2 percent increase in earnings last year, did so while absorbing a $1 billion increase in raw materials. That is one reason Mr. Ludwig estimates Goodyear stock has an upward potential of at least 20 percent.
"If raw materials costs level off or if they can find ways to change their raw materials, we could see a big improvement," he said.
Of course, Mr. Gibara's global plan is a direct challenge to Bridgestone and Michelin, and those giants may retaliate. When he tells tire dealers, as he did recently, that his plan is intended "to give our major competition something to worry about in their own backyards," it is hard to imagine his competitors just sitting on their hands.
There are also risks for the whole industry. Higher interest rates could depress car sales and, with it, tire sales to auto makers. And the replacement tire business in the United States -- still the company's largest market by far -- has been soft, with 1995 industry sales about 2 percent below the 1994 total.
But if they can help Mr. Gibara fill Mr. Gault's shoes, the risks may be worth taking.

HEADLINE: PATH Isn't the Problem; Raising Fare Isn't a Solution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mark Green makes me laugh. "Although the city subway fare has increased three times since 1987, to $1.50 today, the PATH fare is still $1," he writes in his Feb. 25 Soapbox essay, and goes on to ask why "city straphangers, who make 50 percent less on average than New Jersey PATH riders, pay 50 percent more to get to work." 
 In fact, New Jersey commuters are hardly getting a break. For one thing, most PATH riders also take the subway once they get to Manhattan. Second, every commuter from New Jersey must also pay New York City and State income taxes (not to mention the 8 1/4 percent sales tax), part of which goes to pay Mr. Green's inflated salary.
Finally, a ride on the city subway costs the same whether you go from 34th to 42d Street in Manhattan or from 233d Street in the Bronx to the Flatlands section of Brooklyn -- 23 miles for $1.50. What's wrong with this picture? At least on PATH, we're talking about a limited short run under the river.
If Mr. Green thinks New Jersey commuters are getting a free ride, perhaps they should stay home for a week and show him how much we contribute to his city.

HEADLINE: Compromising Positions;
I Promised Me a Rose Garden

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TIRED of professional politicians? Let's have a citizens' Congress that meets only half the year, at half today's pay, and stays home the rest of the time.
Think the tax system is too complicated? Scrap the graduated income tax and impose a flat tax. 
 Too many illegal immigrants? Build a wall on the Mexican border.
Sick of supporting lazy bums on welfare? Force people off public relief after a few years and make them work.
These are some of the impossibly simple solutions the Republican candidates for President are offering this year to correct maddeningly complicated problems.
Cure-alls are standard fare in American Presidential campaigns. Real solutions to serious problems almost always involve unpleasant tradeoffs. The budget cannot be balanced, for example, without raising taxes or trimming Medicare and other popular benefits.
"So in a campaign," said Thomas E. Mann, director of Government studies at the Brookings Institution, "you accentuate the positive. If you laid out the complexity, you would have to make the costs explicit, and no one wants to do that."
Once in office, Presidents sometimes abandon the quick fixes as impractical.
George Bush dropped the idea of imposing what he called a flexible freeze in Government spending. Bill Clinton never followed up on his campaign promise to eliminate tax breaks for American companies that shut down American plants and then ship jobs overseas. (What companies? What tax breaks? What jobs? Mr. Clinton never said exactly.)
But often Presidents do try to implement their simple solutions, only to find that the problems are more complicated than they imagined.
In the 1992 campaign, when Mr. Clinton proposed affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans through local networks of insurers, hospitals and doctors, the idea sounded ever so workable. When he finally submitted a plan along those lines after he became President, though, it was so thick and cumbersome that it died of its own weight.
This year's campaign may set a record for facile ideas.
"There does seem to be an uncommon degree of goofiness in some of their proposals," said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin.
Lamar Alexander would abolish Federal welfare and food stamp programs and turn the money over to neighborhood charities to distribute it to the poor.
Never mind that the directors of such charities say they are not equipped to handle the task. Imagine the brawl when churches, mosques, homeless shelters, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, drug-treatment clinics, the Red Cross, day-care centers and other local charities begin competing for the relief pie.
Mr. Alexander's most intriguingly simple idea may be his proposal for a citizens' Congress. Exactly how he intends to bring this about is not clear. And what kind of part-time jobs could lawmakers take when they were not in Washington? Could they run a business, or teach or maintain a medical or dental practice? Probably not, since those jobs normally require full-time attention. Maybe members of Congress could be lobbyists in their off hours.
Steve Forbes's proposal for a flat tax also sounds good politically. (The other three main candidates thought so too. In their debate in South Carolina last week, they all embraced a flat tax to one degree or another.) But it only sounds good until the details are parsed.
Granted, the current tax system is a nightmare for many individuals and most companies. By some estimates, it costs Americans more than $100 billion a year in accountant fees and administrative expenses to comply with the law.
But here's the rub: The single tax rate Mr. Forbes proposes (17 percent on corporate profits and on wages and salaries after exempting $13,000 for each adult and $5,000 for each child) would cost the Government $200 billion a year in lost revenue, according to economists using conventional forecasting methods.
For a flat-tax to raise as much money as the current tax system, the rate would have to be so high and the exemptions so low that most middle-income families would face a tax increase. That's the last thing Republican candidates want to endorse.
Another idea that may not have been completely thought through is Patrick J. Buchanan's proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border. For one thing, half the illegal aliens in this country entered legally, but overstayed their visas.
The candidates also back the idea of forcing people on welfare to work. So, for that matter, does President Clinton. The problem is that it costs more to provide the child-care, job-training and other services necessary to get these people into jobs than it does just to give them cash. And the Republican candidates want to cut Government spending on the poor.
Another matter on which the Republicans agree is the Department of Education. They all want to abolish it. They see it as a symbol of Washington bureaucracy and intrusion into local affairs.
But they certainly don't want to scrap the Department's popular programs -- student loans, aid to elementary and secondary schools, Head Start and the like. These programs, presumably, would be turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services.
That would create a peculiar twist. Remember, it used to be called the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Then in 1977, President Jimmy Carter separated out the education activities in their own separate Department.
He did it to fulfill a campaign promise.

HEADLINE: The World;
What Castro Still Needs Is a Good Fight

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
UNTIL last weekend, it was tempting to think that Fidel Castro mattered less to the United States than at any time since his seizure of power 37 years ago. Ever since Bill Clinton took office, Washington has viewed Mr. Castro as a noxious irritant, to be sure, but mostly it has tried to ignore him. Yet somehow Mr. Castro -- and the exiles in Miami who so despise him -- manage periodically to keep drawing America's attention back to their family feud.
Since Cuba no longer underwrites revolutionary movements in Latin America (not that it could afford to) and, with the cold war over, no longer serves as a Soviet beachhead, it poses no real threat to American strategic interests, or so the Clinton Administration believes. But that is hardly the point. 
 Just as the exiles regularly need to remind Mr. Castro that they do not intend to give up their struggle, so does he feel compelled to demonstrate to his people that Cuba and its floundering revolution still have enemies that only he can protect them from. No wonder the United States gets caught in the middle.
Before he became a Communist, after all, Fidel Castro was already a nationalist, and during his long history as the principal adversary of the United States in Latin America, he has often found it more advantageous to invoke the legacy of the Cuban nationalist Jose Marti than that of Karl Marx. Last week was clearly one of those occasions; it began with Cuban Air Force jets shooting down two unarmed civilian planes over the Straits of Florida and ended yesterday with United States Coast Guard vessels protecting an exile flotilla just off Cuba's coast (and assuring they staged no provocation).
Viewed from outside, this latest confrontation with the United States appears to produce little for Mr. Castro. The slight lessening of tensions in relations with the Clinton Administration that had been achieved has now evaporated, replaced by the reinforcement of existing American economic sanctions and the prospect of other, harsher measures.
But none of that reflects Mr. Castro's real priority, which is keeping his regime in power during its longest and most severe crisis. At home, the events of the last week have allowed him to portray himself as a patriot, standing up for "our little country" against the bullying of a much-larger neighbor to the north that, Cubans have been led to believe, has always coveted Cuba's territory and resources, while sheltering and encouraging traitors to the Fatherland.
 
 
 
Boxed In
 In a sense, Mr. Castro has had no other choice than to pursue that strategy. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989, he has seen most of the basic pillars of the Socialist system here deteriorate or, in some cases, vanish altogether. Health and education have eroded, several other basic services are no longer offered free of charge, prostitution has re-emerged and the dollar has become the country's second currency. Worst of all, from Mr. Castro's point of view, has been the experimentation, however timid, with economic policies that reward individual initiative and undermine Socialist egalitarianism.
Mr. Castro has complained of having to implement even those modest reforms, knowing they will lead to a loss of the state control and authority he views as essential. And though he has lately become enamored of China's method of combining economic reform with political repression, he has proven less flexible on most issues than his counterparts in Beijing. They welcome investment from Taiwan, for instance.
Mr. Castro still excoriates "that mafia in Miami," presumably including his sister Juana, his daughter Alina Revuelta and a nephew by marriage, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who is a Republican Congressman from Florida. The Chinese now preach the gospel that "becoming rich is good," while Cuba's leader appears to still regard it as a sin -- or at least as a crime and a betrayal of principle.
"Yes, we have legalized robbery," he lamented in a speech to the National Assembly on Dec. 26 that urged the imposition of an income tax, "or at least a certain type of thievery that is produced on the black market here and there, done in one way or another. We have had to adapt ourselves to realities."
Under those circumstances, Mr. Castro has little to hold on to, or to justify his continued rule, than the nationalist card he has always played whenever he felt himself in trouble. Wrapping himself in the Cuban flag and pointing his finger at Washington enables Mr. Castro to paint anyone opposed to him, including both the 1.5 million Cuban exiles in the United States and the 130 dissident and human rights groups here that have recently come together in an umbrella coalition called Concilio Cubano, as nothing more than agents of sinister American interests.
Mr. Castro's objective is to "divert attention from the generalized internal crisis to the terrain of bilateral relations," Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, one of Cuba's leading dissidents, said. "He wants to continue exaggerating the image of the external enemy which has been vital for the Cuban Government during decades, an external enemy which can be blamed for the failure of the totalitarian model implanted here."
 
 
 
History Lessons
 The history of the relationship between the United States and Cuba is such that the Cuban leader has plenty to draw on when he needs to inflame his country's 11 million people. During his own administration, Mr. Castro can list, among other things, the Bay of Pigs and various assassination attempts against him, all of which are recounted at the popular Museum of the Revolution here, with its "cretins' corner" devoted to Ronald Reagan. Earlier, there were the expansionist impulses that led to the Spanish-American War and to the Platt Amendment of 1902, which granted Washington "the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence."
Indeed, the Cuban Government has been quick to evoke that past in the current confrontation. Whether mere coincidence or something more, the attack on the Brothers to the Rescue airplanes occurred on the 101st anniversary of "El Grito de Baires," Jose Marti's call to arms that launched Cuba's war of independence against Spain. And when Juan Pablo Roque, a former Brothers to the Rescue pilot who now appears to have been a Cuban infiltrator, was asked during television interviews here about his reasons for returning from the United States, he cited Marti's famous phrase about living in "the belly of the beast."
 
 
 
Letting It Simmer
 For its part, the Clinton Administration has been content to let the Cuban situation simmer, fending off at the same time leaders of the exile movement who are pushing for a final reckoning and businessmen who are very eager to begin trading again with Havana: The political repercussions in Florida have always seemed too large a risk. In fact, once the raft crisis of August 1994 was resolved, with an immigration agreement that ended a 30-year-old American policy that regarded all Cubans fleeing the island as political refugees, the Administration had hoped Cuba would remain on the back burner until Mr. Clinton's second term.
Mr. Castro, however, operates on a very different timetable than the nine American Presidents he has squared off with, and once again has forced Mr. Clinton to deal with Cuba on his terms.
So now, Mr. Clinton finds himself at a loss for what to do next. The legal enactment of the American economic embargo -- one of the steps that a punitive bill now before Congress would take -- would tie the President's hands in the future and make it hard for him to pursue any kind of detente without the approval of Capitol Hill.
It would also make it much easier for Mr. Castro to manufacture another crisis the next time he thinks his political and economic problems are getting out of hand -- which may well be what the Cuban leader and those closest to him have had in mind all along.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Church on Buchanan: Judgment Day Is Near

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
PROBABLY not many voters, or even many Presidential primary junkies, know the religious affiliation of Senator Bob Dole (Methodist) or Lamar Alexander (Presbyterian) or Steve Forbes (Episcopalian). But it has been hard to avoid knowing that Patrick J. Buchanan is Roman Catholic.
In his autobiography, "Right From the Beginning," and other statements, Mr. Buchanan has made his Catholic upbringing and adult religious faith an integral part of his crusading public persona. In news coverage, Mr. Buchanan's character and convictions are typically explained in terms of parochial school discipline, Sunday sermons and moral dogmatism. More darkly, his style has been compared to that of the Rev. Charles Coughlin, the 1930's radio priest whose populist economics eventually turned anti-Semitic. 
 Mr. Buchanan is part of "a Catholic tradition," said Newsweek, that includes Father Coughlin and Senator Joseph McCarthy. "Christian soldier: trained by Jesuits," the magazine declared in a photo caption, "Buchanan revels in certitude."
This frequent identification of Mr. Buchanan with Catholicism is beginning to trouble many Roman Catholics. Some see in it a revival of anti-Catholic stereotypes. Others are worried about something else: that Mr. Buchanan's positions, even where accurately portrayed, will be confused with those of the church.
"With the exception of abortion," said an editorial in The Tidings, the weekly newspaper of the Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles, "the U.S. Catholic hierarchy and Buchanan are at odds on just about every issue that the bishops have said has serious moral and ethical consequences. Welfare reform, education, immigration, health care and affirmative action are just a few of the hot-button issues where both sides have little or no common ground at present."
A Buchanan Presidency, The Tidings surmised, would almost certainly result in "a constant series of high-profile clashes" with the nation's Catholic bishops. The paper's editorials are the work of an editorial board and not necessarily the views of Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles, but they undoubtedly reflect the Cardinal's dedication to protecting the church's large and growing Hispanic membership, which generally objects to Mr. Buchanan's proposals to restrict immigration.
Some Catholics may view the identification of Mr. Buchanan as a Catholic as a faint replay of the attacks on John F. Kennedy as a politician beholden to the Pope, but others, like The Tidings editors, think that such nativist fears are no longer the issue. For them, the better parallel might be John Cardinal O'Connor's 1984 run-in with Geraldine Ferraro, the Catholic Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, over the candidate's advocacy of abortion rights. The New York prelate felt that Ms. Ferraro was, as the The Tidings said of Mr. Buchanan, sowing "seeds of confusion among Catholics over who legitimately speaks for the Catholic Church."
 
 
 
Little Alarm, so Far
 It is hard to guess the extent of such misgivings among Catholic bishops themselves, who almost always keep silent about particular candidates (the Ferraro case was exceptional) and signal their preferences, if at all, only late in a campaign and by way of gestures like photo opportunities. Certainly the misgivings exist on the next level of church officials, both priests and laity, although falling considerably short of The Tidings' level of alarm.
The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a former adviser to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and now a professor at Harvard and pastor in Cambridge, Mass., says that in talking to church groups across the country, he has encountered very little anxiety over the Buchanan candidacy's import for the church. Father Hehir described the prevailing attitude as, "It's not time to get worried yet and why create unnecessary fissures in church ranks?"
One bishop with that wait-and-see attitude is Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden, N.J. "We're not going to get into a position of fostering or opposing anyone," he said, but he nonetheless seemed ready to give Mr. Buchanan the benefit of the doubt.
He said "Catholic pro-lifers are happy" about Mr. Buchanan's staunch opposition to abortion, but his call for tough curbs on immigration was "at variance with the way the church has spoken" and his tone disturbing to many Catholics. Bishop McHugh added, however, that the candidate "has the time and opportunity to refine these things."
Catholics account for about one in four voters in a Presidential election. Their reaction to the Buchanan phenomenon is complicated, because some of them feel that charges of bigotry against Mr. Buchanan are themselves evidence of another brand of bigotry. William A. Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, complained last week of "Catholic baiting." He said that charges that Mr. Buchanan is racist or anti-Semitic are frequently accompanied by references to traditional Catholicism and stereotype-laden phrases like "Jesuit training."
Many Catholics, both liberal and conservative, were particularly incensed at a recent biographical report on ABC's "Nightline" about Mr. Buchanan. The report said that Mr. Buchanan's father had been a regular listener to the anti-Semitic broadcasts of Father Coughlin. Ted Koppel, the anchor of "Nightline," last week apologized for reporting that detail, saying it had appeared in several publications but that the program had failed to confirm it.
Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister and manager of his Presidential campaign, in a news conference last week assailed the ABC report on her brother as "lies," calling Mr. Koppel an "anti-Catholic bigot" and denying that her father listened to the Coughlin broadcasts. Mr. Koppel said her charges were "hysterical" as well as "repugnant, unfair and absolutely untrue."
 
 
 
Negativity Faulted
 A different issue was raised by George Weigel, head of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, a neoconservative research group. He said the Catholic church views politics as a positive human endeavor, "as an arena of creativity and intellectual and moral dialogue. Pat's campaign is not about dialogue but about we're going to beat these guys."
As for abortion, "it is impressive that Buchanan is unapologetically and unambiguously pro-life, but I would be concerned about how the tone of the rest of his campaign affects this." he said.
"Does it make it more difficult for that message to be engaged by a broad range of people?" he asked. "Yes, it does."
By contrast, neither Bishop McHugh nor Greg Erlandson, editor of Our Sunday Visitor, a popular national Catholic weekly newspaper published in Indiana, thought that making Mr. Buchanan the standard bearer for the anti-abortion movement could do it harm.
"He's forcing other Republican candidates to raise their voices on that issue," Mr. Erlandson said. "His campaign shows the force that pro-choice Republicans will have to deal with if they try to remove the party's anti-abortion plank from the platform."
But Mr. Erlandson said abortion is the only issue on which the Catholic leadership is comfortable with the Buchanan candidacy. If he draws high percentages of Catholic votes in later primaries, Mr. Erlandson said, it may well reveal a yawning gap between Catholic voters and the church's leadership rather than a convergence of views.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Fights More Housing Aided by U.S.

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
As part of the Federal budget debate, Congressional Republicans are mounting a fierce assault on a fundamental assumption behind Federal housing policy for the last half century: that every year, the Federal Government should directly add to the stock of subsidized housing for the ever-growing ranks of the poor and working class.
Last summer, the Republicans eliminated an expansion of more than 60,000 new housing units, nearly all in the form of rent subsidies, that had been approved when the Democrats controlled Congress. They called the new units a luxury the nation could no longer afford. And in the current deadlocked budget talks, they are proposing no new Federally financed units and are expected to do the same in their 1997 budget plans, due out in mid-March. 
 Now, President Clinton, bowing to a political and fiscal climate that is also throwing Federal guarantees for welfare and Medicaid into question, is expected to request a near-record low expansion -- housing assistance to about 30,000 new families.
Over the last 15 years, the Federal housing program has already shrunk drastically, from an average of about 290,000 new units or families assisted each year from 1977 to 1980, to an average of 74,000 each year since then.
In New York City and on Long Island, as well as in Hartford, there are nearly two poor people for every unit of low-income housing, according to a study released last year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. In northern New Jersey, the number is even higher, it said.
But no matter whether the President or the Republicans win the current debate, all sides agree that a sharp reversal in the Federal role in directly creating more affordable housing is under way. There will be little if any growth in the pool of 4.8 million Federally subsidized units in the next year -- and possibly much longer.
And now some advocates for the poor have begun to argue that the dwindling fortunes of Federally subsidized housing may serve as a cautionary tale for the Medicaid and welfare programs. Housing is a Federally financed social assistance program that never attained entitlement status, meaning that the Government never passed a law saying that anyone who met certain qualifications was "entitled" to guaranteed housing assistance.
As a result, only 20 to 30 percent of the people who qualify for Federal rental assistance actually receive it. The study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the nation's shortage of affordable housing had reached 4.7 million units, the largest gap since the early 1970's.
Several proposals at the forefront of the Federal budget debate would take entitlement status away from the Medicaid and welfare programs, too, and allow the states to decide how, and if, needy people would get assistance. As that debate advances, advocates for the poor say they worry that poor people might be placed on waiting lists for food stamps, or medical assistance -- just as they are for housing now.
"When something isn't an entitlement, it becomes a matter of noblesse oblige, which can be arbitrarily denied or terminated," said Steven V. Banks, a lawyer who heads the Homeless Family Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society of New York.
Some Republicans argue that the poor are already so underserved by the housing program that to stop further expansion does not represent a major blow. Moreover, some of them also argue that the opposition is not philosophical, but budgetary: As the Federal budget declines, they say, it may be impossible to sustain the existing stock of housing, with its steadily rising costs -- much less take on more.
"Unless we change our policies," said Stephen H. Kohashi, chief analyst for the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, "what we are going to do is drive this inventory into the ground -- which is the worst of all possible, and perhaps the most perverse, outcome that can come out of all of this."
In late 1994 Mr. Kohashi wrote a memo making the case for deep housing cuts that is still widely circulated among members of both parties. Of the Republicans' current efforts, he said in an interview: "I don't see it so much as a revolution as a revelation."
Mr. Kohashi's paper makes a strong case against what he calls "the myth of housing cuts." That is, even as the Government reduced year by year the number of new units that became available, the overall pool of housing still steadily increased over time. At the same time, the budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development grew at near double-digit rates annually, from $5.5 billion in 1980 to about $26 billion in 1995.
"Our perception is we cannot sustain what we have on the street," Mr. Kohashi said. "It's ludicrious to build up an even larger inventory."
But Administration housing officials and some advocates for the poor argue that an end to expansion is a repudiation of the goals of the Federal housing program, begun in 1937 with the United States Housing Act and affirmed by several Congresses and Presidents, mostly Democratic, ever since.
"That's the heart of the matter," one senior housing official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Are we continuing to add to the number of people who are getting housing assistance? The Republicans are saying we are not."
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, however, is expected to sweeten the request for the 30,000 additional units next year by tying it to a "welfare to work" program favored by Republicans.
And the Administration, in its broad effort to reform H.U.D., has parted company with many advocates for the poor by supporting various measures that the Republicans also like, including giving local housing authorities the ability to bring in more working families into public housing. The advocates say that that change would make the search for housing even harder for the poorest of the poor, though the plan's supporters say it would provide much-needed stability to housing projects.
The Republican budget proposal would center on three areas: It would freeze an expansion of new public housing development and rent vouchers, cut the overall H.U.D. budget from roughly $26 billion in 1995 to about $20 billion and give local public housing authorities more latitude to choose who qualifies for public housing.
Most of these measures are in effect now, as part of the temporary spending plan Congress and President Clinton agreed to late last year. The question now is: Will they become permanent and to what degree?
The Republicans did not touch two block grant programs that spur development of affordable housing through private companies and community groups. But Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has raised questions about the long-term survival of the biggest engine for producing new affordable housing: the Federal tax credit that goes to companies investing in low-income housing.
In the budget talks, the proposal that has generated the most concern is the elimination of new housing units, most of which are currently subsidized in the form of rental vouchers for poor people that are paid directly to private landlords, under Section 8 of the Federal housing laws. Because construction of housing projects has dropped to almost nothing, these vouchers have become nearly the only way the Federal Government can directly increase the level of assistance.
Debra Chapman, a 32-year-old mother of four from Connecticut, says she has no doubts where this budget would have left her had she not been able to get one of the rent vouchers last August after waiting nearly six years. She had recently struggled off welfare -- she shoplifted baby formula and clothes to make ends meet then -- and had started to work as a clerk in an ink factory.
But her rent, about $500 a month, had been too high, often more than half her take-home pay. The economics of her life had been forcing her into making a hard choice that the rent voucher headed off. It pays 70 percent of her rent.
"I would be back on welfare and back in the system I never wanted to be in in the first place," she said.
Some advocates and builders of low-income housing worry about other results of eliminating new assistance under Section 8, a program begun in the Nixon Administration. Most prominently, the program often acts as a linchpin for private developers or community organizations building low-income housing, because it guarantees a certain number of tenants at a predetermined rent. Some builders also worry that a freeze would send a signal to private investors that the Government is hesitant about continuing its own investment in poor neighborhoods.
"What worries us about Section 8 is the stability of the neighborhoods we are working in," said Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national organization that has raised $2 billion in private investment, grants and low-interest loans for low-income housing. "Are these neighborhoods going to come apart even more than they have?"
Along with Republican budget cutters, some advocates for poor people and managers of public housing authorities also argue that Section 8 is far too expensive and now accounts for too little new housing to justify its continuation.
Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican of Long Island and author of a housing bill that would replace the 1937 housing act, also contends that Section 8 has run out of control. But he argues that there should be some growth through Section 8 that is tied to specific programs, like spurring private development in coordination with community groups and local governments.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: HIROSHIMA, Japan

 BODY:
There is a view in some quarters of the Clinton Administration that the U.S. no longer needs to worry about Japan as an economic competitor. After all, Japan lags behind the U.S. in software innovation, it's going through a banking-bailout crisis, it has a rapidly aging population, and it can't seem to shake its recession.
As one U.S. official likes to say, "Japan today is an island with 125 million people growing old, who haven't invented anything new since the Sony Walkman." 
 I beg to differ. Yes, Japan will have to dig out of its banking crisis, and it will. But if you look at how Japan is strategically positioning itself for the future, only a fool -- a complete and utter fool -- would write this place off.
To begin with, the most competitive Japanese companies are quietly beginning to dominate the mega-market of tomorrow: Asia. That's Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Burma, southern China, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam (and Japan itself, which is 70 percent of East Asia's G.D.P.). In the 1980's Japan was putting about 12 percent of its foreign direct investment into other Asian countries; in the 1990's it's been about 35 percent.
Through this strategy Japanese companies are lowering their costs with cheaper Asian labor, while simultaneously capturing a major share of the fastest-growing market on the planet. This year, the Asian market for consumer electronics became larger than Europe and by next year it will be larger than the U.S. By the end of this decade Toyota (and all its Japanese suppliers who came along with it) will be producing one million cars a year in Thailand. Japan already has 80 percent of the auto market in Asia outside of Japan.
"The Japanese are arrogant, insular and stubborn, but they are not stupid," says Ken Courtis, economist for Deutsche Bank in Japan. "They see where the money is, they see where the growth is, and that is where they are parking their car -- and they are taking as many places in the parking lot as they can."
Yes, the U.S. is also investing in Asia, but not with such a coherent strategy. In January, Japan announced it was giving Cambodia $100 million in foreign aid to help it develop infrastructure for a new mobile phone system. A month later Cambodia awarded contracts to three private firms to market this new phone system to consumers. The contracts were divided up between the three major Japanese phone companies, N.T.T., Astel and NEC.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus with other Asian countries has increased almost 700 percent since 1985, from $8.9 billion to $70.7 billion. Much of that was Japanese factories moving their equipment to Asia. Sure, Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. is falling, because its companies are now hiding their exports to the U.S. under the labels "Made in Thailand" or "Made in Malaysia."
It's true that Japan is not as innovative as the U.S. in software, and innovation is important. But imitation isn't a bad second, especially if you're not only good at imitation but at improving on the original as well. Rented a car lately? You can get a computerized map on the dashboard that will give you directions, guided by satellite, to wherever you want to go. The U.S. put up that satellite to track ships and planes, but the Japanese adapted the technology for cars.
While Japan shifts production to Asia, it keeps the most complex, high-value-added jobs here. Toyota may make the Camry in Thailand, but it still makes the Lexus in Japan. Where Japanese companies can't innovate, they just buy U.S. companies that can. And with Japanese interest rates at 1 percent, that's not hard.
Japan is changing all right -- but not by becoming like us. Japan is simply looking for new ways to remain itself: a country that maintains almost no unemployment at home, by closing its markets to outsiders and focusing the best Japanese companies on exports.
Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation, remarked to me: "Just as we underestimated the U.S. six years ago, it would be a mistake for the U.S. to underestimate Japan today." Indeed. This is a serious country, with an underlying hardness and determination. The other day in Hiroshima, I toured the epicenter of the 1945 nuclear blast. There's only one building that survived the U.S. A-bomb attack, and that famous building's skeletal remains are still standing to this day.
It was the Industrial Promotion Hall.

HEADLINE: Curbs Expected to Have Little Effect

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, March 2

 BODY:
The new economic sanctions the Clinton Administration announced this week to punish Fidel Castro's Government for shooting down two unarmed civilian airplanes are likely to have only a limited immediate effect on the Cuban economy, according to diplomats, business executives and Cuban officials here.
Nothing in the measures already in effect or pending before Congress would, for example, affect money sent by Cuban-Americans to their relatives here, which runs as much as $500 million a year. One significant source of income for Cuba, its share of the revenues from phone calls between the countries, may actually rise as a result of the punitive steps Washington has taken. 
 Diplomats and business executives said it is even more doubtful that the harsh provisions of a bill introduced by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, would achieve their stated goal of bringing the Cuban economy crashing down. At best, they maintain, the bill may slow foreign investment, which they say has been leveling off anyway for reasons unrelated to American policy.
"There may be a chilling effect on those who have been thinking about coming in, at least in the short run," a diplomat here said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "But nothing of what has been announced so far looks like it will drive out anyone who is already here."
At a news conference here Thursday, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, a Foreign Ministry official who deals with American affairs, said the Helms-Burton legislation would "primarily affect the political climate between the United States and Cuba." He added that possible investors were being reassured that there is "no reason to stop doing business with Cuba."
The legislation, which President Clinton is expected to sign next week, would permit American citizens to sue foreigners and companies that acquire expropriated property in Cuba. It would also allow the United States to restrict the entry of foreigners who "traffic" in such properties.
But most of the important assets seized from American citizens in the early 1960's remain in the hands of the Cuban Government. These include many of the more than 160 sugar mills, which Cuba has refused to open to foreign investment because it regards sugar as a strategic industry, and utilities and a Bacardi rum and bottling plant.
Indeed, foreign and Cuban officials say only a handful of nationalized properties have been bought by foreign investors. The most notable is a nickel plant at Moa once owned by the Freeport Nickel and Sulphur Company of Louisiana, a 50 percent share in which has been acquired by a Canadian company, Sherrit International.
Sherrit is expected to invest about $500 million in modernizing and expanding the plant as part of an agreement it signed with the Cuban Government last year.
Other properties in this category include the old Havana Hilton Hotel, now being managed by a Spanish chain that claims to have no American interests, and a cosmetics factory formerly owned by Procter & Gamble.
The Cuban Government says more than 200 foreign companies from 50 countries have signed joint-venture agreements, with many setting up offices in what were formerly private residences owned by Cubans who are now American citizens. But those quarters are rented, since the Cuban Government has only this year authorized foreigners to buy real estate, and it is not clear to what extent that arrangement would be open to litigation under the American legislation.
As currently written, the legislation would impose penalties on anyone who "begins after the enactment of this act to manage, lease, possess, use or hold an interest in confiscated property." That would appear to exempt companies that already have offices here.
If the legislation passes, business executives like Ian Delaney, chairman of Sherrit International, could be denied the right to travel in the United States. But Sherrit last year spun off its Cuban interests, which may give the main company and others that adopt a similar approach some insulation from legal action in the United States.
In any case, the hotels of Havana have been filled all winter with European, Canadian and Latin American business executives who appear unconcerned by the threat of American sanctions. They seem to regard the legislation as saber-rattling, and argue that the law will prove both too cumbersome and too politically costly for Washington to enforce.
"Cuba is at most only a side issue in relations between the United States and my country," said one European businessman here, who spoke on condition that neither his name, his nationality nor his company be identified. "I simply cannot believe that the U.S. is going to risk the cooperation of its NATO partners on matters such as Bosnia or Russia because of this."
Already Canada, which has long had a flourishing trade with Cuba, is making efforts to head off the legislation. Canada is one of several United States allies that has laws of its own prohibiting its companies from complying with extraterritorial legislation passed by third countries.
"I don't think what they're doing is the way to treat their best friend and their No. 1 trading partner," Canada's International Trade Minister, Art Eggleton, said in Ottawa on Thursday. On Sunday Mr. Eggleton is to travel to Washington to press his case with American officials as part of a previously scheduled visit.
President Clinton's decision to tighten other aspects of the American embargo on trade with Cuba is likely to have mixed results. The suspension of charter flights, for instance, will certainly reduce the flow of visits by Cuban-Americans to relatives here, hamper their ability to buy gifts for family members while visiting and end the practice of sending large sums of money to them through couriers.
But in 1994 and 1995, when such restrictions also applied, Cuban-Americans found ways to get here through Mexico, the Bahamas and Panama. They also established contact with banks and exchange houses in those countries and in the Cayman Islands, which allowed them to continue transferring money to relatives here largely unimpeded.
This week's measures also leave intact direct telephone communication between the United States and Cuba, which has greatly improved in the past two years. Again, no precise figures are available, but analysts put Havana's share of the revenues from communications traffic at as much as $75 million a year.
"The volume of phone calls has been incredible, and it's pure profit for the Cubans since they haven't made any investment to improve their system," one diplomat said. He added that phone traffic is likely to increase now, because Cuban Americans will conclude that "if you can't visit, phone."

HEADLINE: To Mobilize the Faithful: A Christian Civics Class

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 2

 BODY:
The political power of religious conservatives may be most acutely felt in Washington. But the basis for that power -- the instruction and encouragement of the people who vote -- takes place away from the politicians and the polling booths, in church basements and at convention-style gatherings like one being held here.
Since Friday morning, more than 800 people from 39 states have been at the Broward County Convention Center for a three-day conference, "Reclaiming America for Christ," an event organizers describe as a "mini-course in Christian civics." 
 Speakers have discussed the economy, education, and constitutional law, all the while urging their audience to get involved in public life.
"We're trying to restore the moral and spiritual foundations of the nation," said the Rev. D. James Kennedy, president of Coral Ridge Ministries, which organized the event.
In secular circles, Dr. Kennedy commands little of the name recognition of, say, the Rev. Jerry Falwell. But among evangelical Protestants, Dr. Kennedy, the conservative senior minister of the nearly 9,000-member Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church here, may be at least as well known, in part because of his weekly television and daily radio programs, broadcast nationwide and overseas, as well as his writing, which make him a significant presence in Christian bookstores.
Lately, Coral Ridge Ministries has raised his profile even further by establishing the D. James Kennedy Center for Christian Statesmanship in Washington, to offer spiritual counsel to members of Congress and their staffs. The center's director, Frank Wright, who is active in efforts against pornography and abortion, said, "We think the staffers are the key to what goes on up there."
In an interview at his church, a large, modern building with a soaring spire, Dr. Kennedy described a nation undergoing a harrowing moral decline, with legalized abortion and pornography being signal examples of the social rot.
The remedy, he said, is conservative Christians trying to make their influence felt through political and social activity and, more important, by personally evangelizing others.
"You cannot force a Christian ethic on a non-Christian culture," Dr. Kennedy said. But he added that he believed more people were becoming born-again Christians and that within a decade or so this would manifest itself in some "very dramatic" societal changes.
Slogans on T-shirts being sold at the conference refer to this struggle for the nation's culture On the front is the slogan "Take It Back," and on the backs quotations from John Adams, Noah Webster, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Kennedy, which, taken together, put forth the view that good governance and faith in God are linked. A quote from Adams, for example, said, "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people."
And yet, Dr. Kennedy said in the interview, "there has been systematic elimination of this understanding, so that many Americans have no idea that this country was founded on any religious foundations."
Speakers here have contended that a theft of the nation's historical memory is under way, led by liberal judges with militantly secular ideas of constitutional law and anti-religion professors, who are rewriting textbooks to delete mention of faith's importance in the nation's past.
In a speech on Friday afternoon, Edwin Meese 3d, an Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan, quoted from the Mayflower Compact to offer evidence of the "religious antecedents of our country." Mr. Meese urged his audience to write letters to Congress and newspapers and to call radio talk shows.
Mr. Meese concluded by quoting the Protestant hymn "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and declaring, "The battle is not with some foreign army; the battle is with secular humanism."
Some here are already politically active.
Donna Whitmer, 64, of Toledo, Ohio, said she had organized local meetings on issues in public education and planned to start a chapter of the Eagle Forum, a conservative women's organization founded by Phyllis Schlafly, who led the fight against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970's.
And Donna K. Gentry, 55, of Washington, Ind., said she had begun campaigning as a Republican candidate for an open seat in the Indiana Legislature, having narrowly lost her a race two years ago. A mother of six grown children, she said she was concerned about "the moral issues," abortion and casino gambling.
The conference, Mrs. Gentry said, "just reinforces the ideas I already have, and it gives me the motivation that I can make a difference."

HEADLINE: Despite Deaths, Only Fine-Tuning on Rail Safety

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Railroads have been slow to adopt safer technologies and procedures for a variety of reasons, including money and bureaucratic inertia. But the main reason is that Government officials and railroad managers think the system is already safe enough.
The recent run of crashes, including fatal passenger-train collisions last month in Silver Spring, Md., and Jersey City, is not enough to change their minds because even a bad few weeks, they point out, do not make trains as unsafe as private cars. No yardstick on safety is common across the Federal Government, or even across the Transportation Department, which includes the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. Commercial aviation has a far better accident rate than the railroads, but the F.A.A. has been the more thorough agency in regulating safety. 
 In contrast, the regulation of trains has great gaps. An emergency order that goes into effect on Monday will add some rules, most of them based on safety procedures from well-run railroads. Sweeping changes would be much harder to make.
In the Silver Spring accident, a commuter train that did not have to meet any standards for crash-worthiness or flammability hit an Amtrak locomotive that did not approach the state of the art for fuel-tank integrity. Beyond the attentiveness of the engineers, there was no backup system to keep the trains at a safe speed. Eight people on the commuter train burned to death, and investigators say some might have lived if they had been able to get out of the wreckage. Three were killed by the impact itself.
"These crashes happen, thank God, infrequently enough so you don't have a lot of examples," said Frank Kruesi, the Assistant Secretary of Transportation for policy, explaining why some areas are unregulated. Mr. Kruesi said, for example, that while there was no flammability standard for materials used in trains, fires were infrequent.
In the Silver Spring accident, "would flammability have mattered, if you've got hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel?" he asked. "A lot of it was steel, and steel was melting."
Carmen J. Bianco, Amtrak's chief safety official, said that the railroad would look at every detail to see where improvements were needed but that modifying old engines might not be justifiable.
The owner of the commuter train in the Silver Spring crash, Maryland Rail Commuter Service, plans to make the emergency-exit windows more conspicuous, make every window an emergency window and make the doors easier to open in an emergency. But there is no sign that others will follow, and Maryland Rail Commuter does not plan to stop the practice of allowing trains to operate in "push mode," in which the engine is at the rear of the train. Push mode, which was how the commuter train was traveling in the Silver Spring crash, puts the passenger cars in the front, where they are more vulnerable in front-end collisions, which are the most common and the most serious. Push mode, Maryland officials and others say, is safe enough.
At a hearing last week of the Maryland Legislature's committee on relations with the Federal Government, for example, Ross B. Capon, the executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, was asked whether trains should still be allowed to operate in push mode.
Push mode, Mr. Capon said, is built into the operations of many railroads. Making railroads switch engines to the front of trains for return trips, he said, would cause delays, thereby raising costs and discouraging passengers.
Mr. Capon said that would mean "pushing people into their cars, where they're killing themselves at 23 times the rate that they do on trains."
The executive director of New Jersey Transit, Shirley A. DeLibero, made a similar point about the kind of automatic train-control systems that would probably have prevented the Jersey City crash, in which two of the agency's trains collided, or the Silver Spring accident. Such a system is already in place on other New Jersey Transit lines, Ms. DeLibero said, but installing one on the line where the accident occurred could never be a top priority. Since her agency took over the lines 20 years ago, it has had to attend to more basic needs, like modernizing tracks and trains, to survive.
That logic, extended over the 165,000 miles of rail routes in the United States, has left a system in which half is "dark territory" -- with no signals at all, only schedules and radioed or written commands -- and almost all of the other half has a system that is nothing more than colored lights.
Less than 10 percent of the trackage has systems to stop a train or alert an engineer if the train improperly passes a signal. The Federal Railroad Administration says that in busier parts of the system, sophisticated control equipment would pay for itself in accidents avoided, but it has yet to convince the railroads.
Economists or public policy makers can debate whether "safe enough" is the appropriate approach for rail safety, but it sticks out sharply from the way other modes of transit are regulated. While safety proposals for airplanes are often rejected because of cost, the Federal Aviation Administration has many kinds of standards that the Federal Railroad Administration lacks -- for flammability, crash-worthiness and backup systems, for example -- and it has a better safety record. A passenger is about four times as likely to be killed on a train than on a scheduled airline; the rails have about 1 death per 1.08 billion passenger-miles, while air travel has 1 per 4 billion passenger-miles.
The railroad administration, like the F.A.A., often faces stiff resistance from the companies it regulates. But some safety steps would be fairly low-tech and inexpensive. The National Transportation Safety Board says the rail death toll could be lowered if passengers knew how to get out of trains.
Amtrak conductors use the public-address system on long-distance routes to describe how to get out a window or door, but few commuter lines are inclined to follow. "If we tried to make little safety announcements at every stop," said Joe Szabo, a longtime conductor on Metra, a suburban train system in Chicago, "we'd have a revolution on our hands from the passengers. They'd be going after the conductors with frying pans, yelling, 'We've heard that already, leave us alone.' "
And the railroads do not want to drive people away because passengers generally have other options, like their cars. In testimony on Tuesday, Amtrak's chief executive, Thomas M. Downs, distributed a chart showing that in an average year, only 2 passengers are killed on Amtrak, while more than 24,000 people are killed in cars. A statistician would argue that the comparison is not valid because cars travel about 1.5 trillion miles per year and trains travel only a few million. But Mr. Downs's philosophy is echoed in the Department of Transportation and elsewhere: too much safety can be excessive.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: NEW ENGLAND;
Economy Poses Risks and Rewards

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 2

 BODY:
New England's economy has a way of making its mark on the nation's politics. In 1988, the region's high-tech boom and the confidence it spawned gave rise to the Presidential candidacy of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who promised to carry the "Massachusetts miracle" to the nation.
Four years later, a much-shaken region coping with a harrowing recession began -- by way of the New Hampshire primary -- the long electoral slide of President George Bush and helped shape the change-oriented candidacy of Bill Clinton. 
 Now, on the brink of Tuesday's Yankee Primary, when voters in five New England states will weigh in on the Republican Party's muddled race for the nomination, the picture in New England is far more mixed: better than the early 1990's, to be sure, but hardly the boom years of the 1980's, analysts say.
Senator Bob Dole's supporters, a virtual "Who's Who" of the Republican establishment here, are counting on New England to steady the Dole campaign and send it into the New York primary on Thursday with a string of victories. A not-inconsiderable prize of 107 Republican delegates will be at stake in Tuesday's primaries in Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
But there is enough economic uncertainty swirling through this region to create openings for Mr. Dole's main challengers; Steve Forbes clearly sees one in Connecticut; Patrick J. Buchanan in Maine. Anxiety about unemployment is high, even though the regional jobless rate in the last year averaged 5.5 percent, about the same as the national rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
A recent survey by a Cambridge pollster, John Gorman, found that 41 percent of the employed respondents in Massachusetts thought that there was "some chance" of losing their jobs this year.
On a frigid afternoon in downtown Lowell this week, Paul Burton had little doubt about the most important issue in this election. "Jobs, unemployment -- we need to get that straightened out," said Mr. Burton, a 54-year-old former janitor who now draws Social Security disability benefits, and who was wearing two Buchanan buttons as he stopped for coffee at a doughnut shop. "He cares for people," Mr. Burton said.
Still, there is a strong moderate tradition in New England's Republican Party -- embodied by Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts -- and most of its leading lights are supporting Mr. Dole..
"We keep hearing about the conservative bent of the Republican Party and that's wonderful," said John Holmes, chairman of the Rhode Island Republican Party and a Dole supporter. "But we're up here, we're alive and well, we're just as Republican as the ultraconservatives in the party and we have beliefs and principles just like they do."
Governor Weld, who originally supported Gov. Pete Wilson of California for the nomination and is now backing Mr. Dole, is a sort of poster boy for Republican centrists around the country. At a news conference this week, announcing the expansion of a program to help people save for college tuitions, Governor Weld offered a counterpoint to Mr. Buchanan's brand of tariff-oriented economic nationalism.
"A lot of people have good ideas what to do about economic anxiety," said the Governor, who has been bitingly critical of Mr. Buchanan in recent days. "I think education and training should be the number one response."
The six-state New England region, including New Hampshire, accounted for 13.2 million people in the last census. For all the postcard imagery, three-fourths of New Englanders live in urban areas. The regional unemployment rate in January was 5.2 percent, compared with 5.8 percent nationally.
But those figures belie a sharp change in the nature of jobs: Manufacturing employment has continued to fall in the region despite the economic recovery, Lynn Brown of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a recent article for the New England Council, a business group. Cuts by military manufacturers and change in the computer industry have "taken a severe toll," she said. This makes for an unusual recovery and a jittery people; as Mr. Gorman, the pollster, put it, "Normal here just isn't as good as it used to be."
At a rally in Waltham on Friday night, Mr. Dole tried to address those fears. "Certainly we're concerned about people who can't find jobs," he declared. Surrounded by people like Senator Chafee and Governor Weld, Mr. Dole offered a message that seemed tailor-made for the region, presenting himself a man ready "to get things done" for people, "regardless of party," eager to insure a stable economic future by balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
Massachusetts is the biggest prize in the region, with 37 delegates at stake. Polls for The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald both showed Mr. Dole with a comfortable lead at week's end; The Globe's, with a margin of error of five percentage points, showed Mr. Dole with 33 percent, Mr. Forbes with 15 percent, Mr. Buchanan with 14 percent and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee with 11 percent.
But there is "a huge wild card" in Massachusetts, said Joe Malone, state treasurer and state chairman for the Dole campaign: 47 percent of registered voters are independent, and can vote in the Republican primary, compared with 13 percent registered as Republican.
Connecticut is the second biggest prize, with 27 delegates. There, as throughout the region, Mr. Dole has formidable political support from Gov. John G. Rowland on down, but the Forbes camp clearly hopes to compete in this state.
"Taxes matter, which is to the Steve Forbes advantage," said State Senator Kevin Rennie, the only one of the 19 Republican State Senators who did not endorse Mr. Dole.
The Buchanan forces, meanwhile, are hoping to be felt throughout the region, drawing on such voters as social conservatives, opponents of abortion, former supporters of Ross Perot. Some analysts see Maine as a particular target of opportunity for Mr. Buchanan, since residents there gave 30 percent of the vote to Mr. Perot in 1992.
But many say Mr. Buchanan peaked in the region after New Hampshire, and this assessment was supported in a regional survey by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.
Mr. Alexander has made several forays into the region in recent days, standing in the shadow of Faneuil Hall in Boston the other day to urge another Tea Party against Mr. Buchanan's proposal for tariffs. Mr. Alexander has also been advertising across the region; the other candidates are largely relying on the memory of the regional advertising in the New Hampshire primary to carry them through.
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana has also been encamped in the region in recent days, spending most of his time in Vermont and Maine.
In the end, though, the level of activity in the region by the candidates has been something of a letdown to some of the Yankee Primary's architects. Garrison Nelson, a political scientist at the University of Vermont, offered what has become a universal lament in this frenetic stage of the campaign: "There's so much else out there, we've been crowded off the screen."

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Drive along the asphalt river of Interstate 95 across the Rhode Island border and into the pristine confines of Connecticut. Stop at that first tourist information center with its sheaves of brochures promising lazy delights. What could anyone possibly guess of Steven A. Holthausen, the portly man behind the counter who dispenses the answers?
Certainly not that for two decades he was a $1,000-a-week loan officer. Not that he survived three bank mergers only to be told, upon returning from a family vacation, that he no longer had a job. Not that his wife kicked him out and his children shunned him. Not that he slid to the bottom step of the economic ladder, pumping gas at a station owned by a former bank customer, being a guinea pig in a drug test and driving a car for a salesman who had lost his license for drunkenness. Not that, at 51, he makes do on $1,000 a month as a tourist guide, a quarter of his earlier salary. And not that he is worried that his modest job is itself fragile, and that he may have to work next as a clerk in a brother's liquor store. 
 That, however, is his condensed story, and its true grimness lies in the simple fact that it is no longer at all extraordinary in America. "I did not realize on that day I was fired how big a price I would have to pay," Mr. Holthausen said, in a near whisper.
More than 43 million jobs have been erased in the United States since 1979, according to a New York Times analysis of Labor Department numbers. Many of the losses come from the normal churning as stores fail and factories move. And far more jobs have been created than lost over that period. But increasingly the jobs that are disappearing are those of higher-paid, white-collar workers, many at large corporations, women as well as men, many at the peak of their careers. Like a clicking odometer on a speeding car, the number twirls higher nearly each day.
Peek into the living rooms of America and see how many are touched:
*Nearly three-quarters of all households have had a close encounter with layoffs since 1980, according to a new poll by The New York Times. In one-third of all households, a family member has lost a job, and nearly 40 percent more know a relative, friend or neighbor who was laid off.
*One in 10 adults -- or about 19 million people, a number matching the adult population of New York and New Jersey combined -- acknowledged that a lost job in their household had precipitated a major crisis in their lives, according to the Times poll.
*While permanent layoffs have been symptomatic of most recessions, now they are occurring in the same large numbers even during an economic recovery that has lasted five years and even at companies that are doing well.
*In a reversal from the early 80's, workers with at least some college education make up the majority of people whose jobs were eliminated, outnumbering those with no more than high school educations. And better-paid workers -- those earning at least $50,000 -- account for twice the share of the lost jobs than they did in the 1980's.
*Roughly 50 percent more people, about 3 million, are affected by layoffs each year than the 2 million victims of violent crimes. But while crime bromides get easily served up -- more police, stiffer jail sentences -- no one has come up with any broadly agreed upon antidotes to this problem. And until Patrick J. Buchanan made the issue part of the Presidential campaign, it seldom surfaced in political debate.
Yet this is not a saga about rampant unemployment, like the Great Depression, but one about an emerging redefinition of employment. There has been a net increase of 27 million jobs in America since 1979, enough to easily absorb all the laid-off workers plus the new people beginning careers, and the national unemployment rate is low.
The sting is in the nature of the replacement work. Whereas 25 years ago the vast majority of the people who were laid off found jobs that paid as well as their old ones, Labor Department numbers show that now only about 35 percent of laid-off full-time workers end up in equally remunerative or better-paid jobs. Compounding this frustration are stagnant wages and an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth. Adjusted for inflation, the median wage is nearly 3 percent below what it was in 1979. Average household income climbed 10 percent between 1979 and 1994, but 97 percent of the gain went to the richest 20 percent.
The result is the most acute job insecurity since the Depression. And this in turn has produced an unrelenting angst that is shattering people's notions of work and self and the very promise of tomorrow, even as the President proclaims in his State of the Union Message that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in three decades" and even as the stock market has rocketed to 81 new highs in the last year.
Driving much of the job loss are several familiar and intensifying stresses bearing down upon companies: stunning technological progress that lets machines replace hands and minds; efficient and wily competitors here and abroad; the ease of contracting out work, and the stern insistence of Wall Street on elevating profits even if it means casting off people. Cutting the payroll has appeal for gasping companies that resort to it as triage and to soundly profitable companies that try it as preventative medicine against a complicated future.
The conundrum is that what companies do to make themselves secure is precisely what makes their workers feel insecure. And because workers are heavily represented among the 38 million Americans who own mutual funds, they unwittingly contribute to the very pressure from Wall Street that could take away their salaries even as it improves their investment income.
The job apprehension has intruded everywhere, diluting self-worth, splintering families, fragmenting communities, altering the chemistry of workplaces, roiling political agendas and rubbing salt on the very soul of the country. Dispossessed workers like Steven Holthausen are finding themselves on anguished journeys they never imagined, as if being forced to live the American dream of higher possibilities in reverse.
Many Americans have reacted by downsizing their expectations of material comforts and the sweetness of the future. In a nation where it used to be a given that children would do better than their parents, half of those polled by The Times thought it unlikely that today's youth would attain a higher standard of living than they have. What is striking is that this gloom may be even more emphatic among prosperous and well-educated Americans. A Times survey of the 1970 graduating class at Bucknell University, a college known as an educator of successful engineers and middle managers, found that nearly two-thirds doubted that today's children would live better. White-collar, middle-class Americans in mass numbers are coming to understand first hand the chronic insecurity on which the working class and the poor are experts.
All of this is causing a pronounced withdrawal from community and civic life. Visit Dayton, Ohio, a city fabled for its civic cohesion, and see the detritus. When Vinnie Russo left his job at National Cash Register and went to another city, the 85 boys of Pack 530 lost their Cubmaster, and they still don't have a new one. Many people are too tired, frustrated or busy for activities they used to enjoy, like church choir.
The effects billow beyond community participation. People find themselves sifting for convenient scapegoats on which to turn their anger, and are adopting harsher views toward those more needy than themselves.
Those who have not lost their jobs and their identities, and do not expect to, are also being traumatized. The witnesses, the people who stay employed but sit next to empty desks and wilting ferns, are grappling with the guilt that psychologists label survivor's syndrome. At Chemical Bank, a department of 15 was downsized to just one woman. She sobbed for two days over her vanished colleagues. Why them? Why not me?
The intact workers are scrambling to adjust. They are calculating the best angles to job security, including working harder and shrewder, and discounting the notion that a paycheck is an entitlement. The majority of people polled by The Times said they would work more hours, take fewer vacation days or accept lesser benefits to keep their jobs.
Even the most apparent winners are being singed. A generation of corporate managers have terminated huge numbers of people, and these firing-squad veterans are fumbling for ways to shush their consciences. Richard A. Baumbusch was a manager at CBS in 1985 when a colleague came to him for advice: Should he buy a house? Mr. Baumbusch knew the man's job was doomed, yet felt bound by his corporate duty to remain silent. The man bought the house, then lost his job. Ten years have passed, but Mr. Baumbusch cannot forget.
 
A Question of Expectations
 One factor making this period so traumatic is that since World War II people have expected that their lives and those of their children would steadily improve. "It's important to recall that throughout American history, discontent has always had less to do with material well-being than with expectations and anxiety," David Herbert Donald, a social historian at Harvard, said. "You read that 40,000 people are laid off at AT&T and a shiver goes down your back that says, 'That could be me,' even if the fear is exaggerated. What we are reacting against is the end of a predictable kind of life, just as the people who left the predictable rhythms of the farm in the 1880's felt such a loss of control once they were in the cities."
As the clangor from politicians over the jobs issue has begun to be heard, aspirants to public office may find an audience in that group of households in which a lost job produced a major crisis.
The Times poll revealed something of their signature. Only 28 percent, versus 44 percent of the entire population, say they are as well off as they imagined at this juncture of their lives. The vast majority feel the country is going in the wrong direction, and they are more pessimistic about the economy. They are more likely than the overall population to be divorced or separated. They are better educated. Politically, they are more apt to label themselves liberal. They are more likely to favor national health insurance, and to say that curbing government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and welfare is a misguided idea. And more than 63 percent, compared with 47 percent in the whole population, want the Government to do something about job losses.
Wherever one turns one encounters the scents and sounds of this sobering new climate. Ask Ann Landers. Last year, when she adopted a stone-hearted view in her column to a laid-off worker, lecturing him that he had a "negative attitude," she was swamped by 6,000 venomous letters, one of the largest outpourings to any of her columns. "They were really giving me the dickens," Ms. Landers said. "This is the real world, girl. Now I am trying to be supportive."
People run into acquaintances and don't ask how their job is, but whether they still have it. Surf the Internet or flick on the comedy channels and take in the macabre jokes: Sales clerk: "What size are you?" Customer: "I'm not sure. I used to be a 42 Regular. But that was before I was downsized." Wife: "But why'd they fire you?" Husband: "They said something about the company making too much money. If the business tanks, they said they'd call me back."
Such graveyard humor is pervasive in Scott Adams's popular comic strip, Dilbert, about a 1990's computer engineer who quakes under a gruff and hectoring boss. In one strip, Dilbert competes with Zimbu, a monkey, for a job, and loses. In another, the boss informs Dilbert that he is about to become involved in all aspects of the company's production. "Dear Lord," Dilbert realizes. "You've fired all the secretaries." Raw material arrives daily in the form of E-mail from demoralized workers.
In an effort to somehow cauterize the emotional damage of the dismissals, managers have introduced a euphemistic layoff-speak. Employees are "downsized," "separated," "severed," "unassigned." They are told that their jobs "are not going forward." The word downsize didn't even enter the language until the early 1970's, when it was coined by the auto industry to refer to the shrinking of cars. Starting in 1982, it was applied to humans and entered in the college edition of the American Heritage Dictionary.
Meanwhile, the word layoff has taken a fresh meaning. In the past, it meant a sour but temporary interruption in one's job. Work was slow, so a factory shift would be laid off. But stay by the phone -- the job will resume three weeks or three months from now when business picks up. Today, layoff means a permanent, irrevocable goodbye.
 
A Portrait of the Victims
Imagine the downsized posed shoulder to shoulder for an annual portrait, some sort of dysfunctional graduation picture. Mostly young, male, blue-collar workers dominated the glossies of the 1980's. Now, white-collar people stare out from every row. Many more of them are women and those whose hair flashes with gray. Instead of factory clothes, far more wear adornment appropriate for carpeted offices.
At his office in the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, Thomas Nardone, an associate commissioner, keeps a chart that tracks the correlation between income and layoffs. In the 1980's, the chart shows, the higher the income, the less frequent the layoffs. Now the two lines rise in tandem.
The job insecurity reaches beyond corporations. Government is also scaling back, although not as drastically as corporations, erasing many of the jobs that historically elevated the poor. Between 1979 and 1993, 454,000 public service jobs vanished.
Academia is contributing to the dislocation by paring its rolls and increasingly leaving college teachers in jeopardy by denying them tenure. Doctors, once leading the way along the smug path to American bounty, are succumbing to the cost-containment convulsions in health care.
What so many middle-class workers are experiencing for the first time is achingly familiar to poorer people. Job security never seemed to apply to them. Indeed, those at the lower end of the economic ladder are slipping even further. Rene Brown is a thrice-downsized woman who is still in her 40's. Since the start of the 1980's she has been downsized out of an $8.50-an-hour job at a meatpacking plant, a $7.25-an-hour job in a bank mailroom and a $4.75-an-hour job loading newspapers. Presently she earns $4.25 cleaning office buildings in Baltimore.
Ms. Brown has done this menial work for three years, without a raise. She is annoyed that, despite a high school diploma and a year of community college, she cannot find a way back up the income ladder.
The poor are losing out in another way. The newly pinched middle class has grown increasingly intolerant of having its tax dollars applied to social programs benefiting the disadvantaged.
 
What Changed
People, of course, always lost their jobs. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it didn't take much; job security was not yet an American concept.
World War II, however, ushered in an unprecedented era of economic growth. Demand for workers soared. The post-war years led many people to the succoring belief that they had an almost divine right to a very particular American dream entailing a home, a secure job and a raise every year. An unwritten social contract, codified in part by strong labor unions, came into being, under which managers and workers pledged their loyalty to one another.
The booming economic growth that made this possible slackened in the 1970's, and the economy has remained stuck at a lower volume. The steady and pronounced progress of technology has kept taking tasks from human beings and giving them to machines, undermining the bedrock notion of mass employment. Whereas the General Motors Corporation employed 500,000 people at its peak in the 1970's, today it can make just as many cars with 315,000 workers. Computer programs rather than lawyers prepare divorce papers. If 1,000 movie extras are needed, the studio hires 100 and a computer spits out clones for the rest. Behind every A.T.M. flutter the ghosts of three human tellers.
By the late 1970's, the convergence of these trends prompted companies to sanction large-scale layoffs. At first, the job losses occurred largely in beleaguered smokestack industries. Now the most modern and prosperous industries like telecommunications and electronics are shedding jobs regularly -- companies like Sun Microsystems, Pacific Telesis and I.B.M. Media companies, including The New York Times, are also doing so.
Labor Department statistics show that more than 36 million jobs were eliminated between 1979 and 1993, and an analysis by The New York Times puts the number at 43 million through 1995. Many of the jobs would disappear in any age, when a store closes or an old product like the typewriter yields to a new one like the computer. What distinguishes this age are three phenomena: white-collar workers are big victims; large corporations now account for many of the layoffs, and a large percentage of the jobs are lost to "outsourcing" -- contracting out work to another company, usually within the United States.
Far more jobs are being added than lost. But many of the new jobs are in small companies that offer scant benefits and less pay, and many are part-time positions with no benefits at all. Often, the laid off get only temporary work, tackling tasks once performed by full-timers. The country's largest employer, renting out 767,000 substitute workers each year, is Manpower Inc., the temporary-help agency.
In this game of musical jobs, people making $150,000 resurrect themselves making $50,000, sometimes as self-employed consultants or contractors. Those making $50,000 reappear earning $25,000. And these jobs are discovered often after much time, misery and personal humiliation.
 
The Rationale for Cutting
Most chief executives and some economists view this interlude as an unavoidable and even healthy period during which efficiency is created out of inefficiency. They herald the downsizings, messy as they are, as necessary to compete in a global economy. The argument is that some workers must be sacrificed to salvage the organization.
Sears, Roebuck and Company felt its very existence threatened in a world of too many stores and too many ways for people to buy what Sears sold for less. Cost cutting, in the form of 50,000 eliminated jobs in the 1990's, was part of the response. "I felt lousy about it," Arthur C. Martinez, Sears's chairman, said. "But I was trying to balance that with the other 300,000 employees left, and balance it with the thousands of workers in our supplier community, and with 125,000 retirees who look to Sears for their pensions, and with the needs of our shareholders."
At the Newport News, Va., shipyard of Tenneco Inc., a diversified manufacturer, 11,000 of 29,000 workers have been shed since 1990, largely because of technological efficiencies like automated welding. It's also true that the Pentagon is buying fewer ships. Dana G. Mead, Tenneco's chairman, boasts that Newport News is now as efficient as any shipyard in the world. Four workers operating robots can cut all the ribs of a tanker, a task that had required 21 and took longer.
"We put in automation to get more competitive," Mr. Mead said, adding that the change won important tanker and submarine contracts. "Then how many workers you build back depends on the rate the commercial business grows, and what the Navy decides to build."
Robert E. Allen, the AT&T chairman who has recently been turned into something of a symbol of corporate avarice for authorizing the elimination of 40,000 jobs, said that intensifying competition left him without choices. He said that with the Baby Bells free to invade AT&T's long-distance stronghold, AT&T's bloated staff of middle managers is no longer affordable. "The easy thing would be to rest on our laurels and say we are doing pretty well, let's just ride it out," he said. "The initiative we took is to get ahead of the game a little bit."
Also intrinsic to the new message is that the lion's share of raises and bonuses must be channeled to those judged most talented and diligent. This new standard of "pay for performance" has made a growing divide among incomes a hallmark of the layoff era. In essence, a new notion of growth and job creation has emerged in which, rather than an expanding economy benefiting all, only the stellar performers -- or those providentially in the right careers -- come out ahead.
At the same time, some layoffs seem rooted in economic fashion. An unforgiving Wall Street has given its signals of approval -- rising stock prices -- to companies that take the meat-ax to their costs. The day Sears announced it was discarding 50,000 jobs, its stock climbed nearly 4 percent. The day Xerox said it would prune 10,000 jobs, its stock surged 7 percent. And thus business has been thrust into a cycle where it is keener about pleasing investors than workers.
How this all plays out is a matter of debate. Some contend that through these adjustments American companies will recapture their past dominance in world markets, and once again be in a position to deliver higher income to most workers. Others predict that creating such fungible workforces will leave businesses with dispirited and disloyal employees who will be less productive. And many economists and chief executives think the job shuffling may be a permanent fixture, always with us, as if the nation had caught a chronic, rasping cough.
 
The Hardest Hit
The tally of jobs eliminated in the 1990's -- 123,000 at AT&T, 18,800 at Delta Airlines, 16,800 at Eastman Kodak -- has the eerie feel of battlefield casualty counts. And like waves of strung-out veterans, the psychically frazzled downsized workers are infecting their families, friends and communities with their grief, fear and anger. The metabolic changes taking place in the country are only beginning to be understood, but there is no missing the deep imprint on the life of Steven Holthausen, the loan officer turned tourist guide.
His high-velocity slide has caused him to go into his soul with calipers. He is suffused with anger, much of it toward himself. Why, he berates himself over and over, did he give so many evenings and weekends to his employer? Why didn't he see that his job was doomed? And then when the dismal news came that August day in 1990, he took it as he felt an executive should, coolly accepting the unfeeling reality of modern economics. Accepting it, that is, until he learned that some of his duties had been assumed by a 22-year-old at a fraction of his pay.
Once laid off, he not only withdrew from work, he withdrew from sight. He had been co-chairman of the trustees of a church in Westbrook, Conn., as well as vice chairman of the police advisory board. He quit both posts. No longer a banker, he felt he had lost the requisite dignity to participate in civic activities. "You feel the community has lost its respect for you," he said.
For almost a year, Mr. Holthausen scraped by on severance pay, on meager commissions earned as a freelance mortgage broker and on unemployment insurance. The fact that this income was taxed made him resent the government. If the Federal budget were balanced by scaling back spending, he reasoned, less of his skimpy income would be taken from him.
Accordingly, Mr. Holthausen voted for Ross Perot in 1992, warming to his pledge to cure the deficit. He now considers himself a budget-balancing Republican, although he has yet to settle on a candidate.
He lives alone with his torments in a humble apartment owned by a brother. He sat stock-still as he ruminated on the tatters of his family. Even while he was a banker, tensions underlay the marriage. When he was fired, the couple sought therapy. At the sessions, he beseeched his wife to help him regain his shattered confidence. He found her unsympathetic. Six months later, she ordered him out. Soon after, she filed for divorce and, after years of not working, found a job as a medical secretary. His two teen-age children avoided him. Their view, he felt, was that he must have shortcomings or he would not be jobless.
"The anger that I feel right now is that I lost both my family and my job," he said. "That is not where I wanted to be at this point in my life."
In a society in which identity is so directly quantified by work, the psychological fall involved in losing a job is leading many to stress-induced illnesses. "What makes it so hard for people is very often these situations come about very suddenly," said Dr. Gerd Fenchel, the head of the Washington Square Institute for Psychotherapy and Mental Health in New York, who has seen his caseload swell with downsized workers. "We have a diagnosis called post-traumatic stress syndrome that applies to this."
The impact of job loss on marriages varies. The divorce rate, according to several studies, is as much as 50 percent higher than the national average in families where one earner, usually the man, has lost a job and cannot quickly find an equivalent one. On the other hand, many families where both husband and wife are employed seem to be drawing closer to muster their energies against the common enemy of job insecurity.
The effect on community unity seems more straightforward. In city after city, downsized people are withdrawing from the civic activities that held communities together. Sociologists report that involvement has tumbled at P.T.A.'s, Rotary clubs, Kiwanis clubs, town meetings and church suppers. Bowling leagues are unraveling, even though more people are bowling than ever. The reason is they are visiting alleys not as part of corporate or community leagues, but singly or with a friend. "The 'we' has become a 'me,' or at least a narrower 'we,' " Robert D. Putnam, a Harvard professor who has documented this contracting participation, said. He fingers downsizing as a culprit, although not as insidious as television.
The country's feeling of American mastery, of a nation that stands astride the world, is unquestionably being bruised. The job insecurity is unleashing a "floating anger that is attaching itself to all sorts of targets as a form of scapegoating," Daniel Yankelovich, president of DYG Inc., a polling firm, said. Polls have shown this anger directed at targets as diverse as immigrants, blacks, women, government, corporations, welfare recipients, computers, the very rich and capitalism itself. Some experts say that part of the growth in membership of so-called hate groups is traceable to disaffected downsized workers.
The floating anger is also influencing people's attitude toward politics. Pollsters say it is making centrist politics harder to practice and making people less faithful to any one party, less likely to vote and more willing to entertain the idea of a third party.
 
Adapting to New Times
The downsizing has set off unmistakable currents of adjustment. Increasing numbers of families are scaling back their lifestyles. Two-thirds of those in the Times poll said that in recent years queasiness about their economic future had compelled them to curtail their day-to-day spending. One-fifth said the cuts had been "severe."
Many of the dispossessed are stepping up their involvement in new networks rooted in job pursuit. There are assemblages like "Xerox-ex" for laid-off Xerox workers. There are groups like the 40 Plus Club in New York for people over 40 who have lost jobs. And there are arrangements like the job-seekers club at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Princeton, N.J.
Some are fulfilling dreams by initiating their own businesses and otherwise tapping into some new inner serenity.
After twice losing jobs at computer companies in six years, Marilyn Collins, a 52-year-old computer systems expert, got fed up feeling she was "dispensable" and joined her husband in the small New York direct-mail consultancy he had founded. Since her arrival, the once marginal business has flourished.
Eighteen months ago, Kenneth Russell, 41, quit his aerospace engineer's job at Northrop just ahead of a sure layoff. He and his wife, a nurse, sold their home in Palmdale, Calif., and moved to Arlington, S.D. They make pottery. The corporate life meant income of $110,000. The pottery life netted $15,000 last year (this year is going much better). "It is fantastic," he said. "We have much better friends, because there is no inordinate competition between people as there was in the corporate stuff. There are no false pretenses, you don't have to try to impress anyone. It is very real."
 
Living in Denial
There remain, however, other downsized workers who resist reining in their lives, as if denying what has happened. Just as many people who grew up in the Depression took a long time to shake their fear that hard times would return, today many who grew up in the 50's and 60's are refusing to accept that a period they see as enduringly golden is over.
Increasingly, these people are financing their living costs and adornments through every dollar available to them, including penalized withdrawals from their retirement accounts.
More than six months after losing his six-figure job at Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., Robert Miller is yielding only reluctantly to the likelihood that, at 52, he will never again command his past income.
He continues to live with his wife and two children in a $700,000, six-bedroom home in a rarefied gated community on Sawgrass Island in Ponte Vedra. His severance is dwindling, and soon he will be drawing on savings. "I worked hard for that house," Mr. Miller said. "I hate to use the word deserve, but it is human nature to feel that way."
No job leads have materialized. His wife, Debbie, who had not worked, has joined with six other women to begin a computer data base that will sell church-related information. Only recently have the Millers even contemplated moving. They have their eye on another gated community, where they might scale back to four bedrooms.
 
The Stunned Survivors
The new mood manifests itself in myriad ways, perhaps most surprisingly in the impact on those left behind in the office.
The woman is soft-voiced, introspective, married with children. She has rowed the corporate boat straight and narrow for years now. This has lifted her well up the ranks of middle management at a large pharmaceutical company. She earns more than $80,000. A still bigger company acquired hers. Clinging hard to her job, she would not speak for attribution. Instead, she shared her diary.
Entry: "A huge cloud of uncertainty hangs over each employee. Officially, we still haven't been told a thing about the acquisition and must learn about it from the newspapers. The sleepless nights begin."
Entry: "Every day I have lunch with my friend G, a great guy with a good sense of humor and rock solid values hard to find in industry. He will probably have to relocate out of state. This is ironic because the company just moved him here 20 months ago from halfway across the country. We will probably not see each other again."
Entry: "The company has been sold. It would be sick to suggest that this merger -- which will result in the loss of thousands of jobs -- is in the best interests of employees."
Entry: "My boss left last month. There's no one left to report to."
Entry: "I ran into B today. He wasn't offered a job and is devastated. He is scared he may not be able to pay his kids' college tuition and may have to ask them to transfer to local schools. Any sense of joy I had at being on 'Schindler's list' of employees who've got jobs with our new parent corporation has been wiped out by experiences like this."
Many adaptable workers are accepting without sentiment the fact that their company does not owe them as much as people used to expect. Increasingly, like pool players lining up shots, these workers are figuring out the best angles to job security.
Diane Sirois is a curly-haired, irrepressible 39-year-old who assembles the most popular retractable tape measure at The Stanley Works, a hand-tool maker in New Britain, Conn. She keeps a studious eye on where the safest jobs are. After the company automated the assembly of the tape measure, she learned to operate one of the intricate new machines. Her reasoning went like this: If there are layoffs, the machinery she runs would be the last to be shut down; under union rules, during a layoff, she could not be bumped by someone unless that worker could learn to operate the machinery in a week's time. It took her three months to master it. "Job security is why I bid for this job," she said flatly. "There are people here who have gotten used to sitting on their tails and repeating the same small task hour after hour, and they don't want to change, even to save their jobs."
Other workers simply agree to more work. In the Times poll, 82 percent said they would work longer hours if it would help preserve their job. Some part-timers, among them women who had cut their hours to spend more time raising children, feel pressure to go full time so they won't be viewed as marginal and expendable.
Many workers are returning to school. High school graduates in their mid-20s, for example, are flocking to community colleges in unprecedented numbers.
Behavior in the office is taking on bizarre twists. Leslie Perlow, a University of Michigan business school professor who studied a team of 12 software engineers at a Xerox office near Rochester, N.Y., found that the engineers, gripped by job insecurity, felt driven to show off their prowess before their peers and bosses. They spent the bulk of their workday in meetings and crisis sessions, some that were little more than stages where they could advertise their abilities. Not until after 5 P.M. did they get around to what they were paid for: inventing software. "They felt they were rewarded for individual heroics, and their crisis meetings gave them an outlet for heroics," Ms. Perlow said. "The layoff atmosphere exacerbated this need to 'show' performance."
A lot of workers no longer think of their jobs as entitlements. Robby Smith is a 34-year-old engineer at Maitland & Hoge Enterprises, a Houston oil and gas consulting firm that did some downsizing. While he sees no likelihood that his job is at risk, he hastens to point out, "I don't take employment for granted. It is not a right, so to speak, granted by education and experience. That is an attitude I have developed over the past few years."
Like the downsized themselves, Mr. Smith keeps his eye trained on his personal balance sheet. He is part of a two-earner family; his wife is an assistant school principal. They have a 2-year-old daughter. They have stopped using all but one credit card. When they buy a car, they finance it through his wife's father instead of the bank. All debt is considered suspect.
As new ideas rub up against old certainties, a good number of workers are simply redefining their raison d'etre.
To find Mark Featherstone in the small hours of a Monday morning, it is necessary to journey to the nearly deserted cafeteria of the Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Ill. Mr. Featherstone is a 37-year-old software engineer at Motorola. He has no explicit reason for thinking his job is in jeopardy -- Motorola has in fact been adding jobs -- but rather than this buoying him, he still feels cornered.
Thus he was here at a "Dads Group," rooting for the emotional sustenance he used to get at work. He said he was seeking "a peace within myself instead of the rush of the job." The church has watched its membership grow rapidly, in large measure because of job insecurity.
 
The View of the Firing Squads
It was time, no question. On a cool, pale afternoon, Charles Allen stepped across Fifth Avenue and entered St. Patrick's Cathedral to attend noon Mass. He knows the rite by heart. He goes every day.
Daily Mass is an old habit with new meaning for him. Things are on his mind. One signpost of this era is the multitude of executives who decided who would go. As a $90,000-a-year banking executive, Mr. Allen had to fire his share. Many, to his mind, were not competent and got their just outcomes. One, however, will not vacate his mind.
As an officer in charge of operations of the Standard Chartered Bank, Mr. Allen had to dispose of one of the three currency traders in the Toronto branch. The consensus choice happened to be a woman who was indisputably the top performer, but had the weakest political bonds. "I knew that she was the best in the department," he said. "But she had not networked. And I had to inform her that she was terminated. And she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, 'But Charlie, you know better.' I will never forget what she said and how she looked that day."
Each afternoon at Mass, he looks to put the past and the present in perspective. "It is a mark on my character," he said. "I feel a lesser person."
There is a sullen irony to Mr. Allen's story. He lost his own job last May and now wanders with the dispossessed.
As senior managers find themselves making almost pro forma decisions to detonate the careers of thousands of workers, a new management issue has engulfed them: how to prettify a message to their employees and to themselves that is inherently harsh.
Some executives are essentially resorting to camouflage to cope. Top managers at the Stanley Works have shucked their suits and ties and adopted sweaters and slacks, one reason being that they don't want to advertise their roles in these days of downsizing. Layoffs have reached 2,000 people.
Rationalization of a larger good plays a crucial part in enabling senior executives to accept what they do. R. Alan Hunter, the husky president of Stanley, sat in the company cafeteria recently, in a dark sweater and turtleneck. "Is it better to have 100 people in a world-class plant or 120 in a plant that is not world class and might not survive?" he said. "You have to consider what is best for the shareholders and the organization."
He nodded at the commonly heard lament that businesses are firing their own customers. But he said this did not enter into his thinking because he didn't know where to insert it in the equation. "We know that if Americans have less money to spend, that is not going to help us," he said. "But that is so broad and huge an issue, it is difficult to bring into the decisions."
Studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that employer commitment to diversity has eroded in this wobbly environment. Many women, minorities and older workers express anxiety that they are more vulnerable. The most pronounced effect appears to be on minorities. Employment and earnings of blacks relative to whites have unquestionably declined since the 1970's, according to Labor Department data.
Mr. Hunter of the Stanley Works has it hardest when he returns home. He said he never tells his two children about laying off workers. His wife asks, however, and that is when phrases catch in his throat. "She'll say, 'Why are you doing it?' " he said. "I can answer that more easily to a Stanley employee than to my wife."
He tells her of the need to be competitive, and she nods. Yes, when she goes shopping, she says, she certainly likes bargains.
 
The Children
There is one final cast of characters in this unspooling drama, and they are the characters of tomorrow.
When workers come home with frayed nerves and punctured expectations, what are the children to make of it? The layoffs and the rejiggered lives have caused parents to search themselves for some new song of hope to sing to their children. What is the path to security anymore? What are the safe jobs? What, in short, is an American dream worth dreaming?
In the unlovely apartment of John Castner in North Arlington, N.J., all conversations seem to lead to work and its meaning. For much of his accounting career, Mr. Castner traced the predictable path of better work and pay. Starting in 1989, he was swept into the downsizing grinder. Last April, he lost his third job in six years. Now, at 47, he makes do with intermittent work.
A widower, he lives with his two children, Julie, 14, and Stephen, 11. "I say to my kids, not only will you have to look for jobs anywhere in the United States, but in Singapore and Hong Kong," he said. "You are competing against kids from other countries." He tells them it is no longer enough to be very good, it is imperative to be a star. He feels it vital that they attend a "brand-name college," certainly not the Trenton State stenciled on his own diploma.
His children said they have not been embarrassed by their father's lost jobs any more than they are by neglected ink stains on their hands. After all, many of their friends have downsized parents.
Julie, in particular, seems to have been forced into a response common to a lot of middle-class children -- growing up earlier in a way reminiscent of what happens to poor children on shoestring budgets and deprived of intact families. She did not try out for the basketball team so she can hold an after-school job as a day-care counselor. "I don't mind work," she said. "It's fun."
Despite her adolescence, she demonstrates an adult's knowingness and fortitude. "I wish my father had a job, but since he doesn't you kind of get a little smarter and think about what you have to do more," she said. "How you have to go about, like, choosing a profession. And school is more important, a lot more important. In my school, it is kind of like the in thing to be really smart."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: CHANGING DIRECTION;
DOLE EASILY BEATS BUCHANAN TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., March 2

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole won a commanding victory today in the South Carolina primary, a crucial Southern test that led him to reclaim the title of front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination.
Patrick J. Buchanan, who had expected his overtures to social conservatives to play well in this primary, the first in the South, placed a distant second, followed by Steve Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. 
 Flying to South Carolina from Islip, L.I., late tonight to savor his biggest and most decisive victory, Mr. Dole told a sparsely attended rally at the fairgrounds here: "It's a lot more fun winning. This is the big one." But sounding a note of caution about the frenzy of the next round of contests, he quickly added, "But we still have a tough road ahead."
In a reference to how George Bush crushed him in the 1988 primary here, Mr. Dole said, "I've waited eight years to say, Thank you South Carolina."
This year, with 96 percent of the precincts counted, Mr. Dole had 45 percent, Mr. Buchanan 30 percent, Mr. Forbes 13 percent and Mr. Alexander 11 percent.
The primary here was widely viewed as a do-or-die test for Mr. Dole, the majority leader, who had to demonstrate that he could win a large state beyond his native Midwest. He had won only in Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, all heavily agricultural states.
After unexpected setbacks, particularly his defeats in New Hampshire and Arizona, Mr. Dole looked to this state, where 37 delegates were at stake, to re-ignite his campaign as it must turn to eight contests on Tuesday: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont. Two days later is the primary in New York.
The outcome here was also an important psychological boost. For today, at least, the voting restored Mr. Dole's position as the candidate to beat. South Carolina proved to be as pivotal for him as it was for George Bush, who drew 49 percent of the vote here in 1988. Mr. Dole placed second with 21 percent in that race. Mindful of that drubbing, the 72-year-old majority leader built an impressive organization here this time.
A survey of voters leaving the polling places showed that Mr. Buchanan did not draw the overwhelming support of religious conservatives that helped him in other states. He won 44 percent of people who described themselves as part of the Christian right, but 38 percent of those voters chose Mr. Dole, according to the survey by The Associated Press and the television networks.
Mr. Buchanan also found the limits of his protectionist trade stand. Half the voters said American trade policies had created more jobs for South Carolina; Mr. Dole won the support of half of those voters, while Mr. Buchanan drew only one-fifth.
Half of the voters said Mr. Buchanan was too extreme, and Mr. Dole won two-thirds of them, with Mr. Forbes and Mr. Alexander splitting most of the rest. But Mr. Buchanan won the support of less than half of those who said he was not too extreme.
"Tonight was a turning point for the campaign," Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, said in an interview. "We demonstrated that Dole is the only candidate who can unite the social and economic conservatives in a winning coalition that can beat Bill Clinton." He added that the victory "gives us a tremendous head of steam heading into next week's crucial primaries."
Mr. Forbes, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Alexander all brushed off the results and, sounding like they were reading from the same concession script, vowed to take the fight all the way to the convention in San Diego.
Mr. Buchanan, who had been the hottest candidate after his stunning victory in New Hampshire, had hoped for another upset here to regain his momentum after his third-place finish in Arizona last Tuesday. But even before the polling places closed today, he was playing down the results as he campaigned in Baltimore; Lexington, Mass., and Portland, Me. He said he could have won if Governor David Beasley, a Republican who is popular among religious conservatives, had supported him.
"If Beasley had come out for me, we'd have beat him," Mr. Buchanan said in an interview. About Mr. Dole's prospects, he said: "He will crack, and people will see he is hollow. There's nothing there. He doesn't have issues. He doesn't debate."
The voting here was probably most disappointing for Mr. Alexander, who for months had cast South Carolina as crucial for him, particularly because he is a native of the region. He has yet to do better than third in any contest. But today, Mr. Alexander was already campaigning in what he hoped would be more receptive Southern states, Georgia and Florida, and he seemed to rejoice in Mr. Buchanan's showing without even mentioning his own.
"What this signals is that the Republican Party by a large majority rejects Pat Buchanan," Mr. Alexander said at a news conference at the airport in Augusta, Ga. "The votes in Georgia and Florida are going to reshape the Presidential elections -- and that's going to be a race between Bob Dole and me."
He added: "Ninety percent of the delegates will be chosen after the South Carolina primary."
Though Mr. Forbes did not campaign much here, the results halted his winning streak: he had recovered from his fourth-place showings in Iowa and New Hampshire with back-to-back victories in Delaware and Arizona.
Mr. Forbes insisted that he never expected to do well here, and he spent today in New England, where he said voters would be more receptive to his plan for a flat tax. He was also looking to a showdown in New York with Mr. Dole because they are the only candidates on the ballot in all of the state's Congressional districts, although Mr. Buchanan was still hoping to win the same right through a court decision.
At a news conference in downtown Stamford, Conn., Mr. Forbes suggested that the field might become so Balkanized that it results in a brokered convention.
"It's going to take many more primaries, especially in the large states, right through California, before this may be decided," he said.
Mr. Dole had long been considered the favorite here, in part because the entire party establishment rallied behind him, including Governor Beasley, Senator Strom Thurmond and former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. Mr. Beasley's support clearly helped him Mr. Dole today with religious conservative voters. And unlike in past contests, where Mr. Dole attributed his losses to Mr. Forbes and his bombardment of negative television commercials, the Senator could make no such excuses here.
There was also a contest on Saturday in Wyoming, in which Mr. Dole picked up five delegates at county conventions.
The stumping in South Carolina took on an even more conservative tone than in earlier states, with candidates here especially aggressive in their overtures to religious conservatives, a critical bloc of the electorate here. The campaign also highlighted divergent trade policies, with Mr. Dole defending a free market as attracting foreign jobs to this state and Mr. Buchanan taking up the cause of laid-off textile workers.
The campaign was spiced with symbolic appeals to the old and new Souths -- from Mr. Buchanan standing at the gates of The Citadel in Charleston, criticizing efforts to allow women into the all-male academy, to Mr. Dole's championing the possibilities of global trade at a BMW automobile plant near Spartanburg.
All registered voters in South Carolina were permitted to participate in the voting today, regardless of party affiliation.
Among the other candidates, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana did not campaign here, instead concentrating his attention on the small state of Vermont. Representative Robert K. Dornan of California did not campaign here either. But Alan Keyes, a talk show host, made appearances in the state.

HEADLINE: America's Growth Didn't Rely on Protectionism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Who Says Republicans Are Free Traders?" (Op-Ed, Feb. 27): Alfred E. Eckes questions the efficacy of "conventional economic nostrums" such as free trade by pointing out that the protected United States economy after 1870 grew faster than its free-trade British counterpart. 
 But Mr. Eckes does not mention that this country's industry was more modern than Britain's, that unions in the United States never became as powerful or that United States natural resources were greater. Moreover, since 1945, the United States has been less protective than Britain but has grown more rapidly.
Mr. Eckes is correct that "Mr. Buchanan's views are consistent with those of a long line of Republican leaders." He fails to mention that President Clinton's free-trade views are consistent with those of a long line of Democratic leaders.
While pre-World War II Republicans advocated high tariffs to protect United States business, pre-World War II Democrats supported free trade to protect the consumer.
President Clinton deserves credit for reopening the debate within the Democratic Party and challenging misguided notions such as the dangerous economic nationalism that Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Eckes support.

HEADLINE: America's Growth Didn't Rely on Protectionism;
When Labor Is Cheap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Who Says Republicans Are Free Traders?" (Op-Ed, Feb. 27) is an invitation to a debate that is overdue. Why is a global economy desirable? Is it because, say, Ping-Pong balls from China are cheaper than those made in the United States? 
 Yes, those Ping-Pong balls from China are cheaper. But you must have income to appreciate the price difference. The free trade experts tend to forget this.
The Ping-Pong balls are cheaper only because Chinese labor is cheaper. They are not more efficient at making them. The price of labor is a variable, and if demand for those cheap balls grows, the price of labor will increase. Until one day we discover that we could make those balls as cheaply. By that time it may be too late to have those jobs come ping-ponging back from China without provoking a trade war. Who would want that?

HEADLINE: America's Growth Didn't Rely on Protectionism;
No Trivial Impact

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Some free traders state that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 "caused" the Great Depression. Most economists maintain that a contractionary monetary policy pushed the United States into the Depression, although the outbreak of higher tariffs around the world did not help. 
 Those sympathetic to higher tariffs exaggerate even more by minimizing the impact of Smoot-Hawley. For example, Alfred E. Eckes (Op-Ed, Feb. 27) writes that the higher protective rates of Smoot-Hawley "had little impact on American trade," an assertion that is wrong.
According to United States Tariff Commission estimates, Smoot-Hawley raised United States tariff rates by more than 20 percent on average. Because many of these tariffs were specific duties (a dollar amount per item), not ad valorem duties (a percentage of the price), price deflation pushed the effective tariff up at least an additional 30 percent.
In the two years after imposition of Smoot-Hawley, the volume of United States exports plummeted 40 percent. A quarter of this drop can be attributed to the higher tariff, the rest to falling income. Smoot-Hawley was not trivial in its impact on trade.

HEADLINE: Europe Doesn't Want Our TV Violence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Canada Likes Chip to Block TV Violence" (news article, Feb. 28): The exportation of violent television, film and videos may be in the long-term worst interest of United States media industries. This insight came to me at a program on "Children and Screen Violence," co-sponsored by the Swedish Ministry of Culture and Unesco in Lund, Sweden, last September. 
 The Europeans, who have historically been less concerned about violence in the media, are concerned about the effect this violence is having on their children. They worry that United States media violence will have the same effects there that they see in the United States -- influencing young people to become more violent and desensitizing viewers.
There was talk at the conference about how European countries might regulate if not ban the importation of violent media products.
Media are the second major United States export industry, and their global reach is growing. The increasing number of parents and governments around the world concerned about the effects of such violent media on their children could be an economic force that will have a backlash for United States media industries.

HEADLINE: HARLEM;
A Legend Reviews His Housing Legacies

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
For the last 14 years, the Rev. Dr. M. Moran Weston has been retired. But that description is little more than a technicality. The only hint of a leisurely pace for Dr. Weston, 85, a theologian, banker, developer of affordable housing, human-rights advocate and Harlem mainstay, is that he spends more time at his Florida home where, as he puts it, "there are no stairs to climb."
He flies up every month for a meeting of the Carver Federal Savings Bank board, which he used to head. And he shows no signs of slowing down as he tours some of the 10 or so buildings that stand because of his efforts over the last 20 years. 
 Dr. Weston's Harlem radiates out from St. Philip's Episcopal Church on West 134th Street, where he was rector from 1957 until 1982. While presiding over his famous congregation (Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court was among them), he came to realize the neighborhood's deep need for housing for the poor. After all, he says, "I come from the Christian tradition, which begins with a story about a homeless man."
In Harlem today, he says, "there is no end to the need."
While rector, Dr. Weston directed construction of five nonprofit housing developments in Harlem. Behind St. Philip's is his first, a 14-story structure built for the elderly. Before it was built in the 70's, Dr. Weston often visited his older congregants, most of whom lived in terrible housing. "The idea of new housing for poor people was a crazy idea at the time," he said. "My belief was that if you happened to live long, you shouldn't be penalized."
Down the street at 134th and St. Nicholas Avenue is Dr. Weston's second building, 16 stories high, with 260 moderate-rent apartments. Next door to the church stands another of his legacies, the Upper Manhattan Child Development/Day Care Center, where the voices of children 2 to 13 were heard through the doors during a tour the other day. In a courtyard, Dr. Weston pointed out with particular pride the Japanese cherry trees that will soon bud and bloom. "At one time," he said, "this community center was just in my head."
For the last 10 years, in his so-called retirement, he has headed Weston United Community Renewal, which provides housing and services for the mentally ill. The program was inspired by a Harlem Hospital psychiatrist who told Dr. Weston how dire the need was.
Like other developers of housing for people with mental illness, Dr. Weston's group faced fierce community opposition. The first residence, he said, took five years to gain approval.
Now, Weston United has created three residences staffed by caregivers as well as services like a clubhouse and a gardening program. For the newest of these residences he has selected a new name: the Center for Hope. JANET ALLON

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: JACKSON HEIGHTS;
Immigration Bill Stirs Fears

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Dilip Jani has dished up tea and tandoori at the Jackson Diner on 74th Street for the last 11 years, and since 1992, when he applied to sponsor his wife and children, they have waited in Bombay for the visa backlog to clear. Pramoda Rai, a waitress at the diner, is seeking legal papers for her elderly mother, who came to stay with her since her father died. And across the street at Melodyland, a video and music shop, Seema Vermani has also been thinking about sponsoring her mother.
But legislation being debated in Congress -- which would cut immigration of extended family members -- would jeopardize their aspirations. Along 74th Street in Jackson Heights, a bustling multinational commercial strip, the proposals, which would cut legal immigration by as much as a third, have left many immigrant merchants and workers fearful that they may never be reunited with family members and that the legal labor supply would dry up, damaging the local economy. But many in the surrounding residential blocks say Jackson Heights cannot support more immigrants and welcome the legislation. 
 Under the Senate bill, parents could not sponsor their children over the age of 21, like Mr. Jani's eldest son. The measure would also make it more difficult to sponsor elderly parents: Ms. Rai and Ms. Vermani could bring their mothers only if most of their siblings have lived in the United States and if they could prove that their mothers would not rely on Government benefits. And both the Senate and House bills would bar immigrants from sponsoring brothers and sisters.
Proponents argue that the restrictions are necessary to curb the number of extended family members who emigrate to the United States under family reunification provisions. These immigrants, they contend, compete for scarce jobs and receive costly government benefits.
But on 74th Street, many say such laws would break up families. Mr. Jani, for example, said that by Indian custom, it would be unthinkable for his son to remain behind by himself, even at age 21. "Really, I'm very much upset," he said. "If he is not coming then I have to go back. I'm not going to say goodbye to my family permanently."
Both bills on Capitol Hill would also bar unskilled workers from obtaining employment visas; currently, about 10,000 such visas are offered annually.
On 74th Street, recent immigrants from the Indian subcontinent peddle saris and sweetmeats. Colombians dominate the long, bustling strip of restaurants and long-distance telephone shops. Korean groceries are staffed almost exclusively by owners' families and their Latino workers. Severing legal immigration channels, many people on 74th Street maintain, would encourage illegal immigration, further driving down wages in the immigrant marketplace.
"The legal ones won't get the jobs," Ms. Vermani surmised. "The ones who are here legally -- they're already suffering. They will suffer more."
Still, there are others in Jackson Heights who support efforts to stem the flow of immigrants. Karl Christensen, president of the Jackson Heights Neighborhood Association, said many in his group "think the boat is full."
"They think there should be zero percent immigration," he asserted.
Mr. Christensen, a Jackson Heights resident for 50 years, complained that immigrants in his neighborhood have packed single-family homes with more than 20 people. "They take money, work or whatever, and it is siphoned out of the community," he said. SOMINI SENGUPTA


GRAPHIC: The House and the Senate are considering bills that seek to stem the flow of immigrants and revise rules for obtaining visas for family members. The House version was approved by the Judiciary Commitee last fall and is scheduled for a vote before the full House during the week of March 18. Debate on the Senate version by the Judiciary Committee began Thursday. Chart outlines the following areas related to the bills: sponsorship, workers' visas, and refugees.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
In Dublin, a Golden Run

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
THE powerful bomb that went off on Feb. 9 on London's Canary Wharf did not make a big noise on the floor of the Dublin stock exchange.
Neither did last Wednesday's joint decision by the British and Irish Prime Ministers to persevere with the Ulster peace process, despite that truce-shattering explosion, by calling all-party talks in June. 
 War and peace may come and go in Northern Ireland's six counties. But the impact is virtually negligible on the booming fortunes of the Irish Republic, whose economic success helped make Dublin's stock market the second-best performer in Europe last year, after Switzerland's. The exchange, with a capitalization of $22 billion, was up 21 percent in 1995. And the market's ISEQ Overall index has advanced from 2,220 at the beginning of this year to 2,348 on Friday.
Moreover, despite the market's modest size, United States investors can participate in it through the Irish Investment fund, a closed-end fund, and through more than a dozen Irish companies that trade here as American depository receipts. Big companies with A.D.R.'s include Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal maker, and Allied Irish Banks.
Why the persistent bullishness in Dublin, where the exchange actually rose 1 percent in the week after Canary Wharf? One reason is that while the troubles in Northern Ireland affect the Irish Republic, such as through tourism, they are not that closely linked to the Republic's economy. "Less than 5 percent of Irish exports go to Ulster," said John Forde, an analyst with Bank of Ireland Asset Management, which runs the Irish Investment fund.
Basically, he said, "what drives our market are the fundamentals of the Irish economy."
Since 1992, Ireland's economy has outpaced that of the European Union. The Republic grew 5.8 percent in 1995, for instance, while the union's growth was under 3 percent.
Ireland's strong growth, helped by low inflation and a tight budgetary policy, stands on three main legs. The country's well-educated, English-speaking but low-cost work force, together with an array of tax incentives, has made it a favorite investment site for foreign firms.
Also, the country's demographics suggest growing consumer demand. In 1986, those under 20 years old or over 65 accounted for 50 percent of the population. Today, they are 45 percent; by 2006, they will be less than 40 percent. "This means strong credit growth, which is why we like Allied Irish Banks," Mr. Forde said.
Finally, Ireland, which is relatively poor, receives European Union aid that is equivalent to about 4 percent of its total economic output. Grants will continue through 1999.
Irish stocks are relatively cheap right now. The Dublin market trades at 10.3 times anticipated 1996 earnings, while the comparable figure for London stocks is 13.5 and for the European Union as a whole, 14.7.
This "valuation gap," in Mr. Forde's view, reflects the domination of the market by a few large companies. The 10 biggest account for 75 percent of the market, while the four largest -- Allied Irish Banks; Bank of Ireland; Jefferson Smurfit, a paper maker, and CRH, a building materials manufacturer -- make up just under half.
Because these large companies often trade as A.D.R.'s, American investors can cover much of the Dublin market without leaving home. Of the four biggest stocks, for instance, only the Bank of Ireland has no A.D.R. Other large-company A.D.R.'s include the Elan Corporation, a drug manufacturer, and Phoenix Shannon, which makes dental goods.

HEADLINE: Board Resigns At U.S. Fund For Czechs And Slovaks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The entire board of a troubled investment fund set up to help the Czech and Slovak republics has resigned. Now President Clinton is to appoint an interim board to help determine if the fund should be shut or merged with another fund, a spokesman for the Agency for International Development said today.
The Czech and Slovak American Enterprise Fund, established by Congress in 1989, has invested about $26 million but it expects to write off about $10 million in bad investments. 
 The chairman, John R. Petty, was forced out in November, after he put his longtime assistant on the fund's payroll, got her a raise of more than 50 percent and became romantically involved with her.
According to a report by the Inspector General at A.I.D., the assistant, who later resigned, admitted that she had fabricated documents in an effort to get the fund and a sister fund, the Hungarian American Enterprise Fund, to pay $1,500 for computer consulting work to a woman who was a third member of the household.
The replacement chairman and two allies removed a fourth board member in December because he objected to the way the fund was being run; a fifth board member resigned in protest. On Tuesday, though, the replacement chairman and the two allies resigned.
According to Jay Byrne, a spokesman for A.I.D., the resignations were voluntary. He said the likely options were to re-focus the fund on Slovakia, which has economic problems much worse than the Czech Republic, or to merge the program with the Hungarian fund, or to phase it out.
President Bush appointed the first board, which was authorized to select its own replacements. But Mr. Byrne said President Clinton would appoint a new board, which would present recommendations to a joint committee of the State Department, A.I.D. and the White House.
The chairman who resigned on Tuesday is Lawrence McQuade, a former executive of Prudential Mutual Fund Management Inc. Milan Ondrus, a retired vice president of the FMC Corporation, also resigned, as did Jerome Jacobsen, a financial consultant for Economic Studies Inc., and Ian Tauber. An A.I.D. spokesman said he had no biographical information on Mr. Tabuer.
Mr. Petty, the chairman who resigned last year, is a former chairman and chief executive of the Marine Midland Bank. Joseph Fischera, a former managing director of Bear Sterns & Company, was voted off the board last December, and another member, Robert Rubin, resigned in protest of that vote.
Board memberships are unpaid positions.
Robert C. Odle Jr., a lawyer who examined the fund at the request of its audit committee, said in a telephone interview today that the Czech and Slovak fund was unlike the others.
"We have 11 enterprise funds, and 10 of the 11 have a good, modern corporate structure," he said. He said the others had hired strong professional executives to run the operations.
Mr. Odle, a lawyer at Weil Gotschal & Manges, a New York-based firm that helped write the bylaws of some of the funds, said outright elimination of the Czech and Slovak fund was probably not an option, because it had a portfolio to manage.
"The most important job for the U.S. Government is to get the board right," he said. "If the Government gets the board right, then the board has a chance to create the right corporate structure."
"If you get the right corporate structure, then you have checks and balances," he said.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Rem Koolhaas Sizes Up the Future

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
BY A HAPPY COINCIDENCE, Rem Koolhaas's new book, "S, M, L, XL," arrived just as the magnificent Mondrian show was ending its run at the Museum of Modern Art. One couldn't ask for a better symbol of the passing of modern art's baton than the fortuitous dovetailing of these two events. Mondrian, the pioneer abstract painter, ended his career with "Broadway Boogie-Woogie." Koolhaas, the flying Dutchman of contemporary architecture, began his career with "Delirious New York," a 1978 book that paid a comparably ecstatic tribute to Manhattan's fascinating rhythms. For a brief moment this winter, it seemed that the Dutch still held sway over this tiny, as yet untamed New World island.
Too bad New York hasn't staked its claim on Koolhaas. A week after the publication of his new book, MCA, the media giant, announced that it had given Koolhaas his first American commission. As master planner for Universal City, MCA's Los Angeles headquarters, Koolhaas will supervise future development on a 415-acre site that already includes offices, production studios and a popular theme park. It's a dream job for an architect whose work is vibrantly alert to the impact of media on architecture. 
 Koolhaas, who is 51, has been tantalizing his admirers for some time now with his precarious balance between dreaming and building, but in recent months the architect has been piling up evidence of his determination to build. Euralille, a major trade and convention center in northern France for which Koolhaas provided the master plan, has enabled him to build on the urban scale that has long captivated his imagination. Thanks to an association formed last year between his office and a Dutch engineering firm, he is now designing rail and highway projects in Germany and the Netherlands.
"S, M, L, XL," published by Monacelli Press, is a record of Koolhaas's voyage from visionary to practitioner, a stunning, bloated 1,344-page collection of the architect's writings and designs. The title describes the organization of its contents. The collection starts off with Small projects (private houses, short essays) and builds up to Extra Large urban plans. But the word "organization" fundamentally misrepresents the volume's peculiar, loopy structure. Koolhaas calls the book a novel. I'd call it jazz, a series of riffs on architecture between Koolhaas and Bruce Mau, the graphic designer responsible for the book's dazzling visual style.
Photographs and plans for completed buildings, renderings of unrealized projects, diary jottings, favorite quotations, reports on urban development in Asia and the United States, cartoons, aphorisms, movie stills: the book's topics spill into one another, as if to represent the unexpected connections of Koolhaas's thinking. Fragments of a screenplay, for example, are printed over pictures of an art museum in Rotterdam completed in 1991. Construction shots of Congrexpo, Koolhaas's convention hall in Lille, are interrupted by a reproduced tabloid headline: "The World Ended Eight Years Ago: We are all in the afterlife, says top researcher." The effect of this overlapping technique is to suggest that Koolhaas's individual projects and thoughts are less significant than their complex interweaving.
The book is not a shapeless mess. Its loose, improvisatory framework suggests a model for thinking about the design of cities. The interwoven topics, the quirky juxtapositions, even the autobiographical entries add up to a strangely convincing way to reckon with the void left by the collapse of modern city planning.
The gist of Koolhaas's argument is this: By the time his generation entered architecture school, modern city planning was dead. Instead of thinking in terms of master plans, architects turned to "interventions," small-scale projects that don't threaten to shred the urban fabric.
This thinking would be adequate had urban development adhered to the small scale advocated by Jane Jacobs and others. But it hasn't. Instead, cities have become increasingly dependent on projects of ever more colossal scale: convention centers and hotel complexes, sports stadiums, shopping malls, office campuses.
Koolhaas argues that instead of opposing such projects, architects should begin to develop theories about what he terms Bigness. They should learn how to use the large-scale project, like Euralille, as a contemporary urban force. Otherwise, they, and the city, will lose the opportunity to realize its creative potential.
Bigness? I can hear Lewis Mumford spinning in his grave. Isn't this merely the latest demonstration of architects' capacity to rationalize their dependence on the economic status quo? Could be. But Koolhaas is also offering a much needed critique of the architectural status quo for its failure to deal creatively with the forces he's talking about. New York, for instance, has become addicted to contextualism, a formula for making new buildings look like old ones. There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach. Koolhaas is right to insist, however, that contemporary urban development calls for a fresh approach.
Contextual architecture, in whatever period style, compels architects to think within a 19th-century framework of ideas. This is not an alien framework for central cities like New York, which are, after all, products of 19th-century industrialization. Period revival designs like those at Battery Park City have been useful exercises for educating architects about that framework.
BUT THOSE EXERCISES ARE powerless to guide the city into the future. When we read reports like the one just issued by the Regional Plan Association on the economic slippage of New York, we should be alert enough to make the connection between that slippage and the timid buildings our architects have been turning out. In both cases, we're witnessing a collective failure of creative vision.
The city envisioned by Koolhaas is the ultimate form of what Umberto Eco called "the open work," an art object deliberately left unfinished by the artist so others can interact with it. Jazz lovers won't have any trouble with this concept, but even those who view the city as a built boogie-woogie may doubt that spontaneity and improvising are enough to insure the city's vitality.
And, of course, they are not. Spontaneity is not going to clean the air in Mexico City; improvisation is not going to rejuvenate New York's out-of-date transportation system, and Koolhaas's ideas, small or large, printed or built, won't suffice to insure the city's future. Koolhaas is speaking as a member of a specialized profession whose practitioners are largely restricted to the design of individual buildings.
"S, M, L, XL" is a record of one architect's attempt to give his buildings a more contemporary urban dimension. The record shows that Koolhaas is also a contextualist, but in a fresh, inventive way. His brand of contextualism has little to do with making new buildings match the look and scale of old ones. It is concerned with designing forms that evoke the larger forces reshaping cities today: the global economy, advanced communications, the collapse of regional differences within a shrinking world.
The book's unwieldy size is a metaphor for this enlarged urban context, while its jazzy, free-form contents reflect an artist's intuitive response to it. Obviously, architects have no direct control over the global forces to which cities are increasingly subject. Koolhaas thinks more could be done to activate architecture as a creative force. Electronic money, high-speed trains, cellular phones: on an imaginative level, these could all be seen as instruments for spirited improvisation. Why not let buildings riff?

HEADLINE: Pop Culture: Extremes but Little Reality

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
On the sitcom "News Radio" recently, the owner of a New York radio station decided to sell out to a large company. His small, loyal staff begged him to change hismond.Because they live in a television fantasy, he did. He didn't need any more money, he decided; the friendship of his employees mattered more. 
 The character of the benevolent boss is unreal enough to seem wacky these days, but the fantasy shouldn't be surprising. Pop culture rarely offers a straight-on reflection of social change. Instead, you can rely on television and movies to provide a fun-house-mirror version. So the scariest of economic changes are now being thrown back at us in exaggerated shapes. Films, teleivsion and pop music have begun to play out our worst fears and our fondest hopes about job insecurity.
 At one extreme is "News Radio," which wraps unemployment in comforting reassurances. At the other extreme is a film like "Falling Down," in which the white-collar military-industry worker played by Michael Douglas is laid off, becomes enraged at his unemployment (and at the nation of immigrants taking jobs) and reacts by shotting everyone in sight. Such scenarios, with their veiled responses to the fear of layoffs, allow viewers to feel soothed or to vent their rage, vicariously.
 This polarization into best- and worst- case scenarios is just the beginning. Pop-culture leaves a huge hole where you'd expect the issue of white collar, middle-aged unemployment to be.
 But the blue-collar sitcom families on "Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire" have been struggling with lost jobs and downsizing for years. (Grace was a crew chief at an oil refinery until she was bumped back to being a regular crew member in a wave of job cuts.)
 These television plots resemble common country music songs, expressing economic anxiety. They also resemble the blue-collar folks Bruce Springsteen has been singing about for two decades. On his latest CD, "The Ghost of Tom Joad," he sings about generations of beleaguered factory workers in Youngstown, Ohio. The title song evokes the John Steinbeck character, a scrappy survivor who will never give up.
 But such stoic images are giving way to younger, more lackadaisical types.
 The most up-to-the-minute response to job insecurity comes from a generation in its 20's and 30's, whose characters are slackers. The term "slacker" became popular after Richard Linklater's 1991 film about young adults in Austin, Tex., who drift through life without ambition. There are no decent jobs out there - or at least none like the ones their white-collar parents had - so why bother looking? In another slacker movie, "Reality Bites," the one young character who wears a suit is regarded with extreme suspicion.
 In music, alternative rock is the equivalent of the slacker film. In their son "Long View," the group Green Day proves there is no long view for its generation. The narrator watches television all day and sing: "My mother says to get a job/But she don't like the one she's got." A bleak future - a bad job or no job - is the employment legacy passed on from mom and dad.
 And that's the good news. At least it's not violent. In the Hughes Brothers' latest film, "Dead Presidents," the hero is a young black man who loses his job, can't find another, and stages a lethal armored-truck robbery because he is desperate to feed his family. Though the film is set in the 1970's, it clerly alludes to the present. Its rebellious attitude is shared by the group Jr. M.A.F.I.A., with its hit song "Get Money."
 In contrast to the drama or hopelessness in movies and music, television provides the ultimate comfort zone, even when it addresses a younger generation's joblessness. On "Friends," the twentysomething middle-class characters have few ambitions, and can afford to be blithe about unemployment. When Monica loses her job as a chef, she borrows rent money from her brother and gets a freelance catering job through her mother. For years, one or another ofthe thirtysomething characters are "Seinfeld" always seemed to be job hunting. George was finally forced to move in with his parents in Queens, an undignified but funny move. What's revealing is that no one ends up on the street. There is always a safety net of family and friends. Pop culture, after all, thrives on entertainment and escapism.
 It's a sign of how widespread awareness of this issue is that sitcoms are creeping closer to the subject. The hero of "The Drew Carey Show" works in the personnel office of a department store; the heroine of "Can't Hurry Love" works at an employment agency. These two are employed, but they are surrounded by people who are not. And "Good Company," a sitcom set in an ad agency (to premiere tomorrow), promises to deal with layoffs next week.
 Even as the most populist art forms play out our employment anxieties, one of the most expensive, least populist forms has responded by looking back to the good old days. Broadway has offered up an elaborate revival of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Tryuing." It might help to remember that concept was always a fantasy.

HEADLINE: Future Communications

 BODY:
Most of the recent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average has been fueled by interest in technoloby stocks, and investors have turned an even more vigilant eye to that sector of the economy after Congress passed the telecommunications bill last month. In the long run, that legislation allowd local phone operators to compete with long-distance operators and vice versa. And those companies could also compete with cable companies, who, in turn, are faced with increasing competition from some home satellite firms as well as microwave broadcast transmissions. 
 As last week's acquistion of Continental Cablevision by U S West demonstrates, some companies hope to offer several of these services by themselves. This means that the consumer should enjoy cheaper prices for different types of telecommunication.

GRAPHIC: Chart:
 
RURAL AND SMALL CITY
 
Local telephone and long-distance service (via telephone lines and airwaves)
 Most homes in these areas will have phone service delivered in the traditional manner -- through twisted copper wires. In the United States, 20 percent of all households are limited to rotary dials tones, and this phenomenon is even more prevalent in rurals areas. An alternative in five years for people in these areas is a transmission system called fixed loop wireless that reduces some of copper's high costs.

 
Internet access (via cable and telephone lines)
 Upscale farms and rural areas would use cable lines to access the Internet, as well as copper phone lines that used compression to transmit more data.

Television access (via satellite and airwaves)
 Satellite transmission will probably be the rule, as well as enhanced land-based transmission. Wireless, as opposed to cable, TV will dominate.

Population in this type of area
 Rural -- 35.1 million people in 1990; example: Home City, Kan.
 Small city -- 20.9 million people in 1990; example: Galesburg, Ill.

Options
 The new telecommunications law encourages competition among cable companies along with long-distance and local phone companies, and this competition, at the outset, is going to cost a lot of money. Firms will resist large expenditures in rural areas and small towns. So, in these areas, the long-term effects of the bill are hazy.
 
 
SUBURBAN AND BIG CITY
 
Local telephone and long-distance service (via telephone lines, airwaves and cable)
 Places like Washington, New York and Philadelphia will have at least four choices for local and long distance: traditional copper wire, coaxial cable, cellular phones, and personal communications devices, or P.C.S. People like students will have only wireless phones without even bothering to get a land line installed. This change will be fueled by falling costs to the consumer for portable phone technology.
 
Internet access (via cable--
 Consumers will require big pipes such as cable, to access the Internet. There will also be a bit of small data, such a e-mail messages, transmitted over the airwaves.
 
Television access (via airwaves, satellite, and fiber optic)
 Television access will be very similar to rural and suburban areas except for the largest cities, which might still have a problem with personal satellite dishes.
 
Population in this type of area
 Suburban -- 114.8 million people in 1990; example: all of Long Island
 Big city -- 77.8 million people in 1990; example: Chicago
 
Options
 The future also holds the promise of broadband two-way communications through the airwaves, as opposed to cable, for services such as interactive television and the Internet. Videophones will also be more prevalent as more households begin using bigger pipelines into the house for communications.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Belongs to No One

BYLINE: By Peng Ming-min; Peng Ming-min, a dissident who was exiled from Taiwan for 22 years, is running as the Democratic Progressive Party candidate in Taiwan's first presidential elections.

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
As if controlling its own press were not enough, China has been skillfully getting its point of view into the international media in recent months. Hong Kong, Japanese and American newspapers have been filled with intimidating reports, from unidentified sources, of China's plans for imminent invasions, blockades or bombings of Taiwan. In January, The New York Times carried an article citing unconfirmed reports that China was prepared to launch missile strikes every day for a month against Taiwan following the country's first presidential election, on March 23.
In response to these alarming reports, many people argue that Taiwan should avoid provoking China and concentrate on its own democratic and economic progress. But this argument is based on three erroneous assumptions. 
 First, it assumes that Taiwan's best strategy is to try to appease China by not seeking ties to the outside world. On the contrary, accepting its own isolation makes Taiwan more vulnerable to China. The exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations and other international organizations has enabled China to remove the Taiwan Strait conflict from the agenda of important security discussions.
Second, the assumption that China can be appeased is flawed. In recent years, China has compiled an ever-growing list of reasons why it may attack Taiwan: if the island declares independence, if Taiwan pursues international recognition, if there is foreign interference in settling Taiwan's future, if candidates preferred by Beijing are not elected by the Taiwanese people.
Even if Taiwan tried to comply with one or more of these conditions, its security would never be guaranteed as long as China refused to rule out the use of force. This is particularly true as Beijing prepares for a volatile political transition after the reign of 91-year-old Deng Xiaoping. As potential leaders vie for favor with the military and strive to arouse nationalistic sentiments among the citizens, the question is no longer whether certain actions will provoke China. The question is, When will China find it convenient to claim that it has been provoked?
The final misconception is that Taiwan is part of China. In fact, Taiwan has been separated from China for nearly a century, ever since the Qing dynasty relinquished sovereignty over the island "in perpetuity" in the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki. Except for a brief period from 1945 to 1949, when the island was ruled as a part of China by Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime, Taiwan has had an independent government. To indulge Beijing's territorial claim denies the Taiwanese people their right to self-determination, while allowing China to cite stale history as a justification to try to expand its borders.
Taiwan is not recognized as an independent state by many countries, including the United States. But America also didn't recognize the Soviet Union and China for decades. No one could plausibly suggest, in the years before relations were normalized with these countries, that their people and territory were up for grabs by the nearest neighbors.
Faced with China's unpredictable and belligerent behavior, Taiwan cannot afford to renounce its rights under international law. Its Government must be responsible to its citizens, a significant number of whom oppose unification. The ultimate decision about Taiwan's national identity must be made by its 21 million people through the democratic process rather than imposed by any political party in Taiwan or by the authorities in Beijing.

HEADLINE: The Shell Game of Hollywood 'Net Profits';
Dreamworks May Be Shaking Up Some Time-Honored Accounting Habits

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
When Walter Parkes wrote the screenplay for "War Games" with Lawrence Lasker, he, like many screenwriters, was promised a share of the movie's net profits. Although the 1983 movie was an enormous hit and earned Mr. Parkes an Academy Award nomination, he never shared in the film's financial success with MGM/UA. "I can promise you I never saw any net profits," he said.
Now, as co-head of the motion picture division of Dreamworks SKG, he is in a position to do the same to others -- and declines to do so. Instead, he is overseeing an alternative model for divvying up film profits and, in the process, may undermine the industry's time-honored accounting habits. 
 For years, the profits from blockbusters like "Batman," "Forrest Gump" and "J.F.K." have vanished into the bank accounts of the studios and a few powerful stars or directors. Little was left for the lesser lights whose contracts offered a fraction of what the industry refers to as "net profits" -- but which its defines differently from what is generally understood in accounting.
But Dreamworks, the studio created two years ago by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, has already given two sections of its creative staff -- its animators and screenwriters -- contracts guaranteeing they will share in a film's success. Other studios, including Disney and Warner Brothers, are now giving their animators similar deals.
Studio accounting practices -- whose dubious reputation has given "Hollywood accounting" a place alongside "used car salesman" in the nation's psyche -- have survived many lawsuits and audits. But some observers predict this round of challenges may have a different result. Beyond the implicit challenge posed by the Dreamworks move, the movie industry's unique approach to accounting is undergoing skeptical review in venues from Federal courts to the offices of those who set national accounting standards.
"In general, natural oligopolies are difficult to maintain," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University, referring to the control that seven powerful movie studios have long exercised over the industry. Just as the American auto industry was hurt by the Japanese before it changed its ways, Hollywood may be eventually pushed to alter its formula for calculating net profits under its standard contracts.
"The studios may have to more realistically account to their profit participants," said Philip Hacker, who has audited hundreds of contracts for clients like Harrison Ford, William Shatner and Rob Reiner and is now a consultant for plaintiffs in a new lawsuit against the studios.
The image of Hollywood accounting is not helped when a movie like "Forrest Gump," which took in roughly $650 million at the box office, about 40 percent of which went to the studio, has actually lost money to date, according to Paramount's accountant responsible for the studio's contracts. The studio said it believed the film would eventually make money under the contract and that it had already advanced substantial sums to the participants in anticipation of those profits.
"J.F.K.," the Warner Brothers film inspired by the memoirs of the late Jim R. Garrison, the former New Orleans district attorney who investigated the Kennedy assassination, grossed more than $150 million but is also considered a money loser. (A lawyer for the studio, which is owned by Time Warner, declined to comment.)
In response, Mr. Garrison's estate filed a class-action suit against Warner Brothers and the other major studios last November, accusing them of violating Federal antitrust laws; the suit has opened a new legal front in the attacks on studio accounting. Lawyers for the Garrison estate are hiring Mr. Hacker to help document their case.
In practice, the term "Hollywood accounting" has applied to two not-quite-parallel procedures that studios use to tell their financial stories.
One set of books is maintained according to the general accounting principles accepted in other industries and is shown to studios' corporate overlords and shareholders. That is referred to as "financial accounting."
A second set of books, called "contractual accounting," comes into play when one of the big studios commits itself to dividing the proceeds from a film among the actors, directors, writers, animators, producers and other participants -- after the expenses, from distribution fees to star salaries, have been paid.
While all such participants have been paid a fee or salary for their work, their contracts typically guarantee many of them a share in these artificially defined "net profits."
Both the financial accounting and the contractual accounting practices of the studios are being questioned or challenged. But of the two, the contractual accounting system reflects most closely the rigid pecking order of a closed and power-conscious society. As a result, of the two accounting systems, it is the one seen as most impervious to change.
"For most films, the net profit participants don't receive anything," Mr. Hacker said. "Of late, there has even been less of an opportunity." According to Mark Weinstein, a professor at the University of Southern California, 10 to 20 percent of all films pay some net profits. Critics of the system say the true figure is less than 5 percent.
The suit by Mr. Garrison's estate, which is being argued by Joseph W. Cotchett, one of the country's most powerful and persuasive trial lawyers, contends the studios violated antitrust laws by conspiring to hoard profits. According to the suit, such methods "could only be practiced in a company town like Hollywood, where a few major studios control 90 percent of the movie world revenues, and that enormous economic leverage can be and is used to force compliance with contract terms that no one would sign under any other circumstances."
Mr. Cotchett, who was responsible for getting hundreds of millions of dollars in awards for the bondholders of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan in the late 1980's, contends the contracts are "unconscionable" -- so outrageous as to be unlawful.
Not so, say studio executives. "I've been around this business for a good many years," said Bertram Fields, the lawyer who is representing Paramount, a unit of Viacom, in the Garrison case. "I can tell you the allegations are way off the mark both factually and legally."
The studios are taking the challenge seriously, and have hired some of the industry's most powerful lawyers, including Frank Rothman, the former chairman and chief executive of MGM/UA, and Mr. Fields.
And others in Hollywood also argue that the current system is fair. They say that few actors deserve the $20 million that a Sylvester Stallone gets per picture, while a lesser-known actor, who is typically represented by an agent or lawyer, gets what he or she deserves. "You have no clout and you should be grateful you get a contract," said Howard Vogel, an entertainment analyst with Cowen & Company. "It's not like they're stiffing people who are not getting paid."
Hollywood's accounting methods were available for inspection when Art Buchwald, the Washington newspaper columnist, sued Paramount for a share of net profits in "Coming to America." Although the 1988 movie starring Eddie Murphy was a big hit, the studio claimed it lost money. "We publicized something that has been going on for 70 years," Mr. Buchwald said.
After spending seven years in court and several million dollars in legal fees and expenses, Mr. Buchwald and his lawyers settled his suit last year. Although a judge had determined Paramount's definition of net profits was "unconscionable" in late 1990, the settlement meant no legal precedent was set.
A different judge reviewing a similar case involving the first "Batman" movie, was unwilling to go as far as the judge in the Buchwald suit; he refused to permit the "Batman" case to reach a jury, which might have awarded damages. That case is now on appeal.
With the average cost of making a Hollywood film now at $65 million, including $30 million in worldwide marketing costs, a star or director with a track record of attracting throngs to theaters has the power to negotiate for large fees and a percentage of the gross revenues. Since there is little profit in any but the biggest international hits, once these players devour their portion of a film's proceeds, "they totally and completely destroy the net profit pool," said Peter Dekom, a Los Angeles entertainment lawyer.
The same high costs and seven-figure salaries have caused the studios' return on their investments to drop significantly, putting more pressure on studio executives to limit movie costs.
Studios are dealing differently with that pressure. The new contracts at Dreamworks "could be the first competitive pressure since before World War II," said Pierce O'Donnell, the lawyer who represented Mr. Buchwald.
While the Dreamworks contracts do not discard every previous practice of the old system, screenwriters are given a variety of ways to share in success.
First, they get a share of profits, calculated after the studio subtracts its distribution fee, overhead charges and actual costs. Then, a writer who receives credit on a film also shares in a profit pool, which is calculated essentially the same way but with a much smaller distribution fee deducted. Finally, some writers can share in a profit pool with a reduced distribution fee for all live-action films produced and financed by Dreamworks during their tenure there. The studio has also created an animators' bonus pool.
But Dreamworks is more like other studios when it comes to video revenues. In the age of the VCR, video has been a lifesaver for studios. According to Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research firm, video sales now account for almost half of a film's overall revenues. But the standard industry contract includes just 20 percent of video sales in the revenue column.
This formula, pioneered by the 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corporation, is now standard practice. Such follow-the-leader tendencies have helped bolster the class-action lawsuit filed by the Garrison estate. But the plaintiffs must offer more proof than this to prove a violation of antitrust laws.
Hollywood's practices in the more commonplace realm of standard financial accounting have not escaped scrutiny. An accounting industry task force is currently trying to tighten up industry practices. Among the issues being addressed are whether costs like advertising should be expensed immediately, as is typically required in other industries. The main goal of the task force, according to Robert McLendon, an Ernst & Young accountant and a task force member, is to make sure studio practices are consistent. Writers like Walter Parkes at Dreamworks are not quite as interested in consistency. For them, the issue is fairness. "We're trying to address those areas where, quite honestly, compensation has not been commensurate with the contribution," Mr. Parkes said.

 As studios subtract large fees and pay for top stars, they say that there is nothing left for writers, directors and stars. These are industry estimates
 Production costs -- $35 million (These costs inclukde a 15% overhead charge.)
 Distribution fee -- $35 million
 Advertising -- 30 million
 Stars and director -- $30 million
Interest -- $10 million (Normally 125% of the prime rate.)
 COSTS -- $140 million
 REVENUE -- $100 million (The studios collect only 40% of the box-office gross, and the rest goes to theaters.
 LOSS -- $40 million. (pg. D1)

Lowe Gets Account From Time Warner

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Time Warner Inc. and units of Nike Inc. and Pepsico Inc. have made decisions involving accounts.
Time Warner in New York selected Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York as the first agency to handle its corporate image advertising account, with billings estimated at $10 million. Lowe, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, was awarded the account after a six-to-eight-week review that also included undisclosed agencies. 
 Cole-Haan Inc., the shoe company in Yarmouth, Me., that is owned by Nike, named the Richards Group in Dallas to handle its account, which had been at Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano in New York since March 1994. The billings were estimated at $3 million to $5 million. The decision came after a review in which Weiss, Whitten declined to participate; Richards competed against Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York, an affiliate of Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, and Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass.
And the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico named Dieste & Partners in Dallas to handle advertising and promotions aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers, which had been handled by Ornelas & Associates in Dallas since 1993. The billings were not disclosed. Jorge Consuegra, a Pepsi-Cola brand manager in Somers, N.Y., said that Dieste, an affiliate of the DDB Needham Dallas unit of the Omnicom Group, was awarded the assignment after a two-month review that also included Ornelas and two undisclosed shops. Ornelas had been affiliated with DDB Needham until Jan. 2, when two top executives of Ornelas left to open Dieste. DDB Needham handles several other Pepsico accounts.

HEADLINE: Civic-Minded Pursuits Gain Ground at Newspapers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: DULUTH, Minn.

 BODY:
The Duluth News-Tribune ran an article across the top of its front page in September about 50 local men who got together at a nearby resort to discuss ways they could help curb the rising incidence of domestic abuse, murder and fighting in schools here in northern Minnesota.
It was a standard news article about a common enough occurrence -- local leaders working for the common good -- except for this: the gathering was organized by The News-Tribune, promoted in its news articles and partly paid for by the paper, and then reported on in its news pages. 
 This is an example of what is called public, or civic, journalism, and this year roughly marks the fifth birthday of the movement. About 40 dailies in medium and large cities, up from perhaps a dozen two years ago, are using public journalism techniques that blur the traditional distinction between reporting and editorializing. In the process, newsrooms become more directly involved in shaping local news, in the name of civic improvement.
By asking citizen focus groups what kind of news they want to read, by joining with radio and television stations to promote civic education projects or by sponsoring civic or town hall meetings to address local concerns, these journalists hope to revitalize public debate -- and stem a decline in newspaper readership.
But does it work? The only formal study of the impact of civic journalism disclosed small but, in the words of the foundation that sponsored it, "encouraging," evidence that a 1994 project by The Wisconsin State Journal in Madison had caught the public's attention and slightly increased general awareness of important election issues.
There have been small increases in circulation at several important newspapers that are experimenting with civic journalism. But not at The Wichita Eagle in Kansas, whose editor, Davis Merritt, Jr., helped start the movement in 1990.
At The Eagle, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., daily circulation since 1990 has declined to 111,800 from 120,800. Other newspapers practicing civic journalism, however, including The State Journal, The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va., have had modest circulation increases in the same period.
Daily journalism is a cyclical business, as every publisher knows, and many local factors affect circulation figures and advertising revenue. All three papers that showed growth, for example, are in economically prosperous areas.
While Mr. Merritt conceded that attracting new readers was one goal of public journalism, he also insisted that the benefits of the movement would accrue over a long period. "When I set out talking about this in 1990, I said this would be a generational cultural change," Mr. Merritt said. "Talk to me in 10 years."
Like other papers engaging in civic journalism, The Wisconsin State Journal has teamed with local television and radio outlets. Starting in early 1992, the partners, who named their project "We the People," sponsored meetings, solicited public comment on issues important to voters and instructed readers and viewers how to watch debates and dissect political advertising.
The 1995 study of the "We the People" project, based on polls taken before and after the 1994 elections for governor and United States Senator, found that about half the respondents had heard of the project, though 20 percent attributed the effort to a newspaper or television station that had not taken part.
In addition, the percentage of people who said that the effort had raised their interest in public affairs increased to 32 percent after the election from 26 percent before it, according to the study, which was sponsored by the Pew Center for Civic Journalism.The number of people who said the program had increased their knowledge of important issues rose to 56 percent after the election from 51 percent before.
If these increases in political knowledge or interest seem minimal at best -- after all, nearly 70 percent of respondents said the program did not increase their interest in politics -- the results are encouraging in light of the public's alienation from politics and the news media as its messenger, said Esther Thorson, who conducted the survey.
"The question is, can civic journalism fight back against all the negative advertising that people see in a campaign?" asked Ms. Thorson, who is associate dean for graduate studies at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. "You may look at these results and say the changes are small, but my guess is we have a shot at it. It does not increase cynicism; it does increase knowledge, and it probably increases the likelihood of voting."
Here on the frozen rim of Lake Superior, Craig Gemoules, managing editor of The News-Tribune, said it was too early to tell if the two meetings of the paper's project, called "Men as Peacemakers," and the half-dozen articles have had any effect on the worrisome rise in spousal abuse and the small increase in the number of murders last year.
The paper, which is also part of the Knight-Ridder chain, and its partner, the public television station WDSE, have only recently received a $54,000 grant from the Pew Center to continue the program. The money will pay to rent meeting places for men to gather and talk, and for the production of a videotape to be distributed to schools about the ways men and boys learn about violence. .
But subsidizing and promoting events to get citizens involved in civic affairs is not the job of newspapers, said John G. Craig, editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, part of Blade Communications.
"I don't think the press should be an alternate arm of government," Mr. Craig said. "I don't see that it's Rupert Murdoch's responsibility to make the American people more connected, and I clearly don't want the Disney Corporation and Time Warner to get together to see what they can do to make the American people more connected."
Mr. Gemoules argues that newspapers have been creating their own news for years without being honest enough to admit it.
"I can't tell you how many stories I've read that said 'Front-runner Bob Dole' before a single vote was cast," he said. "That used to fly right by me, and now it makes me cringe."
"If you want to talk about the sins of civic journalism," he said, "you should look at what we've been doing all along."
The debate inside the nation's newsrooms is a little too theoretical for nonjournalists like Mayor Gary Doty of Duluth.
"My feeling about all that is newspapers hide behind the idea that they're not supposed to become involved in the community's business," Mr. Doty said. "I think they have a corporate responsibility and a personal responsibility to be a part of that community and help find solutions, and not just go digging around for all the dirt they can find and then sit back and say, "Let's see if the people can solve this.' "

HEADLINE: Pushing Brazil, Christopher Urges Trade Zone by 2005

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 3

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged Brazil this weekend to help forge a free-trade zone spanning the Americas by the year 2005.
Brazil has a "critical role" to play in Latin America and the Caribbean, Mr. Christopher said Saturday at a lunch given by the American Chamber of Commerce here. The fight against drugs and terrorism and the effort to halt nuclear proliferation are areas in which Brazil can lead, he said, adding, "There is no area in which Brazil has greater opportunities or responsibilities for leadership than in harnessing the full weight of this economy to achieve hemispheric prosperity." 
 Brazil was instrumental in creating Mercosur, a regional trade pact that also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. "Now, Brazil should join us in energizing the effort to achieve a free-trade area of the Americas by 2005," Mr. Christopher said.
The Secretary was in Brazil as part of an eight-day swing through five Latin American countries. Today, he spoke in Manaus, in the Amazonian northeast, and then headed for a stopover in Trinidad tonight and Washington on Monday.
Mr. Christopher's trip coincides with a push by Brazil to remove the last major obstacle to further investment by Americans, the lack of a law protecting patents.
On Thursday, the Brazilian Senate approved a bill that would protect United States pharmaceutical research. The measure is subject to approval in the lower house; American officials said they were confident that would happen.
Approval of a patent law could attract millions of dollars in capital to the world's fifth-largest pharmaceutical market, manufacturers have said. The law would be a harbinger for greater American investment across the board, Mr. Christopher said.
Increased trade would come at a time that relations with Brazil are considered the best in decades.
How Brazil might react to Mr. Christopher's request was not clear. Brazil has doubted that a hemispheric free-trade zone is possible by 2005, which officials in this country see as an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Two weeks ago, during a visit to Mexico, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso rebuffed Mexican efforts to enter into a strategic alliance with Brazil, though he agreed to study the proposal.
Mercosur has set its own goal of establishing a free-trade zone with the European Union by 2005. Talks began toward that last year.
Mr. Christopher said a perception among United States business people in Sao Paulo that the Mercosur nations might favor Europe over the United States was not a matter of concern as long as trade barriers were not erected. "The relationship of Mercosur and the European Union will be positive as long as it is a building block to free trade," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Negotiates to Send Vietnamese Home, Quietly, From Asian Camps

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
White House aides have a nightmare: the last 36,000 Vietnamese boat people, after years in camps vainly waiting for resettlement in the West, are forcibly returned to Vietnam in ugly scenes, shown on television, that recapitulate the pain, anger and guilt of the war that President Clinton opposed.
That nightmare may soon come true, staining the last episode of a dramatic 20-year story of saving and resettling more than one million refugees who fled their homelands after the collapse of American-supported Governments in Communist revolutions throughout Indochina. 
 This final chapter to the Vietnam War is quickly coming to a close, with a meeting scheduled in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday to conclude the 1989 international agreement that governed the issue of the boat people and to set a target date of June 30 for sending the last of them back to Vietnam.
In essence, the meeting is to mark the end of the two-decade aftermath of the Vietnam War and the emotional cloud of guilt and politics that grew up around it.
The countries of Southeast Asia, having taken in the boat people after promises that they would only be there temporarily, want the camps closed and the last boat people repatriated, forcibly or otherwise.
 
U.N. Cites Needs Of Other Refugees
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees wants to devote its time and resources to other pressing refugee problems in Bosnia and elsewhere, though it will continue to monitor the fates of the Vietnamese who return.
Under the international plan governing boat people since 1989, officials of the United Nations refugee agency have screened the people in the camps and satisfied themselves that no legitimate refugees remain. But many critics are not so sure and argue for a generous closing of the books.
The United States, after taking in more than a million Vietnamese refugees since 1975, wants one last screening by immigration officials, to insure that no one with legitimate connections to the American military or the former South Vietnamese Government or with family ties in the United States has been overlooked.
The American proposals are being rebuffed by Vietnam, though American officials say they will continue to press the Vietnamese in Geneva.
But the emotional and political impact of failure to convince Hanoi could be strong and swift.
"Forced repatriations could start very quickly following the Geneva meeting, and then what do you do when people associated with the United States are beaten, wounded or even killed?" asked Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International, who helped formulate the plan for a final screening.
"This is not a problem the United States can just walk away from, that will somehow sort itself out," he said. "It's the final inning of a long and honorable humanitarian program that has rested on bipartisan American leadership and that is about to end in ignominy and disaster."
 
Agreement Sought With Vietnamese
Similar concerns have been expressed to the White House by figures ranging from Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican, to former President Jimmy Carter.
American officials do not really disagree, but one official said their focus "has to be to try to reach an agreement with the Vietnamese that is credible and workable, and we're hopeful."
"We recognize the difficulties of reaching an agreement," he said, "but we're not prepared to cut and run, either." While refusing to describe American alternatives, he said, "Our discussions are encouraging."
In November, American officials presented a plan called Track II, which would have provided the final screening inside Vietnam once the boat people had returned there.
A major part of the proposal, officials admit, was to get the last and most resistant of the camp population to agree to return to Vietnam without being forced onto buses and planes. They could then be screened privately, and if they were rejected, as most would be, their drama would be without what officials call "the CNN factor."
But American officials who had youthful experience in Vietnam, like the national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake, also wanted to be sure that boat people with ties to the American war effort, even if too vague for the refugee commissioner's screeners, were allowed entry to America. Working with Congress and refugee advocates like Mr. Rosenblatt, the Administration drew up Track II, and the refugee agency gave its support to the plan.
 
Hanoi Objects To U.S. Plan
But at a meeting in Bangkok in mid-January, Vietnam indicated that it would reject Track II, saying a final screening would be unfair to the 75,000 Vietnamese who had already returned from the camps. Vietnam also objected to setting up an "extraterritorial" screening center staffed by American Immigration officials on its soil when Vietnamese citizens already had a means to apply for emigration to America through a longstanding system called the Orderly Departure Program.
Vietnam also was worried that large numbers of those rejected in the final screening would become violent and remain actively disgruntled.
American officials have continued trying to allay Vietnam's concerns. But one senior official said he doubted that Vietnamese officials would change their minds.
Another Administration official said the idea of final screening in the camps of Southeast Asia before a return to Vietnam, as some refugee advocates now urge, had not even been broached with the countries of first asylum. Those countries made it very clear in the Bangkok meeting, he said, that "no other actions or new initiatives should take place that might interrupt or adversely affect the implementation of repatriation."
After Bangkok, instances of violence in camps in Malaysia and the Philippines followed botched efforts at forcible returns. In the Philippines, especially, there were ugly scenes of violence and beatings as hundreds of Vietnamese tried to block an airport runway where a flight was to take off.
Pressed by the Roman Catholic Church, the Philippine Government promised that there would be no further forcible returns, and that the remaining 2,500 or so boat people there would be allowed to settle in the Philippines.
 
Asian Hosts Want All to Go Home
But that would have broken the Southeast Asian consensus that the remaining people in the camps must return home. Under pressure from its neighbors, the Philippines soon reversed itself.
Senior American officials recognize a moral dilemma that forces well-meaning people to choose between a general good -- putting a finish to the horrible half-life of the camps -- and the possibility of individual pain if some Vietnamese with legitimate ties to the United States are returned.
But if some American officials are torn between historic ties to the Vietnamese and the need to end a refugee program that has in general been a humanitarian success, the Asia director for the United Nations refugee agency, Alexander Casella, has few such doubts.
The refugee program, known as the Comprehensive Plan of Action, was started in 1989 to stop the seemingly endless outflow of Vietnamese boat people with little or no connection to the American war.
Since then, Mr. Casella said, "possibly tens of thousands of lives have been saved from pirates and the sea, the right of every boat person to a hearing was restored, more than 80,000 refugees were recognized and resettled, more than 500,000 refugees were allowed to depart Vietnam legally and 75,000 Vietnamese who were not judged to be refugees could return home under an amnesty program that is among the best monitored in the world."
 
'Everyone Knew End Would Come'
The screening process deemed 80,000 boat people to be legitimate refugees and 115,000 to be only economic migrants, Mr. Casella said. All but 36,000 or so of the second group have gone back to Vietnam. And 19,000 of them, most from northern Vietnam, are still in Hong Kong.
"The basic issue is that we are no longer dealing with refugees," Mr. Casella said in a telephone interview from Geneva. "These are still human beings, but they are not political refugees. And the international community has to come to grips with that fact. But there is a segment, a minority of American opinon, that hasn't. And these poor people have become to some degree a football in the internal American debate."
Even American officials concede that there is no evidence of general discrimination against the Vietnamese who have returned, that the refugee agency will continue to monitor the returnees and that they will still have the right to apply to immigrate to the United States once they return to Vietnam.
"This is an historic moment after a long and very successful program," said Phyllis Oakley, the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration. "After all the piracy, the dead, the push-offs, we created a regime that brought some order and security, took care of the refugees, provided hearings for resettlement. It was an international effort that stopped boat people from leaving, and it represented an imaginative international conclusion to a very difficult problem."
But after 20 years, she said, "It's time to bring this program to an end, so people can get on with their lives and get out of the camps." America has other business with the countries of the region, including Vietnam.
A senior American official said: "Nobody wants to end this program with terrible scenes -- nobody. No one's trying to do evil. Everybody knew the end would come and that certain people would have to go back. But no one wanted to think about that. It's much easier to start refugee programs than to end them."

HEADLINE: At a Cajun Dance Hall, Race No Longer Rules

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

DATELINE: BREAUX BRIDGE, La.

 BODY:
At a club here named La Poussiere on a recent Saturday night, an all-white crowd danced to a rhythmic Cajun two-step. It is a ritual tinged with racial overtones that is found in small clubs throughout the southern part of this state, where a fusion of French and English is the dialect.
But many in the crowd at La Poussiere, which means "the dust," as in the dust raised by dancers, have more than music on their minds. Last month the club's owners settled a Federal discrimination lawsuit by acknowledging that they had barred blacks from the dance hall and agreeing to open it to all. Though blacks living in this region are still unlikely to frequent the club, some regulars here find even the prospect of integrated dances dismaying. 
 "All the coloreds got their own clubs, and the whites got their own clubs," said Archie Brasher, a retired truck driver who has attended many dances at the club with his wife. "And the coloreds don't dance the way the whites do."
In this part of Louisiana, known as Acadiana, the white Cajuns have lived for centuries beside the black Creoles, separated by both economic and social fault lines, including music and dance. Now those longstanding divisions are coming under attack, not so much by local residents as by blacks from other parts of the country who are being drawn here as tourists or to live.
Those visitors and newcomers are finding a land of rich traditions but one whose rules and conventions are not spelled out in guidebooks. While whites look upon clubs that feature Cajun music as their domain, blacks patronize dance halls that offer the more syncopated style of regional music known as zydeco. Bars also generally divide along racial lines. Although white tourists are welcome in many black bars and dance halls, black visitors to some white establishments can encounter hostility or can simply be turned away.
"There are parallel worlds that exist here," said Barry Ancelet, a professor of French and folklore at the University of Southern Louisiana in Lafayette, the region's main city.
Some tourists have found those differences shocking. Two years ago, Zaldwaynaka Scott, a black Federal prosecutor from Chicago, was touring the area with two white colleagues, spending a few days as most visitors do, eating gumbo and crayfish and listening to music. Ms. Scott said that when she approached La Poussiere, which has been in operation for more than 30 years, she was turned away by an employee who said a private party was under way.
Helene Greenwald, one of Ms. Scott's companions, said she confronted the same employee after seeing white patrons pay to enter the club and was told that Ms. Scott had been barred because of race. Ms. Greenwald, a civil rights prosecutor, got in touch with Justice Department officials. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent agents of different races to the club and confirmed the discriminatory practices.
"It's like a land that time forgot," Ms. Scott said.
Under the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, restaurants, hotels, bars and other places of public accommodation cannot discriminate against customers because of race, color, religion or national origin. Business owners who violate the statute must often attend special classes about its requirements and face contempt proceedings if they fail to change their business practices.
A financial settlement in a separate, private lawsuit filed by Ms. Scott and her colleagues against La Poussiere is being negotiated, said Robert B. McDuff, a lawyer in Jackson, Miss., who represents them.
There is little question that race relations in an area where doctors three decades ago had separate waiting areas for whites and blacks have improved over time. Today, blacks eat in restaurants and go to clubs once closed to them, and young people of all races mix far more easily than their elders.
Even at La Poussiere here on the outskirts of Breaux (pronounced Broh) Bridge, whites and blacks have mingled each Wednesday night to play bingo. But a racial barrier was in place by Saturdays when couples gathered to dance.
Several blacks who live in the area said that they preferred to go to zydeco clubs. But Mr. Ancelet, the professor of folklore, said some whites had also strained to exclude blacks from Cajun clubs because integrated dancing and the touching it involves remains a taboo here.
"It is these very tightly closed Saturday night ritual dances that are the problem," said Mr. Ancelet, who is white.
Dancing is only one of the potential racial flash points, however, in an area where the Ku Klux Klan holds daytime rallies and broadcasts a weekly show called "The Klan in Akadiana" on local public access television. During the show, members of the group, some of them masked, sit around a table with weapons exposed and urge viewers to be prepared for possible racial unrest, said Janice Hebert, an assistant Federal prosecutor in Lafayette.
"It's chilling to change the channel and see that in your living room," Ms. Hebert said. "Hooded people sitting around making offensive racial comments."
After a protest last year by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state prosecutors charged some people involved with the show under an obscure statute that bans the public wearing of masks except on occasions like Mardi Gras.
On Feb. 15, the same day the settlement involving La Poussiere was reached, the owner of a bar in Broussard, a town near here, resolved a separate Federal civil rights lawsuit, acknowledging that he had discriminated against blacks. And last year a black tourist was not allowed to participate in Mardi Gras activities in another area town, though officials there insist the incident was not racial. Blacks living in this area said they had learned to navigate around racial problems by simply not patronizing establishments where it is known they are not welcome.
"I'm trained to avoid this problem," said Ethel Peters, a welfare office supervisor. "It's our life style."
But some recent arrivals are bringing different attitudes with them. Last year Debra West, a black teacher, went with two white friends to play pool at the C'est Ma Vie Lounge in Broussard after a parent-faculty volleyball game. Ms. West, who came to this area six years ago from Indiana to attend college, said the bar's owner, Dennis Broussard, told her that he did not serve "colored people."
"I was floored," Ms. West said. "I had not anticipated anything like this happening during my lifetime."
Ms. West sought out Chief Irving Flugence of the Broussard Police Department to complain about the incident. Chief Flugence said it had been well known locally for years that the lounge would not serve blacks, adding that members of the black community in Broussard had never formally complained about it.
"Most of the people around here would not have challenged it," said Chief Flugence, who is black. "They would have just said, 'What the hell do we need this place for?' "
Some officials appeared worried that the recent incidents may hurt the region's efforts to attract tourist dollars to bolster its wilted oil-based economy. Last year, a black tourist visiting Eunice, another town in the area, was barred from taking part in a traditional Mardi Gras festivity known as a courir, or run, in which costumed riders travel on horseback through the countryside.
Dr. Thomas Hillman, a local dentist who helps organize the holiday festivity, said that while local newspapers depicted the incident as racially motivated, the tourist had been prevented from riding because he was not in traditional costume.
Stephen May, publisher of The Times of Acadiana, a weekly newspaper, said efforts to explain away the incident without acknowledging the role of racial prejudice in the area rang hollow to him. "If we had one incident like this in a blue moon we'd call it an aberration," said Mr. May, who is white. "But we've had three incidents like this over a year or so, and we have to face the fact that we have a problem."
In a bid to avoid a repeat of the episode, the town published the rules that participants in its Mardi Gras courir must follow. "It was a misunderstanding, and everyone is welcome here," Mr. Hillman said.
Whether other communities and establishments are ready to adopt the same attitudes even after the recent Federal lawsuits is open to question. At the C'est Ma Vie Lounge, a new manager has converted the bar into a restaurant and has posted a sign welcoming African-Americans, Chief Flugence said.
On a recent Saturday night at La Poussiere, several patrons in the older, all-white crowd said they had little interest in seeing any changes in the racial mix.
Raoul Bainraul, a retired driver, said he was concerned that there might be violence if blacks came to La Poussiere. "I don't know," said Mr. Bainraul, who has attended dances at the club for about 30 years. "I don't know what I'm going to do."
Given regional tastes in music, it is unlikely La Poussiere will attract many area blacks. But Ms. Scott said that was not the issue.
"This place was listed in a guidebook and in a magazine as a place to listen to good music, giving the impression that it was open to all," she said. "It's good for people to know that they don't have to put up with these kind of things."
Chief Flugence said he believed that the recent lawsuits could have a positive effect. He was up for election at the time of the incident at the C'est Ma Vie Lounge and said that while he was warned by some older whites not to push the case, he won the election handily.
"I wish more people down here would do what she did," he said, referring to Ms. West. "It brings harmony to a community."

HEADLINE: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: In the Workplace Musical chairs;
The Company as Family, No More

SERIES: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: In a College Class, Success and Insecurity -- Second of seven articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
It was an icy, pastel day and in the harried midmorning hours the sidewalks were clotted with workers parading into One Chase Manhattan Plaza, a sterile tower of ponderous coolness just off Broadway and hard by Wall Street. On the ground floor of the Chase banking headquarters sprawls a bustling branch that employees reverently know as the Mother Branch.
A bushy-browed man with a brisk manner who works at the Mother Branch looked around uneasily. "We approach that building with trepidation," he said. "It all seems like a quiz show. Who will win? Who will lose? Do you know the missing letters of the puzzle so you can come back to play again next week?" 
 It was not the place he wanted it to be or had known it to be. Within a matter of weeks, the tower will no longer be a headquarters of anything, because the Chase Manhattan Corporation is in the final throes of being swallowed by the Chemical Banking Corporation. The combination will be presided over from Chemical's Park Avenue headquarters and will constitute the country's largest bank, handling $1 trillion a day. And as these things go, it will also mean 12,000 fewer people will have jobs. It has become a numbingly familiar economic drama in recent years, but the script still has shock when it comes to one's own company.
All of this was testing the man's faith. A co-worker sidled past him, a small bouncy woman with glistening cheeks. She gave a cordial wave and called, "Talking to your headhunter?"
"I wish," the man said.
"Well," she said. "Welcome to another deflating day at Downsize Manhattan Bank."
Like many organizations, Chase is a workplace in transition, a company in which old certainties about work no longer apply. The change is carrying a heavy price. A huge insecurity complex has taken root in the bank's employees. The deracinated workers feel forlorn, if not outright hostile. They are baffled about where their loyalties should lie -- and where their employer's loyalty lies. Anxiety stalks the corridors.
To be sure, quite a number of workers also express optimism, an optimism sometimes a front for blinkered denial that they themselves are at risk. Some younger workers think an employer does not owe them much beyond a desk, an ID card and a paycheck. They are ready and willing to play a game with unclear rules. Certain irrepressibly assured individuals of all ages see something hygienic about downsizing, a boldly efficient way to cleanse sloth and make it more certain that the patient will survive -- so long as they remain untouched.
 
Farewell, Mother Chase
 Employees called it Mother Chase. It began in 1799 as the Manhattan Company, not to lend dollars but to supply treated water to a New York swept by yellow fever. With its spare capital, it opened a bank. In 1955, the company merged with Chase National Bank, the bank of the Rockefeller family.
Jobs used to be as secure as civil service posts. But it has been clear for at least a decade that banks are a capsizing industry. They have been buying and merging with each other, first sporadically and now in a veritable stampede, hemorrhaging jobs in the process. Just four years ago, Chemical itself united with Manufacturers Hanover.
The stewards of these banks invoke the need for efficiencies to stave off rival banks as well as retailers, car makers and brokerage houses that offer their own credit cards and banking-type services. They speak of the speed of technological change and the importance of holding the fickle attentions of Wall Street. Rarely do they address the extent to which consolidations result from lost revenues due to inferior management.
Burdened with sluggish performance, Chase has been cutting its payroll since the mid-1980's, from a high of 47,480 in 1986 to the current 33,500. Pressure on the bank intensified when Michael F. Price, a mutual fund manager, became Chase's biggest shareholder last April and admonished Chase to elevate its stock price. Four months later, Chase sold itself to Chemical for $10 billion, a deal expected to be consummated by March 31.
Within three years, management predicts, 100 of the two banks' 480 branches will be shuttered and about 16 percent of 74,000 jobs will cease to exist. Although the new entity will bear the more illustrious Chase name, Chemical is clearly in command.
Indeed, many profoundly depressed Chase employees interpret the deal as a sellout by senior management, the death of the company they cherished. Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase's chief executive, has already been demoted to president of the new entity, which will be led by Walter V. Shipley, Chemical's chief executive.
One joke going around Chase:
Question: What do you call a Chase worker who is downsized?
Answer: Chemical waste.
 
'No More Santa Claus'
With mechanical efficiency, the woman leaned across her desk, gathered up some loan papers and arranged them. She drew a deep breath and slowly let it out.
"It's not the bank I started to work for," she said, insisting on the anonymity that most fretful employees demanded for their insights about their unraveling situations. "They used to call it Mother Chase. They don't call it that anymore. Everything is about insecurity, not making enough."
Throughout the Chase rank and file, there is a vitriol more often associated with the Internal Revenue Service. Its seeds were planted before the merger, during the years task forces were judging the necessity of jobs and co-workers were going out the door.
Like many others, the loan woman did not think the layoffs at Chase would come out fairly. In her words, "It's not only how well have you done your job, but how well you did your political piece."
She was not political. That worried her. "Chase has always been my identity," she said. "Chase is part of my name. But I'm not going to roll over and die because I don't work for the new Chase. Yet if this keeps up, who's going to go to work anymore. Why bother? Why get out of bed?"
Wrestling with their gloom, workers have begun to seize on customs in the most improbable places. One couple, shaken by the Chase tremors, recently concluded that America might have to become like India, where extended families rather than corporations minister to people.
"You feel like you want to work in Japan or Sweden," the loan woman said. "A place where they take care of their people and their crippled. It's like a lost era here. It's like growing up. There's no more Santa Claus."
 
A New Value System
Chase, in the lingo of human resources, no longer wants to be a parent to its employees. It wants to be their best friend.
In step with other large companies, Chase has replaced a paternalistic organization that guaranteed a job and a raise and a pension with one that tries to assist the employee by sharpening skills that will enhance career success, but will not guarantee anything. In the mid-1980's, it simply discontinued perks like employee picnics, as well as a sacrosanct monetary benefit, a profit-sharing plan to which the bank usually contributed 15 percent of a worker's salary. That benefit was replaced by plans that tended to be less lucrative and involved a lower contribution from Chase. And the company began contracting out many jobs -- guards, messengers, check processing.
Not surprisingly, employee discontent escalated, and Chase concluded it had to do something. To a certain extent, it felt the solution lay in a coffee cup.
In early 1993, Chase did something many companies were doing at the time: It engaged everyone in a mass exercise to compose a statement of values and goals. It called the effort Vision Quest. Chase thought this would make employees feel warmer about the company and their role in it. The result was a set of five not unobvious "criteria for winning" -- customer focus, respect for each other, teamwork, quality and professionalism.
The rather nebulous goal decided on as a new leitmotif was to appeal to the bank's three constituencies -- the worker, customer and shareholder -- and to become the employer, provider and investment of choice. "We spread that vision statement all over the world," John Farrell, the head of human resources for both the old and new Chase, said. Managers beseeched their charges: "Live the values" and "Link to the vision."
Mr. Farrell scooped up a styrofoam coffee cup and twirled it in his fingers. The five precepts were inscribed right on the cup. The cups are stacked at coffee stations throughout Chase. The idea was, every time you had coffee you drank the values, too.
The expression "employer of choice" was converted into a spread of programs, including stock ("Vision shares") for every employee, flexible work arrangements and, most notably, Career Vision. Begun in 1994 as the embodiment of the new covenant between employer and employee, Career Vision offers self-assessment tests, career forums, training in skills like teamwork, and a network of workers who will let you trail them to learn about another area. The intention of this approach, much in vogue among corporations, was to shift the burden of managing a career onto the employee. The company's role would be to offer workers tools to expand their skills so they remained valued employees, whether at Chase or elsewhere. Anyone at any level could use the tools, but none were mandatory.
Now there are Career Development Centers, like the one at Two Chase Manhattan Plaza. There are counselors at the ready. There is a makeshift career library, actually just two stout bookcases containing tapes, Chase training manuals and self-help career nostrums: "Swim With the Dolphins," "Knock'em Dead," "Anger at Work," and "Don't Shoot Yourself in the Foot."
All of this, though, means a chameleon-like change for workers, one particularly tough for longtime employees having trouble accepting the justness of it. Chase could not yet say whether it was succeeding.
Clearly, though, this approach is having a hard time. A lot of employees regard it as "happy talk" intended to mask the fact that their jobs are being pillaged.
A goodly number of workers are openly bitter about what they see as a cartoon substitute for security and decent benefits. And with their jobs in doubt, they felt uncomfortable spending days away from their duties trying to psychoanalyze themselves. As one Chase vice president expressed it, "Career Vision is like the Energizer Rabbit clickety-clacking through Bosnia."
 
A Survivor's Cynicism
In effect, he has become a white-collar factory worker. Punch him in. Watch him run when the evening bell sounds.
He is a business analyst at Chase, 10 years with the company. He has been through smaller downsizings in 1987 and 1991. One of his groups was entirely eradicated. The sepulchral air was getting to him.
Even though he will probably keep his job, he has been transformed. One disturbing truism of the new workplace is that downsizing has an insidious effect on survivors, too. "The merger has eliminated for me a certain motivation and all risk-taking, because this boy was a risk-taker," he said. "I went into areas that no one else wanted to go into. I did a lot of confrontation and tried my best to make it constructive and change things. I shoot for the moon and I settle for a little rock. I'm not doing that anymore. We've all become soldiers. We will obey whatever is said and will not challenge. Since the merger, it's just a 9-to-5 job for me."
A manager in another department said the mood had changed in other ways too: "People are a lot less amenable to being absorbed into the work culture. It's pay me, don't play with me. Don't give me an employee picnic. They're acting like independent contractors. And they're more suspicious of management. Employees are less willing to participate in employee surveys, even though they're anonymous. They feel they are coded in some way."
Recently, the business analyst has rooted for his deeper satisfactions elsewhere. His hobby is photography, so he has settled on a quest to establish a local arts center in his New Jersey town. He now sees that as his driving focus.
Burned out of corporate life. He is 43.
 
The Art of the Layoff
There is an actual Merger Office. Not a physical room per se, but a "virtual office" of some 20 people from the two banks. Chemical's chief administrative officer, a man named Joseph Sponholz, presides over its workings. It is this entity that concerns itself with the monumental arcana of stitching together the two huge companies, and for this it relies on a tool it calls MOM.
MOM is the Merger Overview Model, computer software that keeps track of everything that has been done and has to be done. On a minute-by-minute basis, it wrestles with an equation that is supposed to produce $1.5 billion in savings over three years and eliminate 12,000 people.
Mr. Sponholz, as MOM's daddy, gave a sense of the routine, which he likened to preparing for D-Day. First "mapping" teams with representatives from both banks compiled facts about the Chase and Chemical departments that could be used to plan their integration. These were supposed to be stark facts, with no subjective judgments, the whole point being to get Chemical and Chase people doing things together without animosity. Other integration teams, then, did the harder stuff: Managers were put in place, starting from the top and moving down the pyramid, and business integration plans were hashed out. Some of the most important early decisions had to do with technology. Branches, for instance, cannot be merged until it is decided which check-clearing system to use.
In the early going, Chemical seemed to have the winning hand. Deposits systems: Chemical. Statements and ATM's: Chemical. Check processing: Chemical. It was decided that the trading floor would be consolidated at Chemical's headquarters. The final count, however, was 16 groups of Chemical systems, 15 Chase and 10 joint.
Judging the human beings themselves was trickier. Chase executives call eliminated people "saves," an affable-sounding notion resonant of the achievements of relief pitchers. In this case, it denotes savings to the company, thus positioning laid-off people as a corporate asset. Chase hopes to get a third of the saves from layoffs, a third from retirements and a third from attrition.
To weed out the people, managers have received a 26-page booklet entitled "Companywide Guiding Principles For Selection." It stipulates criteria like employee performance, "value to the organization" and "skills important in a merger or rapidly changing environment." It frowns on seeking a balance of people from the two banks "for the sake of balancing alone."
On the delicate matter of diversity, Chase management says it knows that the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sees a red flag if the makeup of a downsized department deviates more than 3 to 4 percent from the original demographics. Hence Chase's wish is that the layoffs not breach that barrier.
Managers readily admit, however, that there is no distilling human emotion from such an imprecise process, and that politics and long-term ties figure in the equation.
The selection booklet offers sample fill-in-the-blank scripts for meetings with "non-selected" employees, like "Today is your last day with the company. Please turn over your files on the ABC project to (name of employee) and spend a few minutes bringing him up to speed." It suggests that the message be terse and unapologetic, and the whole nasty matter be wrapped up within 5 to 10 minutes. Precautions: Be sure to restrict access to confidential files and computer systems; if strong reactions are anticipated, alert security and medical.
Other tips: avoid terminating people on their birthday (alas, managers confessed they have not bothered to research birthdays) and look for signs of anxiety among employees -- i.e., withdrawal, unshaven appearance, weird habits. An employee relations counselor gave an example from another downsizing company: For weeks, a man sat in his office with the lights turned off, clutching a newspaper.
At the moment, most layoffs are still in the indefinable future, though some workers have gotten notice. The severance packages are sweet as these corporate arrangements go: three weeks' salary for each year of service, 26 extra weeks of pay for those who have 25 years with the company, plus a $2,500 grant that can be applied to any sort of training, including ballroom dancing.
Throughout Chase, there is a clear expectation that it will experience carnage heavier than at Chemical. Time will tell. For the first 300 management positions that were named, Chemical said the score was 53 percent Chemical, 47 percent Chase. But among the positions of power, the breakdown is closer to 60-40 in Chemical's favor.
Mr. Sponholz said he was cognizant of the current jitters and swarm of rumors. "We learned last time that employees get very anxious," he said. "So being as open and forthright as we can be is very important. We're doing a lot of communications."
 
Gallows Humor
The news comes right to every employee's desk, in a neat, multipage newsletter entitled Merger Update. They can have it on paper and by e-mail.
The missives appear roughly every other week. Some contain an opening message signed "Walter" for Walter Shipley and "Tom" for Tom Labrecque. There are also town meetings. There is also a 24-hour hot line for merger questions. There are voice-mail messages from senior officers before key announcements. There are seminars. One subject: "What is a merger?"
To many workers, however, the material is saccharine and platitudinous, and it never tells them what they really want to know: Do I have a job?
Employees, listening to the hollow sound of impermanence, have put their own mordantly black spin on things. They refer to the hotline as 1-800-PINK-SLIP. When Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover merged, employees referred to the combination as Comical Hangover. Around the office coolers at Chase and Chemical today, workers are calling the new union Chasical or Chi-Chi's. And, feeling the need to amplify on the incomplete communiques, they have distributed sardonic Merger Updates of their own.
One mock memo, ostensibly from Mr. Labrecque, under "Frequently Asked Questions":
"Why am I facing layoffs, why is my career in ruins, why can't I sleep at night?"
"Your largely insignificant life is being sacrificed to bring into existence the best banking and financial services company in the world, bar none, without par, without equal, post no bills, void where prohibited."
And: "When will I know if I'm being laid off?"
"You, you, you, is that all you care about, you? Please understand that we need to think about 'us,' which probably doesn't include you. It's about time you started to think about the greater whole, buddy. . . . It should be an honor to be laid off."
Advice on how to insure a job at the new Chase: "Take your boss to lunch. Buy him/ her a gift (under the $250 limit, please). Tell him/her over and over again that your only hope, dream and aspiration is to serve for little or no pay and work inhuman hours to make this place the best banking and financial services company in the world, bar none, without par, without equal, post no bills, void where prohibited."
 
Washed Up at 29
Fast-food lunch at the South Street Seaport with a young, emphatically pragmatic woman with a rather short employment history as a second vice president with Chase.
Eating pizza with a glazed look, she gave the crucial shape of her department, similar to the form many Chase departments were taking. The newly named boss was from Chemical. Of the 10 people directly beneath him, 6 are from Chemical, 4 from Chase. Her odds, she reasoned, were not outstanding. "I'm fairly new," she said. "So if they do last-in, first-out I'm dust."
Gripped by lassitude, her productivity had dropped. She felt implacable despair.
Until recently she had two roommates, and she saw their lives as a modern corporate allegory. All three are 29, and all three graduated from college anticipating long and prosperous business careers. In the last few years, all three have been downsized. "Here we are, all having been in the same boat," the woman said. "We've all lost jobs, and we're not even 30, an age when you're supposed to be highly desirable at corporations. I'll never forget the day my roommate came home with her boxes. The same day she was notified, she had to clear out. She was 25."
Everyone in her department, she said, is punchy and touchy. "If you come in five minutes late from lunch," she said, "they start, 'Oh, were you out on an interview?' " Someone recently circulated a fictitious memo outlining the latest Chase early-retirement program. The age requirement had been lowered. Eligibility began at age 35.
She finished her pizza. She wanted to walk. "I think there is going to be a backlash," she said. "Maybe not this year, maybe not next year, but there's going to be one. People aren't going to give 100 percent anymore. I see this with a lot of my friends. I'm not going to be like my dad and work till 10 o'clock at night and never see the kids. What for? So I'll be thanked with a pink slip?
"I think it all has to do with Wall Street. Every day, there's that stock price staring at you. If it's too low, managers say, 'Why let's get rid of some more people and watch it rise.' I wish corporate executives could see all the faces of these people they're downsizing. I wish they could see them shopping for food and putting their kids to bed. All they seem to care about is the bottom line. And therefore all of us are nothing but Social Security numbers."
For months now, a good many Chase employees have been using their work phones to quite openly and shamelessly market themselves to recruiters, searching for escape hatches. A month after her pizza lunch, the young woman herself bailed out of her wobbly encampment to a new job with a smaller company in another state.
 
The View From the Top
On an easel in his office, Tom Labrecque keeps three stick-figure drawings of the sort children accomplish in art class. Actually, they are the dabblings of Chase workers. During the Vision Quest exercise, everyone was asked to sketch the "ideal state" for Chase. People drew Chase castles with merry figures dancing about them, Chase boats sailing to a future celebrated by dollar signs, people crossing the "Vision Quest bridge."
Mr. Labrecque chose three to keep on display as reminders of the dream.
Mr. Labrecque said he appreciated the churning emotions of employees. But he said that plenty of people shared his optimism, and that the uglier part was the unfortunate cost of a seismic transition to what he believed would be a healthier environment. "Since 1985, we've been going through a secular change as great as the Industrial Revolution," he said. "And we don't know how it will turn out. But I think the assumption that it will turn out to be a negative is a wrong bet. And yet that does not take one minute away from the micro-negatives that are going on."
He acknowledged the primal anger about the dimensions and frequency of layoffs, but said that this was an unnatural phase because companies had misguidedly deferred layoffs for so long: "If you've got 15 years worth of backlog in downsizing, the downsizings will be more severe."
And he recognized generational divides: "The people under 35 are much more flexible than the people who are over 45."
He said that workers who find the new world unpalatable would have to leave the company. There was a Chase person thinking of opening a plant store, someone pondering becoming a park ranger, someone contemplating life as a missionary. Mr. Labrecque thought this was splendid. He said he had heard from severed people who were working for charities at half their banking pay. He said they were happy.
Mr. Labrecque is an imposing man who gives off a steely-cool, confident demeanor. Asked if he felt emotion over the forsaken jobs, he fell silent for a moment.
"I wouldn't be human if it didn't affect me," he said. "I've been working these issues for 35 years. I've faced a lot of crises. In the service, I was one of two people finishing the amputation of somebody's hand because no one else was there. Does that affect you? Sure it does. But if you're doing what you think is right for everyone involved, then you're fine. So I'm fine."
 
Bad-News Bearers
One Chase worker related the experience of her downsized friend. The human-resources representative who delivered the fatal decision accepted her corporate ID and told the woman she would have to cancel her free checking account. Then she handed her some paperwork. With a weak smile, she explained that it was an application to start an account of her own with the bank.
"Don't you dare," the woman said, shooting her a death look. She threw the application at the functionary and stomped out.
Not all human-resources people, of course, are so oafish. How, then, do the executioners live with themselves?
A human-resources representative who has given scores of workers the news spoke succinctly: "Thank God for Budweiser."
Another: "It's like a police officer or a fireman. You find a dead body in a building, you can't take it personally."
Another, who had dismissed 500, was more expansive: "At first, it hurt in the stomach in the morning. It may seem callous, but after a while there's a sort of numbing. You go through the steps without getting too emotional. And you think to yourself, 'When will my day come to be on the other side of the desk?' That, in the end, is how you live with it. You realize that everyone's day will come on the other side of the desk."
As for his own future, he was reasonably sanguine. He knew his department would lose people. "I know what needs to be done to survive. Just be quick on your feet. I've laid the groundwork over the last three years in terms of networking. I've made sure I know the right people. I've made sure I was a generalist, not a specialist."
But in the new world, he felt he had another important qualification on his resume: He had eliminated hundreds of people with nary a complication. "We had only one lawsuit in the group I was responsible for," he said. "It was dismissed after one hearing. That record counts in my favor." A good man, in other words, in a corporate storm.
 
War Stories
Many Chase employees have been through rounds of layoffs, but not a big merger, and mergers are entirely different beasts in the trauma they unleash. As Chase people have talked to more and more Chemical people, they have gleaned some sense of how this all goes. Chemical employees, after all, did the drill with Manufacturers Hanover.
To wit:
The head of one group at Chemical notified the employees beneath him that after the reorganization jobs would be eliminated. Right away, a secretary in the group began bringing to work issues of Guns and Ammo magazine. She would point out to her boss particular weapons being advertised and say offhandedly: "What do you think of this? Wouldn't it be a good gun to get?"
A bluff? Serious stuff? A few weeks later, the staffing decisions completed, the secretary was among those let go. A human-resources officer broke the news to her in a cold sweat, with an armed guard outside the door. As it happened, there was no gun or violence. The secretary simply cried.
Elsewhere in Chemical, a group of 15 people was downsized to one. The woman who was left felt incredible guilt. "I cried for two days," she said. "Some of these people were my dear friends. One was very bitter at me, because he had more tenure." For five months, until she was transferred, the woman attempted to tackle the work of the 15. She toiled through 16-hour days. She reported each morning to a work area designed for 15 people. She sat alone, surrounded by 14 empty desks, feeling as if she were in one of those creepy end-of-the-world movies.
The Purge in Legal
The lawyers heard first. The news came Dec. 13, two days after Chemical threw a Christmas party for the Chemical and Chase lawyers. How absurd the party seemed now. There were Chase and Chemical lawyers fawning over the senior managers. Little did they know, it was too late. The decisions had already been made.
Of Chase's 126 lawyers, 38 were told that their Chase careers were over. Chemical dismissed 15 of its 150 lawyers. And so they became the first department to be fully downsized. Or almost fully downsized. It seemed evident to the lawyers that too many managers were kept, doubtlessly to smooth the transition, and that some of them would eventually vanish as well.
Being fired is always the same, but each person takes it in his own way. Some ego-bruised lawyers began to chatter in denial of the truth. Some left at once, banging doors behind them. Many felt that a disproportionate number of women and workers with flexible hours had been eliminated.
It was also noticed that youth seemed to carry weight. A group of eight lawyers was eliminated except for one man, the youngest. "We heard at the beginning that Chemical wanted a staff that would carry it into the 21st century, and that meant young people," one lawyer said. "It's depressing when people look at you askance because of your age -- and your age is 40."
Chase said the statistical reality was this: of the 53 eliminated lawyers, 30 were women and 30 were older than 40. The proportion of women fell by three percentage points. The number of lawyers over 40 actually rose by one percentage point.
To the survivors, the place seemed suddenly cold. People felt remorse for those who hadn't made it: a pregnant woman, a woman on maternity leave, a woman who had just adopted a child, a man with three children.
A biting joke made the rounds: "The good news is you have a job. The bad news is you have a job."
The lawyers found Career Vision and the Chase determination to be the "employer of choice" all so irrelevant now. "Yeah, employer of choice," one said. "Some choice. I assume they're not still holding those career workshops and all, are they? What's the point? Who would go?"
 
Modern Re-education
The Managing Your Career workshop was being held in downtown Brooklyn in the big Metro-Tech building where some 6,000 Chase employees work. Fourteen Chase vice presidents had assembled for a basic offering in the Career Vision program.
The workshop extended over two days, and much of this part dwelled on self-administered psychological tests intended to afford the takers a sense of who they are and what work situations best suited them.
The facilitator gave a spiel: "When we started doing this course, people thought it would be to provide everyone with a new job. That really is not something you should expect. What you should expect is to learn something about yourself so you can go out there and do the right thing for yourself."
There was some rustling and murmuring in the room.
With a crisp cheerfulness, she went on to state that one of the objectives was to develop strategies for anticipating and adapting to change. "Nothing could be more relevant right now," she said. "Change is it. We're knee-deep in it."
There was more rustling.
The facilitator suggested a little experiment. "Take a piece of paper and sign your name," she said.
When everyone had finished, she asked, "How was that?"
"Easy," someone said.
"Comfortable," replied another student.
"Like duck soup, like falling off a log," the facilitator said. "O.K., now put the pen in your other hand and sign your name."
Everyone struggled.
"How did that feel?" the facilitator asked.
"Terrible," a woman said.
"Imagine if you had to write with your left hand in your job all day," she said.
"I think I would type," someone said.
The facilitator explained that the exercise was intended as a metaphor for those who had not managed their career well enough so that they did not fit their job. But it could have been a metaphor for the work environment at Chase. The instability and pervasive paranoia made them feel as if they were writing with the wrong hand.
Now people went over their scores on a test based on the typology of Carl Jung that intends to identify a person's style. The facilitator went around the room. People spoke of being I's (introverts) and E's (extroverts). They were F's (feeling people) and T's (thinking people). They were also to rate their jobs to see if they possessed extroverted jobs or feeling jobs or whatever, then determine if they matched.
One woman said: "I took the test several times and came out an F. That's the reason I kept taking it, because at work I definitely operate as a T."
The facilitator said, "How do you feel about that?"
Watch Your Back
One way employees at Chase have tried to hedge their bets is to establish their own informal networks through the bank and the larger world of work. They keep lists of people with whom they try to keep in touch.
Networks, though, have been buckling under the strain. People are getting tired of fielding calls from colleagues in pursuit of work. Moreover, with companies constantly downsizing, it is colleague against colleague in a Darwinian struggle. The person at the next desk may be your co-worker and teammate, but he is also your competitor if bodies must go in your department.
A middle-aged man with wavy hair and a creased face told of how for years he has taken lunch practically every other day with a fellow worker in his department. They relished gossiping about the office, denigrating their boss and complaining about the woeful states of the Jets and Giants.
These lunches continued after the Chemical merger was announced, spiced now by hectoring. ("Heard from benefits lately?" "Checking out the trailer park?" "Get the 5-year-old a job yet?") But then the man said he began to hear disturbing speculation. His department was likely to incur severe hits. He began to think of himself and his colleagues as the "walking dead."
He confided these developments to his wife. She told him to watch his back. The next morning, he noticed his friend in their boss's office, chuckling about something. His first thought was that he was politicking. Could it be that he was bad-mouthing him? He worked himself into a nervous lather.
Later, he pleaded other commitments when the subject of lunch came up. The pair ate once a week for a while, and the conversations were more strained. Then they stopped having lunch altogether. The friend did not protest. Apparently, he had drawn similar conclusions.
Now they were both watching their backs.
 
The New Company Man
Is there a modern corporate employee, someone who accepts the new ways? What does he look like? How does he sound?
There are many paths into banking. Matt Hoffman came by piano.
He is 35, grew up in Indiana, went to college in upstate New York to study music. For two years, he was a pianist in New York, doing gigs, playing at a restaurant, accompanying an elderly and abusive man who wanted to keep his voice in shape.
The pace was too much. He decided to enter the business world. He began as a teller at a Westchester bank. He was always a self-starter. On his lunch breaks, he didn't loiter with other tellers. He went and interrogated the mortgage people and the loan people, learning new things, and this led to swift promotions. He moved to another bank as a business development officer and, five years ago, to Chase. He is a cluster manager overseeing several branches in Westchester.
He never sought security in corporate work, and thus the merger doesn't especially throw him. He has embraced Chase's career assistance and thinks he has sharpened his abilities, become a resilient worker. His background has given him an emphatically 90's outlook on work. "I feel my job is to do the best that I possibly can, but my whole area could look totally different in five years through no fault of Chase. I can't imagine any corporate entity owes anyone a career."
By virtue of his background, Matt Hoffman is perhaps the archetypal corporate man of the future. His introduction to the world of work was a terrain where his paycheck depended on how well he sold himself each day. Nothing was guaranteed past tomorrow. No one could assure him that he would be taken care of in declining years.
He has imported that mindset into banking and, currently, into Chase, and he has found the fit to be all too perfect. For an odd reality of the new work environment is that the turbulent world of the freelance classical pianist is more like than unlike the world of the corporate employee. He, too, has to sell himself every day, and he, too, doesn't know if the gig will be there tomorrow.
There are indeed other modern employees, usually young, who have seen this future and in some way accepted it for what it is.
Look at Richard Fischer, a Chase customer representative in Bardonia, N.Y. He goes from work to school, pursuing his M.B.A. with Chase paying the bills. He sincerely feels the merger will offer him more. "I feel I have a lot to offer Chase," he said. "If it came down to it, I'm not afraid of rolling up my sleeves and being a teller again." He was a business administration major in college, and learned about the future. "I remember we did a case study of banking," he said. "It pointed out that before you turn 30, you change jobs six times." He is 24.
A fair number of feisty, high-octane people at Chase relish the merger. They assume (not necessarily correctly) that they will retain their jobs and their roles will swell in importance. As one finance person put it: "There are a lot of people in their 20's who are saying to those who are unhappy, 'Don't screw up my opportunity to be somebody and make a lot of money in this bank.' There's a generational animosity."
Throughout the bank, people are scrambling to position themselves. Donald Skelton, a safe deposit manager, is planning to go to college for the first time at night this summer, at the age of 46 -- assuming he is still employed. It was a rude awakening to him that after 25 years at Chase he makes less money than his daughter, who just graduated and began a computer programming job.
The crucial question is how far can you push these resilient people before they, too, break? How hard can you work them? How many times can they bounce from company to company and still smile?
 
The Last Hope
The end of the line is actually any of three floors -- the 5th, 11th and 12th -- at 640 Fifth Avenue, near Rockefeller Center. These belong to the New York office of Right Associates, the nationwide outplacement firm. It is something of a human recycling bin, where downsized Chase workers take up residence as they begin what Right counselors call their "marketing campaign."
Right Associates offers elaborate services -- career counseling, networking sessions, one's own office, secretarial assistance -- at a cost to Chase of 16 to 20 percent of the employee's compensation. Unemployment may appear to be the great leveler, but there are hierarchies even among the jobless. The better your former job, the more luxury accorded you while you are without it.
With no outplacement operation of its own, Chase sends everyone -- from tellers to what are known as the K.E.'s, or key executives -- to Right. What they get there depends on rank. The lowest levels merit counseling and a cubicle for three months. The K.E.'s get a private office on a separate floor and more elaborate nurturing for a year. Everyone, however, earns secretarial help. For the first time in their career, laid-off people like tellers have a desk and phone of their own, plus an underling to type letters.
Andrea Eisenberg, the account manager for eliminated Chase workers, said she had gleaned certain traits about these people. They have strong networks. They are intelligent. And, despite the recurrent dire news about the shrinking banking world, almost to the person they wish to remain in banking.
Another characteristic, she said, is that they are in shock. "Even though there's all this going on," she said, "they're surprised it happened to them."
Looking in on the cubicles on a chill, gray day around Christmas, Nancy Geffner, the head of the office, remarked: "This time of year, we have to watch people carefully. No job, other people happy -- you know."
By now, one middle-aged woman had come close to spending as many days at Right Associates as she had at Chase. She was downsized early last year.
She had passed through mourning and was well into acceptance. "If someone says, 'Gee, Chase was wonderful for setting up all those employee programs,' that gets me going," she said. "But after the initial detoxification period, you get over the anger. I wouldn't recommend Chase to anyone, but I'm over the anger."
She cleared her throat. "I've changed," she said. "I used to think that having a stable job reflected on your moral integrity and your being a solid human being. Now when I see people doing flaky things to make money -- say, opening a muffin stand -- I say, 'Go for it.' We were talking about this in one of our groups here, of thinking outside the box. Someone said, 'Hey, there is no box.' "
She mentioned that she keeps a collection of the Chase coffee cups inscribed with the Chase values in her kitchen as some sort of comical reminder of the day that catapulted her into outplacement. "I look at the cups and laugh," she said. "They're funny now."
Does she use them?
"Oh, no," she said. "I never drink out of them. They probably leak."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Maddux Battles Inflation One Batter at a Time

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
Ken Griffey Jr. or Frank Thomas could hit 62 home runs this year, and the number would not be as mind-boggling as one Greg Maddux has achieved the past four seasons. In an era of e.r.a. inflation, when earned run averages are soaring, Maddux has permitted 1.98 earned runs per nine innings compared with 4.00 for other National League pitchers.
Maddux has not only been twice as good as his peers, but has also been remarkably better than the rest of the best. Among pitchers who would have qualified for the e.r.a. title in either league each of the past four seasons, the lowest e.r.a.'s after Maddux's are 3.12 for Kevin Appier, 3.17 each for Randy Johnson and David Cone and 3.21 for Tom Glavine, an Atlanta Braves teammate whose admiration for Maddux is boundless. 
 How does Maddux do it? What places him in a niche all his own, far below the madding crowd?
Glavine, who shares clubhouse space with Maddux, said he is running out of answers to the question. But among the reasons he and other Atlanta Braves pitchers provided, this one was the most intriguing.
"He has a tremendous ability to notice things that are going on during the course of the game," Glavine said. "He'll notice a guy moving up half an inch in the box on him, or he can watch a guy taking warm-up swings on deck and have an idea what he thinks that guy's going to look for based on his warm-up swings."
Little wonder that Maddux is so far ahead of other pitchers. Many of them aren't even sure what batters are looking for when they're swinging in the batter's box. But the winner of four consecutive Cy Young awards has many other telltale attributes as well.
"I guess it was Warren Spahn who said the art of pitching is upsetting the hitters' timing," Glavine said. "Greg does that as well as anybody. He's the epitome of throwing off a hitter's timing. That's what you need to do, and that's what he does."
Mark Wohlers, the Braves' matured young closer, who was needed to save only 4 of Maddux's 19 victories last season, said he believes his celebrated teammate's success begins with his game plan.
"He'll map out a game plan with the catcher a day or two before he pitches and he'll stick to it," Wohlers related. "Some guys, if things aren't going well right away, will try to adjust maybe too quickly, maybe go away from their strengths. He realizes what his strengths are and sticks with them."
Expanding on that theme, Glavine said Maddux resists the urge to try to do too much in a particular situation.
"When you have the bases loaded or second and third and two out," Glavine said, "some guys try to turn it up a notch and try to be a little more perfect or throw better pitches than you may be capable of throwing. That's a natural tendency sometimes. But he doesn't seem to do that. It doesn't matter what the situation is. He never tries to do more than he's capable of doing. He always stays within himself, and he stays effective that way."
Maddux, who last season became the first major league pitcher since Walter Johnson in 1918 and 1919 to have a sub-1.70 e.r.a. in successive seasons, does not overpower hitters. His fastball generally travels from 83 to 86 miles an hour, an eminently hittable speed. But try hitting it.
"He can't just sit there and pump fastball after fastball and not worry about changing speeds or locations," Glavine said. "If he did that, he'd get killed. He's gotten the absolute most out of his ability to locate the ball and change speeds. Guys get up there and maybe get comfortable because he's not throwing hard. They may be thinking he's going to give me a fastball and I'll just sit on that fastball; I can hit the fastball.
"But instead, maybe he throws a changeup or curve or slider and they never see the fastball they're looking for. Their approach might be right, but Greg might not pitch them that way and then they end up getting themselves out. Then they're really frustrated. I've seen that happen a lot. Once he gets ahead of you, you're pretty much out. Guys don't hit very well against him when they're behind in the count."
Using a fastball, slider, changeup and, with increasing frequency, a curveball, Maddux throws each pitch at different speeds, with any count and to any spot he desires, inside corner, outside corner, up, down. "I'm not sure I've seen him throw the ball down the middle of the plate," Wohlers said. And he masks the type of pitch he throws by not varying his delivery in any way.
"He throws everything for strikes any time in the count," the reliever said, then illustrated that statement with an example from a game in San Francisco a couple of years ago. The Giants, losing to the Braves, 1-0, had the bases loaded with two out and Dave Martinez was the batter.
"I was thinking he might throw a change," Wohlers said, "but I don't think he would. Sure enough he did and he struck him out. He's that confident in all his pitches."
Wohlers added: "I'm not sure if anyone's perfect, but he's darn close when it comes to pitching."

HEADLINE: SPECIAL PLEADERS: A periodic look at lobbying.;
Lawyers and Lobbyists Help Guide Effort By Republicans to Speed Drug Approvals

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Within days after the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, some gay rights groups saw an opportunity to win speedier access to new, unapproved treatments for AIDS by rewriting Federal drug laws. They knew just whom to call for help in drafting the legislation: Peter Barton Hutt, a Washington lawyer who is one of the nation's leading experts on food and drug laws.
A few months later, drug company executives decided that they also wanted major changes in the laws governing the work of the Food and Drug Administration. Their trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, asked Mr. Hutt to help draft legislation for Congress. 
 About the same time, the Grocery Manufacturers of America started to write legislation that would speed up Food and Drug Administration approval of food additives, especially substitutes for fat and sugar. They also sought guidance from Mr. Hutt, a former chief counsel for the F.D.A.
When Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who is the chairwoman of the Senate committee overseeing the issue, began rewriting the food and drug laws, she had no shortage of advice from these regulated industries and patient advocates. Yet her staff also consulted Mr. Hutt.
In shaping this major legislative initiative, which could mean speeding up approval for new, potentially lifesaving drugs and food additives, Mr. Hutt and specialists like him have come to epitomize the power of Washington lawyers and lobbyists. Their influence is so ubiquitous that the professionals charged with writing the legislation call them for advice, knowing that they are paid handsomely to steer the legislation in favor of their corporate clients.
Republicans on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the House Commerce Committee, joined by some Democrats, have concluded that Congress must revise the F.D.A. laws to give patients swifter access to new drugs and devices.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said the growth of medical knowledge was outstripping the Government's ability to regulate it. "We have a smokestack regulatory framework in an era of cyberspace knowledge," she said.
But the F.D.A. Commissioner, David A. Kessler, said many of the proposals in Mrs. Kassebaum's bill would undermine consumer protection.
Jane B. Williams, a health policy adviser for Mrs. Kassebaum's panel, said of Mr. Hutt: "I talk to him all the time. He's extremely helpful. I've always felt like I could talk to him not as a person who was representing a particular industry, but as an expert in the field." Ms. Williams, a former director of Congressional affairs at the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, which represents makers of medical devices, said that when she started working for Mrs. Kassebaum in 1993, "Peter was kind enough to come in and give me a sort of introductory course, like F.D.A. 101."
Now, she said, the Senator makes decisions about the substance of F.D.A. legislation, and the bill is drafted by Senate staff lawyers. But Ms. Williams said she sometimes asked Mr. Hutt to review proposals and "tell me if I've done anything here that is really dumb."
Mr. Hutt, 61, a partner at Covington & Burling, a Washington law firm with decades of experience advising the nation's biggest food and drug companies, describes himself as merely "a technical scribe," but that understates his role. People who have worked with Mr. Hutt say that even as he translated his clients' policies into legislative language, he helped define and shape those policies.
Mr. Hutt is not the only one influencing this legislation. Few bills have generated such intense lobbying. Patrick S. Korten, deputy vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said: "If you're a drug lawyer in Washington and have not had some input into this bill, you should consider some other line of work. At least 60 or 70 lawyers have dipped a pinkie finger into it."
Jeffrey I. Nedelman, vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, said: "The House and Senate committee staff asked us for ideas. They asked us to suggest specific legislative language."
The products regulated by the F.D.A. account for 25 percent of the nation's economic output. And while lobbyists do not get everything they want, their influence is pervasive.
They have so penetrated the legislative process that before the Senate committee held hearings on F.D.A. legislation last month, the lobbyists obtained copies of confidential briefing papers prepared for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, by members of his staff. The papers described the Democrats' strategy and catalogued the arguments they would make against the Kassebaum bill.
The Republican consensus that the F.D.A. laws must be revised is shaped by several factors: the development of products that promise medical breakthroughs, the growth of the biotechnology industry and the emergence of patient-advocacy groups as an influential force in the debate over health policy.
Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican who is a heart surgeon, said, "In this increasingly complex scientific world, where the half-life of knowledge is growing shorter and shorter every day, it's going to be impossible for the F.D.A. to maintain in-house the full range of expertise and experience that will be needed."
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, says the average time required for the approval of new drugs has fallen in the last decade, to 19 months from 33 months. But F.D.A. officials acknowledge that they have not had similar success in speeding the approval of devices and food additives.
The agency has accelerated the process of reviewing AIDS drugs, but patients with other life-threatening conditions contend that those drugs receive preferential treatment.
Ellen L. Stovall, executive director of one such patient group, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, said: "The accelerated approval process has not had nearly as significant an impact on cancer. People who are sick and dying should not have to depend on political pressure and favoritism to get expedited approval of medications."
Drug companies do not always get a warm reception in Congress. Some lawmakers agree with President Clinton, who accused the companies of "price gouging" in 1992 and 1993. The companies are much more effective when they present their arguments in tandem with patients.
Drug companies contribute substantial sums of money to patient-advocacy groups, but those groups insist that they are not unduly influenced by the money. Mrs. Stovall said her group received nearly one-third of its annual income of $730,000 from drug and biotechnology companies that make anticancer drugs. "We couldn't exist without that kind of funding," she said.
Other patients' groups express concern about potential conflicts of interest. Derek Link, a spokesman for Gay Men's Health Crisis, which provides social services to people with AIDS in New York City, said: "If you take money from drug companies, you don't necessarily become a puppet of the industry, but it does influence your decision-making process. F.D.A. reform is a big issue in this Congress because the drug industry put it on the agenda."
Patients are so effective as lobbyists that some lobbying firms have hired patients as full-time employees. One firm, Medical and Research Communications, also known as Marc Associates, hired a 37-year-old man with hemophilia, Val D. Bias, to help lobby on legislation favored by the National Hemophilia Foundation.
Mr. Bias said the firm "recruited me because I have hemophilia and would be a good spokesman." Randolph B. Fenninger, executive vice president of Marc Associates, said: "Val knows the issues in a way that you and I will never understand. He walks the walk and talks the talk."
Samuel D. Turner, a lawyer for the Coalition for Cancer Survivorship and other patients' groups, said: "There has been a real sea change in the last five years in the attitude of companies. They realize that it's important to build alliances with patient groups, to enhance their image and to be more effective politically."
Mrs. Kassebaum's bill would set strict deadlines for the F.D.A. to act on new drug applications and would expand access to experimental drugs and devices for people with life-threatening diseases. Companies could disseminate preliminary data suggesting that a drug approved for one purpose might have other beneficial uses that had not been approved by the F.D.A. or verified in clinical trials. If the F.D.A. failed to rule promptly on new drugs cleared for sale in Europe, the products could be automatically approved for sale in the United States. If the agency repeatedly failed to meet statutory deadlines, it would have to sign contracts with outside experts to perform reviews.

HEADLINE: Serbian Chief Moves to Suppress Opposition at Home

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, March 3

 BODY:
In the three months since signing the Dayton peace accords, President Slobodan Milosevic has been promoting himself internationally as a guarantor of peace in the Balkans. But inside Serbia, he has been working to suppress political opposition and reassert state control of the economy, diplomats and economists here say.
Expectations that Mr. Milosevic, who has kept the red star on the spire of his palace, might encourage market reforms and democratization as have former Communists elsewhere in Central Europe have not materialized, they say. 
 In moves intended to cement his grip on power, his Government has stepped up harassment of the opposition, nationalized a private television station and banned the American-financed Soros Foundation, which was subsidizing independent newspapers.
New laws discourage privatization and recent efforts by the respected central bank governor, Dragoslav Avramovic, to end Serbia's big state monopolies and liberalize trade were scoffed at by the Government.
Indeed, at his Socialist Party convention this weekend, where nearly 2,000 loyal delegates listened to adulatory oratory and re-elected him party chairman nearly unanimously, Mr. Milosevic confirmed a course that looks like a retreat to the country's Communist past. In one of the most startling throwbacks, the Cuban delegation received the loudest applause of the visiting dignitaries.
No one mentioned Mr. Milosevic's dream of a greater Serbia that fueled the four-year Balkan war and instead of a grander Serbia yielded economic ruin at home, international isolation and hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Dragan Mrdarevic, a convention delegate from southern Serbia, where the economy was badly hit by economic sanctions during the war, echoed the upbeat mood, saying, "To survive the sanctions was a victory in itself."
Ivan Torav, a columnist for the opposition daily Nasa Borba, wrote on Saturday that the President had managed to manipulate public opinion so that he emerged as the "winner despite all the defeats."
At the convention on Saturday, Mr. Milosevic was hailed in an extravagant video on the auditorium screen that showed a utopian Serbia in the year 2000, replete with high-speed trains, splendid new cities and computerized industry.
Outside, on the streets of Belgrade, the reality was starkly different.
The Government is so broke that it has been unable to pay pensioners for the last two months. The lifting of international sanctions in December has yet to spur industrial production. Unemployment remains at about 50 percent and is likely to increase as money-losing factories shut down.
The economic picture is bleak for a number of reasons, economists said.
First, under the Dayton accord, Serbia cannot qualify for the international financing it needs until it demonstrates full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Also, like the rest of Central Europe, Serbia must make serious steps toward privatization.
In remarks to the party convention, Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic revealed the Government's apparently confused notion of a market economy.
"Our first efforts will be a speedy build-up of a market economy," he said. "In the functioning of a modern market economy, the state has an unavoidable and important role."
Economists said one reason for the Prime Minister's enthusiasm for state monopolies was that he is general manager of Progres, Serbia's largest state-run export company and the leading importer of Russian natural gas. The prospects of a market economy were further diminished at the convention, they said, by Mr. Milosevic's selection of a first deputy for the party: Nikola Sainovic, who was Prime Minister during the four-digit inflation of 1992.
Many Western businesses, including major auto, telecommunications and pharmaceutical companies, have sent executives to Belgrade in the last few months eager to do deals now that sanctions have been lifted. But a Western diplomat noted that "they are turning and running."
A new law that allows the Government to reimpose state control over private companies is one of many discouraging factors, the diplomat said.
An American pharmaceuticals executive, on her third and probably last visit, said local hospitals had great need for her company's products but no money or financing to pay for them.
Thanks largely to his almost total control of the media in Serbia, diplomats estimate that Mr. Milosevic holds an approval rating of about 50 percent.
Since signing the Dayton agreement, he has moved methodically to strengthen his hold. On the one hand, Socialist Party leaders have been ordered to recruit new members; on the other, provincial leaders of opposition parties were mobilized into the army.
At the party gathering, delegates spoke of the need for "nonparty pluralism," a phrase favored by the President's powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, who is vehemently critical of the opposition.
Her party, the Yugoslav United Left, which has become an ardent admirer of China, has won growing influence in the Socialist Party and is described as the fount of most of the Socialists' ideas.
In December, the Government outlawed demonstrations in the center of Belgrade, a pre-emptive move to stop a demonstration planned for this Saturday on the fifth anniversary of a violent confrontation between the army and students over the state control of the news media.
"Will Milosevic turn Freedom Square into Tiananmen Square?" asked Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, which is organizing the demonstration. "They are saying, 'You can have your rally but outside Belgrade.' "
The abrupt nationalization in January of the private television station Studio B removed the main outlet for news about the opposition parties, Mr. Draskovic said. "After Dayton, he completely closed state TV to the opposition parties and now all the mass media are in the hand of the Socialist Party."
Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Soros Foundation, which sponsors several provincial newspapers as well as financing imports of medicine, was illegally registered.
The major opposition newspaper, Nasa Borba, remains under pressure because of Government controls over the newsprint market. The paper publishes articles from Western agencies and newspapers but has a circulation of only 20,000, mostly in central Belgrade.
Nasa Borba's former editor, Gordana Logar, said she was disheartened but not surprised by Mr. Milosevic's attempts to strangle the independent media and by his emphasis on a neo-Communist ideology in the Socialist Party.
Such moves, she said, confirmed that Mr. Milosevic never was the fervent nationalist he professed to be. "He is in the middle of implementing his dreams of being in power in an authoritarian and socialist society," she said.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
A Runner Bears Ethiopia's Fragile Hopes

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
As the sun rose over the lip of the National Stadium, and wood smoke wrapped the high-rises and tin-roofed shanties of the capital in a gauzy cocoon, the world's greatest distance runner arrived for his morning workout. In a taxi.
It's not that Haile Gebrselassie, at age 23, could not afford his own transportation. He is the holder of five world records, and a prohibitive favorite to win gold medals at 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He will earn about $500,000 this year, an amount unfathomable to most residents of Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries on the world's poorest continent. 
 His Mercedes-Benz is parked for safekeeping in the showroom of a local dealership. Another Mercedes has just cleared customs. They are prizes from his racing victories. But Gebrselassie will not drive either luxury car. Not now. He doesn't even have a driver's license. When he uses a car, his brother ferries him in an aging Peugeot.
"Don't laugh at this, but if I start with good cars and good houses, I'm afraid I will lose my winning," Gebrselassie said. "If I have a good car, maybe the car becomes more important than my running."
Still vulnerable to devastating cycles of drought and famine, Ethiopia's most reliable and remarkable harvests have been distance runners such as Gebrselassie, who did not lose a single race in 1995 and has set two indoor world records in recent weeks.
The East African running boom, which spread like a great herd migration to Kenya and beyond, was launched by Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila, who won the 1960 Olympic marathon in Rome, running barefoot and collecting Africa's first gold medal.
Forty days after an appendectomy, Bikila repeated his marathon victory at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Wearing shoes this time over the 26.2-mile course, he broke the world record and still had enough energy to perform a calisthenics routine.
Mamo Wolde won the 1968 Olympic marathon for Ethiopia, Miruts Yifter took the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the 1980 Moscow Games and Belayneh Dinsamo set the current world record for the marathon in 2 hours 6 minutes 50 seconds in 1988 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Derartu Tulu became the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal when she took the 10,000-meter race at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.
Gebrselassie lives in a modest house on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, and he routinely goes to bed by 9 P.M., awakening by 5:30 or 6 A.M. Even visits with his girlfriend have been limited this Olympic year, he said, lest "my big heart is for her, not my job." This tenacious dedication has elevated Gebrselassie into a compelling national hero, one who does not flaunt his wealth and who maintains an affecting kinship with his fellow Ethiopians, spiritually if not financially.
"You must do as your people do," he said. "If my people are poor, I must be poor. People ask me, 'Why don't you find a personal coach or a private car?' I can't. Then I won't be part of my people."
As an 8-year-old, Gebrselassie listened on a transistor radio to Yifter's accomplishments, and he ran out among the sheep and cattle on his father's farm in the southern highlands, pretending that he, too, was a famous runner.
Fifteen years later, he can emulate Yifter's accomplishments in Atlanta. He stands only 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 130 pounds, but Gebrselassie is perhaps the most visible symbol of achievement in a country that struggles for direction. Five years after rebels overturned the Marxist dictatorship of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Gebrselassie is a galvanizing figure in a nation riven by 80 ethnic groups and a dozen languages.
Nine months after Ethiopia's first elections, ethnic tensions are raw and old wounds from the Mengistu regime are still open. Mamo Wolde, the 1968 Olympic marathon champion, is in jail, linked to a killing as a member of Mengistu's revolutionary guard, but not charged with a crime. Gebrselassie's older brother, Tekeye, once a marathoner, has sought asylum in the Netherlands for political and economic reasons.
But Haile has remained loyal to his frayed country and, in return, Ethiopians have invested in him this obligation: to demonstrate measurable success for a nation known most acutely for the failures of famine, civil war and dictatorship.
"Before Abebe Bikila, we were not known at all," said Wolde Meskel Kostre, Ethiopia's Olympic track coach. "He brought Ethiopia to the world. Then we had famine, and the Government killing people. Now, the first question I get is, 'How can you run, you have no food in your country?' If Haile wins, then the whole world will see Ethiopia again. They might help us."
It is a heavy weight to carry on one pair of narrow shoulders.
"If Haile loses, people will say, 'Oh, no, Ethiopia has lost everything,' " Meskel said.
Recently, as he led visitors through the capital's bustling market, Gebrselassie reluctantly agreed to be photographed in the streets crowded with vendors and beggars and donkeys carrying heavy loads of hay. Someone who thought he was exploiting this desperate commerce for publicity shouted in Amharic: "Why do you show this part of Ethiopia? Just go to Atlanta and run."
He had carefully guarded against displays of self-importance, and this insult wounded him visibly. Several hours later, the normally ebullient Gebrselassie seemed withdrawn and distracted.
"I am still thinking about this morning," he said.
This humility exists, however, alongside a keenly developed sense of destiny and fulfillment rarely evident in a tattered country where 95 percent of the residents rely on subsistence farming. Since he was a boy, Gebrselassie has kept a world atlas at his home, memorizing the names and places of countries and capitals, eager to travel and be recognized for his prodigious talent.
Where other East African runners remain as faceless in the West as they are successful, Gebrselassie has separated himself with a certain spirit and charisma, and a smile as wide as most of the victory margins in his races. He has taken courses to improve his English, and in whatever language, he has not been afraid to speak his mind.
Last year, bungling by the track federation left the Ethiopian team stranded overnight in the Athens airport en route to the world cross-country championships in Durham, England. First, Gebrselassie helped provide hotel rooms for the 32-athlete contingent. After the championships, he returned home and led a protest through the streets of Addis Ababa to the Prime Minister's office. A number of federation officials were replaced.
If anyone seems poised for the challenge of fulfilling his country's Olympic expectations, it is Gebrselassie. Haile means "my energy" in the Amharic language, he said.
"Ethiopia gets its energy from Haile Gebrselassie," he said.
One hundred miles southeast of Addis Ababa, the geometric hillside fields of the Arsi region bear a hazy resemblance to Switzerland, even in the dry season. Situated on a plateau around 9,000 feet, Arsi is an area fertile with grains like barley, wheat and corn, and with runners like Gebrselassie and Tulu.
Horse-drawn carts replace the mini-bus taxis of the capital, stucco buildings of the villages yield to conical huts of the countryside and gravestones need not be encumbered by metal cages to prevent theft or defacement.
Women and children herd cattle and goats along the two-lane ribbon of road and donkeys carry loads of grain and firewood. Eucalyptus trees and cactus sprout from the rolling, dun-colored landscape. Mounds of teff -- the millet from which the spongy, national bread called injera is made -- squat in the harvested fields like giant corn muffins.
Just before the village of Assela, a four-wheel-drive vehicle leaves the road and bounces along for half a mile through the wheat stubble, coming upon the remains of a thatched-roof hut. This is what is left of where Gebrselassie lived with nine brothers and sisters until he was a teen-ager. The surviving hut served as the family kitchen. The living quarters, made of timber walls packed with mud, are gone, as are the family members, dispersed to Addis or nearby Assela.
As children, Gebrselassie and his brothers tended the crops with oxen and wooden plows and walked up to four miles to haul drinking water from wells. His mother died during childbirth when he was 10, and the children were raised by an older sister. The family farm was larger than many in the country, but the Mengistu regime nationalized the land, slicing away part of the family plot as if it were a birthday cake.
Lacking electricity and, thus, television, Gebrselassie followed sports through a battery-powered transistor radio. When he learned of Yifter's double victory at the 1980 Moscow Games, he said, it left him intoxicated with his Olympic dreams.
"I wanted to be famous," he said. "I wanted people to talk about me."
He ran or walked six miles to school, and to this day, his coach said he can see a slight hitch in his form, a crook in his left arm, which developed from Gebrselassie's carrying his books clutched tightly to his side.
The family could afford one pair of racing shoes, Haile said, and he shared them with his older brother, Tekeye, and a younger sister, Yeshi. Mostly, like other kids, they ran barefoot. But their father, Gebrselassie Bekele, discouraged the sport, believing that it had no practical use for his children, whom he wanted to become doctors, teachers, clerks, anything but runners.
"Don't listen to the radio, go out and look for a job," Haile's father told him, but the son did not listen.
He became a national schoolboy champion at 3,000 meters and, by age 20, he won the 1992 world junior championships at 5,000 and 10,000 meters. Josephat Machuka, a Kenyan challenger, became so frustrated when he was passed near the end of the 10,000-meter race, he slugged Gebrselassie in the back of the head.
"I was so happy, I could almost have died," Gebrselassie's father said of his son's victories. "I stopped telling him about the uselessness of running."
He has set five world records in the last nine months -- 8:07.46 for two miles, 26:43.53 for 10,000 meters, 12:44.39 for 5,000 meters, 13:10.98 for the indoor 5,000 and 7:30.72 for the indoor 3,000 -- running with effortless grace, his head perfectly still, striding like a sprinter on the balls of his feet, his barrel chest jutted forward as if in anticipation of breaking the tape at the finish.
The stunning 12:44.39 that Gebrselassie ran last Aug. 16 in Zurich lopped nearly 11 seconds off the previous 5,000-meter record. He seemed to be carried along on some invisible current as he ran the equivalent of three 4:05 miles, covering the final four laps of the 12 1/2-lap race in a searing 4:00.4.
No one begrudged Gebrselassie two victory laps; many considered this to be track's greatest distance performance, given the 5,000's demands on speed and endurance.
"He ran through a mental barrier, almost like the four-minute mile," said Sydney Maree, the American record holder at 3,000 meters.
Bob Kennedy, America's top 5,000-meter runner, came within a second of his personal best at 13:03.37 in Zurich, but finished 19 seconds back in fourth place.
"Haile looks like he's out there for a fun run," Kennedy said.
Days earlier, Gebrselassie had employed the opposite strategy to win the 10,000-meter race at the world championships in Goteborg, Sweden. He conserved his energy for six miles, then used a blistering kick reminiscent of Yifter, his childhood idol, to cover the final 200 meters in 25.3 seconds. It is this tactical versatility of a boxer that impresses Yifter, the ability to come out punching in one race and to play a patient rope-a-dope the next race.
"Haile is good, not only with his running, but with his brain," Yifter said.
Of course, Gebrselassie has not made a serious attempt at the national pastime: the marathon. Actually, he did run one as a 16-year-old, coming to Addis Ababa for the first time and finishing in an impressive 2 hours 52 minutes, but still he returned home with blistered thighs and a punctured ego. He will try the marathon again, perhaps in two years. Some believe he could run 2:04, breaking countryman Belayneh Dinsamo's world record of 2:06:50 by more than two minutes.
"He will shatter it," said Mark Plaatjes, the 1993 world champion from Boulder, Colo. "He will go through the first half in 62 minutes and be jogging."
In the forest above Addis where he trains, Gebrselassie paid a visit recently to the Orthodox Christian Church called Entoto Mariam. A celebration of the Virgin Mary was under way. Women wore traditional white dresses and scarves, dozens gathered in the solitude of prayer and beggars pressed forward until they were waved away by a man swinging a rubber hose.
This is where Menelik II was crowned emperor in 1882. After the Olympics, Gebrselassie said, he will do something special for the church. Exactly what, he would not say. Already he has been generous. He built a house for his father in Assela, where, because of him, the family can afford to rent a harvester for its fields. Two sisters and a brother live with him in Addis. To friends and children who cannot afford them, he provides running shoes.
"Many people know that Ethiopia is poor," Gebrselassie said. "When I break a world record, maybe people get to know something else about Ethiopia, something good. We can't make planes or cars, we don't have the materials. We do what we can."
Interlocking Olympic rings hover above the stands at the National Stadium. Inside four rings are likenesses of Ethiopia's Olympic champions: Bikila, Wolde, Yifter and Tulu. A question mark is encircled by the fifth ring. Who will be the next gold medalist? The country is counting on Gebrselassie. He is counting on himself.
"If I get Olympic gold," he said, "they will talk the same about Haile Gebrselassie and Abebe Bikila."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: STEVE FORBES;
Forbes Battles State Party Regulars in New York

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
After a third-place finish in South Carolina, Steve Forbes began campaigning in New York yesterday needing a strong showing in the state's Presidential primary on Thursday.
But his aides say he is finding that the same Republican Party machine that tried to keep him off the ballot is also undermining his efforts to assemble a staff, forcing him to rely on a few renegade Republican consultants and a cadre of young rookies, many of whom joined by simply calling a toll-free number. 
 Nearly all of the state's Republican leaders are supporting Senator Bob Dole, and they have made it clear that they consider Republicans who work for Mr. Forbes to be turncoats who may face retribution.
So the Forbes campaign has had to scramble to fill several of its key posts. Its director in New York City is a 22-year-old, Michael Muller, whose last job was as an aide to a Democratic Assemblywoman. The director in western New York, Moria Reynolds, is also 22 years old.
Ms. Reynolds is a Canadian who became an American citizen in 1992 and registered to vote only after seeing Mr. Forbes on television three months ago. Explaining the hostility that she has felt from party regulars, she recalled that when she visited a local Young Republicans club recently, she was assailed for discussing Mr. Forbes.
"They told me to shut up," she said. "They told me that this was no place to be talking about politics. And it was a Young Republicans meeting!"
Thomas L. Slater, one of only two experienced Republican advisers running the campaign in New York, acknowledged that "the only way that we were able to do this was to find a lot of people who have never been able to participate in politics before."
For many years, Mr. Slater ran political operations for the Republicans who control the State Senate, but since signing on with Mr. Forbes, he too has been an outcast among party leaders.
"Anyone actively involved in politics before that," he said, "was pretty much barred from being able to help us."
Dole officials dismissed such complaints, saying they and state party officials never pressured people to shun the Forbes campaign. They also said that when they challenged Mr. Forbes's nominating petitions in court, they were merely trying to insure that his campaign followed the rules.
"These are just the final desperate cries of negative campaigning from a candidate who has clearly set a benchmark for mudslinging," said Kirill Goncharenko, a spokesman for the Dole campaign in New York, which is closely linked with the state Republican Party.
New York Republicans have not encountered this situation before. Until this year, the New York Republican primary had never been contested because the state party had successfully used ballot rules to keep all challengers to the party's favored candidate out of the race.
But the Forbes campaign spent $1 million to defeat the state party and get his name on the ballot. And with that triumph behind them, Mr. Slater and other campaign officials emphasized that they can beat the party machine again, even with a makeshift staff.
With the state campaign heating up, Mr. Forbes is trailing Mr. Dole by up to 25 percentage points in the latest polls. But as in other states, the Forbes campaign is hoping that television advertisements and appearances by their candidate will make the difference.
The ads may prove to be even more important in New York because of the campaign's weak organization. The campaign said it plans to spend at least $1 million on television advertisements between Saturday and Thursday, including a half-hour block of time for a call-in show for Mr. Forbes.
Political consultants and executives at television stations in New York City said that as far as they could tell, the Forbes campaign had purchased only a small number of advertisements over the weekend, suggesting that the campaign was either holding its fire for a final barrage or was not really committed to spending so much money.
Yesterday, Mr. Forbes was trying to get his message across to New Yorkers on news programs, and found himself on the defensive on WNBC's "News Forum." The moderator, Gabe Pressman, asked whether the loss of the deduction for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes under his flat tax plan would be "a blow" to New Yorkers.
"Just the opposite," Mr. Forbes said. "The Heritage Foundation did a study of my flat tax, not somebody else's variation. It found that the average family would have a tax cut of at least $1,300.
"The thing you have to remember is the flat tax gives you a tax cut," he added. "You get more exemptions, generous exemptions."
However Mr. Forbes tries to reach voters with that message, the strength of his campaign staff could still be an important factor in the primary because of the timing. The primary is on Thursday because Tuesday, the traditional Election Day, is a Jewish holiday, Purim. And since this is also the first contested Republican primary in New York's history, campaign officials worry that many Republican voters may not know or care about the balloting.
The state party, whose tentacles reach from Staten Island to hamlets near the Canadian border, is expected to push hard for Mr. Dole, setting up phone banks, telling local Republican officials to make the rounds and even helping bring some voters to the polls. Many of the Forbes campaign's New York workers have little if any such experience.
The Forbes campaign's difficulty in signing up prominent Republicans could also create problems in the voting booths. In New York, ballots list the names of the candidates -- and the delegates who want to represent them at the Republican National Convention in San Diego.
The Dole delegates and alternates are mostly members of Congress and the State Legislature; those for Mr. Forbes and the other contender in New York, Patrick J. Buchanan, are not widely known. So it is possible that voters who are not particularly pleased with Mr. Dole might still pull his lever because they like the delegate who is linked to him.
The Forbes campaign also stumbled a bit last month by shutting its state headquarters for nearly two weeks as it focused on the Delaware and Arizona primaries, both of which Mr. Forbes won. The campaign now concedes that closing the office, in Albany near the Capitol, was a mistake, and last Thursday, Robert Mark Penna, the other Republican consultant attached to the New York campaign, reopened it.
"Welcome to the zoo," Mr. Penna said after he flicked on the lights in the barren headquarters, which was once stocked with all the materiel for modern-day political warfare: television sets and computers, phones and fax machines, voter lists and maps.
"I'm sure there isn't even a pen in this place," he said.
Mr. Penna spent the next few hours returning phone calls and instructing two volunteers, the only other workers in the office, to send out boxes of Forbes pamphlets (inscribed with "Steve Forbes Will Change Washington").
"I'm desperate for help," he barked at one point into his cellular phone. "What's your name again? Where do you live?"
Mr. Penna, who also worked for Republicans in the State Senate, said the campaign hoped some voters might be angry with party leaders, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki, for trying to kick Mr. Forbes and other candidates off the ballot and for discouraging local officials from aiding Mr. Forbes. The backlash, they said, might help their candidate.
"For those New York Republicans who are interested in open access and a voice, this is an opportunity for them to exercise that," Mr. Penna said.

HEADLINE: New York Gets $8 Billion In Mortgages

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a broad plan intended to raise the historically low level of home ownership in New York City, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of mortgage loans, is making $8 billion available and changing its rules so that more New Yorkers of all incomes qualify for loans.
The five-year investment program, to be announced today by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and senior officials of the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, has been developed by the lending agency to supplement a nine-year-old housing rehabilitation program in which the city has spent $4 billion to build and renovate housing, selling most of it to people who could not otherwise afford houses or apartments. 
 But Fannie Mae intends to go further, extending its lending plan to middle-income and even affluent New Yorkers. While most Government-subsidized housing programs are limited to low-income families, the Fannie Mae mortgages will be available to people making $75,000 a year and even more.
"The investment plan reflects New York City's unique housing market and needs," said James A. Johnson, chairman of Fannie Mae, "including the low rate of home ownership compared to other parts of the country and the resulting strong reliance on rental housing."
The level of home ownership in New York City has always been low compared with the nationwide level. While 60 percent of American families own their homes, only 29 percent of New Yorkers do, according to city records.
Most of the mortgage lending that will be extended under the Fannie Mae program -- $7 billion -- has been designated for people who buy and live in one- to four-family homes, cooperative apartments or condominiums. With an assortment of new mortgage programs, applicants will be able to qualify with down payments as low as 5 percent, even 3 percent in some cases; be given credit for more of their projected rental income than is now accepted when they apply for financing, and qualify more easily for loans to fix up the property they buy.
The other $1 billion is earmarked for loans to developers who rehabilitate or build rental apartment buildings.
Bankers say Fannie Mae's influence over mortgage lending policies is immense. Fannie Mae, created by Congress in 1968 as an independent shareholder-controlled agency that buys loans from banks and savings associations, does not directly negotiate loans with borrowers. But it provides local lenders with the rules about the kinds of mortgages it will buy from them.
Such rules typically cover how much income an applicant must have, compared with the price of the home and how much down payment is required. And since lenders rely on Fannie Mae to take over almost all the mortgages they extend, bank executives say any change in the agency's rules is almost automatically reflected in local lending policies.
Fannie Mae said most of its mortgage loans would be made in New York City, but some of its new programs would also be offered in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland counties.
"We recognize that the housing issues facing New York City do not stop at its borders," Mr. Johnson said.
The agency said the five-year program, to begin immediately, would increase the home financing it extends in New York City by 12 percent a year. Perhaps more important, by changing the qualification rules, the plan should help buyers and builders in poor neighborhoods.
"The timing could not be more critical," said Deborah C. Wright, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. "With budgets under pressure at all levels of government, this will allow us to stretch our dollars further."
Still, some experts said the plan might not be as big a windfall as it first appeared, since Fannie Mae was not offering its mortgages at lower interest rates than would otherwise be available to home buyers.
In contrast, under some Government-subsidized programs, particularly those available in the last decade to builders who rehabilitated multifamily housing, interest rates have typically been about one percentage point below the prevailing rate.
And for people hoping to buy homes with down payments of less than 20 percent, lenders say the Fannie Mae plan will not relieve them of the requirement to buy mortgage insurance as part of their monthly housing payments, which can add thousands of dollars to their costs over the term of the loan.
"If you can't afford conventional financing, you probably won't be able to afford these Fannie Mae programs," said one Manhattan banker familiar with the program, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Fannie Mae's program for New York City and its suburbs is part of the agency's broader 10-year plan to commit $1 trillion in mortgage loans to 25 cities and poor rural areas. Although Fannie Mae executives said the New York program was its largest, since it would be offered over five years, one announced in Chicago last year is almost as big: $10 billion over seven years.
But housing experts say the New York initiative comes at a critical time because the city's own 10-year housing program, which has won wide praise since it was inaugurated under Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1987, is being squeezed by shrinking budgets and fiscal conservatism.
"This program is an attempt to keep the economic benefits of housing development on track at a time when government subsidies are being cut back," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, one of the largest participants in the city's housing program.
The success of Ms. Wylde's group in creating new housing illustrates the city's unusual approach to its housing problem. Acting as a go-between, it has taken over vacant city-owned lots at no cost, arranged financing for developers and not-for-profit neighborhood housing groups, and created 13,000 new single-family homes over the last 10 years in neighborhoods as diverse as the South Bronx, East New York and Williamsburg.
The city's $4 billion housing program, while providing Ms. Wylde's group with vacant lots, has also paid for the renovation of hundreds of blighted, city-owned apartment buildings. In most cases, those have been turned over to community groups to be operated as rental property for low-income tenants, or offered for sale as cooperatives.
But city funds for the program are being reduced. Although Mayor Giuliani said last year that he would support committing $300 million a year to the program, that level of spending is far below the $700 million a year that was spent in the late 1980's.
"New York is unique among American cities in the amount of its own tax dollars that it has committed to housing," said David Jeffers, Fannie Mae's vice president for corporate communications.
"We are going to support the city's efforts in any way we can," he said.
In addition to increasing the money it makes available in New York City and the suburbs, Fannie Mae said it would establish a local office in the city to work with lenders on such things as lending policies in poor areas.
In part, the agency's increased financial commitment to New York and other big cities results from pressure on banks and savings institutions to lend more aggressively to members of minority groups, recent immigrants and others who have traditionally had difficulty buying homes.
That pressure has increased in recent years because of the Community Reinvestment Act, a Federal law that gives borrowers and community groups greater access to the lenders' records, and allows them to challenge or even block bank mergers and branch closings and other business moves when the banks' lending practices in poor areas fall short.
While acknowledging lenders' need to offer more loans to low- and middle-income home-buyers, Fannie Mae executives said Mayor Giuliani and his advisers, who were consulted about the New York City program, insisted that it also provide new benefits for more affluent buyers.
The rules for the five-year plan allow families with incomes up to $75,570 to qualify for mortgages on cooperative apartments, with down payments as low as 5 percent and with no restrictions the co-ops' locations. In cases of people buying one- or two-family homes, Fannie Mae said it would not impose income limits.
"It is very important that we encourage economic integration," Ms. Wright said. She said the Fannie Mae rules were written to help people who wanted to move to neighborhoods where most residents were less affluent than they, including members of minority groups who want to invest in the neighborhoods where they grew up.

Concerns on Gambling Bill

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
Some New Jersey lawmakers are worried that gambling legislation scheduled for debate in the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday could lead to higher taxes and stricter regulations for Atlantic City casinos. 
 The bill, which would create a Federal commission to study the social and economic effects of the gambling industry, has more than 140 co-sponsors and the backing of House leaders. Representative Frank A. LoBiondo, a Republican of Linwood, said the gambling industry has nothing to fear from an objective study, but he and others worry that the commission would be biased against Atlantic City. "The people behind this bill are morally opposed to gambling and would like nothing better than to see it completely eradicated," said Roger Gross, editor of Casino Journal, a gambling newsletter based in New Jersey.

 BODY:
The makers of Advil are now suggesting that Tylenol may ruin your liver. I suspect Tylenol will soon blaze back with a campaign to hint that Advil rips out your stomach lining. That will give the boys at Bayer aspirin the chance to repeat both competitors' warnings, and to call for unity against the common enemy, headaches.
Thus does advertising art follow political life. Forbes's negative ads weakened Dole for Buchanan, whose rise scared even the Christian Coalition. This resulted in Dole's South Carolina win, enabling him to call for unity in zapping Clinton's failures. 
 Advice to Buchanan: Drop the gun-toting pictures and lock-and-load rhetoric; it stirs up the nuts. Use your famously scornful oratory to take on foreign-agent Farrakhan and Clinton's fear of losing black support by investigating his billion-dollar Libyan tie. You have no black support to lose, and this would thoroughly discombobulate those of us in Israel's Amen Corner.
Advice to Forbes: Keep popping the press. "The pundits were wrong!" you cried in glee after buying up a third of Arizona's G.O.P. As you lose primaries to come, most of us will be happy to have you remind readers of our certainty from Day One that neither a rich novice nor a nativist demagogue has any chance of nomination.
Advice to Alexander: Hang in there. If you aspire to be the party's insurance policy in case Dole stumbles, redirect your campaign away from Dole while you denounce Buchanan's extremism and Forbes's nutty ideas. In that regard --
Forbes is now trying to revivify his flat tax as a tax cut for the middle class; if this is not to produce a horrendous deficit, where are his ideas to slow spending growth? And "the dollar should be as good as gold" is his code phrase for a return to the gold standard -- ask Forbes if this would not boost interest rates to Carter-era levels once he plunged the country into red ink.
And a slew of advice to Dole:
1. Don't forget the theme that helped get you off the floor. This is a fight for the "heart and soul of the Republican Party." Despite today's euphoria, you will be upset in several states, and weak showings will be magnified by scrap-lovers as major derailments; you are still months away from a unity pitch.
Remember that Buchanan's boast to his "movement" is that he will force you to keep an extreme anti-abortion plank in the platform and will have a veto over your pick for a pro-choice running mate. Such concessions would guarantee your election defeat after what would be branded your "surrender in San Diego."
But nothing you can do in appeasing the nativist, populist, isolationist fringe will stop Buchanan from making a smasheroo bolting speech in prime time. He hopes to combine with Ross Perot if those two can ever settle on which one is to head their third party.
2. Your willingness to talk about your war wounds and hospital struggle will be effective as long as it appears reluctant; make the point about being in the real "crossfire" for the next few weeks and then move on. Obvious and repeated refusal to wave the bloody shirt better reflects the modest Dole character and will score more points than waving it.
3. For God's sake, memorize a simple two-sentence position on abortion and be ready for any question in a joint appearance that begins "If your wife were being raped . . ."
4. Revivify the balanced budget. The media have become bored with deficit reduction; voters have not.
5. Pose the question: In today's showbiz politics, can a doer defeat a talker? This will undermine the strength of Buchanan and Clinton, and provide a rationale for the diffident Dole style. When confronted by ABC's Sam Donaldson for your referring to yourself in the third person, you popped up with an endearing "Gets the name out."
6. Don't get snookered by the "vision thing" to compete with Clinton's double vision. With a Republican Congress in place, America needs not so much a President with more vision as a President with a signing pen.
Today's G.O.P. has more vision than it knows what to do with; the trick is to make real the vision of balanced budgets, local empowerment and global engagement. Brandish that pen you carry to keep your fingers from splaying: Clinton will veto; Dole will sign.

HEADLINE: Meyer Schapiro, 91, Is Dead; His Work Wove Art and Life

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL 

 BODY:
Dr. Meyer Schapiro, University Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, multidisciplinary critic and historian, galvanic teacher, lifelong radical and for more than 50 years a pre-eminent figure in the intellectual life of New York, died yesterday at the Greenwich Village house that had been his home for more than 60 years. He was 91.
As an academic, Dr. Schapiro excelled in two completely different fields. It was as a historian and elucidator of Romanesque sculpture that he made his name in 1931. He also wrote on 19th-century and early-20th-century art -- from Courbet and Cezanne to Mondrian and the Abstract Expressionists -- in ways that gave new dignity to the discussion of modern art. 
 But it was not in his nature to function as a specialist within any one particular discipline. Even less was he a satrap of the seminar with specific "turf" of his own to protect. It was, in fact, the very essence of Meyer Schapiro that he never conceived of any aspect of art, of belief or of language in isolation. He regarded all forms, schools and systems of knowledge as interrelated and interdependent. As far as he was concerned, he had been put on earth to know, and to make known, the correspondences between them all. And he addressed himself not to the insider, but to the generality of intelligent human beings.
An archetypal Jewish immigrant, Meyer Schapiro arrived in the United States at the age of 3 from Lithuania, where Jews were subject to periodic and odious harassment. It was in New York, the fulcrum and heartland of immigration, that he lived out his life. New York made him welcome, nourished his fiery and agile intelligence, and made it possible for him to master one discipline after another with a speed and a thoroughness that have had few parallels in our century. What New York had given him, he gave back many times over.
The painter Robert Motherwell said in 1974: "It was in order to study with Meyer Schapiro that I came to New York, which was the single most decisive factor in my development. He introduced me to European artists in exile here from the war in the 1940's, and this was the second most important factor in my orientation. I have great admiration for him as a sage, though I disagree with him on some judgments. I admire him as an irreplaceable man and as an extraordinary representative of the unique greatness of New York City."
William S. Rubin, formerly the director of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, said: "Few art historians have the eye and mind of a Meyer Schapiro. And none of those shared his extraordinary humanity. So when Meyer Schapiro communed with great art, he saw kinds of things that eluded the rest of us."
Hilton Kramer, the editor of The New Criterion, said: "In my generation, one of the key points of entry into the life of art in New York was the experience of hearing Dr. Schapiro lecture on modern painting at the New School for Social Research. Those lectures, always crowded with artists and writers, were dazzling performances that left one in no doubt that the great work of the modern painters stood at the very center of life."
In lecture hall and seminar, Dr. Schapiro would sometimes start from a prepared text or with a purpose that he summarized at the outset. His speech at such times might be plain and straightforward to the point of hesitation. But before long an almost perceptible halo of cerebration began to wreathe his head. As he took off into an empyrean to which he alone had access, ideas and intuitions crowded in from every quarter. At such times, all present were drawn into a magic circle that he had been tracing since the late 1920's. It could have been overwhelming, but such was the intellectual courtesy behind it that those in his audience left the room convinced, for just a minute or two, that they were as clever as he was.
As to the general direction of his work, he himself defined it when, in 1973, he was given an award by the Art Dealers Association of America. "The study of art history" he said, "presupposes that art is a universal and permanent feature of civilized life, and that what we do to preserve it, and to discriminate the best of it, will contribute to future enjoyment as much as to our own."
"Our concern with the work of art, however touched by vanity or greed, is a homage beyond self-interest," he continued. "Through it we surmount, if only at rare moments, the limitations of our striving, possessive selves and, as an old poet says, 'into glory peep.' "
 
A Remarkable Memory For Scholarly Detail
All his life, Dr. Schapiro had a capacity for total recall. No matter what subject was raised in general conversation, he could usually name not only the necessary books on the subject but the chapter heading and even the page reference that was most appropriate. In this regard, he was rarely faulted. Equally remarkable was his visual memory for works of art that he had once seen and never forgotten.
When the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz was newly arrived in New York from Europe during World War II, he spent an evening in Dr. Schapiro's company. The talk turned to the great collections of tribal art in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris, and in particular to a piece that he had especially admired. To help Lifschitz recall it, Dr. Schapiro took a sheet of paper and drew, from memory and to scale, not only the piece in question but every other piece that had been in the case with it some years before. He did not see this as anything out of the ordinary.
Artists and writers prized in particular the unexpected and far-ranging connections that he could summon up when in their company. The French painter Fernand Leger was not given to mystical observances of any kind, and when Dr. Schapiro took him to the basement of the Pierpont Morgan Library during World War II he may have wondered what was in store for him. But it was thanks to Dr. Schapiro that Leger found, in an 11th-century illumination from the Beatus Apocalypse, an important element in the vocabulary of his later paintings. This was one of many occasions on which Dr. Schapiro dealt with living artists on an inspired basis. Another was a well-known occasion in 1952 on which he convinced Willem de Kooning that his "Woman I" was not a failure, as Mr. de Kooning had supposed, but a success from which other successes would surely come.
More recently, the point was put with ideal concision by R. B. Kitaj, the American painter, who now lives in London. "Meyer Schapiro was here," he wrote. "Like having Plato in the living room!" But then, there were few people who came within his orbit and were not changed for the better. For those who worked with words, he was the speaker they most wanted to hear and the reader they most wanted to please. Irving Howe, the editor, critic and commentator, once said in that context, "To gain even his conditional approval for something I have written has been the single highest reward to which I could aspire."
In 1974, on the occasion of Dr. Schapiro's 70th birthday, 12 of the leading artists of the day made original lithographs, etchings and silk-screens that were sold in an edition of 100. The proceeds were given to a fund for the endowment of a chair in Dr. Schapiro's name in the department of art history and archeology at Columbia. The artists were Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Alexander Liberman, Stanley William Hayter, Roy Lichtenstein, Andre Masson, Robert Motherwell, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol and Saul Steinberg.
 
A 3-Year-Old Immigrant Gets a New First Name
Meyer Schapiro was born in Siauliai, Lithuania, on Sept. 23, 1904. He was the son of Nathan Menachem Schapiro and Fanny Adelman Schapiro. The descendant of Talmudic scholars, Nathan Schapiro in first youth abandoned the Orthodox Jewish traditions in which he had been reared and became influenced by the Jewish Socialist Bund and the Haskala, an Eastern European enlightenment movement that welcomed Western secular learning.
In 1906 Nathan Schapiro immigrated on his own to the United States, where he found work as a teacher of Hebrew at the Yitzcak Elchanan Yeshiva on the Lower East Side in New York. After only a year, he had saved enough money to send for his family. While Nathan's son was being processed on Ellis Island for entry into the United States at the age of 3, his name was changed from Meir to Meyer. With his family settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, Nathan Schapiro prospered as a paper-and-twine jobber. His intellectual interests were uncommonly varied. Yiddish was the first language in the family home, but he kept up with literary (as distinct from spoken) Hebrew, secular Bible studies, the theories of Darwin, books on language, the contemporary socialist press and much else.
While a pupil at Public School 84 in Brooklyn, Meyer Schapiro was encouraged by his parents to let his curiosity run free. He read, drew, took and developed photographs, mastered electrical gadgetry and did not disdain sports. Like many another brilliant Jewish student at that time, he found a second home in the Hebrew Settlement House in Brownsville, where he was the only child in an evening art class that was taught by the painter and etcher John Sloan. In 1975, at the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the settlement house, he pointed to the medal that his wife, Dr. Lillian Milgrim, was wearing around her neck. She had received that medal from the settlement house for teaching at its Sabbath school, Dr. Schapiro said.
While at Boys High School in Brooklyn, he received very high grades in Latin and mathematics, attended lectures on anthropology and economics at the Young Peoples' Socialist League, and worked summers as a Western Union delivery boy, a warehouse packer, an electrical-supply assembler and an adjustment clerk at Macy's.
In 1920, at the age of 16, he graduated from high school. In September of that year he entered Columbia College as the holder of both a Pulitzer scholarship and a Regents scholarship. Already convinced that he would never make the grade as a practicing artist, he chose an undergraduate curriculum that included Latin, living languages, mathematics, ancient and modern literature, anthropology, philosophy and art history. The poet and English professor Mark Van Doren remembered Meyer Schapiro as a Columbia student with "thick, curly black hair, eager white cheeks, darkly rolling eyes" and "a passion to know and make known."
Still not yet 20, he received his bachelor's degree with honors in art history and philosophy. What he called his "sense of the deep connections of art with the totality of culture" was already shaping the direction of the life's work that was to come. Both anthropology (under Franz Boas) and architecture tempted him, meanwhile, and art history as then taught at Columbia seemed to him almost derisory, based as it was on courses given, in his view, by "men who had never really conducted investigations after writing their Ph.D. theses."
But art history remained the discipline that would best satisfy both his love of learning and his love of art. Turned down by the department of art history at Princeton -- a rejection that he attributed at least in part to his being Jewish -- he settled for graduate work in art history at Columbia. The next years were decisive for his career on two separate counts. One was the fact that the distinguished medievalist Ernest DeWald had moved from Princeton to Columbia. The other was that Meyer Schapiro taught himself German (by way of Yiddish) and was thus able to read the seminal work of two great scholars, Wilhelm Voge and Alois Riegl.
 
An Abbey in France Reveals Its Secrets
From Voge, he learned to study the emergence of the monumental style in 11th- and 12th-century Europe. From Riegl, he learned the correspondence between changes in art and the development of individual perception from one stage of life to another. Fired up by these revelations, he chose as the subject for his doctoral dissertation the cloister and portal of Moissac, an abbey in southwestern France that had been built about A.D. 1100 and had long been well known for its Romanesque sculptures. Those sculptures had always been regarded primarily as rudimentary way stations on the road to Gothic art and the work of anonymous artisans who wished only to dedicate themselves to God. But in 1922 the French art historian Emile Male argued in his book on 12th-century religious art in France that on the contrary, they marked "the very inception of the modern tradition in sculpture."
Five years of research, much of it on site in France and elsewhere, went into the doctoral dissertation, which was accepted by Columbia in 1929. Dr. Schapiro's research went far beyond the implications of Moissac itself. Medieval church history, liturgy, theology, social history, illuminated manuscripts, folklore, epigraphy, the analysis of ornament and national characteristics (real or imagined) all were pressed into service and synthesized. As a result, what had been thought of as antiquarian artifacts were seen to have a completely different character.
"A new sphere of artistic creation," Dr. Schapiro called it, "without religious content and imbued with values of spontaneity, individual fantasy, delight in color and movement, and the expression of feelings that anticipate modern art. This new art, on the margins of religious work, was accompanied by a conscious taste of the spectators for the beauty of workmanship, materials and artistic devices, apart from religious meanings."
In 1928, before his dissertation was completed, he was appointed a lecturer in art history at Columbia. That year he also married Dr. Milgrim, a pediatrician. As of 1931, when part of his dissertation appeared in The Art Bulletin, his exceptional stature was widely realized. "For the first time," one scholar recalled, "Meyer treated a set of Romanesque sculptures as art, rather than as documents." The rest of Dr. Schapiro's teaching career was spent primarily at Columbia, where he became assistant professor in 1936, associate professor in 1946, full professor in 1952 and University Professor in 1965. Named University Professor Emeritus in 1973, he went to Columbia once a week to teach a graduate class on "Theory and Methods of Investigation in Art."
He also lectured at New York University from 1932 to 1936, and at the New School for Social Research from 1936 to 1952. His lectures at the New School had a particular importance for artists and writers, in that they coincided with the development of a New York school of painting that was to win widespread international acclaim. Meanwhile, European modernism was still little known in the United States, and when paintings by Picasso, Georges Braque and Joan Miro arrived in New York they were often seen literally out of context. Dr. Schapiro at that time performed a public service by validating them in intellectual, historical and moral terms that were a revelation to many in his audience.
During the 1930's, the Schapiros' home in Greenwich Village was much visited by members of the radical left, and Dr. Schapiro became a contributor to The Marxist Quarterly, The New Masses, The Nation and The Partisan Review. It was, however, noted by the novelist Saul Bellow that "Meyer never took part in any of the quarrels and backbiting and vendettas. . . . He was the one person in the Village against whom no one had anything terrible to say."
 
Speaking a Great Deal But Publishing Little
For many years, Dr. Schapiro was reluctant to publish (or, in some cases, to republish) his lectures and papers. An annunciatory quality had always been fundamental to his performances on the platform and in the classroom. The printed page ruled out the new insights that came crowding in -- or so it seemed -- on the spur of the moment and in the heat of exposition. For this reason, his output in print between 1931 and the late 1970's was almost absurdly small in relation to his reputation as both an art historian of the first rank and the most inspiring teacher of his time.
"Vincent van Gogh" (1950) and "Cezanne" (1952) were treasured texts, but brief. "Words and Pictures" (1973), likewise brief, applied the new science of semiotics to the study of medieval illuminated manuscripts. Other writings had almost a clandestine circulation. But in 1977 George Braziller began publishing a four-volume series of his selected essays and lectures. "Romanesque Art" came out in 1977, "Modern Art: 19th and 20th Centuries" in 1978 and "Late Antique, Early Christian and Medieval Art" in 1979. The fourth volume, "Theory and Philosophy of Art: Style, Artist and Society," was published in 1994.
The former pupil of John Sloan painted and drew for much of his life. In 1987 he was persuaded by Rainer Crone and Elizabeth Ferrer of the art history department at Columbia to exhibit his work in the Wallach Art Gallery in Schermerhorn Hall. The 65 drawings and paintings, dating from 1919 to 1979, touched lightly on portraiture, landscape, family subjects, the all-embracing horror of World War II and the potential of abstraction. A self-portrait drawing made when he was 16 was a sure guide to his ardent nature, and as testimony to his gift for personal loyalty there were two portraits of Whittaker Chambers, the former Communist whose testimony was instrumental in the perjury conviction of Alger Hiss.
In 1966-67 Dr. Schapiro was Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer at Harvard University. In 1968 he was Slade Professor of Art at Oxford University. In May 1974 he was a visiting lecturer at the College de France in Paris. In May 1975 the alumni of Columbia awarded him the Alexander Hamilton Medal for distinguished service and accomplishment. In 1976 he was elected a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Schapiro is survived by two children, Miriam Schapiro Grosof of Manhattan and Ernest Schapiro of Washington; two grandsons; a great grandson, and an older brother, Morris Schapiro.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Venezuela Again Opens to Foreign Oil Concerns

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
Venezuela, a petroleum-rich country that is currently starved for cash, is moving to vastly increase its crude oil production.
This is good news for private foreign oil companies, which, 20 years after all foreign oil operations were nationalized, are rushing back to the South American country at Government invitation to help prospect for crude. And Clinton Administration officials are praising Venezuela's plans because the production surge will insure that Venezuela, the No. 1 petroleum supplier for the United States, will have plenty of capacity to satisfy America's growing energy appetite. 
 But Venezuela's program to double crude production over 10 years is bad news for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the group that Venezuela helped found in 1960. Whether Venezuela's increases in production will send world prices tumbling is in dispute. But they underline OPEC's rising inability to enforce the production quotas that are the organization's principal tool for stabilizing crude prices, industry analysts said.
"Venezuela is saying, in effect, 'forget OPEC,' " said Chris K. Skrebowski, editor of Petroleum Economist, a London-based publication that monitors the world oil industry. "Venezuela is already producing far beyond its quota, and now they're publicly and cheerfully saying onward and upward. They haven't left OPEC -- they're just not paying attention to it any more."
For several years, Venezuelan production has been creeping upward, and it has surpassed its daily OPEC production quota of 2.4 million barrels every year since 1993. Last year, Venezuela pumped more than 2.7 million barrels of crude each day, nearly 400,000 barrels over its OPEC quota. And now Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, has begun a sweeping 10-year, $60 billion investment program aimed at increasing crude production above five million barrels a day by 2005, said Juan M. Szabo, the company's exploration and production coordinator.
These plans, under consideration since 1992, are moving off the drawing boards just as the country's broader economy is sliding into its worst crisis in years. Standard & Poor's has downgraded Venezuela's credit rating to B from B+, criticizing the Government for failing to reduce its fiscal deficit.
"The outlook is negative," Standard & Poor's said.
Andres Serbin, a political analyst who is often critical of President Rafael Caldera's policies, called management of the country's energy policies by Petroleos de Venezuela executives "an island of coherence within the ocean of disorder that characterizes the Government's economic policy."
Petroleos de Venezuela's production plans include three major initiatives. The biggest brought executives from 60 foreign companies to Caracas recently for a public auction of exploration and production rights to eight promising oil regions, scattered across the country. Those areas, totaling 4.5 million acres, are estimated to contain at least seven billion barrels of medium and light crude; if those estimates pan out, the new oil will increase Venezuela's proven reserves to 72 billion barrels. By comparison, Saudi Arabia's reserves are put at 255 billion barrels.
Thirteen of the 60 bidders, including Amoco, Mobil, and Conoco, a unit of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, emerged as winners. The terms to which they agreed were extremely advantageous to Venezuela, analysts said -- the Government's share of profits from any oil discovered would range from 88 percent to 92 percent. That compares with the approximately 50 percent share the United States Government taxes away from domestic American crude producers.
But foreign executives expressed enthusiasm at getting a shot at business in Venezuela anyway.
"We're just delighted we had a chance to participate," said John Williams, president of the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, which won rights to explore a vast tract of swampland in the Orinoco River delta east of Caracas.
Mobil reported its winning bid in an advertisement on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that praised Venezuela for encouraging outside investment and said the nation's "importance in the petroleum sector is too crucial to ignore." Mobil is a partner with Veba Oel A.G. of Germany and Nippon Oil Ltd. of Japan in a consortium that bought rights to explore 445,000 acres onthe southeastern shore of Lake Maracaibo.
"In terms of long-range economic development, this oil opening is probably the single most important event this year for the U.S. in Latin America," Jeffrey S. Davidow, the American Ambassador to Caracas, said.
The 13 foreign companies are expected to invest $11 billion in Venezuela before production in the eight new fields reaches a peak in 2005, Mr. Szabo said in an interview at the state company's towering headquarters in Caracas.
That investment will be overshadowed, however, by Petroleos de Venezuela's spending on the company's own expanded exploration and drilling activities, which Mr. Szabo estimated would reach $33 billion over the same 10 years. Foreign companies working on special projects aimed at extracting and refining extra-heavy crude and liquefied gas are expected to invest an additional $16 billion by 2005, he said.
Mr. Szabo insisted that Venezuela's production goals were consistent with OPEC policies.
Over 10 years, world oil needs are likely to rise from the current daily level of 69 million barrels to more than 80 million barrels, and only a handful of Middle Eastern countries and Venezuela, all OPEC members, are in a position to increase production to meet the demand, Mr. Szabo said. As a result, Venezuela should be able to negotiate a sizable increase in its OPEC quota, he said.
Venezuela's decision to open the oil spigot has, however, irritated several of its OPEC partners, several experts said.
"The Saudis and several other OPEC countries have talked to them," said Paul Huebert, an international energy analyst based in Washington. "If OPEC can't even keep major producers like Venezuela in line, then the organization is in trouble."

GRAPHIC: Graph/Map: "Tapping Into Venezuela's Oil" shows the groups of foreign companies that won rights to prospect for oil in Venezuela and the estimates of reserves in each region. If early estimates of oil deposits in these regions prove to be correct, Venezuelan oil production could increase sharply.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Generally Moves Lower But Advances Against the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday, but it ended lower against the Japanese yen and other major currencies in thin trading.
The mark came under selling pressure as traders speculated that the German Government would cut interest rates again to bolster the weak German economy. Lower rates would make investments denominated in marks less attractive. 
 "The mark was sold rather heavily most of the day," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign exchange dealer at Credit Agricole. "The market is becoming rather sensitive to German economic figures and the potential weakness they may show."
The German Government is expected to issue fresh data this week pointing to a weak economy.
The dollar rose to 1.4780 marks in late trading in New York, from 1.4773 marks on Friday. But it fell to 105.15 yen, compared with 105.41 yen on Friday.
The British pound rose to $1.5275 from $1.5269.
The Italian lira surged to its highest level in 13 months against the mark, which also helped the dollar against the mark, dealers said.
"We heard talk of overseas buying in Italian bonds, which caused the lira to strengthen against its trading partners," said Philip Vasan, managing director of foreign exchange derivatives at CS First Boston. "That was one more factor that helped the mark weaken."
In turn, the dollar was able to recoup ground lost against the mark in Asia and Europe early yesterday.
The yen rallied against the mark and put pressure on the dollar as Japanese investors continued to shed dollar-based assets as the March 31 end of the Japanese fiscal year draws closer.
But the dollar held close to 105 yen for most of the day, bolstered by rumors that the Bank of Japan was buying dollars in the open market whenever the price neared 104.50 yen. A rising yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad.
Still, the dollar was not as strong as it had been in recent weeks, and some traders noted lingering concerns over the stalled efforts to balance the Federal budget.
"The dollar should have been putting in a better performance, given the weak news coming out of Germany and the obvious signs the Bank of Japan has no intention of seeing the yen appreciate," said Chris Widness, international economist at Chemical Securities.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Drops As Income Growth Slows

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The growth in personal income slowed in January after increasing in 1995 at the fastest pace in five years, and consumer spending fell for the first time in three years, the Commerce Department said today.
The report, which said personal income grew an anemic one-tenth of 1 percent, to $6.25 trillion in January, from $6.24 trillion a month earlier, provided additional evidence of the economy's weakness as the year began. 
 But many analysts said the sluggishness was due mostly to the blizzard and the Federal Government shutdowns.
"We hit a bit of a pothole earlier this year, but it was weather-related," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. "While January was weak, all signs point to a fairly significant rebound in February."
The January gain in personal income was the smallest since last August. However, an advance of six-tenths of 1 percent in December, helped raise incomes for all of 1995 by 6.1 percent -- the highest gain since a 6.7 percent increase in 1990. That growth far outpaced last year's inflation rate of 2.5 percent.
The department also reported that consumer spending fell five-tenths of 1 percent in January, to $5.01 trillion from $5.03 trillion. It was the third drop in five months and the largest since a decline of six-tenths of 1 percent in August 1992.
"January was a tough month," Mr. Roach said. "The weather and the Government shutdown had a detrimental impact on almost everything we were measuring."
Donald Straszheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, agreed that the economic expansion, now five years old, had hit "a soft spot" but would escape a recession in the near future.
"The U.S. economy enjoyed eight-year-long recoveries in the 1960's and 1980's, with soft landings embedded in the middle," he said. "We think it is happening again."
For all of 1995, consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, rose only 4.8 percent, down from 5.5 percent in 1994.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January after jumping seven-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. And Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was 5.3 percent, highest since a 6.3 percent rate in December 1993.
Spending on big-ticket durable goods such as cars and computers fell 5.3 percent in January. But outlays for nondurable goods such as food, fuel and services edged up two-tenths of 1 percent.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes were unchanged after rising six-tenths of 1 percent in December. Spending fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, erasing an advance of eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Investors Scramble to Sell As Strong New Year Rally Dims

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Gold prices fell yesterday to their lowest levels in two months as a New Year's rally that had carried the market to six-year highs faded, and disappointed investors scrambled to sell.
"People were getting impatient, and the price of gold wasn't going anywhere," said Greg Drury, director of precious metals at Mitsui & Company in the United States. 
 At the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for April delivery tumbled $5, to $395.20 an ounce, the lowest since Jan. 3 and off nearly $25 from the six-year high of $419.60 reached on Feb. 2.
With energy and grain prices also falling, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities dropped 0.85, to 243.61.
Other precious metals prices also fell. May silver lost 12.3 cents, to $5.417 an ounce, and April platinum dropped $4.80, to $408 an ounce.
Dinsa Mehta, managing director at Chase Manhattan, said the gold market seemed overbought recently, but traders and analysts said there was no fresh news behind the selloff.
Bullish investors had focused on expectations that gold mine output would remain stagnant while buying in the fast-growing Asian economies would continue rising. But the continuing strength in the stock market deflated expectations that investors would move into hard assets like gold.
Crude oil prices fell further, casting doubt on whether the energy sector would mount a late winter rally.
April crude lost 24 cents, to $19.20 a barrel, and April gasoline declined 1.02 cents, to 58.73 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Grain prices fell, hurt partly by moves by two large poultry producers to reduce output, partly because of the high cost of chicken feed made from corn and soybeans.
The approach of the South American soybean harvest also weighed on prices, with March soybeans falling 8 cents, to $7.2025 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade. March corn fell 4 cents, to $3.8925 a bushel, and March wheat declined 3 cents, to $5.1225 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Action on Bills to Create Jobs and Lift Incomes

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: TAYLOR, Mich., March 4

 BODY:
President Clinton today responded to the anxieties about job security that are rippling through the Republican Presidential race by repackaging his legislative program as a "growth agenda" that will "keep creating jobs and raise incomes" to allow all Americans to compete in the new global economy.
Appearing before a cheering, flag-waving crowd crammed into a public works garage in this blue-collar suburb of Detroit, the President listed his economic achievements, noting that his Administration had cut the Federal deficit in half and fostered new jobs in three years. 
 "But we must do more," he said, "if we're going to create jobs and raise incomes and give these people who are being downsized a chance to go right on with their lives and raise their children and live with hope and dignity instead of frustration and a sense of failure."
The President called on Congress to pass several languishing pocketbook measures, including an increase in the minimum wage, tax deductions for post-secondary school tuition, and Federal vouchers to pay for worker retraining, and a bill that would make health insurance more accessible.
"Congress must do its part," Mr. Clinton said, challenging the Republican-led Congress to act in the next 60 days to pass this program, which he labeled a "growth agenda."
"It's a long way from now until the election, but every week between now and the election the American people will get up and go to work, they still have to pay their bills, they still have to educate their children, they still have to try to keep their dreams alive."
Mr. Clinton's speech in this politically crucial industrial state illustrated the balance he is trying to strike on the critical battleground of the economy at a time when Republicans have started to refer to the "Clinton crunch" of stagnant wages.
Mr. Clinton gave a rhetorical nod to the growing chorus of Democrats who want to see a more populist attack on corporations. Acknowledging public concern about rounds of layoffs by companies seeking to raise their stock prices, Mr. Clinton said, "We need people to really think about whether it's the fair and right thing to do when you see these downsizings."
"If they have to do it to keep the business afloat every American can understand that," he added. "But no one should lose a job for short term considerations that are not necessary for the long-term well-being of the profitable enterprise."
But the President did not take the next step advocated by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Congressional Democratic leaders and propose using the tax structure to reward corporations that give their workers job security or profit-sharing or better pension plans and health benefits.
Instead, Mr. Clinton held out economic growth, and measures to promote growth, as the antidotes to worker anxiety and to a politics of class warfare.
"We are not a people who object to others being successful; we do not resent people amassing their own wealth fairly won in a free enterprise system," he said. "The only thing we resent is when every American who is doing the right thing and working hard and playing by the rules doesn't have a chance to be treated fairly."
Mr. Clinton made no mention of Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican candidate who has most sought to capitalize on worker discontent with a platform of protectionism and tariffs on goods from Japan, China and developing nations.
But providing a clear counterpoint to Mr. Buchanan, the President pointed to the upsurge in the American auto industry and attributed it in part to the opening of markets in Japan.
"Our auto industry is back," Mr. Clinton said, drawing applause in this state where the auto industry is a lifeline. "The world's best workers are making the best cars, and once again, for the first time in 15 years, our auto industry is leading the world in sales and progress and profits."
The President noted that in the last year American auto exports to Japan had increased 37 percent.
Most of Mr. Clinton's day in the Detroit area was devoted to campaign fund-raising. At a luncheon that had been rescheduled from the autumn because of the funeral of Israel's slain Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, Mr. Clinton brought in $700,000 for his own campaign and for the Democratic National Committee.
He then moved on to a more exclusive affair for about 100 people in the Detroit suburbs sponsored by David Hermelin, a real estate developer. Mr. Clinton's aides said the stop was expected to raise $1 million for the coordinated campaigns of the state and national Democratic parties, and the Democratic Congressional campaign committees.

HEADLINE: The Real Zyuganov

BYLINE: By Adrian Karatnycky; Adrian Karatnycky is the president of Freedom House, which monitors democracy and human rights. He is the co-author, with Nadia Diuk, of "New Nations Rising: The Fall of the Soviets and the Challenge of Independence."

 BODY:
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader who is the current favorite to win Russia's presidential elections in June, tries hard to sound like a reasonable man.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month and in recent meetings with American business leaders, he has insisted that he believes in private enterprise balanced by a strong social safety net. He has written in The New York Times that he wants to live in peace with the United States. 
 Such conciliatory statements have led many Westerners to call him a social democrat. Others have expressed doubts: If he's a social democrat, why is his party full of Communist hard-liners who backed the 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev?
So is Mr. Zyuganov an agreeable social democrat or troglodyte Communist? On the basis of his writings, he emerges as neither. He is a more worrisome figure: a conservative traditionalist, a Russian nationalist, a proponent of pan-Slavic reunification.
In the last year, Mr. Zyuganov has produced a series of books bearing ponderous titles like "Beyond the Horizon" and "I Believe in Russia," which exude a sort of mystical nationalism. All posit a millennial struggle between East and West that began in 1054 with the schism between Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianity.
Orthodoxy's fight against Catholicism and Protestantism is based, says Mr. Zyuganov, on the fact that the West has "broken loose from its original cultural-religious traditions," largely because of the Industrial Revolution, which accelerated moral decline.
There are, of course, the usual villains. In "Beyond the Horizon," which was issued last summer, Mr. Zyuganov writes of the "ever more perceptible influence of Judaic dispersal, whose influence consistently grew by the day, even by the hour" and so contributed to the decoupling of the West from its Christian moral roots.
His convoluted prose echoes the stereotypes and conspiracy theories prevalent in traditional anti-Semitic tracts: "The Jewish diaspora, which traditionally controlled the financial life of the continent, began expanding its own market by becoming the bearer of the controlling packet of shares in the complete industrial-economic system of Western civilization."
Mr. Zyuganov saves his greatest venom for liberal democracy, which he blames for most of the ills of the modern world. He is remarkably kind to Stalin, who, he says, restored the Eurasian tradition to the center of Soviet life.
Although he avoids passing judgment on Stalin's crimes, he clearly admires the leader's national Bolshevism. Mr. Zyuganov suggests that Stalin "understood the urgent necessity of harmonizing new realities with a centuries-long Russian tradition."
If only Stalin had lived a few more years, Mr. Zyuganov sighs, he would have restored Russia to its former greatness and saved it from the "cosmopolitans" who have ruled it in various guises since his death.
In an ominous declaration of his ambition to extend Russia's territories, Mr. Zyuganov writes approvingly of Alexander III, the 19th-century Czar whose reign saw Russia's "southern border expand by 1,000 kilometers toward Afghanistan."
To prepare for a new expansion, Mr. Zyuganov favors a strategy of turning inward in order to to cast all resources and effort toward "internal evolution." By this, he apparently means that a self-reliant Russia could exact its international influence on its own terms.
Although he purports to be a Communist, he makes little mention of Marx and Lenin. Rather, he elegizes Russia as the "idealist nation," the "dreamer-nation," the "mobilizer-nation."
Some Westerners say that we should view his rhetoric as nothing more than election year hyperbole. To be sure, Mr. Zyuganov may be attempting to cunningly straddle the Red-Brown spectrum with the aim of building a Communist-nationalist coalition to propel him to the presidency. But his writings, which outline a comprehensive, coherent philosophy, suggest something more than political expediency. They show a genuine commitment to the extreme ideas he advances.
What would a President Zyuganov mean for the West? He speaks with a dangerous moral absolutism that resembles the ideological didacticism of Soviet Communism. He aggrandizes the Soviet Union's historic role as the rival of the United States. And he places himself at the center of an epic struggle against the secular. As President, his top international priority would be to bring the territory of the former Soviet Union under Russian rule and build close relations with the Islamic world and China.
Thus, while Mr. Zyuganov may not be a Communist, he is something worse. Neither Red nor Pink, Mr. Zyuganov is White -- the latest incarnation in a centuries-long tradition of Russian nationalists who celebrate Orthodox Christianity, Slavic unity and imperial expansion.
On policy matters, he is quite specific. He opposes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which he says is a conspiracy of big-business interests. He rails at the United Nations and the threat of a foreign-dominated world government. He despises the International Monetary Fund and says the international financial system is cheating the little guy.
As for domestic issues, he believes that abortion is immoral and should be banned. He is tough on crime and contemptuous of what he regards as a fundamentally corrupt political establishment. He complains that the average worker has seen his standard of living erode. He believes his nation is God's country, steered by a unique moral vision, but he worries that the secular and commercial values of consumerism have degraded the nation's spiritual purity.
Does all this sound oddly familiar? Discontented Russians aren't the only ones with whom such ideas are finding resonance. Perhaps it's time for a candidates' summit: Patrick Buchanan, meet Gennadi Zyuganov.

HEADLINE: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA;
Big Holes Where the Dignity Used to Be

SERIES: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: Third of Seven articles -- In the Family, The Good Life Lost

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
To the beggars downtown that autumn day, every wing-tipped stride of James E. Sharlow seemed to resonate with prosperity. His suit was boardroom gray, his tie was red silk, his creases as crisp as fresh money. One ragged man sidled up to him with a sad story and an outstretched palm.
"Excuse me, sir," he said, "but could you spare $5? I've got a family to feed. I haven't worked for a long time." 
 "Me either, fella," Mr. Sharlow said, and kept walking. In the 1990's, he has learned through bitter experience, discarded workers come in rags and Ralph Lauren.
He met some friends for lunch -- laid-off, white-collar, middle-aged men like himself -- and paid his tab with money drawn from his retirement accounts. Then he slid into his shiny black Mercedes, the one with the badly slipping transmission, and followed the Ronald Reagan Expressway home to the house and life in the San Fernando Valley that he can no longer afford.
The 51-year-old Mr. Sharlow lost his $130,000-a-year job in January 1993 when the plant he managed was shut down, permanently. After giving 26 years of his life and loyalty to one big corporation, Eastman Kodak, he found himself chasing white-collar jobs in a market already glutted with unemployed manufacturing executives.
For Mr. Sharlow, his wife and two grown daughters, it is not only a matter of temporarily doing without new cars, nice vacations and unbridled trips to the mall, but a steadily creeping unease that their downsized existence could be permanent. More than anything, they all want the layoff to be only a ripple in their old life, not the beginning of a new one.
"I believe in the American dream," he said, with a resistance that is part pride, part hope, part denial. "I feel it fading. I still believe."
So while the layoff has eroded his dreams of retirement and stolen his family's long-range security, it has not, on the surface at least, greatly changed the look of their lives. Mr. Sharlow always saved, and over the years put away about $300,000. Now every three months he dips into the money for about $10,000 to pay bills and the mortgage on their roomy, ranch-style house, with a small pool out back, on a street of small but manicured lawns and Lyndon Johnson-era architecture in Northridge, northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
Gayle, his wife, calls it: "Keeping up the front."
Every withdrawal from their savings costs them money in penalties and interest, but what she takes home from the $30,000 annual salary she earns as a secretary will not even cover the house payment of $1,800 a month. So they sacrifice their future to pay for the here and now, and at night she takes long walks so her husband and daughters cannot see her cry.
"I just want to pretend things are like they used to be," said Mrs. Sharlow, a slim, gracious blond woman who, lately, always looks a little tired. She spent years finding the perfect curtains. Now she hoards paper towels and soap.
Gayle Sharlow, who is 51, grew up in a household where money was short, precious. Sometimes now, when she forces herself out of bed at 5:30 in the morning, she looks down at her still-sleeping husband and feels a flash of anger: He can hold out for a good job. She just goes to work. Sometimes, she feels like begging him to take a job, any kind of job, instead of holding out for one that fits his dreams.
She fears they will lose their house, their retirement, all of it. But she never wakes him those mornings, never does speak up. His work was not merely part of him. It was the defining part.
"How could my family not think less of me now?" asked Mr. Sharlow, a large, tall, balding, bearded man who looks like a boss. Once he was a husband and father with a great job, and now he is just a man chasing one.
"I thought it would take a few weeks, a few months, and then I would be working again," he said. "I want to tell companies, 'Take me on for a month. Don't pay me. I'm sure I can outwork most people if you'll give me a chance.' "
His guilt over not working, over not bringing home even a small paycheck to help pay the bills, has done battle with his fear that a low-paying, stopgap job will be the end of the line. "I'm afraid it might be it," he said, "the best I could do."
How long can he hold on? He does not know.
Gayle Sharlow does not blame her husband for what has happened to them. She blames the company he was once part of, they were all part of, body and soul.
The layoff of a senior manager is hardly a new phenomenon in modern America; Jim Sharlow saw it happening all around him. But when his turn came, it shocked him. Mr. Sharlow, who missed watching his daughters grow up because he routinely put in 12- and 14-hour days, believed that he was part of a company family.
The company discarded him six months short of the date he needed for a decent pension.
"He gave them 26 years, and it meant nothing," said his older daughter, Karen.
Karen, who is 26, and her 21-year-old sister, Laurie, still live at home, and both have seen their own lives and expectations altered forever by the layoff of the man who once stood for everything that was solid and dependable. Neither makes enough money to help their parents, beyond paying an occasional bill. It embarrasses him to take help from them.
"I know I'll never feel safe again," he said. "I lost my job, I failed my family. I . . ." His voice trails off into a bitter silence. He was 50 when he did his first resume.
There is a painting on his living room wall of a sailboat disappearing into a tropical sunset. The boat used to represent his retirement. Now he uses that sailboat money to pay the water bill, but keeps the picture nailed firmly in place.
 
She Loved to Dance
In the winter of 1968, Jim Sharlow had a primer-brown 1947 hot-rod Chevrolet convertible, and most of his hair. He was in serious love with a good-looking woman who loved to dance. When the gray snow did not pile up too high, Batavia, N.Y., outside of Rochester, was a lot like paradise.
James and Gayle ate fried dough rolled in powdered sugar at a joint called Pontillo's and planned a life.
"He got a tax refund for $110," she said. "He was going to buy some pistons, but he got me a ring."
The only thing that could have made it better was a real job. His father had been a tool-and-die man who worked his whole life for one company, and his son, against his wishes, trained to do the same. "He wanted me to do better, to wear a tie," he said.
But when he was 23, Eastman Kodak recruited him, trained him to be a machinist, promised him a long and happy future. Everyone in Batavia knew that when you got on with Kodak, you were set for life. His father forgave his choice of careers -- it was Kodak. But his time as a blue-collar worker would be short.
Almost immediately, he started climbing. Unlike the college boys -- his bachelor of science degree in engineering management came much later -- Mr. Sharlow could use his head and hands. For the next several years, he was used in mechanical, engineering, assembly, electrical and fabricating areas, in increasingly managerial roles.
"It just seemed like overnight he went from a closet full of work shirts to a closet full of white shirts," Mrs. Sharlow said.
He remembers the first day he wore a tie. An ornery machinist cut it off with a pair of scissors, and stuck it on the wall. (He is not sure, but it might have been a clip-on).
Each promotion improved his family's quality of life. It made college a certainty for his children. And after a while, he felt comfortable being a boss. He had worked up from the bottom and there was a pride in that. If a machinist could not make a part work, Mr. Sharlow would tuck his tie in his shirt and make it himself. He felt he had earned his white shirts, his growing power.
"Kodak was everything," Mr. Sharlow said. "How far I could go seemed to depend on my own ambition."
He worked late nights, weekends, holidays. "I remember going to a dance recital and saying to Gayle, 'That girl on the end is really good.' And she said, 'Jim, that's your daughter.' "
He did dirty work for them. Years ago, back in Rochester, it was his job to find fat in some departments, then trim it. He laid off several people, some who cried, others who begged. One man killed himself.
"He was a young guy, just got married, just bought a house. A Vietnam vet. He saw the pink slip in my hand and asked, 'That for me?' I told him, 'I am afraid so.' He asked if there was anything I could do. He pleaded with me. Two months later he committed suicide. The name is gone, but I can still see the face."
In 1987, the company offered Mr. Sharlow his own small plant, making highly technical aerospace parts on military contracts, in a land where it never snowed.
His job history backs up his assertion that he is a good manager. At the Northridge plant, a subsidiary of Kodak, he increased net profit by 10 percent in his first year and by 19 percent his second. A lot of people got rich in the Reagan era, and the Sharlows, while far from rich, got their share.
"We did all right," Mr. Sharlow said. He started to play a little golf. His daughters became cheerleaders and sorority women. His wife became a power shopper.
They thought it would last forever.
 
'What Did I Do Today?'
The days inch along, like 9 A.M. traffic on the San Diego Freeway.
It has been three years since that first morning-after, when he opened his eyes and thought, "I don't have a job today." But still he shaves and showers and dresses in neatly pressed khakis and sport shirts: the executive on his day off.
"It helps with my self-esteem," he said.
The plant was shut down as a cost-cutting measure, part of an industry-wide slowdown caused by the melting cold war. Mr. Sharlow said that other California managers with the company found jobs back in New York. He asked to be transferred back, too, but he was a little too late. He might have pushed harder and faster for a return to Rochester, but even after the plant's closing was announced, he trusted the company to hold a place for him.
"I knew there were hundreds and even thousands being laid off. I guess I thought I was special. Then the day came when they made a business decision to let me go. It was, 'Bye, and don't let the door hit you.' "
His last day he went home and had four manhattans and wondered how to start over. It was the saddest day of his life.
"My dream was to retire down in St. Petersburg to a little place on the Intracoastal Waterway, with a sailboat tied up to a little dock in back," he said. "I measured the money over a lifetime to try and get there."
At noon one Thursday afternoon, his mailbox is jammed with outgoing envelopes, all resumes, follow-up letters, hopes. By afternoon it will be filled with bills and junk mail and what he has come to call "Dear John" letters: "Dear Mr. Sharlow," they say, "Thank you for your interest, but . . ." And then they promise to keep his resume on file.
In the last three years, he has sent out 2,205 resumes -- by his own, precise count. For his efforts, he has landed 10 interviews; once he was one of two finalists for a job managing a manufacturing plant in Southern California. That job had drawn 3,000 applicants.
He scours The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, The St. Petersburg Times (his mother lives in Florida and he would like to be near her), as well as trade magazines and newsletters, searching for openings for a plant manager, department head, anything that fits his experience. He will not say what he expects to be paid, but has come to realize that it will not approach his old salary.
One potential employer told Mr. Sharlow that he could not hire him because his company could not give the kind of pay and benefits he had come to expect. As the months tumble by, he wonders how many jobs he lost because, once in a fat period in his life, he had it too good.
He shrugged off the rejections at first. Now, his wife says, "You see him sitting there, and you can feel the disappointment coming off him."
Mr. Sharlow has always been a Republican, and he still is. His troubles, he believes, do not have a lot to do with politics. A big corporation decided it would make more money without him than with him or his plant, and that desire for a slightly wider profit margin cost him his job. He does not see that kind of thinking as singularly Republican.
He has refused to become a couch potato, could care less about "General Hospital." He does chores. He runs errands for a shut-in elderly neighbor. He wishes his dog, Scooter, had not died. Scooter was good company.
The evenings are the worst for him, when his wife comes home tense and tired from a lousy day. He sits on his couch and thinks: "What did I do today? What did I do?"
 
Bigger Than All of Them
The meeting room is wall to wall with well-dressed men and women like Mr. Sharlow, cloaked in double-breasted armor, shielding a rumpled reality. It is one of the rules here at 40-Plus, a self-help organization of laid-off, white-collar workers in Los Angeles: Continue to dress like someone important, stay in character. Fortune 500 companies seldom hire managers who spend six days a week in their bathrobes, watching reruns of "Ironside."
There is a woman who lost her sales job and then her husband, because he valued her less without the paycheck. There is a graying former supervisor who believes he was laid off because he was too old, and a younger man angry that the Japanese owners who took over his insurance company let him go with no warning.
They pore over want ads, talk job-hunting strategy, train to re-enter the modern, meaner corporate reality, and try not to be bitter about the fact that they have enough discarded brain power here to run many companies. They drink coffee, but have to get it themselves.
"It's not hopeless," said the president, Ben Cate, but it is bleak. One of their number had just found a good job, and the others grilled him about his resume, negotiations, salary, searching for the secret.
For Mr. Sharlow, this group is important in another way. When he sees the other tossed-aside executives, it proves he is not alone, that something bigger than him is to blame.
When he walks into this place, his whole manner changes. He is back in an office, he has a purpose. His step quickens, his confidence seems to swell. He is like a hooked fish let loose again in a stream.
 
A Reminder of Poverty
The hardships of other families that have lost a regular paycheck are still only an echo for them. Gayle Sharlow hears it clearest. She has heard it before. Her daughters have never been close to poor; neither has her husband.
Her father was a hard-working carpenter who did his best to provide, but they often lived from paycheck to paycheck, and luxuries were scarce. For her, the threat of poverty is too familiar, like a ripped dress she thought she had thrown away for good, but may have to wear again.
Listen to her:
"I grew up with nothing, absolutely nothing. This layoff gnaws at my guts. It's a fear. I stock up on soap and paper towels because I'm afraid we might run out and not be able to afford any more. I try not to lose hope, but I'm afraid we will lose the house, everything. Gone. It's not silly to think about. It happens to people, people we know. I get mad and want to say, 'You'll just have to get a job at McDonald's.' But we keep up the front. I still go to the mall, but I do a lot more looking than buying. We still go to dinner. And at night I go for my walks so they can't see me cry."
Behind the front, there have been difficult choices. When her father was ill recently, she agonized over whether to pay $1,300 for the last-minute plane ticket to go see him. She chose not to go.
There are times when she wishes they had never left Batavia, that the house was smaller, their dreams more modest. There would be less to lose then.
Mr. Sharlow got a year's severance pay when he was laid off, so only in the last two years has he had to peel from their original savings of about $300,000. The withdrawals, countered by profits on his investments, have left him with about $250,000. The bulk of their nest egg is in a 401K -- an ever-changing mix of mutual funds, stocks and bonds. He juggles them now and then, trying to squeeze out every penny.
That means he sometimes is more aggressive -- they now have no money in CD's because interest is low -- and sometimes less. He only gambles in the stock market when he is almost sure he will win. Two winters ago, when the market dropped sharply, he sold and put the money elsewhere. He knows the key to the market is long-term investment, but he could not afford to watch their savings vanish.
He has not borrowed; he does not even use his credit card. He makes sure that he meets his life insurance premium. To drop it would be unthinkable, selfish.
The Sharlows have come to like California, but the cost of living is sucking up their money. They would sell the house, move to a less-expensive neighborhood, but the market is bad and the 1994 earthquake did damage still unrepaired. And besides, the house has come to represent roots, stability. Giving it up would be admitting they have lost.
The living room has cracks in the ceiling, but for now the house and family are intact. Mr. Sharlow says his wife is supportive, that they do not have the ugly yelling fights -- and worse -- that have ripped other families apart in the wake of a layoff. The Sharlows rarely talk about Gayle's fears for the same reason she does her crying out of sight: She believes he has enough to worry about.
"Everyone should know. He has always been a very good provider for his family," she said. "I want to make sure everyone understands that."
They hear of others, many others, who did come apart under the pressure. One man had a nervous breakdown, left his family and moved to New Jersey, to live with his mother. They know men barely clinging to marriages and self-respect. Another laid-off executive and acquaintance of Mr. Sharlow killed himself over Christmas. Mr. Sharlow thinks that maybe he lost hope.
"Don't think Jim Sharlow and his family are typical," said Mr. Cate, the 40-Plus president. "They're not. They're doing good."
 
Life Lessons
Their childhoods were as carefree as love and money could make them.
"When it happened, what bothered me was, I couldn't get a new car," said Laurie Sharlow, who was in her teens then. "I know that sounds really bad, but that's the way it was then."
This is the way it is now: "When I ask dad for $20, I'm ashamed."
The layoff that shocked and hurt their father and chilled their mother did all these things to Laurie and Karen. It also made them angry.
"We've been taught our whole lives that if you give your loyalty to someone or something, it gives you something back," Karen said. "In our house, we didn't even use anything that wasn't Kodak, Kodak film, Kodak cameras."
The loyalty was all one-sided. To them, the corporate family is no more real than any other fairy tale their father told in their childhoods, a fairy tale now replaced with a harsh sensibility that seems out of place on young women, who pledged Tri Delta.
"No one will take care of you," Karen said. "We know."
"I know I don't cry much anymore," said Laurie, who studies television and filmmaking at California State University at Northridge, and works part time as a secretary. All the things that seemed so important, boyfriends, parties, have been shoved into perspective, cheating her out of a period in her life that should have been carefree. "I missed a lot," she said.
Karen works in the international retail department of Warner Brothers, part of the new growth industry in Southern California. Although she makes only about $30,000 a year, she saves as much as she can, preparing for a repeat of what happened to her father, knowing it might never come, unwilling to take a chance.
In better times, she would have probably moved into her own place, because her father would have been able to help. Now she saves the rent money, and, like her sister, lives in her old room, its walls covered with pictures of fresh-faced girls in cheerleader outfits and prom dresses. Everyone is smiling.
The layoff came too late to take everything, but it took their peace of mind.
"I feel guilty," Mr. Sharlow said. "One of the girls will see something they'd like to have and I'll say, 'When daddy gets a job.' "
He would like to promise his daughters, his wife and the man in the mirror that everything will be fine again, but the "Dear John" letters keep coming, the phone still does not ring. Even now, three years later, he is still vaguely disbelieving that all this has happened, that the company -- he still refers to it as "my" company -- is no longer part of his life.
"It's like you're standing outside the castle," he said, "watching the drawbridge go up."
In December, the Sharlows took a Florida vacation they could not afford. They walked along St. Petersburg Beach, the executive and his family on holiday. He caught himself scanning the real estate, looking for a house with a dock in back, with room for a boat.
 
Epilogue: Winter
The guilt won its battle over pride. Jim Sharlow went to work.
He wakes up early again, but does not put on a suit and no one notices if his shoes are shined. He took a temporary job at the college where his wife works. Technically, he is a consultant in its electronics department, but most days he works with his hands again, repairing televisions, video cameras, VCRs and other broken equipment. He makes less money than Gayle.
"I don't manage people now," he said. He carries a screwdriver. It was supposed to last just three months, but he got a one-month extension.
Now and then he sees things on the job he would do differently, he would do better, if it were up to him, "but no one is interested in what I have to say now."
It all came down to the simple fact that he could no longer stand to wait: for the good job, for his tired wife to get home. Now the two ride to work together some days. The transmission in the Mercedes slips so badly that sometimes he has to beg it to roll.
He will not say how much he earns now, only that if the job lasted all year, he would still earn a little less than Gayle's $30,000 salary, which they used to consider "a nice little extra." They make enough money to pay their mortgage, as well as some, but not all, of their bills. But they still have to borrow from savings. "It just won't be as much. In that, it's a blessing," he said.
For Gayle, it did not bring the relief she expected, only what they had really known all along, that "you can't build a life on this."
In some ways he is back where he started, with tools in his hands. But instead of a young man looking toward his future, he is middle-aged, and dreaming backwards.
"I was an operations manager for a plant, and I was a damn good one," he said. "The thing I hate about this is the fear -- no, fear isn't a strong enough word, it's terror -- that I'd just better forget my dreams and do this, and do it for the rest of my life. Maybe this is it.
"Maybe this is the best I can get."

Women's World Cup
After staging the 1994 World Cup with such enormous success, the United States is virtually assured of being the host country for the 1999 Women's World Cup, especially since no other country submitted a bid with FIFA. Australia and Chile had both expressed interest in staging the quadrennial event, but the deadline passed last Friday without either nation issuing a formal proposal. 
 Sixteen countries will participate in the 32-match tournament, which will be staged for 17 days in June 1999 in approximately six stadiums, all on the East Coast and, except for R.F.K. Stadium, all on college campuses.
The official announcement that the Americans would be the host of the third World Cup for women -- the others were held in China in 1991 and Sweden in 1995 -- will be made by FIFA at an executive committee meeting in Zurich on May 31, the day before it awards the 2002 World Cup for men to either Japan or South Korea.
While the United States men's soccer program struggles to establish itself internationally, the American women are already a power, having won the inaugural championship in 1991 and finished third in 1995.
 
Free Transfers in Europe
To comply with a court ruling, the European Soccer Federation has abolished international transfer fees for players within the European Economic Area. This group includes the 15 European Union nations, plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.
This move followed the decision to remove the limit on the number of foreigners playing for European clubs, which had been three. That move was made to comply with the European Court of Justice's judgment on the Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman. The court ruled that the transfer fees and quotas on foreign players contravened laws granting equal access to employment to citizens of all 15 member nations.
The European soccer federation -- UEFA -- resisted the changes, claiming that it benefited the rich clubs and would lead small clubs to financial ruin. Lennart Johansson, the president of UEFA, was quoted in Germany yesterday as saying, "What we have ahead of us is chaos."
Uncertainty remains over the future of domestic transfer systems, since UEFA's concessions apply only to players moving between clubs in different countries.
 
Olympics
Argentina and Brazil, two of the world's powers, qualified for the Atlanta Summer Olympics on Sunday. Argentina beat Venezuela by 2-0 on goals by Herman Crespo and Claudio Lopez. Brazil eliminated Uruguay, 3-1, with the help of two goals from Juninho, who plays for Middlesborough in the English League.
 
Major League Soccer
The Metrostars, who will play their games at Giants Stadium, were the most active team in numerous trades that highlighted the league's collegiate and supplemental draft yesterday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Charlie Stillitano, the vice president and general manager of the Metro stars, said by telephone from Fort Lauderdale that he had "accomplished exactly what we wanted."
The Metrostars got Nicola Caricola, the experienced defender from Italy, as the first overall selection in the draft as a result of a deal with D.C. United, the team based in Washington.
In the other two rounds of the draft, the Metrostars got two young Brazilians, Juninho and Tulio. Juninho is a 23-year-old midfielder, and Tulio is a 21-year-old forward.
In the three rounds of the college draft, the Metrostars selected defender Scott Lamphear of Wisconsin, midfielder Miles Joseph of Clemson and forward Hamisi Amani-Dove of Rutgers.
 
Italy
Sampdoria dealt a blow to Fiorentina's flickering title hopes on Sunday by holding on for a 2-2 deadlock in Florence that allowed AC Milan to widen its lead atop the league to 7 points.
Milan, which thrashed Vicenza by 4-0 on Saturday in a match brought forward to allow the former European champions an extra day to prepare for a UEFA Cup match today, has 53 points, compared with Fiorentina's 46 and Parma's 43.
The tie with Sampdoria was a disappointment for Fiorentina, which will have to face Milan again in the league, but it could have been far worse for the Florentines because Sampdoria scored the first two goals before goals by Rui Costa and Anselmo Robbiati evened matters.
Inter joined Sampdoria in surprising the pundits, beating Lazio by 1-0 at the Olympic Stadium in Rome with a 63d minute goal from Benito Carbone. That result did not change the league standing, but brought Inter to within a point of fifth-place Lazio.
 
Germany
Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga in style on Saturday, thanks to a four-goal burst in the first 30 minutes of the local derby with 1860 Munich.
Two goals apiece from Juergen Klinsmann and Alexander Zickler enabled Bayern, the 13-time champion, to score a 4-2 triumph, while defending champion Borussia Dortmund scrambled to a 2-2 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach and dropped to second.
Bayern's triumph was the perfect preparation for today's UEFA Cup quarterfinal against England's Nottingham Forest in Munich. ALEX YANNIS

When Elmer Gantry Was a Color Man

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
In today's boxing telecasts, somebody talks nearly all the time. Sometimes it's good talk, sometimes it's bad. Usually it's too much. And sometimes HBO's George Foreman, pretending to be a doctor, shouts out his diagnoses.
But one day before the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight -- which occurred 25 years ago this Friday -- the announcer Don Dunphy said: "I'm working these rounds solo. Burt Lancaster can talk between rounds." 
 Yes, Burt Lancaster. Birdman turned analyst. Archie Moore was there, too, but Lancaster overwhelmed him. The late actor was a close friend of the co-promoter, Jerry Perenchio.
"He was a big fight fan," said Perenchio. "We went to the fights together. We went to Atlanta to see Ali's first comeback fight against Jerry Quarry. Then we went to a theater in L.A. to watch Ali fight Oscar Bonavena. We loved the good old days of Don Dunphy and the Saturday night fights. I knew Burt could help promote the fight. He even sparred a round with Ali. Ali slapped him around. Burt's body was kind of red after that."
A tape of the fight (thanks to the Classic Sports Network, the best cable service that Time Warner New York City Cable has not put on) shows a modest production with three cameras, no features, no PunchStat figures and no Don King. Dunphy did his by-then-classic type of call: a calm, distilled, factual narrative that left room for silence. Dunphy had done boxing alone on radio for too long to allow intrusion from non-professionals. "When two or three people do blow-by-blow, they overtalk and emphasize too much," he said yesterday.
Lancaster was an actor doing sports. He read opening comments from Ali's dressing room from cue cards. He appeared to know boxing decently, like a fan, but not like a Gil Clancy. His commentary was short on analysis, long on hero worship. He and Dunphy hardly connected. Moore was nearly silent.
"Frazier is a little man, but he's a Sherman tank," film's Elmer Gantry said after Round 3. After Round 8, he said, "It's something, boy!" Describing a replay after Round 9, he said, "Look, slow motion, look at him go!"
After the fight, as the Madison Square Garden ring crowded to capacity with people awaiting the decision, Lancaster made his way into the squared circle. But he was let down by the producer; twice he told viewers that a replay of Frazier's 15th-round knockdown of Ali was coming, but it was never shown.
Said Dunphy: "He took a crash course in boxing with Jimmy Jacobs before the fight. It didn't help much." Perenchio's memory differs: "He did his homework. He worked with Jacobs. He worked side by side with me for three months, holding my hand, going to the camps. He loved it."
To Dunphy, the bout was "the greatest sports event of all time up to that point." To Perenchio, then an agent and promoter, it was a great fight and a perfect mating of sports and show biz. He and Jack Kent Cooke put up $2.5 million apiece for Ali and Frazier; the fight grossed over $30 million from all sources, including closed-circuit TV. Theatergoers paid $20 each to watch it.
But what sticks with Perenchio most was a scene soon after Frazier's victory by decision. In Ali's dressing room, Perenchio saw a woman kneeling at the fighter's feet, an arm around his calves, her head resting on his knee. She was sobbing uncontrollably. Said Perenchio: "He took her head, turned it around to see me, and said, 'Diana, take a look at the man who paid me $2.5 million to get whupped.' It was Diana Ross."
 
Much Ado About Packer
 No one knows what made CBS's Billy Packer refer to Georgetown guard Allen Iverson as a "tough monkey" Saturday. Perhaps Packer does not know. The phrase came out. It was unfortunate. But there is no reason to think the comment carried racial overtones, although it totes that baggage -- intended or not. Every sportscaster should have excised "monkey" from their vocabulary 13 years ago when Howard Cosell called the Redskins' Alvin Garrett a "little monkey" on "Monday Night Football." And since then, society has become hypersensitive to verbal offenses, real or imagined.
But Packer's slip was not another ugly visit to the antediluvian land of Al Campanis, Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder, Chris Economaki or Ben Wright. Once apprised of making the comment, Packer apologized. So did CBS. No stonewalling. It lived on tape and could not be denied.
Packers and his employer's quick and humble responses were exactly what should have been done after Wright's lesbian remarks. Had Wright and CBS better understood public relations then, Wright might still work on CBS's golf coverage. (He is on a paid suspension.) Should Packer be suspended? Publicly scorned? Not unless there is a record of racism we do not know about.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Plans For Capital Are on Hold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
It was just about a year ago that Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed that the time had come to turn Washington from a crumbling city into his image of a glistening capital.
Setting out to reverse years of mismanagement in local government and frustration among residents, Mr. Gingrich appointed a committee of five House Republicans to study new approaches to public housing, safety, human services, taxes and education. 
 But eight months after the lawmakers presented ideas that would have fundamentally changed how the city has operated for two decades under home rule, the Republicans' vision has languished, trapped not only because of ideological conflicts with Democrats and the demands of balancing the budget, but also by Presidential-year politics: neither side, it seems, has much to lose in a city with only three electoral votes.
So far, only one of the Republicans' new ideas has been taken up in Congress, and that one, a watered-down proposal for school vouchers attached to the District of Columbia's 1996 appropriation bill, along with a rider that would limit spending local money for abortions, has been the main reason the measure has failed in two votes in the Senate. It is expected to fail again on Tuesday when the Senate reconsiders the bill.
"I'm just speechless that we can't get the education reforms through the Senate," said Jack Howard, an aide to Mr. Gingrich, "but we're going to keep trying. We'll keep looking for vehicles to get some of these things through. And if we need to, we'll create them."
The failure of the Republicans to carry out their ideas does not mean that nothing is being done to prepare the city for the future. Two weeks ago, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., a Democrat who has been in office for 14 of the last 18 years, unveiled his own proposals, which include eliminating a quarter of the city's 40,000 jobs within four years and changing how services are delivered.
A financial control board, appointed last year by President Clinton to steer the city out of debt and to a balanced budget by 1999, also has the authority to suggest ideas.
But from the moment they were announced, the Republican initiatives have met steady criticism from opponents, including local leaders who complained that the proposals would violate the spirit of home rule and Federal lawmakers who wondered how Mr. Gingrich intended to pay for the new ideas when Congress is cutting almost everywhere to balance the budget in seven years. For example, a plan by one member of the committee, Representative Amo Houghton of Corning, N.Y., to create tax incentives and empowerment zones in the District would cost $2.76 billion over four years.
And many leading Democrats have argued that Republicans are using the District only as an experiment for their urban policy.
Mr. Howard said Mr. Gingrich responded quickly to the criticism by narrowing the efforts for change, to push first for education overhaul, since the city's crumbling school system is often cited as its most pressing need.
As a result, a package developed by Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin was the first of the panel's initiatives to be drafted into legislation. Mr. Gunderson devised a $15 million package that included $5 million for a voucher program that would permit up to 1,600 children from low-income families to attend a private or religious school.
The Gunderson proposal, and its rider, were attached to the city's 1996 appropriation bill, annual legislation that usually sails through Congress.
It passed the House in November. But even with compromise language added to give Washington's City Council power to authorize any money spent on school vouchers, a concession to home rule, the bill has stalled in the Senate, and White House officials have said the President will veto any bill with public financing for private schools.
"It's legislative blackmail," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today in an interview, referring to Republican efforts to attach social-policy measures to appropriation bills.
The city has received all but $219 million of this year's $660 million budget through stopgap spending bills, and with it expected to run out of money by April 1, Representative James T. Walsh, the Syracuse Republican who heads the House District Appropriation Subcommittee, has promised to push through a spending bill free of attachments.
But that does not mean Republicans plan to abandon their efforts.
"In reality, if we wanted to use this for a huge national debate, we could. We control the place," said Mr. Howard, the Speaker's aide. "We're not interested in a national debate. We just want to fix the schools."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE MAYOR;
Giuliani Tepidly Backs Dole, but Only to Block Buchanan

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
It was considerably less than a full-throated endorsement, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani finally informed the city yesterday of his intention to vote for Senator Bob Dole in Thursday's New York primary, mildly suggesting that fellow Republicans consider doing likewise.
If they do so with the same lack of enthusiasm as the Mayor displayed yesterday, Mr. Dole may be in for trouble. Mr. Giuliani said he would vote for the Senator only to parry the candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, whom he denounced in terms far more forceful than any he employed to praise Mr. Dole. In fact, the Mayor said, Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, would be an equally good choice for those seeking to send an anti-Buchanan message. 
 "Whatever you call this, it is not an endorsement," the Mayor said at a City Hall news conference. "I'd invite others to follow my lead if they want to. If they don't, then I would tell them, please vote for Steve Forbes. The only thing I'm really urging them to do is do not vote for Pat Buchanan."
The Mayor mentioned no particular policies or positions of Mr. Dole that had led him to his choice and said he would not be with Mr. Dole at any of the local appearances planned for the next few days. The best Mr. Giuliani could say about the Kansas Senator was that he was a "positive force" who had always tried hard to bring people together, adding a quick mention of Mr. Dole's courage in battle during World War II.
By contrast, he condemned Mr. Buchanan in terms so strong he almost seemed to be talking about one of his local political enemies.
"Pat Buchanan represents really everything that's just totally inconsistent with what New York City is all about," he said. "For some reason, he finds everything about us repulsive, and I think we should respond in kind by voting against him in very, very large numbers."
For months, the Mayor had refused to join every other major Republican official in the state in lining up behind the Senate majority leader, primarily because the Mayor has no use for the Senator's principal patron in New York, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Mr. Giuliani also said he could damage Mr. Buchanan far more effectively if he were not seen as a proponent of one candidate or another.
But considering that some of the Mayor's closest friends and allies are involved in Mr. Dole's New York campaign, he had little choice in the matter if he wanted to avoid setting afire once again the political bridges he has worked hard to repair since he endorsed the Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, 17 months ago.
The chairman of the Dole campaign in New York City is Guy V. Molinari, the Borough President of Staten Island, with whom the Mayor is once again close. In Mr. Giuliani's own East Side district, the Dole delegates include some of his closest legislative allies in Albany and on the City Council, as well as one of his own employees, Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Several of those allies said they were pleased that the Mayor had provided even halfhearted support for their candidate, although they had hoped for something a bit less tepid. Mr. Molinari said he was surprised and a bit disappointed that the Mayor had essentially co-endorsed Mr. Forbes. But he acknowledged that support for Mr. Dole around the state was soft, and said that Mr. Giuliani's comments, at least, could not hurt.
"We don't find too many voters voicing strong support for Dole," he said. "It's not like it was for Ronald Reagan or even George Bush. So the Mayor saying he'll vote for Dole, well, that's got to help. Maybe it'll bring in some of those people who were undecided."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
Dole's Rivals Stake Their Ground Before Biggest Primary Day Yet

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 4

 BODY:
From a carpet factory in LaGrange, Ga., to a boat house in Burlington, Vt., to a paper mill in Bangor, Me., the Republican Presidential candidates scattered up and down the East today for a final burst of campaigning on the eve of the biggest day of voting thus far.
Faced with polls showing that Senator Bob Dole was leading in most of the eight states voting on Tuesday, his opponents aggressively sought a breakthrough in what for some could be a do-or-die Election Day. 
 Lamar Alexander, already looking beyond Tuesday's primaries, said he would drop out if he did not win Florida next week. Patrick J. Buchanan, the former columnist, was hoping for an upset in Georgia Tuesday to reignite his campaign.
Mr. Dole, buoyed by a fresh tribute from Speaker Newt Gingrich, savored his renewed front-runner status. But he also sought to play down expectations, insisting that the race was far from over.
Voters will pick 208 of the 996 national convention delegates, with Georgia's 42 the biggest single prize. Besides primaries in Colorado and Maryland, there is a bloc of contests in the Yankee states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.
At every stop today, the Dole campaign sought to convey an air of inevitability after Mr. Dole's victory in South Carolina on Saturday. Under the bright sun at a recycling plant here this morning, for example, the stage was crowded with five United States Senators, one former Senator, three House members and an assortment of state and local dignitaries.
But in the celebratory atmosphere, Mr. Dole sounded a note of caution. "This race is far from over, even if we're successful tomorrow," he told the crowd. "It's going to go on and on -- and probably on."
From here, Mr. Dole flew to New York, where he and Steve Forbes will be in essentially a head-to-head competition in the primary on Thursday.
Rather than talking about what states they needed to win the nomination, Mr. Dole's rivals found themselves dogged by questions about which states they needed to win -- or place respectably in -- to stay in the race.
Mr. Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, was perhaps feeling the most pressure because he had built his campaign on performing well in his native South and has yet to place higher than third in any state. At a news conference in Boston this evening, he staked his campaign on winning the delegate-rich state of Florida which, along with Texas, holds its primary on March 12.
"Everybody wants to know when I'll get out of the race," Mr. Alexander said. "My answer is, if Bob Dole beats me in Florida, I'll get out."
In a testament to the scattered nature of the primaries on Tuesday, Mr. Alexander started his day here, raced up north to deliver a talk about the environment at a boat house on Lake Champlain in Burlington, then traveled to Boston, and then wound up back in Atlanta for the night. The temperatures ran from hot to cold -- not just the voters' assessment of candidates but the weather.
Mr. Buchanan, who has been trailing Mr. Dole in every poll in Georgia, today stopped talking about how he needed "a dramatic win" on Tuesday.
Campaigning at a commercial park in Roswell, north of here, he was careful in his word choice, saying: "I think we've got to do well to pick up momentum, to regain momentum. But if we do well here, I genuinely believe we can crack open the South."
From there, on an abbreviated bus tour, Mr. Buchanan went to a carpet factory in LaGrange, southwest of here, where he trumpeted his protectionist trade policies.
While Mr. Buchanan kept his focus on Georgia -- hoping that voters would be receptive to his outspokenness against abortion and his message of economic nationalism -- Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana concentrated on the tiny state of Vermont, which he described as make or break.
He suggested that if he does not place first or second there or anywhere else, he will have a hard time pressing forward.
"As long as I have momentum, and money, I will continue," Mr. Lugar said in an interview. "When both run out, I will be concluding graciously."
But Mr. Gingrich, at a news conference this morning, said Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Forbes, the publisher, were the only two candidates beside Mr. Dole who had any business staying in the race.
"I think you've got another three or four weeks, and I think that Forbes and Buchanan have every right to take a shot at him and see, you know, can they knock him off stride," he said.
Yet, Mr. Gingrich was clearly betting on Mr. Dole. "If tomorrow night is as good as it could be for him," he said, "I think his lead will be very, very big by sometime Wednesday."
After months of staying on the sidelines and even toying with running himself, Speaker Gingrich travelled here to his district in Marietta to file his absentee ballot and give his blessing to Mr. Dole, calling him "the next President." Mr. Gingrich was initially coy at a morning news conference, hinting, but refusing to declare that he had actually voted for Mr. Dole.
But after Mr. Dole publicly thanked the Speaker for voting for him, Mr. Gingrich clarified his decision in a statement.
"I would never reject the gratitude of the next President," Mr. Gingrich said. "Bob Dole is a close personal friend and great leader. Together we passed the balanced budget, tax cuts and welfare reform, which when he is President will all be signed into law." He closed with this key sentence, "And, I did vote for him this morning."
Mr. Dole told reporters that Mr. Gingrich told him last week that he would vote for him, and aides to both men had said they had agreed that the Speaker would announce his decision after voting here.
Mr. Dole's opponents dismissed Mr. Gingrich's support for the Senator as an example of two insiders helping each other out.
Saying it was not up to Mr. Gingrich to decide who stays in the race, Mr. Forbes, who toured a paper mill in Bangor today, explained, "The voters make that decision, not political leaders."
Mr. Alexander, still portraying himself as a Washington outsider, put it this way: "All of the Washington politicians tend to endorse one another. I think the best thing for Newt and the others to do is to let the voters decide."
Among the Senators who rallied around Mr. Dole today were Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucuses, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had been Mr. Gramm's campaign chairman.
Today, Mr. McCain did his best to lower the expectations. "There are so many land mines out there," he said. "What if Steve Forbes spends his $2 million in New York? What if Buchanan tears off one of those conservative states? When you expect it to be a day at the beach, you get a hurricane."

HEADLINE: Finding Profit in Aiding the Lost;
A Civilian Industry Is Built on the Military's Locator Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
It is a navigational system designed in the 1970's to guide troops and missiles, but in the 1990's it has come to be used far more often for helping truckers, boaters and hikers find their way.
So in an example of beating swords into sextants, the White House is about to announce a policy for insuring continued civilian use of the Air Force's Global Positioning System -- a 24-satellite network that enables users with small portable radio receivers to determine their precise location anywhere on land, sea or in the air. 
 The White House policy statement would for the first time detail the rights of use for the commercial G.P.S. industry, thus removing the longstanding implicit threat that military priorities could disrupt the civilian navigational system at any time. By bringing a new measure of certainty to a business that has so far developed ad hoc, analysts and executives in the industry say the market for the receiving equipment and services could quadruple to $8.4 billion a year by the end of the decade.
"The fact is that there has been silence from the Government while G.P.S. applications have jumped ahead of policy," said Scott Pace, an author of a recent Rand Corporation study that was commissioned by the White House. The study recommended that national security concerns not interfere with the vast commercial opportunities available with the satellite system.
"A stable and clear policy needs to be presented to help with both public and private decision making about G.P.S. systems," Mr. Pace said.
Industry executives are enthusiastic about the policy statement, which White House officials say is being prepared by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and is expected to be released by President Clinton within a few weeks. The document will commit the United States to continuing to finance the positioning system for the foreseeable future and make it available for use internationally without the imposition of user fees or other commercial restrictions.
"The commercial industry is poised to explode," said Randy Hoffman, president of the Magellan Systems Corporation in San Dimas, Calif., a leading maker of commercial navigation equipment. "The Presidential policy will bring stability to the market."
A crucial part of the new policy is expected to be the eventual phasing out of a national security proviso known as selective availability -- a crucial restriction that has limited the use of the technology for some civilian applications requiring a high degree of precision, like all-weather airplane landings.
When the military uses the system, as it did in troop positioning in the desert during the Persian Gulf war, the communications with the satellites are done via scrambled radio signals that are useless to anyone not privy to the code. These signals allow almost pinpoint accuracy, so that a tank on the ground or a fighter jet aloft can determine its position within feet. But the commercially available satellite signals, which are not scrambled, are modified to allow accuracy only within several hundred feet -- to keep potential foreign enemies from employing the signal to precisely aim their own weapons.
The "selective availability" policy has, in effect, deliberately blurred the vision of the civilian G.P.S. frequencies. And it has also given the United States the option of interfering with even the unscrambled signals at any time, if deemed necessary by military strategists. But that limitation and the uncertainty of the situation will eventually be removed.
Longstanding Pentagon opposition to the combined military and civilian use of the technology has subsided as the Defense Department has concluded that selective availability is not the only, or even the best, way to deny hostile military forces the advantages of the location system.
"My feeling is that in the future the U.S. Government will design military G.P.S. receivers so they are able to operate in a radio jamming environment," said Michael Swiek, executive secretary of the United States G.P.S. Industry Council, an industry group devoted to commercial development of the technology.
As part of the White House policy statement, officials say, the Government will announce that it will work with foreign governments to devise a series of regional agreements aimed at developing standard ways to enhance the accuracy of the positioning signals and to insure that the signals cannot be used by hostile forces.
The move will clear the way for the Federal Aviation Administration to proceed with its recent decision to adopt the technology as a supplemental means of navigation domestically and as the primary means of navigation over oceans. The agency is also developing an enhanced system known as the Wide-Area Augmentation System, that will sharply increase airline navigational accuracy over the one-third of the globe centered on the United States. The system will allow commercial airliners to fly more direct routes to their destinations beginning in 1998 and by the year 2001 will permit instruments-only approaches to as many as 8,000 airports -- up from fewer than 1,000 today.
The new White House policy is an attempt to overcome reservations by European and Asian governments about supporting commercial development of an industry that would rely on what has until now been seen as primarily an American military system. And yet, the policy is intended to maintain the technological leadership of the United States in this area and discourage foreign attempts to develop competing systems.
Already, a Russian network of 24 satellites, known as Glonass, is in operation, with no artificially introduced limits on accuracy, but as yet there are no low-cost receivers being sold for use with Glonass.
Although the Air Force's complete 24-satellite system did not go into full operation until last year, the first civilian uses began more than a decade ago. In 1983, after a Korean Airlines jet that strayed into Sovietair space was shot down by the Soviet Air Force, President Ronald Reagan announced that the United States would make the fledgling system available for civilian aviation. He established the Department of Transportation as the civilian agency that would share management responsibility for the system with the Pentagon.
By the late 1980's, trucking companies and ship fleets had begun to use the satellite-based navigational systems, even though the receiving gear cost tens of thousands of dollars. But by the time of the gulf war in 1991, consumer models of hand-held receivers cost $1,000 or less. That meant that while military commanders were using the sophisticated scrambled-signal systems for strategic and tactical planning, American troops were using inexpensive receivers simply to find their way around the sands of Kuwait and Iraq.
As the expense of such systems has plummeted in recent years -- aided by the falling cost of microelectronic components -- dozens of new applications have begun to emerge. It is now possible to buy a hand-held receiver in a sporting goods store for back-country hiking for less than $200, and the price is expected to continue to decline. Designers are now focusing on a range of innovative applications that include embedding G.P.S. receivers in hand-held cellular telephones and portable personal computers.
Car makers and car-rental companies have made dashboard navigation systems available for several years. One system now under design would link a G.P.S. receiver to both the car's airbag and its cellular phone. That would permit the automobile to instantly and automatically signal its location in the event of an accident.
Today the market is split into different segments. The Magellan Systems Corporation is the dominant player in the hand-held and recreational market, while Trimble Navigation Ltd. is perceived as the overall technology leader in industrial and business markets ranging from mapping systems to vehicle navigation. Motorola Inc. is also a major player in the vehicle navigation market, while the Rockwell International Corporation is the leader in military sales and also in vehicle navigation. Honeywell Inc. is a leader in aviation systems. Smaller companies like Ashtech Inc. based in Sunnyvale, Calif., have focused on such specialized markets as surveying and seismic monitoring where high accuracy is required.
Japanese electronics companies are also active in the market, including the Sony Corporation, which has focused on car navigation, and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which is active in the recreational market with products bearing the Panasonic brand.
On the horizon are applications for the handicapped and elderly. For example, one system now being developed would act as an electronic guide, using synthetic speech to allow a blind person to navigate independently.
Other uses include emergency location systems for Alzheimer's patients and systems that permit tracking of vehicles like ambulances and vans that transport the elderly.
Other, less serious applications appear to be limited only by the designer's imagination. For example, golf carts available at 30 courses around the country are equipped to provide precise data on how far a ball is away from the hole, using a system developed by Proshot Golf of Newport Beach, Calif.
Call it the G.P.S. caddy: the system, using software that incorporates recommendations from pros, advises the techno-duffer on which club to use for the next shot.


GRAPHIC: The Air Force's Global Positioning System consists of 24 satellites, equally divided among 6 orbits. Each satellite, which is 11,000 miles out in space, continously emits a radio signal that can be received by portable computing devices on land, on sea or in the air. By picking up the signal from four or more satellites, the computer can determine the user's location within 20 to 300 yards of the exact postion, depending on how finely the unit is calibrated.

HEADLINE: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA;
More Than Money, They Miss the Pride a Good Job Brought

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: TORRANCE, Calif.

 BODY:
The wedge-shaped B-2 Stealth bomber sliced through the brownish-blue California haze. Robert Muse lay back on the hood of the pickup and watched it fly, like a boy gauging the progress of his paper airplane.
"Some of me may be in that plane," he said. "My parts. I helped make it fly." 
 The jet was executing what aircraft workers call a flyover, a low-altitude pass, staged so employees at the Northrop Grumman Aircraft Division could view their creation against a canvas of clouds. Mr. Muse was laid off from his job as a machinist two years ago, but he came to the flyover anyway, to be part of it.
Even now, so long after his job disappeared, he thinks of himself as an aircraft builder. The emptiness of that image of himself has been the hardest thing to accept, harder than the loss of the good money and benefits, harder than the fact that he now rides around town in a 16-year-old Datsun with no spare tire in the trunk.
For 28 of his 47 years, Mr. Muse was one of the most skilled and exacting blue-collar workers in America. Now he is a maintenance technician at half the $20 an hour he used to get. The hands that once sculpted complex components out of exotic metals now feel their way through air-conditioning ducts, trim tree branches, unclog toilets. "I do what needs doing," he said.
He is grateful for the new job because the paycheck allows his family to hold onto a three-bedroom home on a still-safe street in Torrance, just south of Los Angeles, and pays the bills, as long as they eat a lot of hot dogs and buy nothing they can do without. But the take-home pay, less than $350 a week, is more like the kind of money he made when he was a young man with no responsibilities, when the only thing he had to worry about was the gas in his car and drive-in cheeseburgers on the weekends.
He has been laid off before. But like other blue-collar workers who would lose their jobs when business was bad, he always knew there would be a call-back. What is different now, what is different for so many millions like him, is that this layoff is forever. He is left to adjust to his whittled-down dignity or live in the past.
He does a little of both.
"I know nothing is for sure in this life," he said. "But I spent 30 years at it. That should count for something. Now there's just a void."
Much of that empty space is filled with bitterness, anger. In March 1994, his company decided it could buy some parts cheaper than its own people could make them, and closed the machine shop. One moment, in the last, desperate months, sticks like a fish hook in his memory.
"A vice president walked into the meeting hall and said, 'Even if you work for nothing, you're still too expensive,' " Mr. Muse recalled.
Now, instead of company medical benefits and enough of a pension to pay for a dignified retirement, he has plaques for excellent work, certificates for perfect attendance and a transistor radio.
Here in California in the last 8 years, about 1 in 3 aerospace workers has been declared too expensive. In 1988, there were 707,000 aerospace and high-technology workers in the state; last year, the work force had slipped to 473,000, a loss of 234,000 jobs.
Up and down the streets of Torrance and Long Beach and other places where these workers made their homes, "For Sale" signs stick up like weeds. Through the trickle of laid-off workers still coming and going, the blank windows of union halls stare out on the rubble of what used to be manufacturing plants. Middle-age men who used to set rivets can now can recite the daytime TV schedule by heart.
Mr. Muse's older brother, 50-year-old Roy, was laid off by McDonnell Douglas in June 1993. He's watched so much "Oprah," he told his brother, "I began to hate men."
Another brother, 46-year-old Larry, still works in the industry but has been told his job will be history, too, someday soon. When he and his brothers congregate, drinking beer and talking airplanes, he only has to look across the kitchen table to see his future.
"It's a little like the plague," Robert Muse said.
For as long as they have been a family, he and his wife, Nancy, and their daughters, Vicky, 23, and Carrie, 17, have lived comfortably, neither rich nor poor. The layoff has created economic hardships they have never known.
But beyond even that, there is an uncertainty, a dread that if it happened once it can happen again, and drive their standard of living ever lower.
"You get scared to spend a penny," Mrs. Muse said. "Even though he has a job, you get scared he won't. You don't plan for the future any more. You live day to day."
The layoff, one Northrop manager assured the workers in those last days, was purely business, nothing personal. Mr. Muse has tried to see it that way, too, to try to lay it to rest.
He cannot.
For nearly a year, he and his family went without health insurance because they could not afford the $600 monthly premiums. He gambled no one would get sick or be hurt, and he won. But he hated it, because of the constant worry, because it was degrading, a poor man's tactic to cheat a basic working man's responsibility.
His older daughter lives with her baby and boyfriend in a dangerous neighborhood, because it is the best they can afford on their own low-paying jobs.
He wants to help them move to a better and safer place, but there is no money for it now. His worries, and his guilt, pile higher and higher.
It is personal, he says.
"It's like the company telling you that you're no damn good."
 
The Boneyard
Northrop Grumman's modest flight museum occupies a corner of the company's plant in nearby Hawthorne, monument to the soaring -- and dubious -- achievements of the industry. There is a lean fighter jet, which never flew a mission, and the stubby, radio-controlled flying bomb, which looks as if it was designed for Porky Pig.
Robert Muse walked through the boneyard of rejected, abandoned planes, pointing to a strut here or a panel there, reciting little facts about stress tolerances or heat resistance, information that used to be so vital, now just useless numbers rattling around in his head.
Across the parking lot, now mostly deserted, is the machine shop where he used to work. He used to have security passes, but the company took them away on his last day. He would have liked to have kept them, as souvenirs. It is hard not to live in the past if that is where so much of your happiness resides.
"It'll just eat you up, if you let it," he said.
He is a tall, lanky man who likes to wear cowboy boots and western shirts, to sip slow on a cold beer and flick through the channels while scratching his dog's ears. But he loved to work, because while anyone can handle the remote control, not everyone can take it apart, add a little bit of wire and a piece of tin foil and use it to open garage doors and dim the lights in the hall.
Unlike many other blue-collar workers, Mr. Muse did not simply inherit his father's place on the assembly line. His father was a straight man for magicians, the one who would volunteer from the audience to be sawed in half.
Robert Muse had no showmanship in him, but he could have told you how the tricks worked. After high school he went to work in the aircraft industry. In 1966, Douglas Aircraft hired and trained him to run a turret lathe. He was laid off in 1971, but back then a layoff was only an inconvenience.
"If one company laid you off, you were sure someone else would pick you up quick," he said, "We called it the merry-go-round."
Four months later, he was making precision parts for Northrop. The job lasted 22 years.
The work, to a layman, sounds impossibly precise. "The cellophane on a cigarette pack is four times thicker than the margin for error on some parts," he said. It was natural that the people who did the work would be proud of it, he said. They were the blue-collar elite. Not just anyone could do the work. The math alone left some people dumbfounded.
"There was a feeling of, 'I'm doing my job, and I'm doing a good job. So why should it ever go away?' " he said.
On a blind date, he met Nancy, who had grown up around planes herself: her father was a pilot, her mother, a stewardess. They got married, bought a house and then, 16 years ago, moved up to a nicer one. They had two children along the way.
He volunteered for the company fire department and was the safety monitor, environmental monitor and secretary for the employee involvement group. In his spare time he souped up a 1964 Chevelle and outran Corvettes from light to light on Hawthorne Boulevard. He voted Republican, in part because Republicans were usually hawks and hawks voted for the military contracts that allowed him to be an aircraft worker.
As the Soviet Union splintered, and the implications for the defense industry became clear, the relationship between management and workers at the plant became colder, more confrontational. But even then, management assured him that his job was safe, that he would be able to retire with a company pension and health plan.
"They said, 'Don't worry. Your jobs are fine.' Go out and buy your houses,' " he recalled. "They lied to us," he said, to keep the skilled work force intact and producing, "dangling that lollipop in front of us."
But in the months before his layoff in March 1994, with their jobs clearly on the chopping block, the machinists took it on themselves to try to save the machine shop. Through harder work, less waste and rising desperation, they sliced costs, increased production, even volunteered for pay cuts.
"We told them, 'Look, we did it. We saved you money,' " Mr. Muse said. "Then they took it all away from us."
The last weeks, after the layoff was announced, were the worst, because so many workers refused to believe it was over.
"He made the comment to us several times that we shouldn't give up hope, that people are saved at the last minute," Mrs. Muse said. "He told us that sometimes, on your last day, people walk up and say, 'We found you a job.' "
The Chevelle sits in the garage now, gathering dust. "I can't afford the insurance," he said. "But I keep the registration up. I'll bring it back to life. Someday."
He is still a Republican. He is not much stirred by social issues -- he is a "live and let live" kind of man -- but he still believes in a strong defense, in building planes. Even though he is coming to terms with his life, there is still a glimmer of hope that, someday, the plants will come to life again, and that they will need him.
 
What Money Can Buy
The graffiti signal a change from Robert Muse's quiet neighborhood to the one his daughter Vicky comes home to after her part-time job at Sears. Mr. Muse looked out from his car window on treeless streets and boxlike apartment buildings, at the sidewalk where a young man traded little packets of fleeting happiness for crumpled cash.
"She lives here," Mr. Muse said. "Can you believe it?"
Over the days, as he talked about the layoff and what it had cost, he fluctuated between sadness, bitterness and anger, usually short-lived, beaten back by natural cheerfulness. Before his layoff, he was an infectiously happy man, said his friends and family, and the ghost of that is still here. But as he stared out on the street, he was disgusted, helpless: "I don't want to cry about it. But I feel like I've been stabbed in the back."
No, the heart.
 
Brothers
It takes a lot of Old Milwaukee to take the edge off three big men's fears.
The Muse brothers, all large, middle-age men with beers in their fists, sat at Robert's kitchen table and talked about the future as if it were a box that they were afraid to open. Together the men represent three stages of a journey now common throughout blue-collar America.
Robert has come the farthest: After his layoff, there was never any question that he would have to find work immediately. He took a job crawling under houses to install wiring for security alarms. It was hard, dirty work, and one day he had to share the crawl space with an unidentified, long-dead animal that had elected to tunnel under the house to die. The stench gagged him. "I thought, surely I can find something better than this," he said.
A year ago, after training in computer and electronics repair, he was hired as a maintenance technician at a company that builds solar panels. Some days he works on electronics and computers, some days he cuts weeds. He does the work with a smile, but it is all teeth, no heart.
"It's work, man," he said. He cannot even afford to stay true to a particular brand of beer. "Now, I just drink what's on sale."
Roy Muse worked for McDonnell Douglas for 29 years and was laid off six years short of qualifying for full pension and benefits, including health insurance, which he regrets more than anything. He has kidney problems, and has had to spend thousands of dollars to continue his old health insurance. Now his savings are down to nothing.
At 50, he is training to be a medical technician, in the hope of landing his own low-paying job in a growing industry. Nowadays, the Muse brothers said, it seems like all growing industries are built with the labor of low-paid and desperate people. Even so, Roy says, the competition with other retrained people is so tight that he is not sure of finding a job when his program is done.
He and his wife have three sons. Their house, their future, hang on his finding work soon. His wife has a low-paying, part-time job to help them survive, but some bills go unpaid. His unemployment insurance ran out a long time ago.
"You know you've always heard about bills piling up?" he said. "Well they do. They do pile."
Their baby brother, 45-year-old Larry, already has a layoff notice in hand from his company, also an aircraft manufacturer. "They keep stringing me along," he said, but quickly adds that he is not complaining, that he prays the company will find a place for him. "I'm still dedicated," he said, "I'm still loyal."
Unlike his brothers, whose families and nostalgia tie them down to Southern California, he is willing to move. He has been married four times, and has learned not to get attached to one particular house. He will chase work wherever it takes him. Most recently, he has been assigned to a four-month tryout with a branch plant in Lake Charles, La. "I kind of like Louisiana," he said.
Larry Muse did some quick arithmetic to calculate how much of their collective lives they had devoted to the industry.
"Seventy years," he said. "Right here."
"It was a good ride," Roy said, "wasn't it?"
Robert nodded. "Till they don't want you any more," he said.
 
Wife and Mother
The Muse house would disappoint a thief: the one obvious treasure, a big-screen television the size of a refrigerator, is too heavy to steal conveniently. Yet this modest house, so neat and clean without so much as a cushion out of place, is a museum of irreplaceable things. There is a sculpture of a child's handprint preserved in clay, and an engraved plaque with a jet plane covered in fake gold. Over their kitchen table someone has pinned a yellowed slip of paper with a priceless poem from third grade, or was it second?
"What we had was wealth," Nancy Muse said, as she stood with one foot on the immaculate beige carpet of the den and one on the gleaming linoleum of the kitchen. This is as much her world as the factory was his, and the change brought into her life by the layoff has been as painful and demeaning as what her husband endures.
"There ought to be a law against it, against taking it all away," she said. "Don't they have any conscience? Don't they care?"
She has been the backstop for the deprivations and disappointment her family endures, because she runs the house. Mrs. Muse has had to look her 17-year-old daughter in the face and tell her that promises made over a lifetime about college had been turned to lies by the layoff.
"We always told her, 'You have to go to college,' and we always told her we would help," said Mrs. Muse, a tiny, quiet woman who tends to let her husband do the talking until the conversation curves into an area where she is the expert. "Now she's a senior and it's time for us to make good on it, but all we can do is say, 'Well, uh, well. . .' "
Over the years, the Muses put away about $60,000 for their retirement. They had planned to use some of that money for Carrie's college. The plan was, as their children eventually left home, they would not only restore any missing savings but add to the nest egg, maybe even have $100,000 by age 65. It is the stuff motor homes are made of.
Now they try to hoard the $60,000 for their old age. But they fear emergencies will peel away the little they have, and they can add nothing to it because this new job pays so little. When he is 65, he will draw a tiny pension from Northrop, but it won't even pay the electric bill, Mrs. Muse said. They are afraid of growing old with nothing to live on except Social Security, and are aware that, barring some miracle, it is precisely what will happen.
"I'm not sure what's going to happen to us in the future," she said. Every time she thinks of it, she added, "It's like a kick in the stomach."
Carrie, she says, is working hard to try and win a scholarship, and while it makes her proud it also breaks her heart. For Carrie and her generation here in Southern California, there is little choice. The option of the good-paying blue-collar job is an antiquity. It is either college, which cannot guarantee a good job anymore, or minimum wage.
In her high school, Carrie said, the layoff of a parent is so common that there is little sympathy left.
"It's like, 'So your dad was laid off. Big deal. Mine's been laid off a year,' " she said.
Still, she suspects but does not know how deeply it hurts her friends; behind the dismissive bravado, she says, "We just keep it to ourselves."
Mrs. Muse accepted her role as wife and mother a long time ago, not because she did not want to work -- after all, she says, raising children and managing a home can be a hard and thankless job -- but because she wanted to be there as her children grew up. She is nearing 50 and is willing to work for wages for the first time in her life, but there is nothing in the job market her dignity could stand.
"People who had years of college can't find anything," she said. "The only thing I could get is Burger King, and I don't need that crap."
So she takes the paycheck her husband gives her and tries to work miracles with it. She walks grocery store aisles looking for the cheapest brand. If a store has a sale on turkey, they will eat turkey four times a week. Dixie, their dog, used to eat what the family ate. Now sometimes there is nothing left, so she eats dog food.
"The food prices increase, the utilities go up, but we have so much less to work with," she said. Their house payment is $550 a month and their utilities run $250 a month. They spend about $400 a month for groceries and other basic needs. Then there are the big expenses they have to make sure they put aside for, like $1,400 a year in property taxes and $740 for car insurance. What is left from their income of $1,500 a month is pocket change.
The family across the street is in the same bad shape, as are two or three families down the block. One family just packed up in the dead of night and left, abandoning their house to the bank and leaving their friends to wonder whatever happened to them. Other families just split apart. She hears about them at the supermarket.
That will never happen to them, she said. He is not going to give up the one part of his life that is still good; she depends on him more than ever to provide, to keep them in a house, in a warm and safe place. You could not pry them apart with a tire iron. Like the plague, as Mr. Muse said, the layoff affects each family differently, ripping some apart as it cleaves others tightly together.
The whole family, along with uncles Roy and Larry, went out for dinner one night last fall at a neighborhood restaurant, a place where a steak and shrimp go for $6.95. They talked about the changes in life, how Robert only gets a haircut now when he badly needs one, and how Roy is going to have to work for several months as an unpaid intern when he finds work, if he does. Carrie talked about how bad Christmas had been, how "we used to get lots and lots of presents," and never knew it was a luxury.
As she talked, her father dipped his head toward his plate, as if to say, I'm sorry.
Then the three Muse brothers -- a maintenance man, an aspiring X-ray technician and one last aircraft worker desperately trying to hold on to a fading way of life -- started to talk about planes.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Displays Its Muscles And Some Warts to Wall St.

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Declaring that "the world is coming our way," Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., said yesterday that the company's traditional strength as a global maker of sophisticated systems would make it a major power in the era of network computing, which is being fueled by the rapid growth of the Internet.
 Mr. Gerstner and two of his lieutenants gave an unusually lengthy three-hour exposition of I.B.M.'s strengths and weaknesses to a group of Wall Street analysts and major investors in New York. The overall message was that the company's leadership in network computing in the years ahead would more than make up for disastrous missteps in the last 15 years, during the era of personal computers.
"The industry is coming back our way," Mr. Gerstner said. "It's coming back to our sweet spot."
He later added, "Everything you have been reading and hearing about the Internet plays to our strengths."
Though the afternoon presentation was generally praised by analysts, I.B.M.'s stock price plunged even as Mr. Gerstner was talking. After trading as high as $121.25, the stock closed at $116.125, down $2. It was the stock's fourth straight losing session on the New York Stock Exchange, after it had reached a five-year high last week.
But I.B.M.'s shares fell during a general selloff of technology-related stocks, and traders and analysts were hard pressed to point to anything Mr. Gerstner had said that might have justified I.B.M.'s decline.
"I thought it was a pretty positive meeting," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, who saw the presentation. "The only thing that I can think of that might have affected the stock was that he said the PC business was weak in North America -- but all the large computer stocks seemed to reverse."
Mr. Gerstner described a future in which computing power would migrate from the personal computer to the powerful computers known as servers, which handle corporate data bases and, in Mr. Gerstner's view, will be host to the network-based services of the future. He predicted that the economics of the business would change as software was bought by subscription rather than as a retail product for the personal computer. As a result, digital transactions on the network will "skyrocket." I.B.M. will benefit, he added, because "we are the server company."
That vision directly contrasts with the view espoused by Mr. Gerstner's bete noire, the Microsoft Corporation, which is the leader in personal computing software and one of the greatest beneficiaries of I.B.M.'s mistakes in the 1980's. In Microsoft's view of the future, computing power will be shared between the personal computer and large-scale systems.
But Mr. Gerstner clearly saw the coming changes as a way to outmaneuver Microsoft. "The best thing about this model is that I.B.M. isn't forced to say that 'oh my God, we've got to go fight someone who has 60 percent of the market,' " he said. "We already tried that game."
In the future, he added, I.B.M. would be tailoring an increasing number of network-based services to the needs of specific industries. One example was an announcement made yesterday that I.B.M. would set up a network for three major health care providers covering eight states, including Colorado, Ohio and Montana, would link doctors, patients and hospitals. The network would, among other things, automate paperwork and make records easily available as patients move between hospitals.
Such initiatives are closely tied to I.B.M.'s fast-growing services business, which helps institutions and corporations set up computer systems or sometimes run a client's operations for a fee. With $12.7 billion in sales last year, the services division is now second only to hardware as I.B.M.'s largest source of revenue and makes I.B.M. the biggest computer-services company in the world.
Mr. Gerstner reiterated his strong commitment to services that directly meet the needs of I.B.M.'s customers who are looking for solutions and are often confused by today's computer technology.
"Until we make computers that work like toasters, it is going to be a great business," he said.
Also yesterday, I.B.M. announced that it had acquired Data Sciences Ltd., a British computer concern, for $145 million. I.B.M. said it hoped to use the company's 1,700 employees to expand its services in Europe.
Mr. Gerstner also said that I.B.M. completed its $743 million acquisition yesterday of Tivoli Systems Inc., a maker of software that manages networks made up of different types of computer hardware. The purchase strengthens I.B.M. product offerings in a key area as I.B.M. tries to revitalize its software business.
Though he spent most of his time outlining I.B.M.'s strengths yesterday, Mr. Gerstner, who is known as a tough critic within the company, acknowledged several shortcomings. He said that I.B.M. had missed major opportunities and had performed poorly in the areas of software, data-storage devices, and networking hardware -- a multibillion-dollar business that I.B.M. could easily have dominated.

HEADLINE: Reversing Field, Ford Will Aggressively Cut Costs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 4

 BODY:
After months of dismissing concerns that its cars have become too expensive, the Ford Motor Company has reversed course and begun an aggressive cost-cutting campaign that includes the elimination of 6,000 product engineering jobs.
Ford officials said today that the company planned to reduce its product development staff to 23,000 from 29,000 in the next few years, mainly by cutting the number of engineers who are hired on long-term contracts but are not on the permanent payroll. Some of the shrinkage in staff will also come through retirements, possibly including an early retirement program, and by not replacing people who leave. 
 Chris Vinyard, a company spokesman, confirmed that Ford would be reducing its product development staff but said that "we don't contemplate anything that would be characterized as a layoff" for career Ford employees.
The cutbacks at Ford are part of a broader shift in attitude among Detroit auto makers. After years of pushing up car and truck prices faster than inflation, they have decided that the affordability of their products has become a problem, and are taking steps to correct it. That new consensus here is good news for car buyers, but could jeopardize industry jobs.
The shift is most evident at Ford, whose chairman publicly dismissed affordability concerns just two months ago. But executives at the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation have also been taking numerous steps to cut costs. "You've got to be conscious of what you're putting on the car," said John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive.
Ford has gone the furthest the last few weeks in releasing details of its cost-cutting plans, trying to address Wall Street concerns. These are among its latest steps:
*No longer painting the insides of ashtrays on the Explorer, for a saving of 25 cents on each of the sport utility vehicles.
*Using a single carpet fabric for its car trunks instead of seven fabrics, for a saving of 90 cents a car.
*Using a single cigarette lighter instead of 14 different lighters on various models, for a saving of 16 cents a vehicle.
All of these cost-saving steps sound small. And for any given vehicle, they are. The unpainted Explorer ashtrays shave just 25 cents from the production cost of a sport utility vehicle that sells for close to $30,000. But with the Explorer ranking as the nation's third-best-selling vehicle, the paint saving on ashtrays adds up to $99,000 a year.
Ford is also taking much bigger longer-term measures. The company is expanding the use of computer-aided design techniques to reduce spending on prototype vehicles to $700 million next year from $1.1 billion in 1994. And Ford is gradually reducing the variety of car engines and underbodies that it produces while changing the sheet metal on top in more ways so as to continue offering a full range of models -- a change that could save billions of dollars early in the next century.
Ford hopes to sell cars for less and increase its profits by reducing its costs. To be sure, auto makers have tried for decades to look for ways to save a dime on a car here or a nickel a mini-van there. And some pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles continue to sell very well even when loaded with costly options.
Yet both the wisdom and effectiveness of the deeper, more aggressive cost-cutting programs remain unclear. When pressed, some auto executives concede that they do not really expect to meet their ambitious targets of reducing their parts purchasing costs, for example, by as much as 5 percent a year. And seemingly small changes that might appear to save money can end up as money losers if they prompt customers to buy a competitor's vehicle.
Japanese car companies have already learned this. Sales of the Toyota Corolla suffered in Japan last year, for example, when the company made many seemingly small design changes.
The issue for American auto makers now is whether cost-saving decisions will mean that millions of bland cars and trucks end up rolling off assembly lines. Even worse, auto makers could omit features that consumers never mentioned as important until they had to do without.
Ford officials now concede, for example, that they erred in deciding not to put a driver's side sliding door on their Windstar mini-van. Chrysler added a door to its mini-vans, luring thousands of buyers who loved the convenience. "I have a saying now: when in doubt, add a door," a top Ford official who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
Given the tension between enticing consumers and saving money, some Wall Street analysts question whether the auto companies can really cut their costs deeply.
Ford and Chrysler have each set a target of reducing parts purchasing costs by 5 percent a year. But executives at the two companies acknowledge some misgivings about whether the targets are realistic.
Thomas T. Stallkamp Chrysler's vice president for procurement and supply, said that the company had a target of a 3 percent reduction last year, but managed only a 1.5 percent cut. Chrysler raised its target to 5 percent this year anyway.
Ford's financial planners decline to say what cost reductions are included in their business forecasts, as opposed to the target they set for managers. But David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance, strongly suggested in an interview that the planners were not expecting a 5 percent drop. "We are always more conservative in our planning on profit projections," he said. "We won't be in financial trouble if we miss them some, but we do count on making much of it."
General Motors has not tried to rally its employees around a specific cost-cutting target, and its executives question the wisdom of doing so, given the many quality changes often involved in cost savings.
"A lot of people kid themselves with these big numbers that they throw out that they're saving," said J. T. Battenberg 3d, president of Delphi Automotive, G.M.'s immense auto-parts division. "When you ask the price question, you have to ask, 'How many engineering changes?' "
As so often happens, American car companies are belatedly following the example of Japanese car companies. Alarmed by the yen's rise against the dollar in 1994 and early 1995, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and other Japanese auto makers redoubled their efforts to shave costs.
Ford has an advantage in cutting costs now. The company has just finished redesigning nearly half its product line, and has less need for engineers. By a curious coincidence, it was the dollar's sharp rebound over the last year that helped persuade Detroit auto makers to begin pursuing their own more aggressive cost-reduction strategies. The dollar has risen 32 percent since touching a low of 79.85 yen last spring.
A Ford official said that the company became more convinced of the need to cut costs after estimating that recent exchange rates made even the Chrysler Neon uncompetitive. The Neon has set a new standard as an American small car with low production costs.
The other two reasons for Ford's new emphasis on cost control were the weak sales of the new Taurus sedan and Ford's abysmal lack of profits from automotive operations in the third and fourth quarters of 1995, the Ford official said.
While Ford began its cost-saving program more than a year ago, the program has become a higher priority in recent weeks.
The question is whether this year's stepped-up cost-cutting will produce next year's cheap-looking car. Ford skipped putting a holder on the inside of the 1996 Ford Taurus doors. "One of the first things I noticed when getting into the vehicle was, where's the map pocket?" a senior Ford official said.
Many consumers had the same reaction. Other car companies continued building map holders in their car doors. And their dealers were quick to point this out to would-be Taurus buyers.

HEADLINE: Dow Registers Rise of 63.59; Passes 5,600

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices lurched sharply higher yesterday, pushed by a number of large computer-driven buy orders and another good day in the long end of the bond market.
At the close of a hectic session, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 63.59 points, to 5,600.15. With only about 30 minutes of trading left yesterday, the blue-chip average was up as much as 90 points. At that point, it lost about half of its gain, only to scoot upward again near the close. 
 "At one point the Dow was up 90, and then the next minute it was up 45, and it all happened in a flash," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "But over all, you have to say it was a good day." The day's climb furthered a 50.94-point advance on Friday, and the Dow has now advanced 2 percent the last two sessions, nearly making up the 2.5 percent decline of the first four days of last week.
The downdraft that swept technology stocks lower on Friday continued yesterday.
Compaq Computer, which sparked Friday's wholesale selloff after it announced sharp price cuts, lost 1 3/4 yesterday, closing at 40. Hewlett-Packard fell 1 1/8, to 94, and I.B.M., fell 2 late in the day to close at 116 1/8.
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., speaking to Wall Street analysts and investors, asserted that the company's traditional strengths as a global maker of sophisticated systems would make it a big power in a coming era of network computing being fueled by the rapid growth of the Internet. [Page D4.]
Among active Nasdaq issues, Cisco Systems fell 1 3/8, to 44 1/8, and Sun Microsystems lost 1 1/4, to 47 3/4.
Otherwise broad market averages generally reflected the improved tone. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, which represents about three-quarters of the value of all American stocks, rose 6.44 points, to 650.81, extending Friday's gain of 3.94. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 3.69, to 348.87, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 3.60, to 567.04.
Volume on the Big Board was 417.3 million shares.
One index that lost ground was the Nasdaq composite, which fell 1.20, to 1,084.88, as technology stocks, which were battered on Friday, failed to recover.
Bond prices in the long maturities improved for a second straight day, after a weak consumer spending report for January and declines in both gold and oil prices.
The report renewed talk of the possibility of yet another cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, whose policy making Open Market Committee meets on March 26.
Despite the weak consumer spending report, a reading that was heavily influenced by the bad weather in January, expectations of faster economic growth helped to push up prices of big retailers.
Lowe's, the home-improvement chain, jumped 3, to 35, after the company said February sales in stores open more than a year rose 9 percent. Home Depot, a Lowe's competitor, rose 3 3/8, to 47 5/8.
Aside from cyclical stocks like retailing, defensive issues like beverages, drugs and health care also did well.
Drug stocks climbed after treatments development by Eli Lilly and Abbott Laboratories cleared regulatory hurdles. Eli Lilly jumped 2 1/2, to 64 1/8, while Abbott advanced, 1 5/8, to 43 7/8.
Among the day's biggest losers was Alumax, whose shares tumbled 7.6 percent after news over the weekend that Kaiser Aluminum had withdrawn its takeover bid valued at $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Alumax, which rose after Kaiser's offer of $40 to $45 in cash and common stock, fell 2 3/4 yesterday, to 33 1/2, in very heavy trading.
The market's solid advance the last two sessions has probably calmed some nerves, but analysts said they expected conditions to be volatile for the foreseeable future.
"I expect the market to remain choppy," said Gail Dudack, investment strategist at UBS Securities. "This advance, which began in November, started on a foundation of a balanced budget agreement, good corporate earnings and lower interest rates. All of those assumptions are very debatable at this point."

UConn and Notre Dame In Showdown for Title

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn., March 4

 BODY:
The UConn Huskies are right where all of the Big East expected them to be: in line to win a third consecutive conference tournament and gain an automatic bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association 64-team tournament field.
The 29-3 Huskies, the defending national champions, tonight advanced to the final game against third-seeded Notre Dame on Tuesday with ease. 
 UConn's Kara Wolters scored 22 points in 23 minutes in top-seeded UConn's 83-51 drubbing of Pittsburgh at Gampel Pavilion tonight.
In the other semifinal, Notre Dame (22-6) stopped Seton Hall, 69-58, setting up the expected match between the tournament's only nationally ranked teams.
Beth Morgan led Notre Dame with 16 points. Katryna Gaither had 12 points and a team-high 10 rebounds. Seton Hall's top scorer was Sandy Mitchell with 15 points.
The Irish have already lost twice to UConn, but gave the Huskies a game before succumbing, 86-79, here Feb. 24. Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw conceded, "We're at a major disadvantage."
"Connecticut has had two days off, and we've had two tough games," McGraw said, referring to UConn breezing through its first two games.
"But," cautioned Jennifer Rizzotti, UConn's senior guard and the Big East player of the year, "you never expect it to be easy. They're going to have some pretty athletic kids, pretty talented kids. So we have to make sure we contain their better players."
One of those top players, Gaither, stated flatly after scoring 12 against Seton Hall, "I'm ready, and more determined than the last time."
UConn seems ready, too, riding a 15-game winning streak thanks to a relentless defense and the fast-break conversions that helped break open both its tournament romps, against Rutgers and Pitt.
"They're just so physical that even if you play them fresh, when your 40 minutes are up you're just thoroughly exhausted," said Stephanie Petho, who led the Panthers with 13 points.
Wolters, UConn's junior center, dominated against the overmatched Panthers, not only scoring at will from the middle of the key but also blocking six shots, one short of the tournament record.
"She leaves her heart, her soul, her guts all out on the court," said UConn Coach Geno Auriemma. "That's why she's a special player."
Wolters, making the middle of the key her own on offense as well as defense, has rained turnaround jumpers, scoring a total of 43 points in 41 minutes of play in two games.
"She has nice, soft hands," said Kirk Bruce, the coach of the Panthers (6-24). "All she has to do is catch it and score. She makes the same play over and over."
The unassuming Wolters refused to call herself a controlling force.
"I just feel comfortable because of my teammates," Wolters said. "They make it so easy for me, getting the ball in up high."
The same sort of economy and excellence that Wolters has shown has also marked Connecticut's tournament play in general, up and down the bench, something Rizzotti said should leave the starters fresh for Tuesday.
"Our subs came in and did a great job," she said. "The game was in control and they kept it in control."
Bruce said, "They're so deep they can go to any of their non-starters and still get great performances."
UConn showed its ability to thoroughly dominate by taking an immediate 16-2 lead over the Cinderella Panthers, the first No. 13-seeded team ever to make the semifinal round in Big East tournament play.
The Huskies built their lead to 43-23 by halftime, as Wolters poured in 16 points, 6 in the final two minutes of play. The Huskies then started the second half with an 18-2 spurt.
 
REBOUNDS
GENO AURIEMMA and JIM CALHOUN, coaches of UConn's nationally ranked women's and men's teams, respectively, are among the finalists for the 1996 Boost/Naismith college basketball coach of the year awards. UMass men's coach JOHN CALIPARI is also a finalist.

Gerstner Declares I.B.M. Is Poised for Leadership
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., told Wall Street analysts and investors that the company's traditional strength as a global maker of sophisticated systems would make it a major power in the era of network computing, which is being fueled by the rapid growth of the Internet. The message was that I.B.M. would more than make up for its disastrous missteps adjusting to the era of the personal computer. [Page D4.]
 
I.B.M.'s stock has suffered from AT&T's decision last week to pull out of a venture linking users of Lotus Notes via AT&T phone lines. But two AT&T rivals are growing with Lotus services, and others also see an opportunity where AT&T failed. [D4.]
 
The Compaq Computer Corporation and two of its rivals, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard, announced steep price cuts yesterday, reflecting intense competition in a slowing personal computer market. [D4.]
 
Campbell Soup to Name Officer
Campbell Soup, after a year without a chief financial officer, will name Basil L. Anderson, an architect of Scott Paper's downsizing, to the post today. But David W.

Income Growth Stalls
Personal income grew just one-tenth of 1 percent in January, after a strong gain in 1995, and consumer spending fell five-tenths of 1 percent in the month, for its first drop in three years. But many analysts say that February results should show a rebound. [D2.]

Mixed Data On Economy Cloud Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as the bond market wrestled with conflicting economic signals and changing perceptions on the economy's outlook. Many traders and investors believe the Federal Reserve still intends to cut interest rates, with the timing uncertain.
The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 95 19/32 for a yield of 6.33 percent, down from 6.36 percent on Friday. Some analysts said that after the recent selloff in bonds, it appeared that much of the bad news the market anticipated -- real or imagined -- might be behind it. 
 Traders say the market is priced fairly at these levels after being somewhat overpriced the last few weeks, and they are not looking for any sharp moves before reports Thursday on durable-goods orders and Friday on nonfarm payrolls.
Gold and oil prices, considered indicative of possible inflation, were down yesterday and helped keep bond prices steady.
P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, said: "I think today the market put the proper perspective on commodity prices, as the contract-month change brought gold down, and you saw some nice declines in petroleum products. The growing belief is that we are coming to the end of peak-usage season and are through the worst of the winter months. The lower stockpiles have time to replenish."
Mr. Leary said that in the last couple of weeks, the market had a number of weighty issues to deal with, all seeming to fall into place at once. There was the testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that was interpreted as negative to bonds, and the record quarterly refunding by the Treasury, adding a heavy supply of debt to the market. "Dealers were also changing positions because of a variety of debt issuance," he said, "and you had a rather sharp increase in gold." This, he said, tested "the fortitude of the long end of the market."
"I think the market is priced fairly," Mr. Leary said, adding, "I think that we still can test 5.75 percent on the long bond by the summer, and really the second quarter is going to be the make-or-break point for the economy, to see whether we are in a long cycle of moderate growth or whether the possibility of recession will emerge."
David Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said a March survey of portfolio managers showed most thought that the rise in interest rates was nearly complete. "They are not turning negative for the longer haul," he said, "and believe that the current economic climate is still conducive to lower rates."
"Position adjustments are substantial," he said, and "now most of the investors believe that yields have reached the upper end of their current range, and intend to sit back and see if they are correct."
Yesterday's trading session began with reports that December and January personal income had risen six-tenths of 1 percent and one-tenth of 1 percent, respectively. December personal spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, but personal spending in January fell five-tenths of a percent.
Rates were mixed at the Treasury's weekly auction of bills, with good retail demand for a three-month bill producing an average rate of 4.89 percent, up three basis points from a week ago. Demand was below average for the six-month issue, with the rate unchanged at 4.80 percent from the previous week.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, the Sprint Corporation's cellular unit, 360degrees Communications, sold $900 million in senior notes in two parts yesterday through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers.
The sale, part of a planned spinoff from its parent, included $450 million of 7.125 percent noncallable senior notes due in 2003 at a price of 99.695 to yield 7.181 percent -- about 135 basis points more than a Treasury security with a comparable maturity. For the second part, the cellular company sold an equal amount of 7.50 percent senior notes due in 2006 at a price of 99.769 to yield 7.533 percent -- 157 basis point above a comparable Treasury. This issue is callable when the yield is about 30 basis more than a Treasury.
While the securities are split-rated -- investment grade BBB+ by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating, low investment grade BBB- from Standard & Poor's, and below investment grade Ba-2 by Moody's -- there was strong demand from investors who normally buy high-grade bonds but sometimes dabble in lower-rated issues with an eye toward their potential gains from upgrading.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: A Florida Congressman With a Fighting Spirit Will Retire

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Representative Sam M. Gibbons, a 76-year-old Floridian who led efforts for civil rights and open government in the House in the 1960's and became Speaker Newt Gingrich's chief denouncer in the 1990's, announced his retirement today after 34 years in Congress.
In 1995, after the Republicans won Congress, he battled them as the Ways and Means Committee's senior Democrat, criticizing Mr. Gingrich and his allies for "baloney," "blackmail," "ineptness," for "whimpering and whining and complaining" and for "behaving like dictators." 
 Today, Mr. Gibbons said it was time for a change after 49 years in public service, which began with 5 years in the Army, punctuated by a parachute landing behind German lines the night before D-Day.
He said he would not run again and expected to teach, serve on nonprofit boards, and work for simplification of the tax system and the re-election of President Clinton. "This is a midlife turning point for me," he said.
Mr. Gibbons's early prominence faded during more than two decades on the Ways and Means Committee, where he concentrated on complex trade issues.
But he returned to the limelight when he became its chairman in mid-1994 upon the indictment of his predecessor, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois. As chairman, he pushed a national health insurance bill through the committee, although it never came up on the House floor.
Next year Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan will be the ranking minority member, a largely ceremonial post as long as Republicans are in control. But if the Democrats win the House back, Mr. Rangel will become chairman, a position of great influence that he would be expected to use on New York's behalf.
In a news conference in the committee's grandiose, cavernous hearing room, Mr. Gibbons rehearsed a varied career, saying: "The worst vote I ever cast in all of the 44 years of legislative life was on the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. I have always regretted it. That plunged 55,000 Americans to their death."
But he had a harder time choosing among accomplishments, talking about trade, civil rights, poverty, Medicare and House rules changes. He spoke most warmly of his earliest years, when, as a freshman from Tampa, he was a floor manager for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. "We did get things done in those days," he said.
Mr. Gibbons's voluntary retirement from the House is the 40th in this Congress, and his seat is likely to be a battleground. The 39th came earlier in the day, when Representative Toby Roth, an 18-year Wisconsin Republican, said he would not run again. Twenty-six of the retirees are Democrats and 14 are Republicans.
Mr. Gibbons said he was proud of his record in fighting for free trade. Markets "are not perfectly open, and they never will be," he said, "but they are far more open than when I began." After he had ended his news conference, he agreed to take one more question, and when it was on trade with Chile, he leaped into the subject, saying the United States should make a pact with that country.
His role as a reformer of House rules was to push for openness. In 1966, he got the House Education and Labor Committee to meet in open session to vote on bills. He wrote the first formal rules for that committtee and later for Ways and Means. In 1970, with Representatives James G. O'Hara of Michigan and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts, he led an effort that ended the practice of anonymous voting on the floor of the House.
Under that system, known as a "teller vote," members would walk down the aisles and be counted. But they would face the back of the chamber, away from the Press Gallery, and be largely unrecognized. Starting in 1971, all votes on amendments were taken electronically and roll calls published.
Mr. Gibbons's procedural experience and his civil rights credentials enabled him to lead a fight against Representative Adam Clayton Powell, an exceptionally autocratic committee chairman in a day of autocratic chairmen. In 1966 his efforts stripped Mr. Powell, who was black, of much of his authority to run the committee.
He blamed the bad manners of today's House on a growing tendency to curtail debate under both parties. He said, "When people are limited in what they have time to say, they tend to raise their voices and use invective." He admitted he had enjoyed the last year, when he repeatedly denounced Republicans.
"I go with happy memories, a fighting spirit, a lot of thanks, and no regrets," he said.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Said to Be Ousting Economists

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 5

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company will dismiss its entire economics research department upon completing its takeover of First Interstate Bancorp on April 1, individuals at the banks said today.
Wells Fargo has said it expects to cut annual operating costs by up to $700 million after the merger. The 20 or so economics jobs would be a tiny fraction of the job cuts envisioned. The total cuts could eventually be 10,000, one of the largest reductions in United States banking history. 
 But the dismissal by Wells Fargo of its own economics staff along with First Interstate's is unusual and shows how determined the bank is to cut costs. Large banks have historically employed economists to help guide management decisions.
Employees said all departments at the banks were under review, with special scrutiny of headquarters staff not directly involved with bank customers. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco and First Interstate has headquarters in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed as Traders Focus On Global Interest-Rate Outlook

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday, fading slightly against the German mark but holding steady against the Japanese yen.
The mark staged a tentative rally, ending several days of weakness. But the gains occurred on limited trading volume, and foreign-exchange dealers still expect the dollar to rise in coming days. 
 "We had seen some selling of marks in previous days and we saw some profit taking out of those trades," said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank. "From here the dollar should be inching up ever so slowly."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar was at 105.25 yen, up from 105.15 yen on Monday. The dollar fell to 1.4758 marks from 1.4780 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5300 from $1.5275.
Interest rate forecasts continue to drive currency trading. Most analysts foresee an imminent cut in German short-term rates, which would make German securities less attractive.
United States interest rates, meanwhile, appeared likely to remain steady after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested in a speech yesterday that the economy was stronger than official data showed. Mr. Greenspan's comments weakened the American bond market, which has been expecting a rate cut, but they strengthened the dollar.
"That was somewhat of a bullish statement," said Diego Giurleo, vice president at Royal Bank of Canada. "It suggests perhaps we're not ready to cut interest rates in the U.S."
Still, the dollar hit strong selling pressure at 1.4820 marks. That produced a selloff to near 1.4750 marks, the level at which the dollar spent most of the New York trading session.
"People were looking for a lot of topside and when it failed to materialize, we had a correction," Mr. Lawrie of Mellon Bank said.
Against the yen, the dollar continues to draw modest support from speculation that the Bank of Japan was staying in touch with currency dealers in an effort to support the dollar below 105 yen.
The currency markets have been subdued recently as traders are reluctant to take new positions before Germany releases employment data today and the United States issues its report on employment on Friday.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Show Surprising Strength

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Factory orders jumped unexpectedly in January and backlogs surged, the Commerce Department said today, offering evidence that manufacturing might be picking up after months of weakness.
The rise in January orders of five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $311.1 billion, fanned concerns among investors that the Federal Reserve might be less likely to cut interest rates later this month. 
 Most private economists had expected a decline in orders because of severe winter storms that closed some plants temporarily in January. Not only were orders stronger than expected, but December orders were also revised upward, to a 1.7 percent increase from the previous estimate of a 1.3 percent gain, the department said.
The January increase in factory orders was the fourth in the last six months. The rise in backlogs was the biggest in more than six years, the department said.
Order backlogs grew for the fifth consecutive month, rising 1.7 percent after a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent in December. It was the biggest jump in unfilled orders in more than six years, since an identical 1.7 percent gain in December 1989.
"Barring a disappointing employment report on Friday, we seem to be moving through Alan Greenspan's 'soft patch' in the economy successfully," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "So the case for a Fed easing is no longer certain."
Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other policy makers are to meet on March 26 to consider whether to lower interest rates for the fourth time since mid-1995.
Economic growth slowed sharply at the end of 1995 but bad weather and the shutdown of the Federal Government, which delayed the collection and release of data, have made it difficult to assess the economy's condition early in 1996.
The financial markets are eagerly awaiting the release of February employment data by the Labor Department on Friday. Economists surveyed by Reuters predict that 326,000 jobs were created last month, more than making up for 201,000 lost in January.
The factory orders report showed fairly broad manufacturing strength, with more orders in January for expensive durable goods and nondurable goods like food and clothing. Analysts said companies were investing in new plants and equipment despite slower consumer spending.
Mr. Dederick of Northern Trust said, "We always wondered whether business would crumble in the face of weakening consumer demand, but it appears that business is continuing to spend for its own account" by buying new machinery and computers to become more efficient.
The increase in orders for industrial machinery and equipment was the largest, rising 5.7 percent after falling 2.6 percent in December.
The biggest drop in orders occurred in transportation goods, which fell 3.4 percent after a 12.3 percent jump in December. The department said there were large declines in orders for new aircraft and parts in December. Excluding transportation, orders jumped 1.2 percent after a slight rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in December.
"It is quite an encouraging figure," said David Sloan, senior economist at IDEA Inc. in New York, of the latest report. "The gain was modest but it wasn't led by transport, the usual erratic factor."

HEADLINE: Fearing a Toehold for Gay Marriages, Conservatives Rush to Bar the Door

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 1

 BODY:
Fearful that a court case will lead to the sanctioning of marriages of lesbian and gay couples in Hawaii by the end of 1997, conservatives are campaigning across the nation to insure that the recognition of same-sex marriages will not spread to other states.
California is one of 19 states considering measures that would deny government recognition to same-sex marriages performed within the state or elsewhere. South Dakota and Utah have already enacted such laws. And a Defense of Marriage Act is being drafted in the United States Senate. 
 The legislative battle has picked up momentum in recent months as more conservatives have become convinced that they must act before Hawaiian courts pave the way to civil marriage rights for couples of the same sex. They envision a time in the not-too-distant future when lesbian and gay residents of their own states will fly to Hawaii and return with official marriage licenses. If they do not act and that should come to pass, their states will be left with an obligation under the United States Constitution to recognize those marriages.
It is too early to predict how many of the measures precluding same-sex marriages will be passed. Some have already been killed or tabled.
What brought the same-sex issue to the fore was a 1993 ruling by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that the denial of marriage licenses to three homosexual couples amounted to unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of sex -- not sexual orientation -- unless the state could show a compelling reason for the denials. That question is expected to be taken up by a lower court in August.
Even though the Hawaiian Legislature passed a bill in 1994 affirming marriage as intended for "man-woman units" capable of procreation, conservatives and civil rights advocates expect that the state will be unable to convince the courts that it has a compelling interest in denying marriage licenses to couples of the same sex.
The conflict in many Statehouses will be fierce. Conservatives see themselves in a fundamental crusade to preserve the traditional family structure as it has been understood through history. They argue that it is not only morally necessary to do so but also that it is in the best interest of children, who benefit from having both a mother and father.
Lesbian and gay couples are seeking the economic and legal benefits of marriage for their long-term relationships, which can involve the rearing of children. The benefits of civil marriage -- as distinct from a union recognized by a religious authority -- include the right to hold joint parental custody, obtain family insurance and health benefits, file joint tax returns, inherit property automatically and visit a spouse or child in a hospital.
Many of these couples are so eager to wed that they are already planning their flights to Honolulu, even though it could be a year or two before Hawaii begins issuing licenses, if it does so at all. Nowhere on the mainland is the interest in Hawaiian marriages for same-sex couples as palpable as in California, which has a large homosexual population and is a gateway to Hawaii.
Laurie McBride, executive director of the Lobby for Individual Freedom and Equality, a lesbian and gay group here, said, "California is going to have literally thousands of couples who are going to come back from Hawaii expecting their marriage to be treated with the respect and dignity given every other marriage."
When Ms. McBride was asked whether she and her partner of 11 years, Donna Yutzy, would be among those couples, she answered, "In a heartbeat."
The issue of same-sex marriages, almost unimaginable a generation ago, has become so potent that it is affecting the Republican Presidential campaign. A "marriage protection" rally in Des Moines on the eve of the Iowa caucuses drew Patrick J. Buchanan in person, as well as written support from Senator Bob Dole, Steve Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander.
"It strikes at the very core of who we are as a people," said Jay A. Sekulow, chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia Beach, Va., which is headed by the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson. "Marriage defined as a man and a woman has been around more than 6,000 years and has served most cultures very well."
"The Supreme Court has set the highest standard with the 'compelling interest' test," Mr. Sekulow said. "It may well be, by the end of the year, that there are same-sex marriages in Hawaii."
Such marriages would have to be recognized in other states under the United States Constitution, which says that "full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state."
Alarmed at that possibility, legislators on the mainland are seeking an exemption from the "full faith and credit" provision on the grounds that same-sex marriages would violate the public policies of their states as defined by law. They are backed by conservative groups like the Christian Coalition, Concerned Women for America and Eagle Forum.
"My concern is that a limited number of judges in Hawaii will be dictating public policy in California," said Assemblyman William J. Knight, a Republican from the Antelope Valley, outside Los Angeles.
Mr. Knight introduced a bill that would invalidate "any marriage contracted outside this state between individuals of the same gender." It was passed by the Assembly, 41 to 33, on Jan. 31.
Mr. Knight's bill was opposed by Assemblywoman Sheila James Kuehl, Democrat of Santa Monica, and other Democrats who consider it to be discriminatory. The withholding of marriage rights, Ms. Kuehl said, has been a familiar tool used to "deny the humanity" of minorities.
She said she hoped that the bill could be stopped in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it goes next. Meanwhile, Mr. Knight has introduced a second bill specifying that California's marriage laws apply "only to male-female couples" as a matter of public policy that cannot be changed by the courts.
Legislation is also pending in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, according to the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay and lesbian group. In Hawaii, further legislation is being considered, including an effort to amend the state constitution. Measures have failed to reach the floor in Maine, Mississippi and New Mexico.
Evan Wolfson, senior staff attorney for the Lambda group, said, "Religious extremists are trying to shut down the nation's discussion on how the denial of marriage rights harms real-life couples before most Americans have even had a chance to think about it." Mr. Wolfson is a co-counsel on the Hawaii case.
Staff members in the United States Senate are preparing a Defense of Marriage Act to define marriage in Federal policies and acts of Congress as the legal union of one man and one woman, said Robert H. Knight of the Family Research Council in Washington. He has been shown drafts of the bill but would not identify the prospective sponsors.
"If defending marriage is likened to offensive action, then so be it," Mr. Knight said. "The onus should not be on those defending marriage but on the tiny minority of people who are attempting to radically redefine it. I, for one, won't submit to the tactic of portraying tradition-minded Americans as radicals and close-minded bigots."
In Illinois, State Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Palatine Republican who has introduced a bill adding same-sex couples to the list of those who may not be married under state law, said it was necessary to act now.
"To not pass this bill is to change our marriage laws fairly radically, if Hawaii changes its laws," Mr. Fitzgerald said. "If we were to act after Hawaii, I don't believe we could constitutionally strip marriages retroactively of those vested rights."
Last month, Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, a Republican, signed a law defining marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman arising out of a civil contract. "We put in statutory law what I believe the majority of people in the state believe has always been the definition of marriage," said the bill's sponsor, State Representative Roger Hunt, Republican of Brandon.
But Barry Wick, president of a group called Free Americans Creating Equal Status, said: "The government of this state has allowed the legislation of hate and the creation of a second-class citizen. This second class of citizen is defined by love."
The conservative campaign has forced lesbian and gay groups to focus suddenly on an issue that was not a priority a year or two ago, compared with things like job and housing discrimination. Indeed, the goal of marriage is far from universally embraced among homosexuals.
But the fight has been joined. A group called the Freedom to Marry Task Force of Northern California recently collected 1,600 letters in the heart of San Francisco's largest gay neighborhood, opposing Mr. Knight's bill. They delivered them to Ms. Kuehl on Wednesday. Marc Gofstein, a task force member, said, "When we stand there with the Freedom to Marry banner, people swarm over."


GRAPHIC: In the next year or two, as a result of an anticipated court decision, Hawaii might issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, which other states would have to recognize under current law. Conservatives have mounted an effort in many states to enact laws to prevent any such recognition, as well as other measures that would effectively ban same-sex marriages.

With a plan to become a nine-story store, Warner Brothers will double its Manhattan retail space.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE Warner Brothers Studio Store at 1 East 57th Street, a 15-floor building at Fifth Avenue, is growing from 30,000 square feet on three floors to 75,000 square feet on nine.
As part of the expansion, the exterior will be refurbished. The store, which opened on Oct. 27, 1993, will remain open during construction, with the new floors expected to be ready this fall. 
 "We've enjoyed great success, and we want to expand on that success," said Peter Starrett, president of Warner Brothers Studio Stores, a unit of Time Warner Inc. There are 137 of the studio shops worldwide, and 25 more are to open this year.
Mr. Starrett said the new floors at the Manhattan store would primarily be additional retail space but would also include "entertainment features." He declined to elaborate.
The lease on the new space is for 10 years, he said, and the lease for floors one through three was revised to give the store the entire site for the next 10 years. "We also have four five-year options," he said, "so we control the space for 30 years."
"The deal," he said, "made sense from an economic standpoint, because although the capital cost of converting office space to retail is high, the rent value for the additional floors is very competitive."
Mr. Starrett declined to give financial details. But a person familiar with the deal said that adding the 45,000 square feet, which more than doubled the original space, increased the rent by just 25 percent and that the rent for the additional floors was comparable to office rather than retail rents in the area.
Joseph Fabrizi, a director at Cushman & Wakefield, said rents for office space around Fifth and 57th generally ran from $35 to $40 a square foot.
 
Sports Club Moving In
 The space once occupied by the Atrium Club in the Galleria at 115 East 57th Street has been taken over by the New York Health and Racquet Club.
The club has leased 41,000 square feet -- part of the 6th and all of the 7th, 8th and 9th floors. The 57-floor building off Park Avenue has commercial space on the 3d through 16th floors and condominium apartments above.
Michael Laginestra of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company, who represented the landlord, Laszlo Tauber & Associates, said the lease was for 15 years, with options for 5 more years. The deal, which involved Mr. Laginestra and his colleagues Helene Saren and Alissa Finerman, was valued at $15 million.
Greg Manocherian, the managing partner of New York Health and Racquet Club, said he planned to reopen the space "in the next couple of months," as a subsidiary called the HRC Spa. The opening will follow more than $1 million in renovations, he said.
"We will have a full spa," Mr. Manocherian said. "We are upgrading the dining areas and will offer a low-fat, health-food and spa diet. We are also replacing the existing wall tile in the pool area with granite."
The Atrium Club opened in 1975 as a luxury social club with a gymnasium and a dining room. It closed suddenly on Feb. 1. The club's management said the closing was forced by "economic realities" including changes in the tax laws governing deductions for business entertaining and the increasing competition from "super gyms" like Reebok and Equinox on the Upper West Side.
Mr. Manocherian said that letters were being sent to the Atrium Club's 1,500 members informing them of the new spa.
Mr. Laginestra said he was also about to close three other commercial leases in the building, totaling about 18,000 square feet, making the office space about 80 percent occupied.
 
Investment Firm to Midtown
 Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, an investment banking firm, has leased 21,000 square feet -- one and a half floors -- at 320 Park Avenue, a 35-floor, 656,000-square-foot office building at 50th Street. The 12-year lease was valued at more than $13 million.
Robert B. Emden, executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis New York, who represented Welsh, Carson with his partner, Elliot Klein, said the investment firm would move in July from 1 World Financial Center, where its lease is expiring. It had occupied about 12,000 square feet there.
"They wanted to get out of downtown, and they wanted to move to midtown, where they will be closer to hotels and where they can also entertain their clients more easily," Mr. Emden said.

HEADLINE: Start of Charter School Shows Flaws in Concept

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
The campus is 18 portable buildings in a muddy vacant field and the classrooms contain 1950's desks and chairs. There is no gymnasium, food service or library. The school almost closed in December when it ran out of money, and it was recently cited by the state for accounting procedures so lax it could be shut later on.
Charters, innovative schools that operate autonomously with public money, like Valley Academy here, are this year's hot concept in public education. But the bargain-basement campus and makeshift finances at Valley Academy and at some other Arizona charters are a reminder that reality can be a lot messier than the rosy visions of charter schools as scrappy entrepreneurial innovators. 
 Valley Academy's problems highlight two related issues dogging the charter process: whether states will provide enough money for them and whether the parents and teachers who start them can develop enough business savvy to run them.
Arizona has been one of the most aggressive states in moving into charter schools, with 46 opening in the last school year as the program got under way. They have a total enrollment of 7,500. None of the schools have gone under.
But only an interest-free $100,000 loan from a state legislator who has children in the school kept Valley Academy alive. And organizers admit that they were unprepared for some of the challenges.
Valley Academy, with a back-to-basics philosophy, has lost more than 100 students from the start of the school year. It now has an enrollment of about 485.
"We had good ideas about education," said Vicki Coulter, one of the founding teachers, "but I don't think we had enough people who knew what it took to run the school as a business. I think it's going to work, but I think it's going to be rough, and it's going to be rough for more than one year."
In the last few years, 246 charter schools have opened around the country, many of them small, concentrating on basic education or lessons focused in science, art or music. They operate as public schools dependent on state money, but with almost complete autonomy as far as hiring, curriculum and how they spend their money. Proponents say charters can provide cheaper, more innovative education if allowed to operate outside the established education bureaucracy.
In December, New Jersey became the 20th state to allow independent groups to set up charter schools and authorized the establishment of up to 135 in the state.
A recent study by the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization based in Washington, said the majority of the 35 charters visited in seven states offered distinctive, varied programs, with excellent, sometimes unconventional teachers and committed, involved parents.
But it also said that many of the schools operated in "what could charitably be termed minimal facilities." And it said many faced enormous business problems that would inevitably result in the closing of some of the schools.
"We expect some charter schools to fail, possibly even within the next few months," concluded the report issued in January. "Some of these will fail for educational reasons, but most such losses will be because of economic and business difficulties."
Valley Academy, with kindergarten through 10th grade, is an example of how chaotic the charter process can be. The school is the only one in Arizona that started its campus from scratch rather than adapting existing buildings. Its squat gray portable buildings were put up in just a month, and the school opened a month after the other public schools. Only recently was the school given a temporary certificate of occupancy.
Rob Hamblin, who was among three of the school's six board members who resigned in February after continuing disagreements among parents, said: "They allowed us to do a lot of things that were not normal. We could have been shut down at any time."
The school was on the brink of closing when it ran out of money in December, and its long-term economic future remains in doubt.
A state auditor's report released in February about Valley and two other charter schools concluded, "We have serious concerns about the current financial management and accountability of the charter schools we reviewed, which in turn raises the question as to their long-term viability."
On Valley Academy, auditors found that documentation of expenditures was haphazard and overall financial controls were "practically nonexistent." The state gave the school 90 days to correct the problems or risk being closed.
On the other hand, organizers of the charters say many of the problems are the result of underfinancing and poor planning at the state level. And even if all the schools are not floundering to the same degree as Valley Academy, they face similar problems.
The state appropriated just $1 million, later augmented by $635,000, as start-up money for its 46 schools, far less than what it costs to start a single public school. That left schools spending operating money to renovate and maintain buildings rather than to pay teachers or buy books.
Gregory Miller is the principal and chief executive of the Dragonfleye Charter School, which has a science program and a 300-animal zoology laboratory in an abandoned college building in an area of warehouses and strip shopping centers here. He puts the overall financial picture this way:
"If we're running charter schools for two-thirds or three-quarters of other schools, I think that's possible, but we can't do it for less than half. If you want to say we're doing this too much on the cheap, you won't get an argument from me."
Charters in Arizona contend that a number of changes in the state laws are needed for them to survive. The charters cannot sell bonds or raise taxes like other public school districts. To compensate, they want to be able to borrow money, which would mean they would have to be chartered for 15 years rather than 5. They also want to be designated as the owners of their assets like buildings and supplies, most of which are now owned by the state, so they can use them as collateral for loans.
They also want a waiver from a state law prohibiting schools from carrying over 3 percent of their money to the next year, to help them build up a contingency fund for building, maintenance and major purchases.
"As things stand now, we're a hybrid that's the worst of both worlds," said Eddie Farnsworth, executive director of the Benjamin Franklin Charter School in Mesa. "We can't levy taxes like public schools, but we can't go to the private marketplace to raise funds either."
State Senator Mary Hartley of Phoenix, who is also a member of the local school board, said the state moved too quickly into charters, failing to establish appropriate guidelines. "I think if there had been a more structured environment, fertile soil to plant schools in, they could have flourished," she said. "Instead we planted them in the middle of the highway and they're being run over."
But others say the charters exist because the public schools were not providing what parents wanted. And even Valley Academy, for all its problems, has a passionate corps of parents and students who say the education there is better than the schools they came from.
"When there was a rumor in December that we were closing, the kids literally started crying," said Ms. Coulter, the academy teacher. "It's been frustrating, and it's been wonderful, but the education part is working. It's the other part we need to work on."

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Offers Companies a Deal in Contract-Worker Disputes

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service said yesterday that it would offer discounts of up to 87.5 percent on the payroll taxes owed by employers who were found to have improperly paid employees as independent contractors.
But a leading lawyer in the contentious field of worker classification said the I.R.S. deal was no bargain. 
 When companies hire employees, they must pay half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes, as well as unemployment and disability taxes, which together can equal 10 percent of salary. But when companies retain independent contractors, those taxes are supposed to be paid by the contractors out of their fee.
The I.R.S. says its studies show that many independent contractors, however, do not pay all the taxes they owe and that auditing these individuals is costly and inefficient compared with auditing companies with many employees.
The last official I.R.S. estimate put the number of workers who are improperly treated as independent contractors at more than three million, but experts say the number is much higher and has grown rapidly in recent years with widespread layoffs at major employers. Construction companies, newspapers, advertising agencies and computer makers are among those being examined by the I.R.S. in worker classification audits.
Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said yesterday that at the end of a worker classification audit companies would be given a chance to agree with the I.R.S. about which independent contractors were really employees.
If they agree, she said, the service will limit its claim for back taxes to one year, instead of the usual two, and will settle for as little as 25 percent of the taxes owed. That works out to an 87.5 percent discount compared with a full tax bill for two years and will be available without the expense of hiring accountants and lawyers to negotiate.
"This is a big difference," Mrs. Richardson said of the new policy and added that the I.R.S. could make claims as far back as six years.
The I.R.S. may also waive penalties, said Frank Keith, the senior I.R.S. spokesman.
"This program is voluntary," Mr. Keith said. "You can say no and challenge our view."
But Harvey J. Shulman, a partner at the Washington law firm of Ginsburg, Seldman & Bress, who specializes in worker classification cases, said the service's new program "is not different than many of the deals now being offered and it retains the same tactics that many small-business owners have been complaining for years are extortionary."
"The fact of the matter is, the I.R.S. has all the leverage," Mr. Shulman said. "If you don't take their deal, and the assessment is a half- million dollars, they will place a lien on your business for a half-million dollars. And if you are a small business, that means you are out of business before you can even get to court. The I.R.S. approach is like the guy who says, 'I won't kill you if you will let me cut off your ear.' "

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Drop on Weakened Rate-Cut Hope

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slumped yesterday, as hopes for a quick cut in interest rates were weakened by a strong factory orders report and by comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Trading was fairly light with many market participants looking ahead to Friday's report on employment for February. The market was pressured by selling of intermediate-maturity securities by large hedge funds, traders said. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 of a percentage point, to 95. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.38 percent, from 6.33 percent on Monday.
The bond market was surprised by a Commerce Department report that factory orders rose five-tenths of 1 percent in January. Many economists expected a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent because of a blizzard that closed some plants temporarily that month. The report raised fears that the economy could snap back more strongly than anticipated and bring on a surge in inflation.
Comments by Mr. Greenspan caused bonds to extend their session losses. He told a meeting of the Independent Bankers Association of America in Las Vegas, Nev., that "we may be underestimating the growth of our G.D.P. and productivity."
His comments bolstered the view of those in the market who see the economy growing fast enough to keep the central bank from lowering short-term interest rates further. A number of traders say that a cut in rates in the coming months has already been priced in by the market.
Another report yesterday also pointed to a pickup in the economy. A Johnson Redbook report showed retail sales up 1.9 percent for the four weeks ended March 2, just barely below a reading of 2 percent last week, suggesting that retail activity has held steady.
"The two weeks in a row of strong sales was enough to take the wind out of any attempt to rally in the market," said Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of Government bond trading at Cowen & Company.
"I still think the sentiment is bullish, but I think we may be seeing a little long overdue correction in bonds," Mr. Gamba added.
In the municipal market, New York City sold $1.25 billion of general obligation bonds yesterday.
Yields on some of yesterday's bonds were around five basis points more than other comparable top-rated securities. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. It is not uncommon for investors to want a premium for increased risk; on Thursday, Moody's Investors Service strongly criticized a preliminary budget proposal by New York's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. The ratings agency warned that the city's ratings of Baa1 could be lowered.
New York's ratings are already among the lowest for a major American city. Only Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington have lower ratings.
New York City's 10-year bonds were tentatively set at 5.8 percent, or 120 basis points more than triple-A-rated general obligation debt, according to Bloomberg Fair Value Analytics.
In the largest part of the debt offering, the city negotiated the sale of $900 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt securities through J. P. Morgan Securities, at a price to yield a maximum 6.275 percent for a bond due in 2024. The underwriter also sold $190 million of tax-exempt variable-rate securities at the close of the market. However, they have not been priced yet.
In addition, the city sold $160 million of taxable bonds through Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, at yield spreads over Treasury securities that ranged from 56 basis points in 1997 to 84 basis points in 2003.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Rise by 5.6%, With Ford's Flat in Month

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 5

 BODY:
Auto sales rose 5.6 percent last month, assuaging industry and Wall Street fears that the industry was heading for a stiff downturn.
The Ford Motor Company reported nearly flat February sales today. Ford said its car sales fell 4.7 percent while its truck sales -- buoyed by its redesigned F-150 pickup -- rose 5.5 percent. Over all, Ford sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent last month. Sales of the Ford Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, fell 3 percent despite $600 rebates. But Ford was encouraged because the slip came as Ford reduced sales of the two cars to fleets by 26 percent, while retail sales of the cars rose 45 percent in February, said Joel H. Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager. 
 All together, auto makers sold 1.21 million cars and light trucks in the United States in February, up 5.6 percent from the month a year ago. Car sales rose 2.3 percent, to 694,154, while sales of pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles jumped 10.2 percent, to 520,213. Ford was the last major auto maker to report February sales. Many companies released their auto sales figures last Friday.
Wall Street took Ford's sales dip in stride, overjoyed at the upturn in what many had feared was a slowing industry. In fact, on a seasonally adjusted basis vehicle sales in February clicked along at a 15.8 million annual rate compared with a 14 million rate in January and 15.9 million rate in December.
Last month "certainly came in much stronger than anyone was anticipating," said Jack V. Kirnan, a Salomon Brothers auto analyst. "The snapback probably does relieve some of the fears that many of us felt," after seeing January's weak sales.
In a striking development, Honda surpassed Toyota in car sales in February. Honda sold 61,212 cars, up 20.4 percent from the period a year ago. Meanwhile Toyota's car sales dropped 6.4 percent, to 51,353.
Analysts said it was too early to tell whether Honda would begin outselling Toyota month after month. But Scott F. Merlis, an auto analyst in Westport, Conn. said, "Honda has demonstrated the capability of running neck and neck with Toyota." He said there were several factors behind Honda's strong sales in February: "The driving force was the strength of the Civic, new products in the Acura line and low interest rate financing on the Accord."
Toyota sold 793,971 cars last year, well above Honda's 740,487 cars. Each month Toyota typically outsells Honda.
Of course sales varied around the country, and auto dealerships had mixed results in February. Many dealers predicted strong spring sales, however.
Sales have been slow on Long Island, where Michael L. Lazarus sells Saturns, Land Rovers and Volvos from his nine dealerships. "We haven't had a single weekend without snow," and that slowed sales of Saturns and Volvos last month, Mr. Lazarus said. By contrast, Land Rovers have sold briskly because of the poor weather, he said.
But he believes the sluggish sales now could help make for strong sales in spring -- the critical auto selling season. "Customers tell us that they are waiting" to buy, Mr. Lazarus said. "I think it is going to be a good spring."
Other dealers agree. Craig R. Caldwell, general manager of a Dublin, Calif., Ford dealership, said "cautious optimism" best described his outlook for spring sales. "Business was good in February," he said, with his store's car sales up 10 percent and truck sales up 58 percent from sales in February 1995.
In his dealership, Ford's F-150 pickup "has been a tremendous hit," Mr. Caldwell said. Customers "love the looks of it, and they love the performance and the utility of the 3rd door," he added. The pickups are selling almost as quickly as they arrive in his showroom, he said. He said Ford Explorers continued to be popular.
By contrast, the redesigned 1996 Taurus has been disappointing. "The Taurus is just O.K.," Mr. Caldwell said. "The people that own them like them -- I think it's a matter of time."

HEADLINE: John W. Wright, 83, Headed Money-Management Company

 BODY:
John Winthrop Wright, the founder and chairman of Wright Investors' Service, an investment management and advisory service company, died on Monday at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. Mr. Wright, a resident of Fairfield, Conn., was 83.
The cause of death was a heart attack, said Barbara Albright, a vice president at Wright. 
 Mr. Wright began in securities analysis by evaluating his own stock portfolio, and then started Wright Investors in 1961, developing it as an investment advisory service for Wall Street firms. He had a strong belief in conservative investments based on extensively researched companies. In a 1981 article in The New York Times, Mr. Wright was quoted as saying, "There's a lot of difference between gambling and investing," and characterized most stock traders as gamblers. "I have nothing against it," he added, "but that's not the business we're in."
Today, Wright manages $4 billion worth of investments for corporate, municipal and union employee benefit funds, single-country equity funds, endowment and charitable funds, bank trust departments, and individual clients.
The company also publishes weekly economic reports for its clients -- mostly banks and brokerages -- discussing general trends and making specific stock recommendations. In 1985, Wright Investors founded the Worldscope Database, a subscriber service offering information on 13,000 companies, some of it dating to Mr. Wright's original 1960's research. Since 1990, Worldscope has been jointly owned and operated by Wright Investors and the Primark Corporation.
The bulk of Mr. Wright's investment capital came from the sale of the Wright Power Saw and Tool Corporation, which he founded in 1947 and sold in 1954 to Thomas Industries of Louisville, Ky. After he sold the tool manufacturing company, he was a senior partner for four years in Andris Trubee, a financial consulting firm, and managed the bankruptcy of Rototiller Inc., from 1958 to 1959, before devoting himself to managing his own investment portfolio in 1960.
Mr. Wright graduated from Amherst College in 1933, and worked for various banking corporations before World War II. He was an active duty commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1940 to 1946.
Mr. Wright, who was regarded as an expert on the stock market, was interviewed for articles in numerous publications. He testified before various Congressional committees and started the Committee on Developing American Capitalism, an organization devoted to promoting free enterprise and examining public economic policy.
Mr. Wright is survived by his wife, Mildred.

HEADLINE: Budget Paralysis in Albany

 BODY:
New York's State Legislature is in a bind. It cannot decide what to do about Gov. George Pataki's proposal to close a $4 billion budget deficit by relying on more than $2 billion in projected savings from Congressional actions that are not close to enactment and may never occur. Rather than face reality and find alternative ways to reduce the deficit, the legislators want to defer a decision by adopting a three-month temporary budget, with the hope that Washington will come to the rescue.
That is a bad idea. Delay would weaken the state's finances for no good reason. The rescue Mr. Pataki wants is unlikely to happen on time, and would be harmful to the state if it did. 
 There is one obvious route out of the current mess. The hole facing the Legislature as a result of Congressional inaction is almost exactly the size of the $2.3 billion in tax cuts that are scheduled to take effect in the next fiscal year. Many lawmakers who voted for the tax cut last year would now like it to be rescinded, but they are afraid to say so in an election year. Even so, New Yorkers need to confront the fact that the next stage of an income tax cut will force deep reductions in aid to education, mental health programs, the State and City University systems, and Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes and community health centers that care for the poor and elderly.
To his credit, Governor Pataki placed his own spending proposals on the table last December, a month early, to prod the Legislature into adopting a budget by the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1. But it was overly optimistic for him to assume that Congress and the White House would agree to sweeping Medicaid and welfare changes incorporating more Federal money for New York than is allowed under the current law. It is now anybody's guess whether President Clinton and the Congressional Republican leadership will be able to overcome their current impasse on budget issues before the fall election.
Passing a three-month budget is advertised by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, as a sensible response to the possibility that Congress and the President might agree on a budget by the summer. But building a temporary budget bridge to nowhere will almost certainly cast a shadow when Albany issues bonds for important transportation projects in late spring, possibly raising interest rates on the state's debt. Moreover, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City and the leaders of every other locality in the state will have to draw up budgets without knowing what to expect from Albany. Sharp cutbacks in services are almost certain to result.
Some of Mr. Pataki's aides argue that the key to saving the New York budget lies in Senator Bob Dole's wrapping up the Republican Presidential nomination in the next few weeks. According to this theory, he and President Clinton might then both seek a compromise on the Federal budget to defuse some of the harshest issues in the fall campaign and enhance their credentials as effective leaders. But one can just as easily imagine that both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole would find it distasteful to make important concessions in these sensitive areas.
In the end, the Legislature's faith that a budget compromise in Washington will serve New York's interests may be misplaced. The path that Mr. Pataki has outlined would yield some $2.4 billion that could be applied to deficit reduction -- but only by imposing nearly $3 billion in cuts in Federal, state and local spending on Medicaid that supports the vast network of hospitals, nursing homes, community health centers and home-care attendants across the state. There is room for some cuts in a state with the highest Medicaid costs in the country, but the $3 billion proposed by the Governor is too steep to be absorbed in one year without destroying a vital part of the state's safety net for middle class and poor alike.
A better way to proceed would be to work with Congress to institute managed care for Medicaid to keep the growth of costs under control. Sooner or later, it should become obvious to both Democrats and Republicans who thought a state tax cut could be enacted without much pain that the cuts, instead, will cause extreme hardship for the elderly, the young, the sick and the poor who depend on the state for their well-being.

HEADLINE: A Bad Way to Fight the Drug Trade

 BODY:
Influencing the behavior of countries involved in the production or shipment of illicit drugs is no easy matter for the United States, but the problem is exacerbated by a clumsy law the President must exercise every year. It requires that the State Department annually compile a list of delinquent countries, and that the White House decide which deserve punishment and which can go unscathed.
It is often hard to see why some countries are exempted from censure while others are not. This year, for example, Mexico was not singled out for American sanctions, even though it serves as the transit point for 70 percent of the drugs flowing into the United States. Colombia, home of some of the biggest drug cartels, was designated for sanctions. 
 While President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico seems to be making a concerted effort to combat the drug business, in contrast to the Colombian President, Ernesto Samper, who is accused of taking campaign contributions from drug lords, neither country is a model of drug enforcement. The reason Mexico got a pass from President Clinton is that the United States has far closer economic and political ties to Mexico than Colombia.
There ought to be a more consistent way to conduct American foreign policy. The law is a blunt instrument for fighting the international drug trade. In Bolivia and other Latin American countries, the threat of American sanctions has led to brutal military crackdowns in drug-growing areas and alarming human rights abuses.
In the case of Mexico, the inconsistency has already caused resentment in the international community. It is clear that the United States, having bailed out the Mexican economy and signed the Nafta treaty to create closer trade ties, was not prepared to jeopardize its investment by naming Mexico a drug pariah.
In Colombia, the economic impact of sanctions will probably not be great, but the diplomatic repercussions could be serious. Some members of Congress clearly hope the punishment will hasten Mr. Samper's downfall, but the judgment against Colombia could generate nationalistic sympathy for the embattled President. Honest and courageous figures like Alfonso Valdivieso, the Colombian prosecutor general who has pursued drug corruption, and Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, the national police chief, may now be more isolated than ever.
The law should be more nuanced. One idea is to have graduated sanctions. Clearly Colombia, an imperfect but struggling democracy, does not belong in the same pariah category as drug-exporting dictatorships like Myanmar and Iran. Another constructive approach would be an effort to deal with the problem on a regional basis, perhaps through the Organization of American States.
As long as the United States is the largest consumer of illegal drugs in the world, suppliers will find a way to do business here. But American efforts to fight the flow of drugs into this country should not be hampered by a law that substitutes posturing by Washington for an effective strategy to combat drugs.

HEADLINE: A Hometown Feels Less Like Home

SERIES: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: In the Community, Fraying Bonds -- Fourth of seven articles.

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio

 BODY:
To Wall Street and the world, it was the National Cash Register Company. Then, it was modernized, computerized, streamlined down to NCR. But in Dayton, the company was always just "the Cash."
The Cash got rich selling its cash registers to the world, and it rewarded its workers with good livings and unrivaled benefits, and its hometown with a firm hand of civic guidance and millions of dollars of good works. They were all bound together -- the company, the workers and the town. To a lot of people here, Dayton was the Cash, and the Cash was Dayton. 
 "NCR was part of Dayton's soul," George Bayless, a 58-year-old banker, said as he drove past the vacant swath of Main Street where 30 yellow-brick NCR factory buildings once stood.
As a boy, Mr. Bayless learned to swim in the big pool in the park that NCR's founding patriarch, John Patterson, built. He played French horn in the NCR band. And when he graduated from high school in 1955, he marched down the aisle of NCR Auditorium, just as generations of high school graduates had before him, and would for two decades more.
Nearly all of it has vanished in the steep decline and takeover of NCR: the buildings, 20,000 jobs, even the NCR name; the security, the middle-class aspirations, the way of life. And today, as its faraway corporate parent, AT&T, prepares to break into three pieces, the future of Dayton's hometown company is profoundly unsure.
The same could be said of the future, and the present, of the entire town. For Dayton was always much more than just the Cash. Daytonians invented and manufactured many of the staples (and a few of the quirky incidentals) of American prosperity -- the cash register, of course, and the airplane, but also the automobile self-starter and the pop top. And companies like Frigidaire, Delco, Dayton Tire, Huffy Bicycle and Esther Price Chocolates joined with the community in an unwritten social contract crafted on a foundation of profits and jobs, plenty of jobs.
Now, this test marketer's vision of average America is deep in mid-passage between two economic eras: the old era of making things and of job security, and the new one of service and technology, takeovers, layoffs and job insecurity. And the entire cloth of society, which most people in Dayton once wore so comfortably, feels as if it is out of style and could just wear out.
Everything, seemingly, is in upheaval: not just the jobs and lives of tens of thousands of people, but also the big corporations, the banks, the schools, the religious and cultural institutions, the old relationships of politics and power, and, especially, people's expectations of security, stability and a shared civic life.
"Now that there are only a few big hometown companies left, people are less certain about the community, too," said Brad Tillson, publisher of The Dayton Daily News, which itself is owned by an out-of-town company these days. "It creates tremendous uncertainty in people's lives. The tie between individuals and the community is less certain, and more fragile. It's scary for everybody."
All workers may be replaceable. Not so volunteers. When one man, Vinnie Russo, left NCR in the turmoil after the takeover -- he felt he had little choice, he said -- and found a new job in Louisville, the 85 boys of Pack 530 lost their Cubmaster; a new one has yet to sign on. With most women working, it is harder to find people to help in the schools and libraries. Churches are losing members. So are service organizations; people say they cannot leave work for meetings, even if they last only an hour. In a town with a tradition of charity, the United Way has missed its $20 million goal by $1 million in each of the last two years.
It can be confusing, living in Dayton in 1996. Like much of the Rust Belt, this sprawling region of nearly a million people is not as rusty as it was 15 or 20 years ago. Many of the economic indicators are, if not exactly dazzling, at least promising. Unemployment is low. There is plenty of work available, even if many of the jobs do not pay what the old ones paid. Dayton has not, of late, undergone the staggering layoffs of, say, the aerospace industry in Southern California.
"By most of the traditional criteria, Dayton is doing pretty well," said Mr. Tillson, who sits on the board of the Miami Valley Economic Development Coalition, which was formed in 1994 to help guide Dayton into the new economic era. "But people just don't feel that way."
They know that thousands of jobs -- middle-management, government, blue-collar -- have disappeared, and that more could go at any time. The anxiety is everywhere. From the mostly white East Side to the mostly black West Side; over coffee in the new $300,000 homes of suburban Centerville, in the classrooms at John Patterson High School downtown: the conversation inevitably returns to the loss of jobs, the fear of losing jobs, the decline of the middle class, the rise of the global economy, the end of the American dream.
"Downsizing -- I hate that word," Chuck McElligott said one evening, recalling the feelings of all the people he knew who had lost their jobs. " 'You just blew my life away, and you're telling me I was downsized.' "
And yet, Dayton is not falling apart. People here talk a lot about their communal ability to work things out, and the civic physics of Dayton today is indeed a constant push and pull. So while out-of-town journalists may have dismissed Dayton as an unlikely backwater setting for the Bosnia peace talks, people here thought it the perfect place.
Dayton's arts organizations may be getting less corporate money, but with that threat as inspiration, the Dayton Art Institute has raised a record $18 million in two years, including $11 million from individuals.
The city's public schools may be struggling to prepare their students for the needs of the new economy, but Sinclair Community College is confidently busy -- virtually 24 hours a day, 7 days a week -- training, or retraining, 65,000 local residents for these post-industrial times.
Chuck McElligott and his family are also working hard to cope in the new economy. Mr. McElligott, 55, a one-time University of Dayton football star, lost his job five years ago when the graphic-design company where he had spent 23 years shut down, partly because of the problems at NCR. He considers himself lucky to have found another job, even if it is for longer hours and less pay. His wife, Armonde, gave up her volunteer work at the library and got a paying job, teaching school. College for Charlie, the youngest of their three children, was going to be tough to afford.
But last fall, the future seemed full of possibility for Charlie, a senior and the best player on the football team at suburban Oakwood High School. He had cardboard boxes stuffed with letters from interested Big Ten schools.
In the second game of the season, he broke his pelvis in two places. Football was out for the rest of the year. And so, it became quickly apparent, was the football scholarship.
Mrs. McElligott recalled her son's reaction at the hospital, when the doctor described the seriousness of the injury. "His eyes welled up, but he didn't cry," she said. "Then he looked at us, and said, 'O.K., we've got to think of Plan B.' "
This is what Dayton feels like right now: All the people, and all the institutions, are groping for Plan B.
 
'The Cash' Was No More
History, local history, is also part of the conversation here. People may sometimes feel as if their community is in danger of splitting apart, but history is still what they own together.
Never, according to that history, did Dayton's people and institutions pull together more fiercely than during the flood of 1913. The flood killed 300 people and wiped out scores of businesses. Luckily (or was it destiny?), the National Cash Register Company was on high ground. Overnight, the company was transformed into an emergency shelter and hospital, as well as a printing plant for The Dayton Daily News. From the waters of the flood, and a vast common effort, modern Dayton was born.
In the decades that followed, the Cash boomed, and so did Dayton. While Detroit made cars, Akron made tires and Pittsburgh made steel, Dayton made all that and more. They called it "the city of a thousand factories." There were not just NCR, General Motors and Chrysler, but Dayton Press, Dayton Tire, Dayton Malleable.
"How did I feel about my future?" asked 53-year-old Kathleen Stewart, whose father, a Hungarian immigrant, worked in one of those factories and raised a family of 10 in a housing project. "I felt lucky. I was from Dayton. All you had to do was grow up. There was money everywhere."
She went straight from high school to the NCR plant to the middle class. "I was making $3.50 an hour," she said. "That was big money in those days. The company treated you like you were family."
By the 1970's, though, this city that had thrived on its mastery of technology was in danger of being done in by it. In deep financial trouble, NCR belatedly embraced the electronic age. It began carving out a niche selling automated teller machines and computer systems linking department stores. It also moved its manufacturing south, and abroad, where labor was cheap.
Twenty-thousand NCR jobs were lost, and soon the layoffs were echoed all over town: General Motors, 10,000 jobs, half of them at the Frigidaire plant, which closed; Chrysler, 5,000 jobs; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 3,000; Dayton Press, 3,000 more. By the mid-1980's, a third of Dayton's manufacturing jobs had been lost, about 50,000 in all. The city, and the society, that rose from the flood were effectively gone.
And a new Dayton began to emerge. In the churning of businesses opened, downsized and taken over, thousands of jobs have disappeared; many, many more have been created.
But that is only part of the story. Most of the new jobs, or at least the ones that do not require a college education, have been in lower-paying retail and service work. Indeed, median family income in Montgomery County, which includes Dayton, rose only about $1,000 between the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, to $36,069, from $34,903. And the unions, which once helped keep wages high, have lost much of their membership, and more of their power. The local A.F.L.-C.I.O., for example, had about 70,000 members in 1975 and fewer than 50,000 today.
Then in 1991, the Cash was no more. AT&T acquired the company in a hostile takeover. It was a disastrous marriage. The company lost a half-billion dollars in the first nine months of 1995 alone.
"You knew things were changing, but when AT&T took over NCR that was the landmark that proved it," Ms. Stewart said. "People can't depend on anything for the future. Anything can change in a New York minute."
Around Dayton, nothing so symbolized the unease with NCR's new identity as much as the name change, to AT&T Global Information Solutions. It felt as if some outsider had summarily renamed the town.
Today, Dayton is trying to re-create itself yet again. A new wave of small high-tech companies dot the fringes of town, working on computer projects with Wright-Patterson. And so everyone here is asking the chronic question: Can this cradle of invention reinvent itself well enough to make up for the losses of the past?
When Ms. Stewart returned to work after getting divorced, the best job she could find was at an electronic engraving company, where she took home $14,000 last year. When her refrigerator broke in early January and she could not afford a new one, she made do with a cooler and garbage bags buried in the snow outside her back door.
Her 25-year-old son, David, is trying to negotiate the new world as best he can. He makes about $8.50 an hour, including commissions, working nights at one of the big new service businesses, the Victoria's Secret Catalog company. There, hooked up to a telephone and a computer and surrounded by blow-ups of celebrity models, he sells Savoy robes and Miracle bras made abroad to customers from all over the world.
Mr. Stewart says he may enroll at Sinclair. What does he want to study? "Something with a guaranteed job." His other plan is to leave Dayton, and go south.
 
No Commitments
Karen Myers is 40 years old, a lawyer and the mother of three. Her husband, Robert, is a pediatrician. Her father-in-law worked for the old NCR. They live in a new neighborhood of custom-built homes in Centerville. Family by family, she says, her community is being taken apart.
"Many of these kids I see are on their fifth or sixth move because the company keeps saying, 'We're not making enough money; we need to downsize more,' " she said recently. "It used to be military families. Now it's modern life. It really hurts the child's ability to develop those long-term commitments. It's devastating to the sense of community."
Some 100 houses in and around Centerville were on the market last fall, after G.I.S. announced its latest round of 1,300 layoffs.
Mrs. Myers is on the board of the Centerville United Methodist Church, a medium-size church.
"I see people moving to the mega- , super-sized churches," she said. "I don't see them moving because the churches offer more services. They're able to attend without commitment. You can go and be one of the many and be invisible."
Mrs. Myers was talking over coffee and muffins with her neighbor, Mary Ellen Knecht. Mrs. Knecht and her husband, Mark, who quit his job at G.I.S. last fall for more satisfying and lucrative work, have four children.
"We are the new homeless," said Mrs. Knecht. NCR had moved her family from Indianapolis to Wichita, Kan., to Dayton to South Carolina and, four years ago, back to Dayton. Each time, they bought a house with a 30-year mortgage.
In South Carolina, Mrs. Knecht was president of her Methodist church women's group. She sang in the choir. She helped set up computer labs in the schools.
Now, she said, "I'm not building anything here. I attend church. I haven't joined. When they pass around the attendance card on Sundays, I want to write down: 'I'm moving.' "
Now the family was planning a move to Virginia. Mr. Knecht has been living there since October, when he took a job with a software company called DataFocus.
Sipping her coffee, Mrs. Myers said: "My husband has been clipping articles out of Pediatric Journal on the effects of moving on kids."
Mrs. Knecht asked: "What do they say?"
Mrs. Myers: "You don't want to know."
 
'The Safety Net Was Us'
Monday mornings, Cinda Woodward rises early, very early, so she can send her husband, Jeff, off at 5:30 on the first leg of his weekly commute -- the 90-minute drive to the Cincinnati airport. By noon, he arrives in Gainesville, Fla., where he goes to work as the chief financial officer for Gold Standard Multimedia, an electronic health-care publishing company. He rents a small apartment where he eats, sleeps and exercises on a NordicTrack. Thursday night he is back at the Gainesville airport.
"I've rationalized it to myself that I'm gone three nights, and home four nights," he said cheerfully.
Mr. Woodward left his Dayton job at Mead Data Central last May after it was acquired by Reed Elsevier P.L.C., a Dutch-British conglomerate, which eliminated 400 jobs.
He is one of the new nomad dads. They have been laid off, transferred or, like Mr. Woodward, they have simply decided to leave, dissatisfied with what their corporate lives have become. Now, they commute by plane to new jobs that they consider no more permanent than the old ones. Three of Mr. Woodward's former Mead co-workers have become nomad dads, too. One commutes to Manhattan, another to New Jersey, the third to Chicago.
"I'd rather be the one to be the nomad than drag the whole family around the country," Mr. Woodward said, adding that at 48, he considers himself fortunate to have the education and the financial flexibility to adapt to the new world.
Against his commuting grind, Mr. Woodward is trying hard to hold onto the family life and community that he says anchor him in the world. And so at 10:30 on a Saturday morning in early January, after a week made even more grueling than usual by a blizzard, he was at choir practice at the Oakwood United Methodist Church.
The sun was streaming through the stained-glass windows. Cinda and their 18-year-old daughter, Leslie, were in front, raising their voices in strains of "Agnus Dei." Leslie's brother, Paul, 14, would have been there, too, but he had basketball practice. Mr. Woodward was at the lectern. He is not just a member of the choir, he directs it.
He never considered giving up the choir, he said later. Neither, apparently, would any of the other 20 regulars. They all showed up that Saturday. "The choir is like an extended family," Mr. Woodward said. "This is how you keep in touch."
But across Dayton, scores of other people are too exhausted, or frustrated, or just too plain busy, to keep in touch. "No one," said Kathleen Stewart, "has time to eat dinner together anymore." Everywhere you go, you meet working mothers who used to stay home, people with two jobs who used to have one, high-school students who have taken jobs to help out their families and prepare themselves for the future.
Mr. Woodward said he became concerned in the early 1990's when, as Mead's representative, he headed the planning and allocations committee for the Dayton United Way.
"It has gotten harder to recruit people as volunteers," said Mr. Woodward, who had to give up his United Way position after he left Mead. "A lot of the women have gone back to work, and because of that a lot of the guys have picked up bigger child-care responsibilities. It spreads around, and makes everyone less available."
Business leaders and politicians used to clamor for invitations to lunch at the Sertoma Club, which helps the poor. Today, the club is down to 50 members, its influence is at an ebb, and speakers are hard to find. The Rotary Club is having membership troubles, too, and so Rotarians no longer must attend 60 percent of meetings or face expulsion.
"Did you ever read de Tocqueville?" asked Mr. Bayless, who would never consider missing one of the weekly Sertoma lunches. "One of his points was that Americans in 1831, they associated together. There were all these associations.
"It was one of the things that made America work, that made it unique. The safety net was not just government. It was us."
 
View From the West Side
Job losses and economic uncertainty are hardly news to blacks in Dayton. Few blacks ever got on at NCR, and the jobs they did find, usually in Dayton's hot, dirty and dangerous foundries, were never guaranteed.
"We were always the last hired, first fired," said Lloyd Lewis Jr., a black State Representative. "We'd do it every five, six years. They'd lay off the bottom of the work force, then hire them back."
Dayton, which is 40 percent black, has long been racially segregated. Blacks live on the West Side, whites on the East. When Mr. Lewis, who is 69, graduated from the University of Dayton with a business degree in 1948, NCR offered jobs to all his white classmates but not to him. He was fortunate. He escaped the foundries by going to work in his family's Goodyear tire franchise, and today he lives in a middle-class West Side neighborhood.
A lot of Dayton's black foundry workers made it to the middle class, too. But no one ever talked about downsizing factory and foundry workers -- black or white.
"Downsizing -- that's a middle-class term," said Mr. Lewis, who two years ago retired as an assistant vice president of the Dayton Power & Light Company. "Now it's affected the white middle-class middle management, where no one ever thought it would go."
And while plenty of middle-class blacks are also being hurt, they do not feel betrayed the way so many whites do, Mr. Lewis said.
"We never had it to be betrayed," he said. "It's just like the Depression. People jumped off the top of skyscrapers. Black people didn't commit suicide. You couldn't commit suicide jumping out of a basement."
The Rev. Raleigh Trammell came north from Georgia in the 1950's and created his own job, making sandwiches for factory workers. For rich and for poor, he said, "Dayton was a work town."
Today, inner-city Dayton is not the work town it used to be. With little to replace the foundries, unemployment is around 15 percent, compared with 4.8 percent in the county. To people there, who have little mobility, the new jobs, in the suburbs and outlying areas, might as well be four states away.
The day before Christmas, Fred Sampson, 49, and Joseph Atkinson, 20, were earning a few dollars at Mr. Trammell's church, loading crates of oranges for poor families.
"What happened to all those places?" Mr. Atkinson asked, referring to the shut-down foundries.
"Cheap labor," said Mr. Sampson.
 
Power Leaves Town, Too
"It was a white boys' club," said Mr. Tillson, the publisher, describing how power and politics used to work in Dayton.
The white boys were the corporate executives. They ran the town through its city manager, mayor and city commission. These days, though, the white boys' club is mostly gone.
"Power is distributed now," said John Moore, who went to work at Wright-Patterson as a clerk in 1946, and eventually became the first black personnel director there. "There are more people at the table." Mr. Moore, who is retired, is chairman of Sinclair Community College.
The waning of the white boys' club made it easy for Willie F. Walker, president of the Dayton Urban League, to introduce himself to John Granzau, chairman of Standard Register, at a 1991 reception for a new banker in town. At lunch a week later, Mr. Walker made his pitch. He needed two community workers for an inner-city neighborhood. The price: $60,000 over three years. After another lunch, this time with the chief executive, Mr. Walker had his workers.
But today, stories like that are less common. The entire community, black and white, has less access to corporate power and money. More of Dayton's top executives are accountable to headquarters somewhere else, and, what with global economics, a lot of them aren't even in Dayton half the time; they're on airplanes.
David H. Ponitz, the president of Sinclair, told of one local executive who had been trying for six months to get $50,000 from his company's out-of-town headquarters for a community project.
"There used to be more C.E.O.'s who could make immediate decisions on community issues," Mr. Ponitz said. "Now there is more checking with corporate offices outside of Dayton to get those same decisions. And they usually come at a lower level of interest, and a lower dollar level."
Frederick C. Smith, the retired chief executive of Huffy Bicycle, recalled a 1993 luncheon with Jerre Stead, then the chief executive of AT&T's new acquisition. Mr. Smith, along with five other local business and community leaders, had been summoned to the old NCR private dining room.
"Jerre Stead walked in at precisely 12 o'clock," Mr. Smith said. "We were all in coats and ties. He came in a cardigan sweater. He let us know he was sandwiching us in between meetings with Business Week and Morgan Stanley. He talked for one hour almost nonstop and left at precisely 1 o'clock.
"I went home later and told my wife I didn't understand a word he said. It was all about the information highway and globalization and 'It's a new world.' " Dayton scarcely came up in the conversation, Mr. Smith said. "Jerre Stead didn't know a thing about Dayton."
Last June, Mr. Stead left to head a software company in Virginia. He was replaced by Lars Nyberg, a Swede who had never lived in America.
Given the changes at G.I.S., it is not surprising that the United Way missed its goal the last two years. In 1995, with a $400,000 corporate contribution, the company remained the fund's biggest corporate giver. But as its work force fell to 3,500, from 4,500 in 1992, employee contributions fell to about $840,000, from about $2 million, according to Jim Keeney, the regional A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s liaison to the United Way.
Now, as the company prepares to be cut loose from AT&T, it is planning a rescue strategy based on a return to its business roots: computer systems for stores, banks and big companies. And, said the chief financial officer, John Giering, it remains committed to Dayton. "We are still very supportive of the community," he said.
Mr. Nyberg has begun to be more visible around town. He attended a Rotary lunch in December, and held a community reception in January.
"I think as time moves on, and we become a public company," Mr. Giering said, "Lars will be spending more time in Dayton."
 
Where Have the Banks Gone?
George Bayless was alone in his office in Dayton's fading downtown. Nobody was in the adjoining offices. After yet another "consolidation" last fall, Mr. Bayless was the only person left in his department at National City Bank. "Is it a permanent job?" he asked. "As permanent as any job is nowadays."
Mr. Bayless has had an intimate association with Dayton's banks over the years. In the last decade, he has had to get used to a lot of changes. Gem Savings & Loan Association, where he started out as a teller 36 years ago, was merged into the Cleveland-based National City Bank. Mr. Bayless, who was then a purchasing officer with his two daughters just barely through college, says he was lucky to keep his job.
Mr. Bayless ticked off the other changes: "Winters Bank became Bank One. Third National became Society, which became Key Society, which is headquartered in Cleveland." Third National was where he opened his first savings account, when he was 10 years old and a paper boy. Today, there is one locally owned financial institution in town, Citizens Federal, a savings bank.
With the loss of the hometown banks, small-business owners say it can be harder to get a loan. But more than that, out-of-town ownership is another blow to the sense of Dayton as a distinct hometown.
Kathleen Stewart is not looking for a loan, and she has no money to invest. For her, it comes down to trust. "I've dropped banks," she said. "They all changed names so many times." Now, she uses a credit union.
Mr. Bayless has a new title at the bank these days. He is the business recovery coordinator. In the event of a disaster -- "a fire, say, or something like the Oklahoma City bombing" -- it would be his job to come up with Plan B. In that sort of disaster, he said, he would know how to help people -- "whereas, the economy, people's attitudes, you can't repair those disasters."
 
Studying for an Edge
If there is one institution that is trying to prepare Daytonians for the future, it is Sinclair Community College. Sometimes it seems as if every other person in Dayton is either enrolled at Sinclair, taking a class there or planning to do so. They are studying everything from computer graphics to medical data processing to advanced manufacturing. More than 20 percent of the students have undergraduate degrees and are back to learn new job skills; many have been laid off. Sinclair's nine downtown blocks of modern, rectangular buildings -- with numbers instead of names, and no ivy anywhere -- are a pure statement of utilitarian purpose.
"This is everyone's hope, right here," 35-year-old Tommy Weems, a business major, said as he walked to his car after classes.
Mr. Ponitz is considered one of the most important people in town. When he arrived 20 years ago, Sinclair had 7,000 students. Today there are 65,000. Their average age is 32. At $31 per credit hour -- one third the cost of tuition at Ohio State -- Sinclair is the least expensive college in the state.
"You have to understand what the new reality is," Mr. Ponitz said. "The new reality is that you have to know something that somebody else doesn't know, but that is not enough. You have to keep growing dramatically if you're really going to keep a job."
At 10 o'clock one night, Rob Lind and 11 other men who are trying very hard to adjust to the new reality were gathered around a computer in a classroom in Building No. 11. They are learning to be machine-tool operators, and today that means they have to know computers. Class meets Monday through Friday, 10 P.M. to 7 A.M.
Mr. Lind, who is 32, had already put in his usual 9 1/2 hours at the garage where he has been a mechanic for 14 years, making $11 an hour without benefits. "I can go anywhere from here and make $15 an hour," he said.
Last semester, Mr. Lind, who gets by on about three hours sleep, earned a 4.0 average. "I didn't want to crawl around under cars my whole life," he explained.
 
In Search of an Identity
When a man loses his job, his identity is shaken. The same could be said for a town when it loses the old way of work.
"What is Dayton's identity now?" Mr. Bayless asked as he drove by the vacant, snowy expanse that once was the Cash. He paused a long moment, then shook his head. "I don't know."
As it gropes for a new identity, and with the centennial of powered flight just seven years away, Dayton is getting ready to celebrate its own hometown heroes -- the Wright brothers. The old West Side bicycle shop where they began to develop the first airplane will become the centerpiece of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. "We're trying to gather around this flight thing," Mr. Bayless said. "We're trying to work out an identity based on that."
Speaking of history and identity, in January, G.I.S. had news that was received here as a small victory. "Drawing upon a 112-year history," Lars Nyberg announced, "we begin to build our exciting future by renaming our company -- NCR."

HEADLINE: The Street Cop In Pin Stripes

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Lou Matarazzo takes off his gun, a snubnose .38 he is packing under his pin-stripe suit, and slips it into the drawer of his burnished horseshoe desk.
"Guess I won't need this for a few hours," he says with just a flicker of bravado, enough to insure that the gesture does not go unnoticed. 
 Mr. Matarazzo, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, might say the gun shows that -- despite the corner-office view of the Brooklyn Bridge and the closet stocked with red wine -- he is still a street cop. He may wear tasseled lace-ups but they are spit-shined.
But those who have been on the receiving end of his powers of persuasion might say it shows something else: that he is an impresario of the implied threat, the figurative show of force.
In the year since he took the helm of New York City's police union, Mr. Matarazzo has wielded a blend of political polish and street smarts to push through his union's biggest legislative victory in 20 years. Descending on lawmakers' offices with or without an appointment, he and his platoon of union leaders last month helped persuade the Legislature to override Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of a bill that would strengthen the hand of the city's police officers in contract disputes.
The victory only escalated tensions with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in what Mr. Matarazzo now calls a war. The Mayor had strenuously opposed the bill, now law, under which contract disputes involving the city's police and firefighters will be arbitrated by a state board considered to be more generous than the city board.
Mr. Giuliani has since declared that talks on the police officers' new contract are at an impasse and his aides have warned that the city will consider a range of cost-cutting measures for the Police Department, including one-person patrol cars and limits on overtime pay.
Mr. Matarazzo has retaliated by saying he would not endorse Mr. Giuliani in the next mayoral election. Recently, he has floated the prospect that he might endorse someone else, like Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, the City Comptroller, Alan Hevesi, or City Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn.
"The Mayor made up his mind and I made up my mind," Mr. Matarazzo said. "It'll never get patched up as long as he keeps fighting us."
Even those who question whether Mr. Giuliani needs the backing of the P.B.A. president or the union's 28,000 members to win a second term acknowledge that the square-jowled 56-year-old union leader could prove a tough sparring partner.
"The Mayor and Matarazzo, they both dig in," said Michael Julian, who retired last year as chief of personnel for the Police Department. "If he wasn't as strong on these points, he would probably be replaced by a more vocal and militant president."
Unlike his more patrician predecessor, Phil Caruso, who preferred behind the-scenes jockeying, Mr. Matarazzo has embraced hands-on lobbying. In Albany, he took to carrying two pieces of paper with him: a stub from his police paycheck and a pay stub belonging to Police Officer Thomas Barbieri of Nassau County.
Officer Barbieri happens to be married to Mr. Matarazzo's daughter, Annamaria. He also happens to make $63,000 after nine years with the Nassau department, in contrast to the maximum pay of $47,000 for a New York City police officer. (Mr. Matarazzo actually makes twice that, because the union matches his police salary.)
"He is absolutely passionate about it, and personal," said James Lysaght, the P.B.A.'s chief counsel and lobbyist in Albany.
If, as Hugh Mo, a deputy police commissioner from 1984 to 1988 says, the P.B.A. "is the proverbial 800-pound gorilla," Mr. Matarazzo is its gregarious handler. With its millions in dues, the union wields its power through campaign contributions and the influence that comes from the reluctance of elected officials to appear anti-police (read "soft on crime").
 
Political Muscle In the Suburbs
Many New York City officers also have political muscle in the suburbs, where most live. This afternoon, Mr. Matarazzo is scheduled to receive a visit from Mr. Pataki, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and other dignitaries, when he will announce the union's endorsement of Senator Bob Dole in the Republican Presidential primary.
While Mr. Matarazzo is clearly bent on using all lobbying tools at the P.B.A.'s disposal, he seems to think he may be his own best weapon.
"I was seen more in Albany in the last few months than they'd ever seen any P.B.A. president," he said. "No one wants to see it on paper. They want to see you tell them. They have a right to see me in person and see how I present myself."
He presents himself as rough cut, earthy but earnest, the kind of man who takes satisfaction in the two Webster's dictionaries he received from union officers jokingly comparing Mr. Matarazzo with his urbane and articulate predecessor.
Two days after the Governor's veto, Mr. Matarazzo was back in the capital, urging legislators to override the veto, and to do it fast, before the newspaper editorial writers that Mr. Matarazzo calls "the boo birds" persuaded them otherwise.
"People looked at me and said, 'I don't believe you,' " he said. "Most of them thought I would accept the veto. I think I took them by sneak attack."
The son of a shoemaker from Avellino, Italy, Mr. Matarazzo grew up in an East Harlem apartment with no telephone or television. When he was 15, his family moved to the Patterson housing projects in the South Bronx.
A star third baseman and catcher at James Monroe High School, Mr. Matarazzo said sports helped keep him out of trouble. That and the Boys Club of New York, where he sold towels after school and eventually became an athletic director.
"At Christmastime, I was given an apple, a bag of candy and a flannel shirt," he said.
When it became clear that he would never make it to the New York Yankees, he became a police officer, walking a beat in Long Island City's 108th Precinct.
Barely six months after he started, Officer Matarazzo was deployed to Harlem to keep order during the riots in summer 1964. "I remember standing in Mount Morris Park during the riots and we didn't have helmets," he said. "I thought this was crazy."
He went to some Con Edison workers in Queens and borrowed as many hard hats as he could, spray-painting the orange utility helmets blue.
Five years later, Mr. Matarazzo became the P.B.A. delegate from the 108th Precinct. In the 1970's, when a lieutenant offered to put him up for detective, "I said: 'Don't bother. I'm going to get on the P.B.A. board,' " Mr. Matarazzo said. In 1977, he became the union trustee for Queens, and in 1991, he was elected recording secretary and then treasurer.
When Mr. Caruso announced his retirement in January 1995 after 15 years as president, Mr. Matarazzo won his endorsement over higher-ranking union officers. "I felt I was the most qualified for the job," he said. "We were in very difficult times. I did not want to see this union destroyed."
 
Union Is Powerful But Suspect
The difficulties went beyond the city's economic troubles and the labor contract, which expired as he took over in March 1995. Mr. Matarazzo inherited leadership of a union that is powerful but suspect, accused by the Mollen Commission of being "a shelter for the corrupt cop," tipping off corrupt officers to investigations and encouraging a secretive "us versus them" environment.
Last year, senior Police Department officials accused union delegates of trying to thwart major corruption inquiries by explaining in detail how to spot undercover operations. Other blemishes on the P.B.A. include the 1988 forced resignation of the union's chief lawyer after he took millions from union funds to pay his gambling debts, and the rowdy and profane behavior by officers at a 1992 rally at City Hall.
Mr. Matarazzo says these are isolated incidents and that he has taken small steps to distance the union from officers who appear clearly guilty of crimes. But he continues to defend officers like Francis X. Livoti, who was charged with choking 29-year-old Anthony Baez to death in the Bronx last year. Mr. Matarazzo said Officer Livoti, who has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, "was doing his job."
"He got involved with a 5-foot-6, woefully out of shape, 270-pound asthmatic who happened to die when he wrestled him to the ground," Mr. Matarazzo said.
Mr. Matarazzo said he was cooperating with the Police Department's efforts to fight corruption. But he said the union did not need to take a more aggressive anticorruption role because officers get adequate back room lectures, where they are told, among other things, that "Internal Affairs will have programs out there to try to entice you."
"Police officers can get into trouble for thinking they're doing the right thing, like quote unquote perjurious statements," he said. "They might get overzealous. Police officers are not allowed to make a mistake, a legitimate honest mistake, but the defendant can."
 
Keeping in Touch With the Troops
Starting his day at 5 A.M. -- "I don't even need to use an alarm clock," he said -- he often stops at a precinct in one borough or another on the way from his Nassau County home to the union's high-rise near the Fulton Fish Market.
One day last week, he breezed in to the Midtown North station house on West 54th Street in time for the 3 P.M. shift change. In the back room, 35 men and a few women in uniform listened with arms crossed or hands on hips, peppering him with questions about health benefits, pay raises, the arbitration bill.
Here, too, Mr. Matarazzo was a lobbyist, telling the crowd how hard he was working on their behalf, how stunning his victory was in Albany. He slapped a lot of backs, gabbing with one officer about her recent marriage and kidding a short officer that he was lucky the department no longer had a height requirement.
He reminded them of a voter registration drive he started for officers and their families, telling them that the union was putting legislators' voting records on computer and would eventually give members a list of the union's endorsements.
"When you go out in November, you'll know who to vote for," he said.
For now, the Giuliani-Matarazzo face-off shows no sign of ebbing, with the administration filing a legal challenge to the new arbitration law and shrugging off the endorsement question.
"What he's doing is putting a price tag on his endorsement, and that's a big mistake," said the First Deputy Mayor, Peter J. Powers. "Anybody who takes that endorsement now is very tainted. It's a poison pill that's going to blow up in their stomach."
But some say the Mayor won't have such an easy time of it. "If you want to take on the P.B.A., you are really going to go to the mat," Mr. Mo said. "Giuliani is one of the few guys who wants to take them head on, but he's in for an eye-opener."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Compromise Bill Tightening Curbs on Cuba

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The Senate moved today to punish the Cuban Government for its downing of two American private aircraft last month, passing legislation that would tighten the embargo on American trade with Cuba and punish other countries that insisted on continuing trade on their own.
The vote, on the final compromise version of legislation first approved by the House and Senate last fall, was 74 to 22. The compromise now goes to the House, which is expected to approve it later this week. 
 Canada, Russia and the European Union all condemned the proposal, and its foes in the Senate, all but three of them Democrats, denounced it as overwrought and almost certainly ineffective.
But President Clinton has already promised to sign the bill. Many Democrats and moderate Republicans like Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, said Cuba and its leader, Fidel Castro, had nobody to blame for the measure but themselves.
The chief sponsor of the measure in the Senate, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, took the floor "in a friendly sort of way" to admonish Canadians for their objections to the bill. "Let me remind them that Castro has had a murderous regime from the very beginning," he said. "I suggest that they be ashamed of themselves."
What angered the Canadians, Russians and others were provisions that seek to force other nations to toe the American policy of isolating Cuba economically.
The compromise bill would codify current executive orders that impose an economic embargo on Cuba, meaning the embargo could not be eased without Congress's approval. It would deny entry to the United States to foreigners who traffic in any confiscated American property. And it would give Americans a new legal right to sue foreign companies that make use of confiscated American property in Cuba.
A Republican aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who demanded anonymity said the clause, which covers about 200 confiscated American assets, aims more to discourage future foreign investment in Cuba than to spur lawsuits over old investments.
The legislation also seeks to break ties between Cuba and the former Soviet Union by linking American financial aid to the abandonment of trade and military relations with the Castro Government. The Russian Foreign Ministry was quoted as calling the measure "contrary to international law," saying Russia would expand its trade and economic relations with Cuba "strictly on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."
Meeting in Grenada, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada and 14 leaders of Caribbean nations urged President Clinton to reconsider his support. After meeting with the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, Canada's Trade Minister, Art Eggleston, called the bill a "dangerous precedent."
The measure was first passed by Congress last fall and seemed bound nowhere, hamstrung by a White House veto threat, until Feb. 24. On that day Cuban Air Force jets downed two planes off the Cuban coast, killing four members of an anti-Castro group. Four days later a House-Senate conference produced a compromise bill and the Clinton Administration dropped its objections after legislators modified language dealing with confiscated property.
The Senate majority leader and current favorite to oppose Mr. Clinton in the fall, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, praised the President today for supporting the bill. "There can be no doubt that the signal from the U.S. is stronger when the Democratic White House and Republican Congress speak with the same voice," he said in remarks on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Denver Airport Nestles Into Its Lair

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, March 5

 BODY:
Depriving cartoonists and television talk show hosts of a staple food, Denver International Airport has emerged in its first year as the nation's most efficient cold-weather airport.
Before its opening a year ago, Denver's $5 billion airport offered a steady source of national amusement with its on-again, off-again openings, its cost overruns and a baggage-handling system that chewed up suitcases with more abandon than a teen-ager with a mouthful of bubble gum. 
 But after a year of operation, Denver's airport ranks only after those in Honolulu and Las Vegas, Nev., for the fewest flight delays, according to a Federal Aviation Administration study of the nation's 20 busiest airports. And in sharp contrast to those balmy climes, Denver's airport last year had Arctic temperatures, 75 mile-an-hour winds and four feet of snow.
In addition, confounding predictions that the airport would go bankrupt in a year, airport officials calculate that they made an $8 million operating profit in the first year.
Slowly, revisionist attitudes are creeping into comments about the soaring tentlike glass structure that is still lampooned as the Taj Mahal of the high plains. As the first major airport built in the United States since the 1970's and the ninth-busiest one in the world, Denver International has seen its every shortcoming held under a magnifying glass.
"Any new airport takes a hit at the outset," said Jon F. Ash, managing director of Global Aviation Associates, a consulting company in Washington. "Ten years from now, everybody will using it. People will forget that it had a difficult birthing."
This month's spring break will present new tests to Denver International. With Easter often being Colorado's heaviest ski season, the equivalent of about 1 percent of the nation's population is expected to travel through.
Veteran East Coast skiers may wax nostalgic about the intimate feel of a youth hostel at Stapleton International, the old airport, when they were socked in on a Sunday evening too snowy for planes to take off. But skiers snoozing on couches are a rare sight at the new airport because with five runways to allow three simultaneous take-offs, the airport has cut delays, eliminating four of five previously experienced at Stapleton. Now, an average of 3 flights in 1,000 fail to take off within 15 minutes of leaving its gate, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
By contrast, Newark International Airport posts more than 10 times as many delays, with 35 per 1,000.
Contributing to the airport's overall efficiency, last year United Airlines, the dominant operator here, diverted only 26 of 100,000 planes it sent to Denver. And with fewer planes having to wait to land, United's flights to and from Denver are shorter now, by an average of seven minutes, allowing an annual savings of $13 million in crew time and jet fuel.
Local newspapers still pounce when the baggage system eats a bag in a particularly spectacular way. For example, two weeks ago, the automatic system mangled a $7,500 computer, a company's demonstration machine that had logged 150,000 air miles and was protected in a special case made of the same plastic used for football helmets. But statistics show that baggage loss and damage in Denver is well below the national average.
In December, a prime ski month, United handled 1.2 million bags here. The airline registered only 367 complaints. This ratio, 1 complaint for every 3,270 bags, is far better than the industry standard of 1 for 2,000.
"In Geneva, they just throw the skis out in a pile," David Brown, a 37-year-old skier from Edinburgh, said on Thursday as he watched an automated system pump skis out of the airport's bowels, each pair in its own standup bin. "This spoils you."
The new airport's profits have come, in part, from concession sales doubling the forecasts. The terminal and concourses have 100 stores, and some visitors say flying into Denver is like flying into a mall.
More money has also come from a surge in parking revenues. Denverites, it turns out, are not inclined to drive friends and family out to the airport, which is in wheat fields 25 miles northeast of downtown. So instead, travelers are driving themselves and parking.
But the new airport's first year shakedown flight has had its share of air bumps.
The number of people flying in and out of Denver dropped last year by 6 percent, to 31 million. This two million drop is largely attributed to a five million drop in passengers registered here by Continental Airlines, which abandoned its Denver hub in late 1994. The other big airlines registered increases in Denver traffic -- United up 8 percent; Delta, 9 percent; American, 10 percent; Northwest, 14 percent, and TWA, 17 percent.
But to the relief of travelers, United's high fares spawned discount airlines. In a fare war last month, it was cheaper to fly to Salt Lake City -- $19 than to take a taxi from downtown Denver to the airport -- $35, plus tip.
Because of United's dominance, Denver International has not become a truly international airport. United prefers to send its international passengers from here to coastal hubs, and foreign airlines are reluctant to fly here if United will not feed them passengers. So overseas flights are scheduled only to Mexico and Canada.
But after United States authorities initialed an "open skies" agreement with Germany last month, Denver city officials decided to lobby Lufthansa for a direct flight from here to Frankfurt.
Noise complaints have also soared, despite the fact that the isolated airport occupies 54 square miles, an area twice the size of Manhattan. Last week, a citizens group, Colorado Coalition Against Aircraft Noise, resorted to what is a serious scare tactic here: hiring "a New York lawyer."
Throughout the year, the new airport has produced enough picturesque incidents to keep local radio talk show hosts alive.
In mid-January, Bea Romer, wife of Colorado's Governor, Roy Romer, had her wallet picked from her purse while riding a train from a concourse to the terminal. Later that month, Denver's 1996 telephone books were issued without any listing for the airport, the regions's largest public works project in memory. There was a "Denver International Airport" listing but it was for a model plane airport.
Tired of cab drivers grousing about a dearth of fares, city officials first tried sending them to "charm school" -- classes that featured a video on the new airport's wonders. When that did not work, one official proposed planting city spies to monitor cab drivers' enthusiasm levels.
"Snitches to rat on cabbies dissing D.I.A.," screamed the city's tabloid, The Rocky Mountain News. Denver's Mayor, Wellington Webb, quickly killed the proposal, calling it "a stupid idea."
While Denverites love to grumble about their new airport, visitors are often more boosterish than locals.
"I love it: The big risk of D.I.A. is that you miss your connection because you get embroiled in one of the bookstores," said George Gilder, the technology writer, on Thursday night after arriving here with two of his daughters for a cross-country ski vacation. "Colorado has a high-tech economy. The airport is an investment in the future."
On Friday, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, gushed to a skeptical audience at the Denver Press Club: "I think you've got a great airport. From where it's located, you get a great feeling of what it must have been like to be a pioneer crossing the plains."

HEADLINE: Business Advice From the Sidelines;
It's Management By Game Theory

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Can an N.B.A. coach offer an M.B.A. anything besides entertainment?
Phil Jackson and Pat Riley think so. Mr. Jackson, coach of the Chicago Bulls, the leading team in the National Basketball Association, turned his hardwood lessons into a new book, "Sacred Hoops." His debut on the management bookshelves follows the motivational success of Mr. Riley, author of "The Winner Within" and the former coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks who now leads the Miami Heat. 
 The business-as-sport metaphor seems to have reached another cyclical peak. Mr. Riley and Mr. Jackson are best sellers among coaches-turned-management-gurus, a group that grows every year. Publishers churn out new titles like "Everyone's a Coach," by Don Shula, (who actually isn't, having resigned his post with the National Football League Miami Dolphins), and "Game Plans for Success: Winning Strategies for Business and Life from 10 Top N.F.L. Head Coaches."
"The profusion of books comparing macho-coaching to maestro-management has become a heavy industry," said Warren Bennis, a professor of business administration at the University of Southern California who has written many books on leadership.
Publishing and management experts say the appeal of these successors to popular motivational icons like the late Vince Lombardi and George Allen is that they talk the language of leadership, one of the prevailing buzzwords of an increasingly fast-moving economy in which business executives are often required to reinvent systems rather than run existing ones and to push more responsibility onto their employees rather than control them.
"Managers spend much more time thinking about coaching and building teams," said Noel Tichy, a business professor at the University of Michigan who has written on the subject. "The new game of business is one that requires engaging each individual in personal, intellectual and emotional excellence, while paradoxically being a superb team player."
These are more abstract concepts than follow-the-rules management, so many business people are turning to less traditional books for advice, from "Jesus C.E.O.: Using Ancient Wisdom for Visionary Leadership," to "Make It So: Leadership Lessons from Star Trek, the Next Generation."
But coaches appear to have an edge over Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. They are familiar leadership figures to anyone who has ever played organized sports. The language of business is infused with sports terms. And the seats at sports events are often filled with upper-income managers who enjoy second-guessing a Phil Jackson or a Pat Riley.
But is it all hooey? In an attempt to assess whether coaches can really offer business people useful advice, Mr. Bennis, Mr. Tichy and Charles Farkas, co-author of a new book on leadership and a director at Bain & Company, a management consulting firm, were asked to critique the books by Mr. Jackson and Mr. Riley.
The three experts said that "Sacred Hoops" (Hyperion Press) and "The Winner Within" (G. P. Putnam's Sons, hard cover; Berkley Books, paperback) cover familiar themes -- the importance of goals, teamwork, pride and learning from mistakes, as well as the art of knowing when and how to motivate workers or criticize and discipline them.
But they added that the two coaches -- who said through spokesmen that they were too busy to be interviewed for this article -- did find new and compelling ways to flesh out these old truths. "People learn best through stories," Mr. Farkas said. "We capture those images in our mind, replay them and remember the lesson to be learned. Both Riley and Jackson paint very interesting and memorable portraits of leadership."
To be sure, others believe the basketball-as-business metaphor is entirely inappropriate.
Rick Wolff, a senior editor at Warner Books, a former sports psychologist for the Cleveland Indians and author of 15 books on both sports and business, noted that it is easy to get rid of an unproductive player by cutting or trading him. But in business, dismissing an employee often requires extensive documentation and carries the threat of a wrongful-termination suit. Playing ball, he added, is just that: playing. Athletes are easier to motivate than employees grinding through jobs with no off-season.
"In the long run, sports and coaching is about fun, entertainment and excitement," Mr. Wolff said, "In contrast, work is about, well, work."
A less debatable observation, however, is that the two coaches have very different styles of leadership.
Mr. Farkas described Mr. Jackson as a "human assets" manager, the type of executive who focuses on managing people and the relationships between them, in part by fostering certain attitudes and values in an organization. This is the style, Mr. Farkas said, of Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and Wayne Calloway at Pepsico.
Mr. Jackson, for example, writes that creating a successful basketball team or sales force is "essentially a spiritual act."
"Most leaders tend to view teamwork as a social engineering problem: take X group, add Y motivational technique and get Z result. But working with the Bulls, I've learned that the most effective way to forge a winning team is to call on the players' need to connect with something larger than themselves."
Mr. Jackson regularly offers his players books to read, tailoring his choices to broaden each player's horizons. He takes his team on field trips. He encourages his players to study meditation. He prefers a light management touch, sometimes interspersing game films with clips from movies like "The Wizard of Oz" (in one meeting, a game tape showed Horace Grant falling for a fake, followed by the Scarecrow wishing he had a brain). Early in his Bulls coaching career, he convinced his superstar, Michael Jordan, that to win championships, he must help raise his teammates' performance.
Mr. Jackson writes that he strives to be "an invisible leader" by giving players increasing responsibility to shape their roles on the team.
Mr. Riley, by contrast, employs the "box approach" to leadership, Mr. Farkas said. In this widely used style of leadership, a chief executive establishes rules, structures, values and performance measures and clearly defines what is expected of every employee.
For example, Mr. Riley developed a statistical approach -- similar to the benchmarking practices used at many businesses -- for measuring his players' performance against that of their peers. Mr. Riley also offers readers plenty of rules for living and winning: "Shoulda, coulda, and woulda won't get it done"; "Giving yourself permission to lose guarantees a loss."
The reviewers said Mr. Jackson's ruminations were more original than Mr. Riley's motivational exhortations but that Mr. Riley's book would be somewhat more practical for most readers. So far, Mr. Riley's book has been the better seller. In its first several months in bookstores, sales of "The Winner Within," which was published in hard cover in 1993, outpaced the early sales of "Sacred Hoops," published last year, 2 to 1, according to the Ingram Book Company, a book wholesaler.
In many ways, the two coaches' outlooks are distilled in their views on winning.
To motivate his Los Angeles Lakers team before facing the Boston Celtics in the second game of the 1985 championship finals, Mr. Riley told his players a personal story of the last words his father said to him years earlier after he was cut from the San Diego Rockets and invited to the Portland Trailblazers' training camp. Paraphrasing that advice, Mr. Riley wrote: "Every now and then there comes a day where someplace, sometime, you simply have to plant your feet, stand firm and make a point about who you are and what you believe in."
For Mr. Jackson, there is more to basketball than basketball, and there is more to life than winning. He disagrees with Lombardi, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach, who once said, "There is no room for second place. There's only one place, and that's first place."
"How can anyone," Mr. Jackson writes, "from sports figures to entrepreneurs, possibly maintain their self-esteem when this attitude dominates our cultural mindset?"
Clearly, each coach knows how to win, but how would they fare running a corporation?
Not so well, according to Mr. Tichy, Mr. Bennis and Mr. Farkas, who said that for all their leadership skills, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Riley would lack the "business literacy" to run a large corporation.
Mr. Tichy said leaders must increasingly spend time teaching their views on leadership and how to grow and change a business to nurture future leaders among their employees.
Mr. Bennis said that top executives these days must be experts in corporate finance to excel. "All the successful C.E.O.'s I know know their numbers," he said, "and, more important, they understand how those numbers are derived and what they mean in the specific contexts in which they work."
But Mr. Farkas, who is based in Bain's Boston office, said that if he had to choose either coach to be a chief executive, he believes Mr. Riley would be the better leader for a company in need of a rapid turnaround, while Mr. Jackson belongs in an organization that has already mastered the basics.
"Personally, I would rather play for Phil Jackson," Mr. Farkas added. "But my home-team Celtics could use a dose of Pat Riley."

A Race for Votes in New York
 
The three major Republican Presidential candidates raced their campaigns across New York. Senator Bob Dole began the campaign day on a traditional note, paying tribute to New York's politicians and culture. It fell to Patrick J. Buchanan to end the day on a more strident note, attacking Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Steve Forbes moved his campaign to the highways. [Page A1.]
 
Mr. Buchanan raised the possibility that he would not endorse Bob Dole for President if Mr. Dole wins the nomination. [B6.]
 
Senator Dole beamed in the bosom of one of the most formidable political machines, the Nassau County Republican organization. [B8.]
 
Street Smarts and Pin Stripes
 
In the year since he took the helm of New York City's police union, Lou Matarazzo has wielded a blend of political polish and street smarts to push through his union's biggest legislative victory in 20 years. He helped persuade the Legislature to override Governor Pataki's veto of a bill that would strengthen the city's police officers in contract disputes. The victory escalated tensions with Mayor Giuliani in what Mr. Matarazzo now calls a war. [B1.]
 
Loss of a Jewish Symbol
 
The murder of Abe Lebewohl not only ended the life of a much-beloved figure in the life of the Lower East Side, but was also a symbol of the diminished Jewish presence in a neighborhood that served as a Plymouth Rock for newcomers from Eastern Europe. [B1.]
 
More than 200 people gathered at a synagogue on East Sixth Street to mourn for Mr. Lebewohl. [B4.]
 
Judge to Reconsider Drug Rule
 
A Federal judge who was widely criticized for throwing out drug evidence agreed to listen to prosecutors' arguments that he should change his mind, saying that a rehearing is "in the interests of justice." [B1.]
 
Rebuilding After the Floods
 
Six weeks since Walton, N.Y., sustained some of the worst hits in the worst flooding along the Eastern seaboard in 60 years, many merchants along Delaware Street are back in business. Our Towns by Evelyn Nieves. [B1.]
 
Witness Tells of Gotti Plot
 
The courtroom saga over the sanity of the suspected mob boss Vincent Gigante took another bizarre turn. This time the focus was on John Gotti, inset, who was called so desperate to get out of prison that he considered bribing the President of the United States. [B4.]
 
Alarm Over Health Policy
 
Governor Pataki's proposed mental health budget marks a dramatic shift in direction from recent policy. The Governor would take the state out of the administration of community mental health services, turning the planning and management of such services over to counties through a system of block grants. The plan has been called "devastating" by mental-health advocates and others. [B5.]
 
City Sued Over Job Offer
 
A man is suing the city, saying it withdrew its offer of a job as a Housing Authority tenant organizer because he wrote an opinion article for New York Newsday that was harshly critical of Mayor Giuliani's cuts in social-service budget. [B5.]
 
Drug Defense Is Discounted
 
In a closing statement, prosecutors disputed that a dangerous combination of drugs that drove Edward J. Leary to place firebombs in the New York City subway system, as his defense lawyers have suggested. [B2.]
 
For-Profit Unit for Empire
 
The New York State Insurance Department approved a request by Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to establish two wholly owned for-profit units that could eventually take over most of the troubled insurer's business. Business Day. [D2.]
 
Governor Pataki signed a law that prohibits law enforcement officials from subjecting people who file rape complaints to polygraph tests. [B5.]

Dispute Over U.S. Exports Of Poultry to Russia Settled

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
A trade dispute between the United States and Russia was apparently settled today when Washington received formal assurances that American poultry shipments to Russia would continue without interruption.
Vice President Al Gore announced this evening that he had been assured by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia that a stoppage of poultry imports from the United States, threatened March 16, would not take place. 
 The Vice President's statement said the Prime Minister's message was relayed through the Russian Minister of Economics, Yevgeny Yasin, in a meeting at the White House today.
"We're certainly very pleased with the announcement," said George Watts, president of the National Broilers Council. "This is what we had asked for and hoped for all along."
Russia is the No. 1 export market for United States chicken parts, and bought around $550 million worth last year. Some estimates are that American-grown chicken now accounts for more than half the poultry eaten in Russia.
Last month, Russia unexpectedly acted to halt all imports of American chicken beginning March 16 due to concerns about American poultry industry standards and the quality of the chicken. That prompted swift action by the Clinton Administration to avert any trade stoppage. Administration officials said such a move would be unacceptable, especially for a country that wants to join the international trading community and the World Trade Organization.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said last week that he was deeply concerned by any barriers to American goods going into Russia. "We'd consider it to be unfortunate and we would react in a very strong manner," he said.
Several American poultry producers have announced cutbacks in production because of the threatened slowdown of sales to Russia, as well as because of higher costs as a result of high grain prices. They include the nation's biggest poultry company and the top supplier to Russia, Tyson Foods Inc., and Pilgrim's Pride, the fifth-largest chicken producer in the United States.
American officials have said Russia's concerns are nonsense and part of a protectionist attempt to restrict imports. Some said the action was a bid by President Boris N. Yeltsin to gain the favor of the pro-Communist and pro-agriculture factions.
United States and Russian mid-level officials and scientists have been meeting since last month in technical talks to resolve some concerns, and Mr. Gore said the Administration would continue to work with Russian officials to resolve remaining poultry issues.
Mr. Gore also said he had accepted an invitation from Mr. Chernomyrdin to send senior United States officials to Moscow for discussions of outstanding issues related to the poultry exports.

A renewed optimism in the stock market propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to its 17th record of the year. Surging in the last half-hour of trading, the Dow jumped 42.27 points, to 5,642.42, bringing its three-day gain to 156.80 points, or 2.8 percent.
Gains in I.B.M. and Philip Morris fueled the advance, and other major market indicators joined in it. [Page D10.]
 
Senators Cite 'Corporate Welfare'
A bipartisan group of Senators pushed for an independent commission to help slash subsidies and tax breaks for business. Senators as ideologically diverse as John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, called for sweeping cuts in "corporate welfare." Fierce resistance is expected. [A1.]
 
Auto Sales Up 5.6% in Month
Auto sales rose 5.6 percent last month, assuaging industry and Wall Street fears that the industry was heading for a stiff downturn. Ford reported nearly flat February sales, and in a striking development, Honda surpassed Toyota in car sales in the month. [D4.]
 
The U.A.W. went on strike at two General Motors plants in Ohio, an action that could force the closing of other plants. [A19.]
 
Factory Orders Beat Expectations
Factory orders jumped unexpectedly in January, and backlogs surged, offering evidence that manufacturing might be picking up after months of weakness. The orders rose five-tenths of 1 percent. [D4.]
 
Prices of Treasury bonds slumped, as hopes for a quick cut in interest rates were weakened by the report on factory orders and by comments from Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.38 percent from 6.33 percent. [D9.]
 
Business Week Wins Suit
An appeals court threw out a ruling blocking Business Week from publishing sealed court documents from a suit between Procter & Gamble and Bankers Trust. In language that at times bordered on the incredulous, the three-judge panel ruled 2 to 1 that a circuit judge erred in barring publication of an article based on the documents. [A15.]
 
Empire Blues in Profit Plan
The New York State Insurance Department approved a request by Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to establish two wholly owned for-profit units that could eventually take over most of the troubled health insurer's business. But financial experts saw little chance that Empire could attract investors until it reversed its operating losses. [D2.]
 
Russia Settles Chicken Dispute
A growing trade dispute with Russia was apparently settled when Washington received formal assurances that American poultry shipments would continue to go to Russia without interruption. Russia is the No. 1 export market for U.S. chicken parts. [D5.]
 
S.E.C. Eliminating Many Rules
The S.E.C. took the first steps toward eliminating hundreds of rules and required forms in an attempt to simplify corporate offering procedures and make it easier for small companies to raise capital. It accepted a 94-page report of an internal study group, which also urged that corporate prospectuses be written so that they could be easily understood. [D2.]
 
Tax Offer on Contract Workers
The Internal Revenue Service plans to offer discounts on the payroll taxes owed by employers who improperly paid employees as independent contractors. [D4.]
 
An AIDS Blindness Drug
Chiron won approval by the Food and Drug Administration to market a device that can be implanted in the eyes of AIDS patients to fight blindness. [D10.]
 
Japan's Banks Offer Help
Japanese banks agreed to shoulder a bit more of the burden in the very unpopular Government rescue of mortgage companies. But the banks' plan is so vague that it is not clear whether the banks will actually have to put up any more money. [D5.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
DOLE, SWEEPING 8 PRIMARIES, CALLS FOR PARTY TO UNITE; ALEXANDER READY TO QUIT

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole won a clean sweep of eight primaries spanning New England, the Rockies and as far South as Georgia yesterday, leaping far ahead of his rivals in the biggest test thus far of the Republican Presidential primary season.
In a string of triumphs in politically and geographically diverse states that he said demonstrated his ability to unite the Republican party, Mr. Dole handily won in Georgia, Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island. 
 The results apparently claimed two casualties, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Aides to both said they would announce their withdrawals from the race on Wednesday.
Two of Mr. Dole's rivals who have never held elective office -- Mr. Buchanan and Steve Forbes -- vowed to press on even though they competed for a distant second or third place in most of the contests yesterday.
At a boisterous victory rally last night on Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole set his sights on President Clinton rather than dwell on the intramural competition. After buoyantly reciting state after state where he had won, Mr. Dole declared: "Tonight we're proving the pundits wrong -- and pretty soon we're going to unite and beat Bill Clinton in 1996."
Calling on the party to rally around him only weeks after his lead seemed to be jeopardized by chaotic early primaries, the Kansas Senator added: "All my life in politics, I've been trying to bring America together. And I'll do the same as the Republican nominee. And I'll do the same as the President of the United States."
Mr. Dole claimed a majority of the 208 national convention delegates that were selected yesterday; 996 are needed for the nomination.
In light of the daunting numbers, Mr. Alexander met with his closest advisers tonight to consider his future course. He cancelled campaign events scheduled in Florida today and aides said he planned to travel home to Nashville and pull out of the race. This was not a complete surprise because on Monday he had vowed to withdraw if he did not defeat Mr. Dole in Florida on March 12, when that state and Texas are up for grabs. In yesterday's voting, Mr. Alexander was a distant third or fourth.
Mr. Lugar, who had barely managed to register in the voting results from earlier contests, also planned to announce that he would drop out, campaign aides said.
"I have no Don Quixote idea here of competing endlessly with no prospects," Mr. Lugar told reporters in Vermont earlier in the day.
Mr. Buchanan vowed that he would fight all the way to the convention in San Diego, but he acknowledged while campaigning yesterday in New York State: "We hope to do well up here in New York. We know it's an uphill battle here. It's an uphill battle everywhere."
Mr. Forbes's fortunes have alternately plummeted and soared, as he lost the first votes and then won a few smaller contests. In theory at least, he can run as long as he wants, if he is willing to keep spending from his personal fortune.
Mr. Forbes made clear last night that he had no plan to drop out. Referring to Harry Truman's saying if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen, he said: "This chef has no intention of leaving the kitchen."
According to surveys of voters leaving the polling places yesterday, economic issues were foremost on voters' minds. Either the economy and jobs or the deficit were more frequently selected as the most important issue. Mr. Dole drew most of those votes, as well as among voters for whom taxes was the overriding concern. For example, a fifth of the voters in Massachusetts selected taxes of the most important issue, and a third of them voted for Mr. Dole, compared to 4 in 10 for Mr. Forbes.
Mr. Dole scored his success last night by drawing from a broad-based Republican coalition.
He also made inroads into Mr. Buchanan's natural constituency. Surveys of voters leaving their polling places yesterday conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press found that Mr. Dole did well among self-described religious conservatives and among voters who said the nation's most serious problems were moral rather than economic.
In addition to breaking ground in Mr. Buchanan's core base of support, Mr. Dole continued to do well among mainstream Republicans, including those who say they are concerned about the deficit and those who are looking for a candidate who can defeat Mr. Clinton in November.
Mr. Buchanan, by contrast, was not able to build on a narrow base of support among the most conservative voters. Most of his supporters described themselves as very conservative and said they supported a Constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion. And Mr. Buchanan failed to make inroads with other groups, like self-described moderates.
Explaining Mr. Dole's performance after his jolting losses in the New Hampshire, Delaware and Arizona primaries, Scott Reed, his campaign manager, dismissed polls that showed the Senator had not inspired the Republican electorate. Instead, he pinned the blame on Mr. Forbes, the publishing magnate, and his television advertising.
"I'll tell you exactly what happened," Mr. Reed said in an interview last night. "We moved out of the states where Steve Forbes had spent $25 million running negative ads tearing Bob Dole down. He almost got us."
While the candidates competed in a mix of primaries spanning the South, New England and the West, the heaviest competition was in Georgia, with the day's biggest trove with 42 delegates. Mr. Dole's advisers said they were most concerned about that state, which had led the Senator to add to his schedule an election-eve visit to Atlanta on Monday.
Also yesterday, Republicans in Minnesota and Washington began selecting more delegates in party caucuses.
The voting in Georgia was a particularly harsh setback for Mr. Alexander, who has staked his campaign on performing well in his native region. Even before the polls opened yesterday, he said he would withdraw if he did not beat Mr. Dole in Florida next Tuesday.
As Mr. Alexander and Mr. Buchanan concentrated in the South, Mr. Forbes chased hopes of an upset in Colorado, while Mr. Lugar pinned his chances with the tiny state of Vermont, where he had campaigned for days.
From the day that Mr. Dole announced his candidacy last April, he was widely viewed as the candidate to beat for the Republican nomination. In addition to raising millions of dollars early, he amassing the most extensive ground organization and roster of endorsements, including those of most Republican governors. And for months, he held a commanding lead in the polls.
But Mr. Dole received a scare in the Iowa caucuses, when Mr. Buchanan placed a close second. And his campaign was knocked completely off balance a week later when Mr. Buchanan defeated him in the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Dole stumbled further when Mr. Forbes beat him in Delaware and Arizona.
But Mr. Dole regained his footing when he decisively won the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
In yesterday's voting, Mr. Dole did particularly well in Massachusetts among women, half of whom voted for him, while one in five backed Mr. Buchanan. Men split their votes, giving Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan about a third each.
Asked whether the country's main problems were mostly economic or moral, most voters in Massachusetts, as in other states, said they were moral. That generated no momentum for a particular candidate, with Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan splitting the voters of this group.
Unlike in Georgia and Maryland, the exit polls showed that Mr. Buchanan won the votes of conservatives of all stripes, both those who call themselves somewhat conservative and those who call themselves very conservative.
About one sixth of the voters identified themselves as religious conservatives, and three-quarters of them backed Mr. Buchanan.
Most voters in the states that held primaries yesterday said they were opposed to a Constitutional amendment banning abortion, and most of them backed Mr. Dole.
But Mr. Dole was already looking to November, as if the primary season were already over. Asked by reporters yesterday about how strong he would be against Mr. Clinton, the 72-year-old Senator replied: "He's a little taller than I am, but I've got lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol -- and I'm not going to make health an issue in the campaign."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OUTLOOK;
Finding the Formula

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 5

 BODY:
Through two campaigns and the start of a third, Bob Dole was the man who could hardly win a Presidential primary. Now, presto change-o, he has turned into the man who can hardly lose one.
His clean sweep of the most closely watched of today's contests -- in New England, the Rockies, a Border State and the Deep South -- demonstrated broad geographic appeal. Exit polls indicated broad demographic and ideological appeal. The results made him the strong, if not overwhelming, favorite to win the Republican nomination unless he stumbles in the New York primary on Thursday, which now seems much less likely. 
 Harold Wilson, the British Prime Minister, once observed that a week is a long time in politics. Bob Dole knows better. In the turbocharged world in which he is competing, a couple of days can be a lifetime. Less than a week ago, the oddsmakers were writing the Kansas Senator off after a series of lackluster performances; now, at least for the moment, he looks almost as inevitable as the sunrise.
Asked by reporters this afternoon whom he considered his chief opponent, the suddenly sanguine Mr. Dole replied, "Bill Clinton."
Mr. Dole's triumph in South Carolina on Saturday marked the turning point, but he ran much less powerfully in winning Georgia today. Here he had neither strong organizational support (the Democrats control the Statehouse) nor a powerful intermediary with the religious right like Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina, who filled that role there.
In the simplest terms, Mr. Dole is succeeding by taking some of Patrick J. Buchanan's natural supporters away from him, because they think he has a better chance of defeating President Clinton, because they find Mr. Buchanan too extreme, because Mr. Dole has finally started to play to his strengths, or for some other reason. The defections are substantial.
The religious right had been considered Mr. Buchanan's strongest constituency, for example, and so it proved early on, but not in South Carolina. In Georgia, Mr. Buchanan recovered a bit among such voters, but Mr. Dole did respectably, according to a survey of those leaving the polls by the television networks and The Associated Press. And in Maryland, a Border State often receptive to protest candidates like George C. Wallace in 1972, Mr. Dole outpolled his rival 5 to 3 among Christian conservatives.
In most states voting today, more than half of the voters interviewed said they considered Mr. Buchanan too extreme, which is an electoral burden that no candidate could carry.
Mr. Dole did especially well in most states among women, older voters and those concerned about the deficit and beating President Clinton in November. But he did well enough among almost all kinds of people, except implacable opponents of abortion and voters younger than 30.
Again, about one-third of the voters surveyed said they thought that the Senator's age, 72, would hurt him as President -- an issue that could cost him in the fall if he is nominated.
Among voters who think the country's problems are moral rather than economic in character -- two-thirds of the electorate in Georgia -- Mr. Dole, the pragmatic legislative craftsman, did better than Mr. Buchanan, the moralist and sermonizer.
If any of Mr. Dole's rivals are to mount last-ditch efforts to stop him, they will have to hustle. He already has twice as many delegates as all his rivals combined.
By a week from today, 43 percent of the delegates will have been chosen, and by two weeks from today, 54 percent will have been chosen. Then California votes on March 26, and all 165 of its delegates go to the statewide winner.
There was not much in today's returns that implied that Southern and Southwestern states voting next Tuesday would vote much differently from South Carolina and Georgia. Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma, perhaps even Lamar Alexander's Tennessee seem likely to follow the pattern.
Once again, in Georgia, Mr. Buchanan failed to move much beyond his constituency of very conservative voters, though he exceeded 30 percent of the vote for the first time in what must have seemed an achingly close-run thing to him.
Mr. Alexander, the only Southerner in the field, had hoped to make a strong stand here. He spent $230,000 on Atlanta television alone, far more than any other candidate, according to a tabulation by The Atlanta Constitution, and still got less than one-sixth of the vote. He had already said he would withdraw if he lost in Florida, where advertising is far more costly, and today's voting might bring an even quicker exit.
If Mr. Dole is to be the nominee, as seems much more likely now, his successes in the South have long-term implications.
This is the Republican heartland, a region where the party must score in November if it is to win the Presidency. The Kansan, laconic where many Southerners are loquacious, tightly wound where they tend to be laid back, has never been very comfortable here, and his success in the primaries will help to make him a better political fit.
Another of those who has siphoned off votes from Mr. Dole, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, had his best showing of the campaign in Vermont, where he fought it out with Mr. Buchanan and Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher, for second place. But even there Mr. Dole was an easy winner, and Mr. Lugar decided to fold his campaign, aides said.
Soon, it seems, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, will be Mr. Dole's only major rivals. Beaten today by more than 2 to 1 in Connecticut, a state where he had some hopes, Mr. Forbes is now concentrating on New York to revive a campaign that was riding high after his Arizona victory a week ago.
As for Mr. Buchanan, he has budgeted only one day for Florida, preferring to husband his resources for a big push in Texas, which will have 123 delegates at the convention in San Diego in August, the second-largest bloc. But even before today's voting, he was calling attention to Texas's proportional representation system, apparently counting more on winning delegates for bargaining purposes later than on taking the state.
Neither Mr. Forbes nor Mr. Buchanan has much incentive for pulling out, even if the men conclude in their heart of hearts that they have no significant chance to win the nomination. They are the two most ideological candidates in the race. Each has a program he would like to see imbedded in the party platform, and each feels he is bringing new voters into the party.

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN ISRAEL: THE WHITE HOUSE;
U.S. Is Sending Technology To Help Intercept Bombers

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
President Clinton sent Israel sophisticated bomb-detection equipment today, a shipment that senior Administration officials said had been held up for several months in a dispute over who would pay for it.
In sending the equipment, the President vowed to help Israel combat what he called a "campaign of terror" that "must not succeed." 
 The nine specialized bomb sensors, together with American technical experts to help operate them, will be used in an effort to intercept terrorists at border crossings. At the same time, the White House said it would encourage its European allies and other Governments to maintain financial aid to the Palestinian Authority to compensate for economic losses to Palestinians prevented from working when Israel closed its borders to deter further attacks.
"The United States has always stood with the people of Israel through good times and bad, and we stand with them today," Mr. Clinton said in a speech to county officials from around the nation meeting here. He said the recent bombings in Israel were "desperate and fanatic acts" aimed not just at killing innocent people, "but at killing the growing prospects for peace in the Middle East."
Mr. Clinton also ordered American technical support, training and equipment to help improve and coordinate anti-terrorism efforts in the region. The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said Mr. Clinton would take additional steps soon.
"We'll be assembling some more assistance in the coming days," he said.
The two Governments have been discussing the advanced sensors as part of a package of anti-terrorist equipment worth about $40 million "for several months," a senior Administration official said. He denied that the equipment was held up out of concern over the transfer of technology, saying, "It was a question of how to pay for it."
But under the pressure of the bombing attacks, he said, the United States was providing the sensors out of anti-terrorism funds.
One White House official said that materials transferred today were worth about $3 million and that additional gear expected to be sent this week could bring the total to $15 million.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a telephone interview, said Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel asked for the sensors in a telephone conversation with President Clinton. "When these bombings focused the issue, we responded very quickly," he said.
For months American officials have criticized Iran as the prime sponsor of Middle Eastern terrorism and as an open opponent of peace.
On Monday night, American officials said they would use the bombings as a means to try to isolate Iran further and to convince other countries that Iran should not be dealt with, but contained.
Today, Mr. Christopher and his aides emphasized the Iran connection. "Hamas receives its greatest support from Iran," Mr. Christopher said, referring to the group that took responsibility for nearly all the most recent bombings in Israel. "It provides financial backing, tactical advice, and we see the Iranian hand in the conduct of the various terrorist groups."
"The trouble we've had with Iran over the last several years is their export of terrorism, their encouragement of terrorism -- their providing support for terrorism comes to a head at a point like this," he said later. "It is a good lesson -- ought to be -- for the world as to why we've been so strongly opposed to Iran."
But when pressed, Mr. Christopher refused to make a direct connection between Iran and the four recent bombings in Israel. His aides said there was as of yet "no direct chain of evidence" tying Iran to the bombs.
The American specialists will work to "improve coordination" on anti-terrorism and intelligence efforts among the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which governs territory until recently occupied by Israel.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is the majority leader as well as Mr. Clinton's would-be Republican rival, said that Congress should rethink financial aid to the Palestinians, which has totaled about $180 million during the last two years.
"We've had enough drivel out of Washington, D.C., about what's happening in Israel," Mr. Dole said while campaigning in New York. "It's about time that Yasir Arafat exerted some leadership. I think he wants peace. I know the Israelis want peace."
But Mr. Christopher said, "We all need to press Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to take the firmest possible action against Hamas."
Other officials said that Mr. Arafat had been trying to negotiate with Hamas, to bring it in politically and to put an end to the bombings.
"Now Arafat is going out after Hamas," the senior official asserted. "And we are prepared to help My own judgment is that it would be self-defeating and shortsighted to cut off aid of any kind. It wouldn't enhance Israel's security to do that, and that's our prime concern right now."
It took the recent bombings, Mr. Christopher acknowledged, for Mr. Arafat to understand that his strategy with Hamas had failed.
"Arafat has to root out whomever in Hamas is involved, Mr. Christopher said. "This is a new realization on Arafat's part."
The Administration also seemed to signal that any strike by Israel against Hamas would be understood, if not countenanced, by Washington, Mr. Christopher told news service reporters. "There is understanding on the part of the United States that Israel has to take strong action to defeat the terror," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Slap on the Hand Brings Colombia Out Punching

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 5

 BODY:
Fanning nationalist discontent over President Clinton's formal declaration that Colombia was not cooperating in the fight against drugs, this country's embattled President has moved to cool relations with the United States further, apparently as a means of relieving pressure on him to resign.
The declaration, known as "decertification," was announced on Friday, and it leaves Colombia ineligible for any United States aid with the exception of assistance linked to fighting drug trafficking. 
 The action and the harsh accusations against President Ernesto Samper that accompanied it were interpreted as signs of Washington's distrust of Mr. Samper rather than as disapproval of the country's efforts to combat drugs.
Mr. Samper has been fighting accusations that he financed his 1994 presidential campaign with more than $6 million from drug traffickers. The day after the declaration, El Tiempo, a highly influential Bogota daily, crystallized the prevailing view in a banner headline: "Decertified for Narco-Corruption."
Almost as a mass reflex to the national insult, even groups that had been critical of the President lashed out at the United States for interfering in Colombia's internal affairs.
On Monday the national police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano -- who was singled out for praise by the United States -- said the President had requested a report on the extent of cooperation by the two countries in fighting drug trafficking. General Serrano said the report would "analyze a possible suspension of cooperation with the United States in the fight against drug trafficking and study the participation of American agencies in running radar stations granted on national territory."
In the past, General Serrano has said that last year's achievements -- which included record coca crop eradications and the arrest of six of the seven most powerful drug cartel leaders in the drug center, Cali -- would not have been possible without United States assistance.
[The third-ranking member of the Cali drug cartel, Jose Santacruz Londono, was shot to death late Tuesday in Medellin, The Associated Press reported, citing General Serrano. Mr. Santacruz fled from prison in Bogota in January after about six months in jail. United States officials had said last week that the escape would have a negative effect on the certification process.]
Diplomats here said they did not expect Colombia to suspend all forms of cooperation with the United States intelligence and drug enforcement agencies because Washington could still retaliate with economic sanctions.
At a meeting of his Cabinet, the President requested reports from the Foreign Ministry on the extent of Colombian cooperation with the United States in other areas as well and instructed Colombian Embassies to seek out new forms of cooperation with other countries.
The President has held open the possibility of increasing cooperation with Britain, though diplomats here say they doubt Mr. Samper would go as far as ending cooperation with the United States.
In a lengthy statement on Monday, the President of the Senate, Julio Cesar Guerra, decried the American decision, invoking the Colombian "blood that flowed" to fight narcotics trafficking.
"Decertification is not a holocaust for Colombia," he added. "We have to overcome it and work for the good of the country."
Juan Tokatlian, an independent economic analyst, said he thought the President could rally support for reining in, if not suspending completely, American intelligence and drug enforcement operations in the country. "In the country, I do not see an actor who, in the short term at least, would be opposed to more control or hardening on this issue," said Mr. Tokatlian. "Many feel the U.S. is intervening in Colombian affairs."
The blow from Washington, analysts here predict, is not likely to prove fatal to Mr. Samper immediately, though it may well erode his standing over time.
Jaime Ruiz, a former senator for the Conservative Party and a newspaper columnist, noted that a string of setbacks that once would have been considered decisive -- the President's abandonment by business leaders, the withering of his news media support, public accusations by his lifelong friend and former campaign manager and charges against him by the chief prosecutor -- had all struck without the President's having surrendered to the gathering calls for his resignation. There was no reason to think decertification itself would be different, he said.
"If you ask me, all they're doing is buying time," said Mr. Ruiz. "And time is on Samper's side."
This week, Mr. Samper has put off an appearance at the National Electoral Council, which is looking into allegations that his presidential campaign exceeded the legal spending limits. His attorney, Luis Guillermo Nieto Roa, said he wanted the President to be able to respond to any questions from the Council in writing rather than in person.
Mr. Nieto, in an interview, acknowledged that in the court of public opinion, Mr. Samper was seen with suspicion and doubt. The lawyer said he would request that the proceedings of the Committee of Accusations, which determines whether to recommend impeachment, be held publicly. Many predict that Mr. Samper will be cleared, given that many of the committee's members, including its chairman, are under investigation for improprieties. If that happens, the President would leave the door open to a referendum, his attorney said.
"It has nothing to do with the law," he said. "It has nothing to do with the evidence. It has to do with who's judging." He argued that for the proceedings to carry any credibility, the committee chairman and several members would have to recuse themselves.
Some analysts here predict the crucial factor for Mr. Samper's survival will be the economy. Last month, inflation rose 3.9 percent, dangerously outpacing the country's projections for an annual rate of 15 percent.
"In the short run, this will not weaken Samper," Mr. Tokatlian said. "This firmness gives his mandate the mark of legitimacy." But he predicted that in the long run, the anger at the United States will subside and the President will be pressured anew to step down. The assessment was echoed by American officials in Washington and diplomats here.
"I think in two weeks, maybe even less, we'll begin to see editorial pressure on the President," a diplomat said.
Javier Fernandez, president of the National Association of Financial Institutions, said he did not expect Mr. Samper to remain in office for long.
"He could have if the U.S. had certified him," Mr. Fernandez said. "But now, I don't see how he can."

HEADLINE: Panel Votes for Worker Visas for 250,000

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Bowing to big farming interests in California, Florida and Texas, the House Agriculture Committee today approved an amendment to the House immigration bill that would grant temporary work visas to as many as 250,000 foreign farm workers, even though many senior Republicans say this will only encourage a new flood of illegal aliens.
Among those favoring the guest-worker program at today's packed hearing were many of the same House members who have clamored the loudest for tighter restrictions on illegal immigration, as well as many lobbyists for farmers and ranchers who fear that cutting off the migration of workers across the border would leave them without the help they need. 
 The overall bill the committee is considering would strongly crack down on illegal immigration, which has become a major theme in the Presidential campaign, and several representatives today condemned the amendment for allowing undocumented aliens into the United States, even with temporary visas.
"Once you admit hundreds of thousands of people like this, why not just pull the Border Patrol off the border and let people in?" asked Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is the main author of the bill. "This undercuts everything we're trying to achieve."
Six of the Republicans who voted for the amendment belong to a House committee appointed by Speaker Newt Gingrich that last year recommended tough restrictions on illegal immigration.
What large farmers and ranchers fear, their lobbyists say, is that the new immigration bill might work too well and that additional border guards and the need for employers to use advanced new systems to confirm an alien's legal status would dry up a large part of their labor market. Crop growers estimate that up to 50 percent of their 1.6 million seasonal workers are illegal aliens who hold false identification papers, but the Labor Department says the real figure is closer to 25 percent.
Today, lobbyists from the National Cotton Council, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation and many of the 48 other agricultural organizations favoring the guest-worker amendment darted in and out of the corridor outside the committee room to buttonhole lawmakers before the final votes.
"The combination of electronic verification, interior and border control puts pressure on our labor market," said Monte Lake, a lobbyist for the National Council of Agricultural Employers.
Representative Richard W. Pombo, a California Republican who sponsored the visa amendment, said: "We have an opportunity to address the serious concerns of the farmers and ranchers of America. It is vital to accommodate the legitimate interests of farmers and ranchers."
The amendment passed 25 to 13, largely along party lines, after lawmakers agreed to make the program a three-year pilot program rather than a permanent part of immigration law.
The lobbyists have been making their case for weeks.
"All we're asking for is that if there are worker shortages, we can get temporary workers to get through," Michael J. Stuart, executive vice president of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, said in a recent interview.
Opponents of the amendment, including the Clinton Administration and many farm-worker organizations, say that there is no farm worker shortage and that big farming interests are just trying to insure a surplus of cheap, docile labor. The Labor Department estimates that at any given time, 12 percent, or at least 190,000 domestic farm workers, are out of a job.
President Clinton said last year that a new guest-worker program was unwarranted because it would increase illegal immigration, take jobs from American citizens and lower wages and work standards for American workers.
Moreover, the United States already has a guest-worker program that allowed in about 17,000 temporary workers last year. Growers contend that the program is snarled in bureaucracy.
The new program evokes memories of the Bracero program of 1942-64, which brought in more than four million laborers from Mexico. The House narrowly approved a guest-worker program in 1984, but the bill died in the Senate.
Proponents of the latest guest-worker amendment said that under their plan, 25 percent of foreign workers' wages would be withheld until the workers returned to their home countries.
But critics of the proposal said that provision would not be enough to prevent temporary workers from remaining in the United States.
Lawmakers focused today on the apparent contradiction between wanting a new guest-worker program and cracking down on illegal immigration. The debate provoked several sharp exchanges, including one between Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, and Representative John T. Doolittle, Republican of California.
"You can't have stepped-up calls for enforcement on the border and then contend guest workers aren't going to wander off to become illegal aliens once they are here," Mr. Pomeroy said in the exchange. "Mr. Doolittle, you can't have it both ways. It's absolutely illogical."
Mr. Doolittle shot back: "We're doing this so we can accommodate people who want to work, and can work and then can go back to their country. I've got no interest in immigrant-bashing. If you think this is so illogical, I think you're being uninformed."

Dole Gains Easy Victory, But Doubts Are Cast, Too

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

 BODY:
In a state known for its moderate brand of Republicanism, Senator Bob Dole won the Presidential primary in Connecticut yesterday by an impressive margin.
Mr. Dole had long been considered the front-runner in this state, endorsed by Gov. John G. Rowland and almost all of the state's Republican leadership. His message of "experienced leadership for unsettled times" seemed to be tailor-made for Connecticut Republicans, many of whom feared a victory by Patrick J. Buchanan. 
With 99 percent of the districts reporting, Mr. Dole had 54 percent of the vote, while Steve Forbes had 20 percent, Mr. Buchanan had 15 percent and Lamar Alexander was at 5 percent.
"We have a new candidate on our hands," Governor Rowland said last night. "The Bob Dole that showed up here on Friday was not the Bob Dole we heard about. He's focused. He's appealing to people. He's invigorated. People are starting to realize that he's the candidate to run against Clinton and that he can run on integrity questions and win the day."
Still, there were indications that some of Mr. Dole's support was less than enthusiastic. An exit poll showed that about 4 of every 10 Dole voters in Connecticut would like to see another candidate enter the Republican field. A similar trend could be seen in the exit poll results from Georgia, Maryland and Massachusetts.
Indeed, the desire for another candidate could be seen among voters for all the candidates. About half said they wished there was another choice in the race.
"The only reason I'm voting for Dole is because I can't stand the other guys," said Jim Kinne, a 74-year-old retired farmer in South Glastonbury. "Buchanan's off the wall, and Forbes is no more qualified than I am. Anyone can be President if they inherited $400 million."
The apparent dissatisfaction with Mr. Dole raises questions about whether he can win back the state that President Clinton carried in 1992, the first Democrat to do so since Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968.
Mr. Rowland dismissed such doubts and said that, once the contest was over, the party would enthusiastically unite behind Mr. Dole.
This was the fourth Republican Presidential primary ever held in Connecticut, and the three previous ones were won by George Bush, who grew up in Greenwich and whose father represented the state in the United States Senate.
The Secretary of the State, Miles S. Rapoport, the state's chief election official, said voter turnout appeared likely to exceed 25 percent, an increase of four percentage points from 1992.
The state has 8 of the nation's 538 electoral votes, and it elects 27 of the 2,010 delegates to the Republican convention. As the winner, Mr. Dole receives all the delegates.
The primary campaign provided little opportunity for Connecticut voters to see the candidates up close. Mr. Dole appeared briefly in Hartford on Friday, and Mr. Forbes campaigned across the state Saturday and Monday. Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, never visited.
Voters largely learned about the candidates through news coverage of events in other states and advertising, with Mr. Dole running television commercials since last week and Mr. Forbes conducting a media blitz in the final three days of the campaign. For instance, on Monday night, Mr. Forbes bought a half-hour on the NBC affiliate in New Britain, and yesterday, he had two commercials airing every hour on one local radio station.
With the support of the state party, Mr. Dole was the only candidate with an extensive statewide organization -- one that actually drove some voters to the polls -- and Mr. Rowland put his reputation on the line by guaranteeing a Dole victory.
The race appeared to turn on several factors. In the exit poll, most voters said their main concern was the economy and jobs, taxes or the deficit. Only a small minority listed foreign trade, Mr. Buchanan's major economic theme, as the "one issue that mattered most," and a majority of them backed Mr. Dole. In general, Mr. Dole was the choice of voters who were most concerned about the economy and the deficit.
About one of every five voters said that "experience in Washington," a key theme in Mr. Dole's campaign, was the most important quality they were looking for in a candidate, and almost every one of these people voted for Mr. Dole.
By contrast, the exit poll showed that 1 in 20 voters wanted someone who was "not a career politician" and most of them chose Mr. Forbes.
"Dole's been in politics too long," said Denise Aguillera, a 30-year-old lawyer who voted for Mr. Forbes. What she likes most about Mr. Forbes, she added, is his proposal for a flat tax.
About half of the Forbes voters said that taxes were their top concern, and State Senator Kevin F. Rennie, Mr. Forbes's Connecticut campaign chairman, noted that polls showed that Mr. Forbes's support doubled in the last five days as he began advertising.
But among voters who listed taxes as the most important issue, Mr. Dole did almost as well as Mr. Forbes, according to the exit poll.
In turn, Mr. Buchanan, who concentrated most of his energy in Georgia, said he knew he had "an uphill battle in Connecticut," and he failed to match his performance of four years ago, when he won 22 percent of the vote against Mr. Bush.
This time around, two-thirds of the voters considered him "too extreme," according to the exit polls.
This may have worked to Mr. Dole's advantage. "In Connecticut, there developed an imperative to stopping the Pat Buchanan juggernaut and Bob Dole was perceived as the one to do it," Mr. Rennie, the Forbes campaign representative, said.

Dole's Troubled Horizon

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Bob Dole is not quite there yet. He lost a pair of adversaries today, but two others hang on, notably Patrick J. Buchanan, who is apparently determined to harry him, the same way J. E. B. Stuart harried McClellan, all the way to the Republican convention in San Diego in August.
Gone are Lamar Alexander and Senator Richard G. Lugar, and the Presidential nomination will be within Mr. Dole's reach if he can defeat Steve Forbes in the New York primary on Thursday. Given his huge organizational edge, that should be relatively easy, despite the endorsement of Mr. Forbes this afternoon by Jack F. Kemp, a member of George Bush's Cabinet and a champion of supply-side economics. 
 "I know it's late," said Mr. Kemp, a former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Indeed, most politicians think it is far too late for Mr. Forbes or Mr. Buchanan to deny Mr. Dole the nomination after the Senator's clean sweep of primaries in eight states on Tuesday.
But even with a big victory in New York, Mr. Dole will face major challenges. Looming just ahead is the threat that Mr. Buchanan's sniping from the right will delay the tactical move to the center that Mr. Dole would like to make before the general election, as Richard M. Nixon always counseled. Beyond that lies the threat that the convention will make Houston 1992 look like a lawn party, with disruptive battles over abortion and other social issues -- another outbreak of the debilitating cultural warfare that Mr. Buchanan likes to foment.
And at the end of the trail there lurks the biggest threat of all: Bill Clinton, a campaign-aholic who thrives on the blarney and flesh-pressing that the Kansas Senator shrinks from, and who begins with a big lead.
Although he stipulated, old pro that he is, that he must avoid overconfidence, Mr. Dole talked about restoring party unity even before two of his rivals, humbled, stepped back from the contest today. He described himself as a unifier and said the party was not "spinning out of control."
Mr. Forbes, Mr. Lugar and Mr. Alexander all struck positive notes.
But amid the symphony of Republican reconciliation, Mr. Buchanan sounded a discordant and unreconciled note. "I'll be here awhile, talking and carrying on," he said, describing Mr. Dole as part of "a calcified group" in Washington with "no ideas, no fire, no passion, no conviction." The commentator said his supporters were full of the kind of zeal the Republicans will need if they want to beat President Clinton.
There is ample evidence of that, and not only in the fervor of the crowds that turn out for Mr. Buchanan's rallies. In state after state, he has taken from 25 to 30 percent of the total, even with numerous candidates in the field.
Figures from exit polls conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press on Tuesday make it look unlikely that Mr. Buchanan can win a significant number of future contests, even if Mr. Forbes does not stay the course. But either Mr. Forbes or Mr. Buchanan might stage an ambush or two. In past races, candidates who had seemed clearly spent pulled off upsets (Gary Hart over Walter F. Mondale in California in June 1984, for example, and Edmund G. Brown Jr. over Mr. Clinton in Connecticut after Super Tuesday in 1992).
Both Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Forbes will continue to accumulate delegates in states with proportional representation, like Michigan, Oregon and possibly Texas (if no candidate gets an outright majority there), and in the many states where the candidate who carries a Congressional district gets that district's delegates.
With his delegates, Mr. Buchanan can bargain for things that matter to him and his backers. He wants a platform plank calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion, for example, and he wants a Vice-Presidential nominee who opposes abortion, unlike Colin L. Powell, whom Mr. Dole has often mentioned as a potential running mate.
Mr. Forbes wants to make the case for what he calls his "pro-growth agenda," centering on the flat tax. He has the money to do so. His friends doubt, however, that he will resort again to attacking Mr. Dole in the process.
But as long as he remains active, Mr. Buchanan will keep before the nation his critique of Mr. Dole as a worn-out Washington insider with no vision of the future, criticism that can only hurt the Republicans. Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a pivotal state, said that the quicker Mr. Dole "can end this internal party battle, the better for us going into the fall," and other party leaders agree.
The trick for Mr. Dole is to assuage Mr. Buchanan's ardent followers on social issues and economic anxieties without alienating other parts of the potential Republican coalition. Many of Mr. Dole's current backers, officeholders and ordinary voters alike, support him because they fear Mr. Buchanan. In Tuesday's exit polls, more than half the electorate in each state that voted said Mr. Buchanan was too extreme to be President, so Mr. Dole cannot afford to seem to kowtow to him.
Mr. Dole must also work to overcome lingering problems with his own image among Republican voters. As with any candidate, his first priority will be solidifying his partisan base, but the primaries have revealed major weaknesses.
One is his age. He will be 73 by November, older than any previous President when first elected to the office. In every primary state so far except South Carolina (which remains fond of its 93-year-old Senator, Strom Thurmond), one voter in three has said his age would hurt his performance in the White House. He consistently does better among older voters than the more numerous young ones.
Another obstacle is Mr. Dole's difficulty in exciting the electorate -- even Republicans, even those who have voted for him in the primaries. In Georgia, for example, almost half of those taking part in the primary said they wished other candidates were in the race; 40 percent of his own supporters said so.
Mr. Dole has prevailed so far, it might be said, more because of his opponents' frailties than his own strengths. For all his money, Mr. Forbes was unknown. Mr. Lugar's innovative themes did nothing to pierce his reputation for dullness. Mr. Alexander's scenario depended on Mr. Dole's collapsing. Mr. Buchanan seemed too extreme. By sheer grit, Mr. Dole hung on until he got to South Carolina, a state with a strong party machine committed to his candidacy, where Mr. Forbes spent very little.
Its primary last Saturday proved to be the turning point. To borrow an analogy from physics, the Dole campaign reached critical mass, allowing a chain reaction to carry him through the geographically and politically diverse tests he faced on Tuesday.
Georgia was the big prize on Tuesday, with the most delegates at stake (42) of any of the day's eight primaries and the greatest strategic significance leading into the Super Tuesday contests on March 12 in six Southern and Southwestern states. Bob Dole took it and made himself the prohibitive favorite elsewhere in the South, but he had a closer contest there than anywhere else on Tuesday.
Mr. Buchanan has a strong natural constituency in Georgia, especially in rural areas. He won at least 65 of the state's 159 counties, remobilizing the rural base that helped George C. Wallace take the state in the 1968 Presidential election. But the Atlanta metropolitan region has grown explosively since then, along with smaller cities, and Mr. Buchanan did much less well in urban areas.
By any measure, the commentator failed in his bid to turn his campaign around in Georgia, which was almost certainly his last best hope.
Unable to unify the religious right behind him, unable to win significant support in his party's center, he was left again to ponder the might-have-beens and to decide how much damage he was willing to inflict upon Mr. Dole prior to the fall election. In 1992, as Republicans recall without pleasure, he kept the focus on President Bush's weaknesses all year, then helped divide the party in the general election with his hotly combative oratory at the Houston convention.

DATELINE: LEWISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
The faces of the Bucknell University class of 1970 gaze out from the yearbook with a wide-eyed hopefulness untarnished by time. Though their hairstyles and clothes may look ever more dated, the class members remain forever 22 years old and unbowed, captured by the camera at a singular, ascendant moment of their youth.
They came here in 1966 from farm country Pennsylvania, from the suburbs of New York City and from the shores of Chesapeake Bay, children of America's middle class and of the great post-World War II economic boom. Born mostly in 1948, they had known nothing but prosperity, and it had imprinted upon them a pattern of belief and behavior as profound as the one that the Great Depression had left upon their parents. 
 If anything, the tumult of the 1960's only deepened their convictions about themselves and their future. Many grew their hair and protested the Vietnam War, but their campus never became violent, and the 1960's presented, in the end, another affirmation of hope: there were shelters from life's storms. People were essentially civilized. The great American promise still held, and if it ever faltered, they would be there to help set it right.
"Everything was on the upswing for us," said Mark S. Harris, a biology major in 1970, now a pediatrician in northern Vermont. "We were going to do a pretty good job by the world because the world was going to do a pretty good job by us. There was a confidence bred into us."
Twenty-five years on, a lot of those great expectations have been fulfilled. The 618 men and women of Bucknell 1970 have achieved and prospered. The vast majority are professionals, administrators and managers. Many are at the heights of their careers, and some are millionaires. This is their lion phase.
So what is most striking about these exemplars of middle-class success is what they have lost: their belief in the future and their faith in the rules of hard work rewarded. In the new economy of layoffs, limitation and job insecurity, their expansive confidence has eroded. The world that once seemed rich and ripe with potential has become, for many, a place full of fear -- for their jobs, for their retirement and, especially, for their children.
"There's an uncertainty at 25 years after," said Shirley A. Trauger, an English major who now runs a community arts center outside Philadelphia. "Just when we should be at the most stable time of our lives, we're not."
So here is their journey. One college class from one year: Bucknell 1970. It is not meant to be a microcosm of the nation, but a significant slice: one middle-class cohort on the cusp of change and what became of them.
They left here on diverse paths, celebrating the sense of infinite possibility. But in middle age they have seen those paths converge. Some believed they could discover alternative ways to live, work and prosper free of the lock-step compromises of corporate life, only to find that ideal corroded in a time of scarcity and cost-cutting. Many of the women, inspired by the nascent feminist movement, created new roles in the 1970's and 80's, only to find that they had to reinvent themselves all over again as their jobs, or their spouses' jobs, changed or simply disappeared.
But most of all, whatever life they chose, the men and women of the class of 1970 were believers -- in the system and the old social contract binding companies and their workers. Now, that system is being torn down, and if they are not victims, they feel like accomplices. They are the survivors, and, often, the executioners.
Richard A. Baumbusch, an electrical engineering major at Bucknell, was already a corporate veteran in 1985. He was working for CBS in New York, as a manager in a division that was going to be closed. The secret clock was ticking away to the surprise mass layoff. Then a co-worker approached. He was thinking of buying a house. Did Mr. Baumbusch think it was a good time to get into real estate?
The man's job was doomed and Mr. Baumbusch knew it. But spilling the secret, he believed, would violate his integrity as a corporate officer and doom the company to a firestorm of fear and rumor. There was no way to win and no way out.
"I considered it my fiduciary responsibility to the business to keep my mouth shut, and yet here was this person coming for advice as a friend and a business acquaintance and I had material information that would affect him," Mr. Baumbusch said. "For someone with a sense of empathy and sympathy, which I like to think I have some of, it was very, very hard."
In the end, Mr. Baumbusch swallowed his anguish and kept silent. The man bought the house and lost his job. The secret held. But 10 years later, all you have to do is watch Mr. Baumbusch tell the story to see how many times he has relived it, and second-guessed what he did that day.
The school that produced Mr. Baumbusch helped build the old economic order. Founded on the west bank of the Susquehanna River in 1846 by Baptists and equidistant to the great cities of the Midwest and Northeast, it is a place of hard-headed practicality and bucolic beauty, of Federalist brick buildings and rolling hills where violets creep to the roadside's edge in spring.
The school's core strengths, the basis for much of its sense of heft and quiet competence, are the engineering and business schools. Bucknell has produced few truly famous names. The writer Philip Roth is one exception -- he studied here in the 1950's and has become a sort of poster boy for the recruitment office. But it has produced many substantial ones. The Ivy League, from the Bucknell point of view, is where you go if you have arrived -- Bucknell is for those on the way.
"Hollywood would cast Bucknell as the vice presidents' school," said Scott G. Nichols, an economics major in 1970 who is now the dean for development at Harvard Law School. "They're going to be the quiet upper end. They really run the infrastructure."
But as that infrastructure has changed, so, too, have the school and its students. In their unrelenting focus on career goals and on the outsize efforts they believe are needed to achieve them, today's Bucknell seniors can seem like modernized re-creations of the Depression-era parents of the class of 1970.
At Bucknell today, taking time off to find yourself feels dangerous. Caught between the pressure to commit to careers earlier than the class of 1970 ever imagined and the fear that those choices may turn out to be terribly, joylessly, wrong, seniors say that pragmatism rules. The class of 1970 had dreams. The class of '96 has ambitions.
"The class of 1970 knew that great poetry would be written and great music composed and great novels written and it never occurred to them that they wouldn't be the people who might do it," said Douglas K. Candland, who has taught psychology here since 1960. "The current students know that these things will happen, but they don't have the faith that they might be the ones who accomplish those tasks -- in short, we've cut out hope."
The men and women of 1970 knew they would win. It wasn't even something they could articulate, they said, it was just there, a given, like the air itself.
Gerald M. Brown got a half-dozen job offers after graduation and took the best, from Eastman Kodak, in his hometown.
Peter Louthis and Robert P. Justman rejected the mainstream and became carpenters in Aspen, Colo., at a time when a carpenter's wage could still pay the rent.
Christine Dotterer invented herself. Shortly after graduation, she met a female physician for the first time and realized in a flash what her own future could be. Shelby H. Diefenbach entered a corporate world that at last seemed promising for women.
They came of age as a new economic order was taking shape, with its corrosive costs, its compromises and, yes, its opportunities. Their experiences show how broadly and deeply America has been affected by that economic restructuring, and that while mass layoffs may be the most dramatic expression of the new era, little has been left untouched and unchanged.
"In 1970, I wanted to fight to change the world," said Gilbert L. Panitz, the 1970 class president, now an engineer for a major military contractor that has shed two-thirds of its employees in the last five years. "It's ironic that now I'm fighting to keep my job."
 
Hollow Victories
The guarantee that once came with a Bucknell diploma, of a life insulated from economic instability, has been breached: about one in five households in the class of 1970 has lost a job permanently over the last 15 years, according to a New York Times survey of the class. Many of these people tell stories of emotional and financial hardship.
But the damage has spread far wider, to those who have inflicted the pain and to those who have been forced to remain and watch. There are victims who look like winners, and winners with secret, silent wounds.
When he was growing up in Rochester, N.Y., Gerald M. Brown always wanted a house on Canandaigua Lake. His father, a bulldozer operator, would take the family there on summer days, but then they had to pack up and drive the 30 miles back home. For Mr. Brown, a lake house, and a Bucknell education, became symbols of the life his parents never had.
The Kodak job, begun in the summer after graduation, has taken him through more than 25 years now, and from his front window he can gaze out every day onto the shimmering jewel of Canandaigua. He is still in the department where he started out as a programmer, information services, and he has risen in the hierarchy, to senior systems analyst.
But he feels lost. The company that he grew to respect and even love is gone, transformed by downsizing into a place that he says he barely recognizes. Kodak has shrunk by a third, to about 96,000 employees, over the last five years. The last round of downsizing, in early 1994, wiped out 10 percent of Mr. Brown's department.
"When I have lunch with my peers, we all have the same sense of hollowness," he said. "You're always left with the feeling, each time around, 'I'm dispensable, I'm not a vital cog in the machine.' Even though you're a survivor, even though you win, it's a hollow victory. It doesn't make you feel valuable when they say, 'I know you're doing three projects, Jerry, here's another one.' "
Mr. Brown once hoped his oldest son, David, who is 16, might someday become a Kodak man. Now he has no idea what advice to offer.
"The paradigm I taught my son -- work hard, take the A.P. courses, get into a good school and you will get a good job in corporate America like I did -- that corporate America isn't there anymore," Mr. Brown said. "I can't steer him that way. What are the odds that anyone will ever again get 25 years at Kodak?"
Richard Baumbusch, the CBS manager, laughs at the idea of 25 years anywhere. Ultimately, he, too, was laid off by CBS, and he was laid off yet again. But he shrugs off those experiences.
Each time, he got enough of a severance package to tide the family over. He bounced back. His adaptability and his agility are hallmarks of the new corporate man.
He now is an executive director at U S West Communications, a unit of the telecommunications corporation U S West, and lives in a walled enclave called The Preserve, just outside Denver, in a beautiful home of wood and plants.
True, he never feels remotely secure in his job and never will again. But that's the way it is, he says. Sometimes, having survived thus far, he even relaxes.
"Sometimes I think I'm a little too relaxed," he said.
But he is not the man he was. He has seen too much.
Like a third of the class members and their spouses, he has helped lay off people himself. He still remembers pretty much verbatim what he said to his home-buying colleague that day in 1985, the way he tried to convey a message of caution, a signal across their secret divide.
"I said something like, 'Gee, if it was me, I'm not sure I would,' " he said. But the warning was vague, and the man's heart was set on the purchase. "I wanted to say, 'Can't you read the handwriting on the wall?' "
Mr. Baumbusch believes that the changing economy, in the end, has made him more compassionate in some ways, though he still probably would do the same thing and, if anything, feel even more torn.
"I'm more aware of the pain involved in layoffs and relocations than I was," he said. "I'm more prone to spend more time helping people look for work than I was -- it's easier for me to picture myself in that situation, losing self-confidence, sitting at home. It's an extremely lonely experience."
 
Every Man for Himself
Peter Louthis still remembers the opening line from the platoon leader's manual he was given in his Army Reserve Officer Training Corps class at Bucknell: The mission comes before the men.
That one sentence, so loaded with implications about human expendability, became an obsession for him and eventually led him to change the course of his life. Two months short of graduation, the former American Legion Boy of the Year from Rhode Island, the Bucknell football captain and business major who had made all the right moves, dropped out of school and failed to appear for his preinduction draft physical. He went underground and ended up in Aspen, Colo., living with no last name. He got work as a carpenter.
In 1970, Aspen symbolized escape -- from the war, from parents, from the middle class itself. Robert P. Justman, an electrical engineer at Bucknell, also heard the call. He drifted there after graduation and took up carpentry, too, planning to stay perhaps a year. After his second day on the job, he knew he would never go to law school or business school or do anything requiring suits and ties and life indoors. He had found home. By early 1971, two dozen members of the class had arrived in town.
That old Aspen is mostly gone now. The new Aspen is about money. Range Rovers, known locally as Colorado Cadillacs, slink up to the curbs, and teen-agers with just-so haircuts stalk the boutique-choked streets. With housing costs and demand soaring, the bargain-basement shared homes of 1970 are a thing of the past. The idea of Aspen as a left-leaning, egalitarian, alternate universe has been eclipsed.
Mr. Louthis, who ultimately got a draft deferment that allowed him to come out of hiding, is now a construction superintendent for a small company that specializes in multimillion-dollar mountainside mansions. The smallest home he has built since the late 1980's is 16,000 square feet, and some have been larger than 40,000. All are custom designed at a cost of up to $500 a square foot. He and his workers wear white paper slippers over their shoes to protect the floors.
And like business owners and managers all over the country, he has found that the mission, in the new economy, very often does come before the men. Two years ago, his company went through its first downsizing, cutting the staff of 110 by about 10 percent, using temporary workers and subcontractors instead. The old elements of his company's founding culture -- the family-like feeling, the shared purpose and enthusiasm -- are alive, he says, but they are struggling.
So is Mr. Louthis. He believes in his company, Hansen Construction, and wants it to prosper, but the impulse that brought him to Aspen is also still there, and sometimes the two are at war. Although he did not have to lay anyone off himself, he said, he is more acutely aware of being one of "them" than he ever was before.
"I know I've become part of the system I rejected, to an extent," he said. "But I feel that I have still kept my individuality."
So he encourages his employees to quit if they show even the smallest amount of initiative. Set yourself up as an independent subcontractor, then come back, he tells them. You'll keep more for yourself and have a chance to build something. The company, Mr. Louthis tells workers, "may not stand by you as long as you expect it to."
He tries to hold out the same model for himself: draw a line beyond which the incursions and compromises of the business are too much, and be ready to walk away. Just as he did in 1970.
"Right now we still have a family, we still do the raft trips and the picnic," Mr. Louthis said. "But the new world is more computer-like, and I can see us beginning to go that way, being cleaner and colder and more calculated. We have to stay competitive."
Robert Justman also became a successful custom-home builder, in Austin, Tex., using what he earned from his first two Aspen houses as seed money. But the self-made road has led him to become a pillar of the new social contract.
He hires mostly Mexican immigrants for $6 an hour. He realizes that probably drives down the pay scale, maybe even contributes to homelessness, and that those wages alone will not support a family as they could in the 1970's. But he believes native-born Americans have lost the work ethic.
The Mexicans who work for him, he said, are "dream employees. At $6 they're thrilled and honest and hard-working. Try and find a black or white American who will work like that." Besides, he says, "Just because a guy didn't have the good fortune I did to be born north of the 40th parallel or whatever, I should punish him? Anyway, that's my rationale."
 
Feminism Compromised
When the class of 1970 arrived at Bucknell in 1966, the ideal of female behavior was a mythical being called the "Bucknell Lady." She had perfect poise and charm and always wore a skirt downtown, never pants. She needed to be sheltered.
Women in the class were required to eat separately from the men, and their dormitories were locked earlier, at 11 o'clock, even though the library was open until midnight. By 1970, as the women's movement was being born, the student body had voted for coeducational dormitories, and the other old restrictions had been trashed. The Bucknell Lady was dead.
The story of the Bucknell woman is still being written. Many women from the class of 1970 were at the front lines in shattering the dichotomy between work and home, asserting themselves in professions and institutions once all but closed to them. Now, economic forces have compromised those feminist ambitions in ways the women never expected.
Shelby H. Diefenbach never remotely imagined that in her late 40's she would be a self-employed businesswoman, mother and the primary breadwinner for her family. An English literature major in 1970, she took the corporate road after graduation. She went into marketing research, first for Campbell's soup, then R. J. Reynolds, then Apple Computer in California.
In 1992, it all unraveled. Her husband's export business went soft in the recession. She had two small children, and the rising financial burden and ever-longer hours at the office filled her with stress and guilt. Then she got laid off.
It was a turning point. Feeling alienated by the grind, then burned because the opportunities that had been promised were ripped away, Ms. Diefenbach refused even to look for a new job. Instead, she set up shop as an independent marketing research consultant and found herself, to her surprise, on the winning end of a downsizing trend: companies were eliminating their research departments and contracting out the work.
She gets no benefits, and her husband is now working as a consultant, too, but she says she is happy in a way she never was before. She is more confident of herself and her abilities, but more relaxed too. She laughs more now.
"We're struggling basically, when we should have a nice retirement stashed away," she said. "But we'd have to be in a homeless shelter before I'd go back. I have a great personality now. I never had a personality before."
Ann M. Morrison, a psychology major in 1970 and co-author of "Breaking the Glass Ceiling," a how-to book for rising female executives, said that in many ways, Ms. Diefenbach's story had become a new model. Companies that were flush in the 1970's and 1980's have retrenched.
For women inside organizations, she said, the 1990's have been a disappointment. Advancement has been blocked and workloads have increased, even as many women need their jobs more than ever because of family pressures. But, she added, "More women are also going and making it on their own. That's a very encouraging factor."
Still, independence by itself has provided no immunity either.
Christine Dotterer's graduation from Bucknell marked the continuation of a tradition: she represented the third generation of women in her family to be educated here, beginning with her grandmother in the class of 1916. She also began a tradition on her own: she took a career after graduation.
She stumbled on it, actually. She went to New York in November 1970 to be a social worker and met, for the first time in her life, a female physician. A new world suddenly opened. This was something she could be, something she could make all her own.
She has done that, achieving a precise and layered vision. She wanted the autonomy of a small-town family practice, in Selinsgrove near her family's roots in central Pennsylvania, and she wanted to run it with what she thought of as a woman's sensibility.
"It's not hierarchical," she said. "It's a female-oriented office, just me and two nurses, and we're all soft touches. If somebody is in financial trouble, we charge for a brief office visit even though it wasn't."
In the last few years, though, Dr. Dotterer has seen her work transformed by the same forces of cost-cutting that are behind the layoff phenomenon, as more and more of her patients get their medical coverage through managed-care companies. The increased paperwork, she says, has forced her to computerize her practice and raise her rates. Worse still, she points out, her autonomy as a physician is being whittled down as insurers second-guess her treatment decisions.
"The system can't pay attention to the needs of people, and paying attention to the physical and emotional needs of people was the feminist vision of my practice," she said. "It's being a mother hen, for lack of a better word, to my patients and to my employees, but the more I see the iron stamp of managed care on the practice of medicine, the more those wonderful things are being lost.
"I used to think I would be one of these people wandering around practicing medicine at 85 and having a good time. I can't imagine that anymore. I can't imagine working to 65."
 
Self-Determination
 Glen B. Maynard still has the 1969 Datsun 2000 two-seater convertible in which he drove west in 1975 after graduating from Boston University Law School. In fact, he just had it repainted last fall.
His law office, right above the Silverheels Grill in downtown Golden, Colo., has a view of Table Mountain and the exuberant "Howdy Folks!" banner that stretches across the main drag, Washington Avenue. He walks eight blocks to work. He can live on $2,000 a month if need be. He has one associate, and never went in much for possessions or family commitments.
"I never acquired a wife," he said.
In the last few years, more Americans have been "downshifting," discovering new tracks out of the consumer culture, and away from the complexity, stress and anxiety of modern life. Mr. Maynard simplified his life long before it became trendy, and in an economy that rewards the self-reliant, that has been a formula for victory, or at least a way to fight to a draw.
Mr. Maynard's college years were so overshadowed by the Vietnam War and the draft, which to him symbolized all the forces of life over which he had no control, that the driving force of his life ever since has been autonomy, never to be under the thumb of a boss, never to be in debt.
"I don't know what trade-offs have been made to stay independent," he said. "I'm sure some are economic. My choice is that I don't like to take direction from other people. I like to do things my way."
So does Janice E. Thomas; it just took her longer to realize it. A conservative math major at Bucknell, the daughter of a career military man, she worked for AT&T for 18 years after graduation as a computer programmer before deciding about seven years ago to throw it all over and do what she really wanted to do.
"When I went into the business world, I thought there would be rewards," she said. "But you're like a widget -- you're a programmer and you sit at a desk and this is what you're supposed to do. I began to get the feeling that the work I was doing wasn't making a difference -- for me, or the world."
Asked to explain just what it is she does now, she struggles, settling finally on a label she invented: a mind, body, spirit healing facilitator. She works from her home in Norwalk, Conn., helping people through a combination of nerve-muscle relaxation, meditation, psychology and spiritual counseling. Her basic premise is that everyone has a mostly untapped interior reservoir of regenerative power, a kind of will to heal that mainly needs encouragement and training.
Ms. Thomas believes that all the old systems are breaking down, and that the changing relationships between people and their jobs are simply one manifestation. She believes that a new era is dawning that will be more open to self-fulfillment than any before. What we are experiencing, she says, with all its thrashing and turmoil, is the death rattle of what we knew. "The world," she says, "is being destroyed so that it can be rebuilt."
Now, as the members of the class of 1970 approach the precipice of their 50's, there is also a sense of mortality in many of their voices. Losing a job in your 50's is easier in the new economy, and finding one, especially a good one, is harder.
"As you go forward and more and more people will have lived through this, you get more resilient and not so scared," said David L. Hall, a bank executive who has been laid off, and who has laid off others. "But the most dangerous 15 years for our class is now approaching -- the 15 years to retirement."

HEADLINE: A Trial Without Witnesses

BYLINE: By Theodor Meron 

 BODY:
The International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague is being undermined by a lack of cooperation from most of the combatants in the former Yugoslavia -- the Serbs, Bosnian Serbs and Croats. Unless the United Nations and the Western powers use all their leverage to help the tribunal, the rule of international law and the legacy of the Nuremberg trials will be in danger.
So far, 53 people have been indicted: 7 Croats, 3 members of the Serbian Army and 43 Bosnian Serbs. Yet only two, both Bosnian Serbs, have been apprehended and sent to The Hague (along with another Bosnian Serb suspect who has not yet been indicted). The primary reason is that the governments and militaries have been sheltering the suspected war criminals. 
 But there is another worrisome trend. Many of the victims and witnesses that the prosecution needs have refused to cooperate. This is probably due to pressure from their governments, which could use a lack of witnesses as an excuse to claim that the accused cannot receive a fair trial and must be released. When Dusan Tadic, a Bosnian Serb charged with raping, killing and torturing Muslims in a concentration camp, comes to trial in May, his lawyers may try to have the charges dismissed for this reason.
The indictment last week of Gen. Djordje Djukic, one of the Bosnian Serbs in custody, for indiscriminately bombing citizens of Sarajevo, was good news. But it will only partly relieve the growing disappointment in the West that the tribunal, in which it has invested heavily, has produced only two defendants. Public support of the trials is vital to the future of international law.
Given the military muscle that the NATO-led international force now has on the ground in Bosnia, it would be a disgrace if Mr. Tadic and Mr. Djukic remain the only defendants.
What can we do? The Clinton Administration appears to be less reluctant than Congress -- which is apparently haunted by memories of Beirut and Somalia -- to have the international force play a more active role.
Under its operating procedures, the international troops are allowed to arrest indicted war criminals but not to seek them out. Still, they could be more aggressive without breaking those rules. If intelligence agencies improved the way they share information with the international force, the troops would have a better chance of finding indicted criminals without appearing to hunt for them.
Then there is the diplomatic approach. As a part of the Dayton peace agreement, if either the civilian coordinator, Carl Bildt of Sweden, or the the NATO force's commander, Adm. Leighton Smith of the United States, informs the United Nations that the Serbs "are failing significantly to meet their obligations under the peace agreement," economic sanctions are to be reimposed within five days (unless the Security Council disapproves). This threat has yet to be used.
Of course, such sanctions would have no effect on Croatia, which has also been unhelpful. Fortunately, Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, craves international legitimacy and a place in the European Community. It should be made clear that no such acceptance will be forthcoming until he fully cooperates with the tribunal. Should the Bosnians cause trouble, their assistance can be best insured through American influence, perhaps by threatening to end military training and other aid.
The tribunal could enhance its own prospects by vigorously investigating notorious Serb paramilitary leaders who have not been indicted. It must also look into Muslims suspected of atrocities; since most of those currently indicted are Bosnian Serbs, questions about the tribunal's impartiality have been raised. The Hague needs a guarantee from the United Nations that it will be given adequate financing to broaden its efforts.
The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Richard Goldstone of South Africa, has done an excellent job despite the lack of cooperation. But he needs more help from the United Nations and the international community as he strives to uphold the rule of international law.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
TV Airwaves Becoming Issue In Budget Battle

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The television airwaves are becoming part of the budget wars in Congress, with Senate Republicans taking a hard look at proposals to raise billions of dollars by auctioning off a part of the radio spectrum earmarked for advanced TV services.
The newest effort comes from the Senate Budget Committee, where lawmakers are looking harder for money to cut the deficit and have cast an eye on television licenses that are estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars on the open market. 
 Broadcasters and television equipment manufacturers have already begun publicity and lobbying campaigns to stop any auction proposal. On Thursday, a group called Citizens for HDTV (high-definition television) will hold a news conference that is intended to convey the views of consumers and labor unions.
But the group's main organizer is a trade association for the consumer electronics industry, whose members hope to make a lot of money on the sale of new digital TV sets and related equipment.
Television broadcasters have also started buying full-page newspaper ads and have begun pleading their case in visits to members of Congress.
Broadcasters argue that they need the licenses to make a transition to new digital technology, which was originally developed for high-definition television but can also be used to send data or to beam as many as six shows at a time over the frequencies now used for just one.
The effort in Congress could split top Republican lawmakers. Some, like the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, have made it clear they would like to auction off the airwaves. But the television industry also has powerful supporters, including the Senate Republican whip, Trent Lott of Mississippi.
Republican Congressional officials say that fight is heating up again for two reasons.
First, they say, members of the Budget Committee, headed by Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, have become increasingly excited by the sky-high prices being bid in the auction of wireless telephone licenses that is under way at the Federal Communications Commission.
Bidding in that auction, which was reserved for companies that qualify as small businesses, has soared well beyond expectations and has topped $7.9 billion.
Second, according to members of the Republican staff, lawmakers have become worried that sluggishness in the economy will force them to revise their economic assumptions downward and make it even more difficult to trim the deficit.
"Those issues have taken on added importance because of the latest economic growth numbers," said one Republican staff member. "That's causing trouble for both the White House and the Congressional leadership."
Senator Domenici surprised many of his colleagues last Friday, scheduling a Senate Budget Committee hearing for next week to analyze the value of different auction proposals. Analysts from the Congressional Budget Office, the White House Office of Management and Budget and perhaps from industry are expected to testify.
The hearing upstages hearings scheduled for later this month by both the House and Senate commerce panels. These hearings are expected to be broader and probably inconclusive because those committees are far more divided and the House panel is openly sympathetic to the TV industry.
No one, however, can more than guess about what the television frequencies might be worth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that an auction would yield about $12.5 billion. The F.C.C. has produced estimates ranging from $11 billion to $70 billion. Some independent analysts believe the figure could be as low as $5 billion, given practical limitations on the frequencies under debate.
Supporters of digital television say that an auction would derail the new broadcasting technology because television stations could not carry out a transition from today's system to one that would transmit to an entirely new generation of sets.
Auctions "would set back the whole technology, in which the United States has the leadership," said Richard E. Wiley, a former chairman of the communications commission and now head of an F.C.C. advisory group that guided development of an advanced TV system. "From many public policy standpoints, auctioning the digital television frequencies would be a mistake."
Senator Dole, who protested that giving or even lending the broadcasters new licenses amounted to "corporate welfare," said little today but remains sympathetic to auctions.
"Senator Dole's view is that the spectrum is a valuable resource and that that taxpayers should be fairly compensated for its use," said Clarkson Hine, spokesman for Mr. Dole.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has campaigned for auctions, said he was increasingly optimistic about prevailing.
"I would never underestimate the power of the broadcasters, but over time, I believe that these things will turn out in the interest of the average citizen," he said.

HEADLINE: Boeing, in Rosy Forecast, Says Industry Is Recovering

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that a recovery is under way in the commercial airplane industry, as it issued a new 20-year forecast for the industry.
Boeing said it expected airlines would buy 15,900 planes worth $1.1 trillion in the next 20 years, up modestly from 15,462 in its 1995 forecast, with two of every three planes going to carriers outside the United States. 
 "Traffic growth and sustained airline profitability are beginning to result in airplane orders," said Nancy Bethel, vice president of marketing for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. "Our industry appears to have made it through the bottom of the cycle."
Boeing's optimistic forecast coincided with the $2.8 billion order from the International Lease Finance Corporation, a unit of the American International Group, for 18 of its midsize 777 airliners. The agreement brings to 24 the total number of 777's that International Lease has on order. International Lease, based in Los Angeles, also ordered 38 airplanes worth about $3 billion from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, including the first orders for the new A330-200 wide-body planes. The Boeing and Airbus orders announced yesterday were reported in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.
Shares of Boeing shares fell 50 cents, to $80.75. The shares rose to a record $83.625 on Feb. 23.
"There's a modest recovery under way," said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The market is not as frenzied as in some previous recoveries, but it has tightened. It's not quite at the point where there's a shortage of aircraft, but it's approaching it."
Although deliveries by domestic and foreign manufacturers declined to 481 aircraft in 1995, compared with 522 in 1994, orders for new airplanes more than doubled to 714 in 1995, compared with 347 in 1994, Boeing said. It was the first time since 1990 that orders exceeded deliveries.
"Unlike the boom years of the late 80's, however, airlines today are focused on profitability -- not market share," Ms. Bethel of Boeing said. "We foresee rational new-airplane acquisitions, and continued efforts to enhance revenues and reduce costs."
The order from International Lease confirms the strength of the 777 in the market, analysts said. Questions about the jetliner's performance, raised in a letter from United Airlines to Boeing , were played down by officials of both companies. In the letter, which was disclosed in an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, Joseph O'Gorman, United's executive vice president of fleet operations, wrote that the reliability of the new plane is "a major disappointment."
Donna Mikov, a spokeswoman for Boeing, said yesterday that "We're obviously aggressively addressing these concerns. We understand the problems and they're being fixed."
She added that that the 777 had a reliability rate of 97.5 percent in 1995. "Our goal for 1996 is 98 percent," she said.
In a statement, Mr. O'Gorman of United Airlines, which is owned by the UAL Corporation, said yesterday: "The 777 is an excellent airplane; we just want to make it better. The 777 is outperforming all other new airplanes we've introduced into our fleet."
Analysts said airlines often used frank, even blunt language in their confidential correspondence with aircraft makers, and said that no concern raised in United's letter involved safety.
"If you looked in the files of any of the manufacturers you would find many letters like this," said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities. "Nothing they are saying is safety- or flight-related -- it's niggles." He said that the 747-400, an upgrade rather than an entirely new airplane like the 777, had a lower reliability rate in its first year.
Though International Lease split its order between Boeing and Airbus, that is common for a leasing company, which must serve airlines of many different sizes and nationalities, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Life and Death Reports From a Chicago Project

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 6

 BODY:
At 16, LeAlan Jones is full of ambition and dreams of playing college football and pulling his family out of the ghetto.
But first he wants to go prison. 
 His uncle is already there, along with who-knows-how-many-other young men from LeAlan's hard-luck, no-job neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.
For many of LeAlan's peers, a stay in jail or prison has become a rite of passage. But LeAlan, a high school junior, only wants to deliver a message there. He gives motivational and anti-drug speeches for a social service agency, No Dope Express. He fits in these talks around homework, football practice and reporting about life and death in the inner city for National Public Radio.
LeAlan and his reporting partner, Lloyd Newman, 17, are part of the silent majority of urban America -- decent young people trying to do the right thing, even in places where the good as well as the bad often die young in the crossfire of the streets.
"It's easy to do wrong around here," Lloyd said the other day as they walked through their neighborhood. "It's easy to get caught up by mistake."
LeAlan nodded in agreement, and a sad shadow crossed his face, a face caught between chubby and lean, boyhood and manhood.
"All most people need is a push and they'll do right," he said. "But around here there aren't a lot of people pushing. They're too tired."
But three years ago, the two lifelong friends got a big push. Under the direction of a radio producer based in New York, David Isay, the boys wandered the streets of the South Side with a tape recorder and turned their travels into a 30-minute, award-winning documentary of their lives and families for National Public Radio. It was called "Ghetto Life 101."
Now, the teen-agers are putting the finishing touches on another project for N.P.R., the story behind the death of 5-year-old Eric Morse and the two boys -- ages 10 and 11 at the time -- who in 1994 dropped him to his death out of a 14th-floor window at the Ida B. Wells public housing development. In January, the two boys became the youngest in the nation to be sentenced to maximum-security juvenile prison. Mr. Isay is producing the show, with money from the Chicago Community Trust, a charitable group.
LeAlan and Lloyd did not have to go far to do their reporting for their piece, "Remorse: The 14 stories of Eric Morse," which is scheduled to be heard on March 21 at 4 P.M. Eastern standard time. Lloyd has spent his entire life in the Ida B. Wells project and LeAlan lives one block away. The teen-agers are like war correspondents who never get to leave the front.
"Around here there is so much killing that you got to harden yourself from within," LeAlan said. "If you don't, you'll be sobbing every day."
Lloyd, who looks more like 12 than 17 with his hairless face and his too-big-for-him coat, ticked off the most common ways to die in their world, and natural causes were not on the list.
"People get thrown out of windows, drowned, stabbed, shot," he said. "But a lot of that killing would stop if the Government would make it livable around here. We don't have no parks. The swings are broken. There's nothing for people to do. There's no fun. Life isn't worth living without some fun."
"That's where he landed," LeAlan said, pointing at the mud at the foot a 14-story building. "That's where Eric's world stopped forever."
Neither reporter claims to know why the two boys dropped Eric out of a window. Lloyd, who knew the older boy's family, said it was probably an accident, that they only wanted to scare the child. The police said the boys did it because Eric refused to steel candy for them. LeAlan and Lloyd said they did not believe that the candy was the only reason.
"Those boys probably didn't get enough love at home," LeAlan said. "That's probably the main reason all this happened."
In putting together their report, LeAlan and Lloyd walked up and down the building where Eric died and had plenty of doors shut in their faces, an experience common to even veteran reporters.
"People in the projects are suspicious," Lloyd says on the audiotape.
But they kept going back, and the result is a moving documentary of a world of sad children forced to grow up much too fast.
Among those interviewed was the younger brother of one of the boys who dropped Eric. They asked him whether he had ever stolen candy, and he said yes, "because I be hungry."
LeAlan and Lloyd climbed to the top of the building from which Eric was dropped and looked down. Le Alan asked Lloyd on the tape what would have gone through his mind as he had been falling 14 stories.
"I don't know," Lloyd responded. "I'd be thinking about how it is in heaven."
"Do you think they got a playground in heaven?" LeAlan asked.
LeAlan lives with his mother, June, and his grandparents in a worn-out row house. Lloyd lives with his two sisters, Diana, 23, Sophia, 22, and brother, Michael, 18, in another row house. Diana Newman has been in charge of the family since their mother died five years ago.
"It's real rough around here," Ms. Newman said. "We tell Lloyd there's no reason for him to join a gang because he has his family to love him. He listens. We're very proud of him."
Michael plays football and basketball for nearby Dunbar High School. Sports, he said, has keep him out of trouble. Like his brother and LeAlan, both of whom plan to pursue journalism after graduation, he hopes to go to college.
"My mother lived long enough to teach me right from wrong," he said as the boys and some friends sat around the kitchen table in the Newman home. "But I got more fears than hopes right now. I stay awake thinking about all the things that could happen to me."
"No, man," Lloyd said, "you got to put your dreams before your fears."
"Not around here," said Shemauro Gibbs, 18, a friend. "You can't be walking around here dreaming. You might not see the bullet coming your way."
Fears of violence and early death haunt these young people but they say the streets are worse now than they were when they were children or "shorties," like "the brothers who dropped Eric out of that window," LeAlan said.
Michael said he was more worried about politicians and their message. He said he was afraid that what little Government help poor neighborhoods now received would be cut off "because the Republicans already control Congress and they might get the White House, too."
"I'm studying politics real hard now," he said. "I'm going to vote this year for sure."
"I'm voting, too," Shemauro said. "I have to for my people."
"I wish I was old enough," Lloyd said.
LeAlan was quiet as his friends talked, and then the sad shadow crossed his face again.
"The only time young black men get on the news," he said, "is when they score a lot of points playing basketball or when they get arrested. That's not right and now that I'm a journalist I'm going do something about it. That's not a dream. That's a promise."

HEADLINE: Traditional Family Stabilized in the 90's, Study Suggests

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
After two decades of social pressures that caused many to fear that it might dissolve, the traditional American family is making a comeback in the 1990's, a Washington research group said today in issuing a profile of the country's population.
The report, by the Population Reference Bureau Inc., said increases in the number of two-parent households with children, decreases in the divorce rate and other changes suggested that the American family was stabilizing. 
 "We don't look and we don't function anything like we did 20 or 30 years ago," Carol J. De Vita, author of the report, said today at a news conference. "And it's true that the American family has undergone some very radical changes in the past 25 years. But what I want to emphasize is that the major changes in the family structure are probably passed."
The group is a private, nonprofit research organization that uses Census Bureau data and other information to periodically paint demographic portraits of the country.
Although it is highly respected and its former director of policy research, Martha Farnsworth Riche, is now director of the Census Bureau, some demographers and sociologists questioned the report, saying its conclusions were overly optimistic.
In the report, "The United States at Mid-Decade," Ms. De Vita said, the number of two-parent households with children increased by 700,000 from 1990 to 1995, reversing a 20-year decline. She also said that the divorce rate slowed to 20.5 divorces per 1,000 married women in 1994 from 23 divorces per 1,000 in 1980 and that the increase in the number of births to unmarried women slowed to a 2 percent annual average increase in the early 1990's, down from a 6 percent annual rise in the 1980's.
Ms. De Vita attributed these changes to the fact that the baby-boom generation, which makes up a third of the country's population, has entered middle age. After delaying marriage, and then often divorcing and marrying again, baby boomers are beginning to settle into the task of raising families.
"Middle age is the time of life when family responsibilities come to the fore," Ms. De Vita said.
But Reynolds Farley, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, said: "The numbers I have looked at don't show any reversal of these trends. There may be some moderation, but the overall trends remain the same."
Mr. Farley said, for example, that the continuing increase in the nation's population means that there are more and more people reaching marriage age. That, he said, would account for the increase in the numbers of two-parent families. But he added that the decline in the percentage of two-parent families as a proportion of all households had not changed.
While the report painted an optimistic outlook for the traditional American family, it also provided evidence of other recent economic and demographic trends that have fueled anxiety in some segments of the population and helped propel the Presidential candidacy of politicians like Patrick J. Buchanan.
While the report noted that the number of legal immigrants was declining, it said 9 percent of the population was born in a foreign country, the highest level of foreign-born residents since the end of World War II.
The report also indicated that nearly 32 million people spoke a language at home other than English, a 40 percent increase from 1980.
Moreover, the report noted that as a result of higher birth rates and immigration, the country's minority population grew by 15 percent in the first five years of the decade, compared with 3 percent in the non-Hispanic white population. The Hispanic population grew by 20 percent, Asian 31 percent and black 8 percent.
Indeed, the report said that if current trends in immigration and fertility continued, the minority population and the non-Hispanic white population should be roughly equal by the middle of the next century.
In addition, the report showed that while the country had pulled out of recession, median household income was 6 percent below its 1989 pre-recession peak, though it acknowleged that the measurements of income included only cash wages and not benefits like health insurance provided by employers.
The report is also striking in its depiction of the continued increase in the overall America population. The United States is the fastest growing country in the industrialized world, the study says. Fueled by immigration and a mini-baby boom as the baby-boom generation has had children, the United States grew by an annual rate of 1 percent in the first half of the 1990's, up slightly from the 0.9 percent growth in the 80's.
In contrast, Western Europe grew by an average of 0.4 percent annually and Japan's by 0.3 percent. At this rate, the United States population of 262.8 million could reach 300 million by 2010 and nearly 400 million by the middle of the next century.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves Bill Easing Rules On Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
A House committee today approved legislation that would make it easier for small employers to band together and buy health insurance, but the bill would allow such health plans to avoid all state insurance regulation.
The vote, in the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, followed party lines. Twenty-four Republicans voted for the bill and 18 Democrats opposed it, saying it would undermine state efforts to adopt more comprehensive health insurance measures. 
 The committee chairman, Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the bill could make it possible for half of the nation's 40 million uninsured to obtain coverage through employers.
"Members of a national association, such as the Chamber of Commerce or the National Federation of Independent Business, could join with other small businessmen to gain greater economies of scale and command greater clout in the health insurance marketplace," Mr. Goodling said.
Some trade associations help employers band together to buy health insurance for workers now. But Representative Harris W. Fawell, Republican of Illinois, chief sponsor of the bill, said it was difficult to arrange such coverage because regulations on benefits varied from state to state. Mr. Fawell said these requirements had raised costs to the point that many small employers decided not to offer health insurance.
Mr. Fawell's bill is one of several incremental health insurance measures put forward in Congress since the demise of President Clinton's plan to guarantee coverage for all Americans. Another measure, a bipartisan bill that would make it easier for people to retain insurance coverage when they change or lose jobs, is pending in the Senate.
The Fawell bill includes similar provisions, but goes further. Under Mr. Fawell's bill, "multiple-employer health plans" would be treated like big corporations that serve as their own insurers, paying claims from corporate assets. More than half of all employees in the United States now work for such self-insured companies. There is virtually no state regulation of their health plans, and a self-insured company is exempt from state taxes on insurance premiums.
The National Federation of Independent Business, representing 600,000 small business owners, supports Mr. Fawell's bill. But Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, said Democrats had voted against it because it was "a phony piece of legislation designed to make it appear that Republicans are concerned about an issue when they are really not."
The National Governors' Association, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the National Conference of State Legislatures also criticized the bill, saying it would undermine state authority to regulate health insurance and would leave consumers with fewer protections. In a joint letter to Congress, the insurance commissioners and the state legislators said the bill "would hamper states from going further than the Federal standards."
Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri, said, "It's ironic that Republicans, who claim to be the protectors of states' rights, are usurping the power of states to regulate health insurance." State officials said the bill could deprive them of tax revenue used to finance coverage for people who cannot obtain affordable health insurance in the private market.
President Clinton, Democrats in both houses and many Republican senators support the Senate measure, sponsored by Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, has introduced an identical bill in the House.
The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said today that he and 170 other Democrats intended to sign up as co-sponsors of Mrs. Roukema's bill, which is also supported by many business and consumer groups.
Mrs. Roukema said her bill and Mr. Fawell's were not irreconcilable. "There can be a marriage of the best parts of the two," she said.
The measure approved today is one of many legislative initiatives that House Republicans want to tack onto the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. They say they also intend to add provisions dealing with medical malpractice, antitrust law, medical savings accounts and tax deductions for health insurance costs of people who are self-employed.
Mr. Goodling recalled the failure of Mr. Clinton's health plan in 1994, saying: "That bill ultimately sank of its own weight. By trying to do too much, we ended up doing nothing at all."
Democrats said they feared that House Republicans would have a similar experience this year.

HEADLINE: Texas Instruments Cites Surplus of Computer Memory Chips

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 6

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc. said today that an oversupply of memory chips was hurting prices as demand for personal computers slowed.
As a result, growth in the worldwide semiconductor industry this year is likely to be less than expected, the company said at its annual meeting here with analysts. 
 "Business is just not good," said Tom Kurlak, an analyst with Merrill Lynch who attended the meeting.
The gloomy assessment followed price slashing by top United States computer makers and Micron Technology's halting of construction of a Utah chip plant until demand improved.
The Texas Instrument news pounded semiconductor stocks. The company's shares fell $2.75 each, to $47.625. Micron's share price fell $2, to $29.125, and shares of the Intel Corporation lost $2.125, to $53.25.
Texas Instruments, which reported a 27 percent sales rise last year to $13.1 billion, expects the increase to level off at about 20 percent during the next several years, Bill Aylesworth, the company's chief financial officer, said. The company derives about $2 billion of annual revenue from dynamic random-access memory chips.
The company said the price of the benchmark four-megabyte D-RAM dropped to between $6.50 and $7 a unit, from about $12 in December.
"People are going to have to rethink their numbers," said Daniel Niles, an analyst at Robertson Stephens Company.
Texas Instruments said that while current market conditions showed a slowdown in demand and prices, it was temporary and would turn around as the economy picked up in the second half. It said prices might rebound in the third quarter.
"The economy is weak right now, but we see a U.S. economy that will strengthen in the second half," said Vladi Catto, the company's chief economist.
Mr. Catto also predicted that over the next few years, the compound annual growth rate for personal computers and semiconductors would increase to 20 percent a year from the 15 percent average growth rate over the last 10 years.
The company expects the chip industry's sales to reach $350 billion by 2000, compared with $140 billion last year.
Texas Instruments itself expects to increase capital spending to $2.5 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 1995.
Memory prices have been steady over the last two years as demand outstripped supply. For that reason, Micron, Intel and other chip makers disclosed plans to add new capacity.
D-RAM's were in short supply last year because of the increasing amount of memory needed in personal computers to run multimedia applications and Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.
However, Compaq Computer and I.B.M. have said that demand for personal computers from corporate customers is declining. They and others -- including Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment -- have slashed prices over the last few days.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the second straight day, as investor hopes of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve continued to fade on fears of more strong economic data that could lead to inflationary pressures.
Despite the widespread sentiment, there was little economic news on the calendar. The only official report yesterday was revised fourth-quarter productivity from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Market participants viewed the modest upward drift in wage pressures in the report as inflationary. 
 The 30-year bond dropped 30/32, to a price of 94 2/32 to yield 6.45 percent, up from 6.38 percent on Tuesday and its highest level in nearly a week. For a bondholder it meant a loss of almost $10 for every $1,000 of bonds held.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at IDEA, a British financial consulting firm, said, "It appears that a modest upward drift in wages is running above the 2.7 percent Consumer Price Index year-over-year, unit labor costs of 3.3 percent year-over-year, average hourly earnings of 3.5 percent and the employment costs index of 2.9 percent year-over-year, which suggest that further C.P.I. declines are not likely in 1996." Rather, he said, the bias is to inch up.
"This trend," Mr. Stiles said, combined with "the strong car sales and factory order resiliency makes the case for a March easing by the Fed even weaker, barring a very weak payroll report. Our forecast is for a gain of 400,000.
"We expect first-quarter G.D.P. will be about 2 percent, which is above the early consensus of about 1 to 1.50 percent, with the yield spread between a two-year maturity and the Federal funds rate of 5.25 percent gradually widening," he said. "The yield for the 30-year bond is more likely to see 6.70 percent before re-establishing a trading range that would keep the yield between 6 percent and 6.25 percent."
Another factor that encouraged market participants to adjust positions yesterday rather than take new ones was the February employment report due out tomorrow. However much of the damage had already been done overnight before the day session got going, traders said.
"Traders might refer to the price chart formation today as looking like a bowling ball going down the stairs," James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, San Francisco, said. "There have been plenty of bounces, but the general direction is pretty clear."
Yesterday states, cities and agencies sold about $1 billion in new debt securities through negotiated and competitive bidding, as municipal bond prices fell on concern that even more issues are being made ready for sale. According to The Bond Buyer's most recent count, about $7.4 billion of new bonds will be up for sale next month.
Should the jobs report tomorrow show fewer new jobs than expected, bonds could gain in price. That would lower the yield on Treasury bonds, which helps determine rates on everything from mortgages to corporate and municipal borrowing.

Prospect of Cut in German Rates Lifts Dollar Across-the-Board

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged up against leading currencies yesterday, finding strength against the German mark on news that suggested that German interest rates might come down.
"The only real news of the day, which sort of got muddled by some profit taking earlier in the day, was the German employment report," said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
 News that Germany's unemployment rate rose in February to 10.3 percent from 10.1 percent may prompt the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, traders said.
Lower interest rates generally hurt currencies as investors tend to put their money elsewhere seeking a higher rate of return.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 105.40 Japanese yen from 105.25 yen on Tuesday. The dollar was changing hands at 1.4770 marks, up from 1.4758 marks. The British pound slipped to $1.5295 from $1.5300.
Traders were focused on profit taking from overnight gains abroad and gave little notice to the German employment report until afternoon New York trading, Mr. Donney said.
The only other news that aided the dollar against European currencies was a decision by Denmark to lower interest rates, supporting the argument that some other key European rates may be coming down.
Against the yen, the dollar advanced largely as a result of technical factors, particularly so-called cross-trading between the yen and mark, which can affect dollar-yen transactions. Generally positive sentiment about the dollar also helped it advance against the Japanese currency.
Many market participants continued to be reluctant to make any large bets on the dollar before tomorrow's release of the United States employment report for February.

HEADLINE: U.S. Productivity Level Fell 0.5% in the Fourth Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers declined in the fourth quarter as the hours they spent on the job increased at a faster pace than their output of goods and services, the Government reported today.
Nonfarm productivity -- a measure of the time, effort and cost of providing goods and services -- declined at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, reversing much of the third quarter's increase of 1.7 percent. The third-quarter gain was previously reported as 1.4 percent. For all of 1995, productivity rose 1.1 percent, compared with a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent the previous year, the Labor Department said. It was the largest annual increase since 1992, when productivity advanced 3.2 percent. 
 "Going into periods of weaker growth, productivity falls because demand slackens in the economy, yet it takes time for businesses to respond by laying off people," Raymond Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said before today's report.
Slower growth may already be prompting some companies to step up job cuts, suggesting future improvement in productivity figures. The number of planned layoffs announced by American employers rose 9.3 percent in February from a year earlier, according to a survey released today by Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago employment firm.
If the economy rebounds later this year, so will productivity, analysts said. "Associated with a pickup in economic activity in the second half, productivity will advance," said Robert Barbera, co-chairman of Capital Investments International Inc. in New York.
Today's report showed that manufacturing productivity rose 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter and 3.7 percent in all of 1995.
Unit labor costs, which make up about two-thirds of American business costs, rose 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter, after a 2.5 percent rise in the third quarter. For all of 1995, unit labor costs rose 2.5 percent.
Hourly wages adjusted for inflation, meanwhile, increased six-tenths of 1 percent, lower than the 2.2 percent gain in the previous quarter. And the implicit price deflator, a measure of price increases tied to the productivity report, rose just nine-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, after a 1.8 percent rise in the previous quarter.
Worker output advanced by 1.1 percent, after posting a 4.7 percent gain in the third quarter.
Today's figures reflected the Government's new weighted measure of output, which makes economic growth and productivity gains look lower than under the old system.
Using the old method for gauging productivity and growth in economic output, the Government was locked into a system of comparing price changes with products from a base year -- even if products vastly changed over the years.
Though the revised statistics cast doubt on the existence of a "productivity revolution" caused by increased use of computers and pared-down work forces, most analysts are confident technology and layoffs have contributed to efficiency.
Analysts point to surging corporate profits. Because competition and consumers have made it hard to raise prices, only better use of labor and raw materials could be responsible for higher profit margins, they say.

Oil Prices Go Over $20 a Barrel As Crude Stockpiles Fall in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged above $20 a barrel yesterday after a report showed that stockpiles in the United States had fallen to their lowest levels since an oil crisis caused gasoline rationing in 1977.
Heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices also rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On other commodities markets, corn and soybean prices advanced after Russia lifted a ban on American chicken imports. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.73 point, to 243.90, its first gain in six sessions. 
 After the market closed on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude stocks fell 2.7 million barrels last week to 297.5 million -- the lowest American stockpile since mid-1977, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries nearly doubled the price of oil.
Most traders had expected stocks to rise by two million barrels.
"We're in a squeaky-tight stock situation," said Tim Evans, an analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, "and consumers are going to feel it."
Crude oil for April delivery rose 65 cents, to $20.19, the highest price for the contract closest to delivery since Feb. 20. The April heating oil contract rose 1.22 cents, to 54.22 cents a gallon, and April unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent, to 59.75 cents a gallon.
American oil refiners have been importing less oil this year and refining for deliveries just in time for use in a bid to cut storage costs.
Corn and soybeans were bolstered after Vice President Al Gore announced that Russia had decided against banning chicken imports from the United States. The ban was to begin March 19. Corn and soybean meal are used in chicken feed.
Traders ignored announcements later in the day that Tyson Foods and Hudson Foods would hold to plans to cut production by 7 percent. Pilgrim's Pride also said it would keep an 8.5 percent production cut.
Most traders viewed the announcements as efforts by the nation's largest chicken processors to force grain and soybean prices lower, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
"It's to their advantage right now not to talk prices up, and nobody is taking what they say at face value," he said.
Corn prices have run up to 15-year highs recently as supply nears 22-year lows. May corn rose 1 cent, to $3.81 a bushel, and May soybeans rose 3 cents, to $7.265 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Piper Jaffray Is Fined Over Data on Fund

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The National Association of Securities Dealers fined the Piper Jaffray Companies $1.25 million yesterday, saying that the firm had sold a mutual fund without fully informing investors that it contained volatile mortgage-backed derivatives.
The settlement, one of the largest in the association's history, comes months after Piper paid $67.5 million to settle lawsuits brought by investors who had contended they were misled about the risks of the fund, Institutional Government Income Portfolio. It was the largest settlement ever disclosed between a mutual fund company and its investors. 
 Piper also agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its mutual fund sales practices. The firm agreed to the fine and disciplinary action without admitting wrongdoing.
Piper, based in Minneapolis, also reached an agreement with the Minnesota Commerce Department, which investigated the fund's marketing. That brought the total to $1.9 million, which included fines, charitable contributions and reimbursement for investigation costs.
The N.A.S.D. said that between 1991 and 1994, Piper recommended and sold the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income Portfolio without telling clients, or disclosing in its advertising and sales literature, that the holdings in mortgage-backed derivatives, and its use of leverage, increased the riskiness of the portfolio.
The fund was begun in 1988 and at first invested primarily in Treasury bonds. Beginning in 1991, it increased its purchases of interest-rate-sensitive mortgage-backed derivatives, the association said.
Those notes gained value in 1993, making the fund one of the top short-term government funds.
As the returns of the fund increased, so did its riskiness as an investment, the association said, and Piper failed to give investors adequate warning about the increased risks. By 1993, derivatives represented 51 percent of the market value of the portfolio.
When interest rates began to rise in early 1994, the value of the fund's mortgage-backed bonds eroded. The fund lost 30 percent of its value in 1994.

Money Keeps Pouring Into Market Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Despite the heavy volatility in the stock and bond markets in February, mutual fund investors remained unshaken, continuing to pour plenty of fresh cash into funds investing here and abroad, according to estimates released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute.
Equity mutual funds recorded an estimated $21 billion of net inflows in February, down from $28.9 billion in January but still the second-largest monthly total ever. The combined $50 billion of net inflows to equity mutual funds in the first two months of this year exceeds by 30 percent the net cash invested in stock funds in all of 1991. 
 Bond funds, meanwhile, recorded estimated net inflows of $1 billion last month. While that figure was down from $4.4 billion in January, it was the eighth consecutive month in which bond funds took in more money from investors than they paid out -- particularly impressive in a month in which long-term interest rates jumped four-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.47 percent.
While mutual fund investors remain steadfast, the stock and bond markets continued the wandering pace they have followed for much of the last four weeks. Stock and bond prices both fell yesterday as investors looked ahead nervously to tomorrow's monthly report of employment statistics, perhaps the single set of data that investors watch most closely for clues about the strength of the economy.
The price of the 30-year Treasury fell nearly a point, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.45 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.65 points, to 5,629.77, its first decline after three consecutive gains. General weakness in technology stocks pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 3.79 points, to 652.00. [Page D8.]
The amount of cash flowing into mutual funds was expected to fall in February from January's extraordinary inflows, because the first month of the year benefits from annual payments to corporate retirement plans and, in many cases, company distributions of yearly bonus checks.
But the fact that last month's inflows to stock funds were the second largest ever confirms that United States investors have maintained an abiding faith in the long-term strength of the market.
To longtime watchers of investment trends, the monthly cash flow data from the Investment Company Institute have taken on an ethereal quality. "Wow!," exclaimed James W. Paulsen, senior managing director of Investors Management Group, a Des Moines investment adviser and money manager. "$50 billion in two months is unheard of."
Indeed, after being repeatedly bombarded with the message that they might not be saving enough for the future, Americans have embraced savings plans so far this year. At the FMR Corporation's Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, sales of individual retirement accounts are 14 times stronger so far this year than in the first two months of 1995, said Robyn Tice, a spokeswoman.
In addition, net inflows to all types of retirement accounts -- I.R.A.'s and 401(k) and 403(b) accounts -- are up more than 70 percent in the first two months of 1996 over a similar period last year, she said. Retirement programs account for about half of all new mutual fund sales at Fidelity.
That behavior is even more impressive considering that much of that money was invested as the stock and bond markets gyrated wildly. The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, gained roughly 200 points in the first two weeks of February, then fell 150 points in the next week. That was followed by a further 150-point gain and another loss of more than 100 points.
The bond market, meanwhile, hardly provided a refuge from the turmoil. Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which also tracks mutual fund flows, noted that several bond sectors recorded net outflows of cash in the last half of February, including high-yield funds, international bond funds and those specializing in mortgage-backed securities.
Investors continued to shuttle some money overseas, where foreign equity markets have, in general, been tracking or outperforming their American counterparts. Inflows to global and international stock funds in February fell slightly from the previous month, said John Rea, chief economist at the institute, which was their biggest month of inflows in two years.
The estimates reported yesterday by the Investment Company Institute are based on a survey of long-term funds that account for about 97 percent of long-term mutual fund assets. Last month, the first under the institute's new format of twice-monthly data release, the trade group's estimates fell 21 percent short of the actual totals, which are reported approximately four weeks after the end of each month.

HEADLINE: Lord Jay, 88, Laborite Gadfly Who Defied Leaders on Europe

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Lord Jay, an iconoclastic British Labor politician and former Cabinet officer who was such a fierce opponent of economic ties with Europe that he railed against Britain's entry into the Common Market even as his own Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was aggressively campaigning for membership, died yesterday at his home in Oxfordshire. He was 88. Known as Douglas Jay until he received a life peerage in 1987, Lord Jay was an Oxford-trained economist who worked for The Economist and other publications before entering politics.
A protege of Clement Atlee, Lord Jay served as his personal assistant when Mr. Atlee became Prime Minister in the Labor sweep of 1945. 
 The next year, at Mr. Atlee's urging, he resigned and won a by-election to the House of Commons from the North Battersea area of central London, a traditionally safe Labor seat he held until his retirement in 1983.
He held two Cabinet posts in the Atlee Government, Economic Secretary and Financial Secretary. Then, after the Conservatives regained power in 1951, he spent 13 years in vocal opposition, becoming closely allied with Hugh Gaitskell, an old school chum who was the leader of the Labor Party until his death.
When Labor returned to office under Wilson in 1964, Lord Jay, who had served in the post in the shadow government, was made Chairman of the Board of Trade, the rough equivalent of the American Secretary of Commerce.
If the Prime Minister was dismayed when Lord Jay spoke out openly and sometimes scathingly against British membership in the Common Market, doing so even on one occasion when Mr. Wilson was on a tour of Europe to promote the idea, he should not have been surprised.
Never one to keep his views to himself, Lord Jay had shocked many of the Labor faithful in 1959, after the party's third successive electoral defeat, when he made an impassioned plea for Labor to drop its traditional support for nationalization of industry and even to change its name to the Democrat Social Party.
Mr. Wilson tolerated his public dissent on the Common Market, at least for a while. But he was abruptly dismissed in 1967 on the ostensible ground that he had turned 60.
Lord Jay was a brisk and highly efficient administrator who generally limited appointments to 30 minutes on the ground that no business should take longer than that. And for all his aversion to international travel, in 1964 he became the first senior government official to visit Communist China.
A tall, gaunt figure in rumpled clothes, he was also something of a darling to the British press, an endearing eccentric of such renowned frugality -- or xenophobia -- that when required to attend meetings in Paris he carried a good English sandwich in a plastic bag rather than submit to French cuisine.
During his years in the Cabinet, Lord Jay's nondescript clothes and ascetic ways were portrayed in stark contrast to the trendy tastes of his twin teen-age daughters, Helen and Catherine, who were photographed so often in Mary Quant miniskirts and Courreges boots they seemed to be the ultimate incarnations of Carnaby Street chic.
The son of a lawyer who gave up his practice to do social work in the East End of London, Lord Jay, who traced his own social leanings to his first sight as a toddler of poor children in tatters, was deeply committed to his version of the socialist ideal.
"Socialists believe in equality as an end," he once wrote. "Any and every human being has as much right as anyone else to whatever gives value to human life."
He was also inconoclastic in his private life. Having told his fiancee that he regarded monogamy as a sin, he proceeded to live up to his own marital ideals during a 39-year-marriage that didn't lead to divorce until 1972, the year he married his secretary, Mary Lavinia Thomas.
In addition to his wife and daughters, he is survived by two sons: Peter, who was Ambassador to the United States in the 1960's, and Martin; and 14 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Maputo Elephant Reserve Journal;
Thinking Big ($800 Million) to Rescue Big Game

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MAPUTO ELEPHANT RESERVE, Mozambique, March 1

 BODY:
In this remote and beautiful corner of the world, representatives of a conservative Louisiana millionaire used to hand American cash to a rebel movement so cruel that it kidnapped children for its assassination squads.
Today, a representative of the same man is handing children little American and Mozambican flags. Mozambique's flag is the only one in the world with an AK-47 assault rifle on it, and the socialist Government the businessman was trying to undermine won the war and the elections two years ago. 
 But that's ancient history. Now James Ulysses Blanchard 3d wants to build an $800 million ecotourist's paradise here in this wilderness of lakes and savannas edged by 60 miles of crystalline sands and Caribbean-blue waters. His plans include a floating casino, thatched game lodges perched high over watering holes, a marina, a golf course with hippos in the water hazards, and an antique steam train that would pull rolling hotels made of Orient-Express-style sleeping cars through herds of noble elephants and leaping antelope.
He may succeed in building his Disney World in the bush. Biologists consulted by the Frelimo Government, his old foe, seem favorably inclined toward his plans for the 4,000-square-mile area. And it may be the only way to save the ecosystem, which the 1992 Rio summit conference on biodiversity named as one of the 200 most remarkable on the planet.
Mozambique's unspoiled coastline, as long as the stretch from Seattle to San Diego, was once the playground for generations of white Rhodesians and South Africans.
Now, after 17 years of destructive civil war, this desperately poor country is helpless to resist the hordes rushing in to exploit its natural wealth and beauty: South African tourists zipping up the beach in Land Rovers, running over the nests of leatherback turtles and plundering the reefs of coral and tropical fish. Dirt-poor war refugees sneaking back in to slash and burn tiny cornfields out of the rare vegetation. Mozambican military officers arrogantly hunting the reserve's last few elephants.
"My budget is $50,000 U.S.," said Mateus Chambal, the director of the elephant reserve, who lives in a half-burned-out compound in the middle of the park and whose near-dead Land Rover leaks water he draws by hand from a well. "It came from American and European organizations because of the biodiversity conference, and it will run out in June. If we don't get more, we will have to abandon the reserve."
The irreplaceable flora of the park is largely intact. But its mega-fauna suffered badly during the war between Frelimo and Renamo. About 500 of the 600 elephants are dead. All the rhino were poached, One local environmentalist claims to have seen the last one mowed down in the dunes by a Cuban helicopter, which then swooped in to saw off the horn. "Pretty much everything else went into people's pots," said Donald Beswick, who runs the Mozambique desk for the Endangered Wildlife Trust. The trust, an environmental organization, doesn't outright endorse the Blanchard plan "but we certainly aren't anti-it," Mr. Beswick said.
Animals are the first step in the five-year plan, which was drawn up by the same consultants who created the Pilanesberg wildlife reserve and Sun City casino complex 100 miles from Johannesburg. The $9 million budget for game restoration reads like a cargo manifest for Noah's Ark: 500 zebras at $500 each plus 30 white rhinos at $21,800 apiece, shipping included, in Year 1, plus assorted giraffes, wildebeest and other animals. In Year 2, the first predators, 10 brown hyena, are to be introduced.
Not until Year 4 does the item that worries the locals appear -- 25 lions at $4,070 apiece. The footnotes remind potential investors that endangered species, including wild dogs and black rhinos (at $58,000 apiece), may be donated, which would save money.
John R. Perrott, the project's general manager in Mozambique, actually wants the first restocking to be of crocodiles in the Maputo River, the area's western boundary. "Great game scouts," he says "Real tough on poachers."
Mr. Perrott, a burly former pipeline engineer and big-game hunter who has worked everywhere from Alaska to Tanzania, has some ideas even more radical than the plan's. He wants to import the last remaining Bushmen from the Kalahari Desert.
"People make fun of me for that," he says. "But I'm not talking about just a tourist attraction. I say let the little guys in and let them hunt. Their homeland in Botswana is being wiped out by cattle fences."
Mr. Blanchard foresees raising the $800 million over at least five years, at first from investors he knows and millionaires who want private homes inside a Big Five game park. Then he hopes to offer stock to emerging market funds and attract hotel chains like Club Med and Sheraton who see potential in a "beast and beach" package. The displaced subsistence farmers and fishermen -- who probably number fewer than 10,000 -- will also get shares of the corporation and first crack at the 12,000 projected jobs as game trackers, construction laborers, chambermaids and the like.
The architect of all this, Mr. Blanchard, is a 52-year-old man of many interests -- prominent among them gold, guns and right-wing politics -- and of unquestionable daring. He buzzed President Richard Nixon's 1973 inauguration in a Cessna trailing a "Legalize Gold" banner. "That was fun," he says. "They flew jets up to chase us out."
The author of "Confessions of a Gold Bug" made his fortune dealing first in gold coins he bought at $35 an ounce, then in newsletters, $1,000-a-head conferences and mutual funds appealing to the kind of investors who gravitate toward hard assets on the assumption that the world is going to hell. Despite being in a wheelchair since a teen-age car accident, he took his 8-year-old son, Anthem (named after the Ayn Rand novel loved by libertarians), on a weeklong flying trip to the North Pole.
He was also part of the circle of rich Americans who helped Oliver North funnel aid to guerrillas they believed were fighting Communism everywhere from Afghanistan to Nicaragua to Angola. Mr. Blanchard supported the Renamo rebels in Mozambique, not with guns, he says, but with radios, medical supplies and cash.
Even though Renamo fought a dirty war, killing whole villages and destroying everything that kept the economy afloat, from power lines to cashew nut farms, Mr. Blanchard defends his support for the rebels. Renamo's leader, Afonso Dhlakama, he said "was a Christian-educated guy in the bush who believed in democracy and anti-Communism and free-market capitalism."
"He was reading a life of George Washington when I met him."
But above all else, Mr. Blanchard is a salesman. In 1991, Forbes magazine cited the Blanchard mutual fund family as an example of funds that did only middling well, often under-performing the market, but made money charging high fees, much of which was spent on direct mail marketing.
"That's the key to this," said Mr. Perrott, who attended several of Mr. Blanchard's investment conferences before meeting him on the North Pole trip. "Jim's got the greatest mailing list in the world."

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds China Guilty of Wide Rights Abuses

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration issued its annual human rights report today, declaring China guilty of "widespread and well-documented human rights abuses," and announced that the United States would again co-sponsor a critical resolution on China at the coming meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The State Department had held out the possibility that better Chinese behavior would be rewarded at the Geneva meeting, which convenes on March 18. But China's human rights record has worsened rather than improved, the Administration said today, making public its annual report on human rights in 194 countries around the world. 
 China has been guilty of human rights abuses including torture, arbitrary detention, coercive family-planning practices and organ transplants from executed prisoners, the report said. Toward the end of 1995, it said, "almost all public dissent against the central authorities was silenced."
In its overview, the report implicitly challenged the Clinton Administration's strategy, supported by many business interests, of strengthening economic ties with China regardless of Beijing's human rights record.
"The experience of China in the past few years demonstrates that while economic growth, trade and social mobility create an improved standard of living, they cannot by themselves bring about greater respect for human rights in the absence of a willingness by political authorities to abide by the fundamental international norms," the report said.
Senior officials were concerned about the release of this sensitive report, delayed because of the Government shutdown over the budget, as they try to improve a difficult relationship with Beijing. In recent months the United States has accused China of violating agreements on the spread of nuclear and missile weapons, of trying to intimidate Taiwanese voters who are electing a President on March 23 and of breaking its pledge to crack down on the flagrant pirating of American music, videos and computer software.
A senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Liu Huaqiu, is now in Washington for talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and other officials charged with finding a consistent policy toward China.
Despite the strong language in today's report, human rights advocates remain critical of Administration policy. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said: "Overall it is an accurate, hard-hitting report, and probably more critical than last year."
"But it underlines the glaring disparity between the Administration's analysis and its policy," he added, calling the overall approach too soft on China.
Although the United States will co-sponsor the human rights resolution in Geneva, Mr. Jendrzejczyk said, the Chinese are pushing Washington not to lobby hard for the resolution, which could lead to its easy defeat when a vote comes in late April. Even John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor who is in charge of compiling these reports, said today the American vote in Geneva would depend on Chinese behavior at the time.
While saying little that American officials have not regularly discussed, these annual human rights reports carry the weight of an American political judgment that many countries, especially in Asia, reject as hypocritical.
In the report Russia was criticized for abuses of human rights in its effort to put down an armed revolt in Chechnya.
The Administration said abuses had decreased in Turkey and in Israel, where the redeployment of most Israeli troops from large areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip had reduced the incidents of abuse. In Turkey, however, the improvement came against "a continuing pattern" of abuses, including restrictions on expression, torture and excessive use of force against the Kurdish population in the battle against terrorism. Similarly, Egypt was criticized for excessive force, including torture and extrajudicial killings, in its campaign against Islamic militants.
There were "familiar patterns of abuse" in countries like Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Indonesia and countries in crisis, like North Korea and the Sudan, the department said.
Over the last 20 years, Mr. Christopher said, the reports also "tell a vivid story of how much the world has changed."
Latin America, he noted, had greatly improved, with a strong movement toward democratization throughout the hemisphere. But displaying how the reports are used for current political purposes, Mr. Christopher sharply criticized Cuba for stifling dissent and shooting down civilian airplanes. He also touched on other countries that he called "rogue states that possess the greatest threat to America's security -- states like Iran, Iraq and Libya -- that are among the greatest violators of human rights." And he mentioned Nigeria and Burma as abusers of human rights as well as protectors of the drug trade.
As the State Department focused today on human rights, Mr. Lake, the national security adviser, gave a speech at George Washington University about America's security challenges in a post-cold war world.
While listing the promotion and defense of democracy, "which enhances our security and the spread of our values," Mr. Lake spent little of his speech discussing human rights. Instead, following the new tone of a Clinton Administration encouraged by its relatively successful use of the American military in Haiti and Bosnia, Mr. Lake concentrated on "the use of force" and "the example of our power," in addition to "the power of our example."
"Until human nature changes," Mr. Lake said, "power and force will remain at the heart of international relations."

HEADLINE: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA;
For Bucknell's Class of '96, Pressure to Focus, and Fast

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LEWISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
Every generation has its pressure cooker. For the Bucknell class of 1970, it was Vietnam and the draft. Lives and goals were transformed as men sought escape from an increasingly unpopular war, or dealt with the prospect of fighting in it.
But while many in the class of 1970 had a hard time even thinking about plans and goals in those chaotic times, the class of 1996 faces the opposite problem: how to avoid being swallowed alive by premature certainty. 
 At Bucknell today, corporate recruiters connect with sophomores and even freshmen, encouraging students -- or pushing them -- to identify goals earlier than the class of 1970 ever imagined. Anxious parents preach practicality. "Focus," as a noun and a verb, sprinkles conversation after conversation, like an early line on one's state of grace, a mark of success or failure to come.
Priscilla Stack is a bright, articulate 21-year-old psychology major from Mendham, N.J., who is distinctly lacking in focus. In 1996, it would seem, that is a serious problem.
There is pressure all around her, she complains, to choose and commit. It comes from friends, from parents, from potential employers, all of them beating the same maddening drum: competition is everywhere. You must dive in and start swimming. Stragglers lose. But what if you just don't know? And what if you choose wrong, plunging into a career only to find yourself trapped later in something you hate?
"Everyone has a direction," Ms. Stack said. "My dad is pounding on my head every time I talk to him. I feel like I have to make some kind of decision and pounce into it, but I just don't know."
Even taking time off to grow up a little more -- one of the great escape hatches for members of the class of 1970 -- seems closed to her. Future employers, she said, might think her a slacker.
"I know it's not good if you take time off after graduation," she said. "It doesn't look like you're very motivated."
For many students, pressures like that have profoundly changed the college experience. The old model of college as a broad intellectual adventure, they say, just does not make as much sense as it did a generation or two before.
"From what I see of the world in general, and especially for people my age, we're a little more realistic about our goals than our parents were," said Karim Abdul-Matin, 21, a biology major from Brooklyn who is planning on a medical career in New York City. "We can't become anything we want anymore. We have a set number of options."
Professors who have seen the shift of generations say the pressure to be practical is so overwhelming that for many students, even choosing a major has become an identity crisis: more than one in five people in the class of 1996 are pursuing two degrees at once.
"English because they love it, economics to get a job," said Marilyn R. Mumford, who has taught English at Bucknell since the late 1950's. This is hardly, she said, a sign of confusion.
"Students today are much more self-conscious," she explained. "They have to ask themselves more questions than the class of 1970 ever did, and I think they have a better total picture of the role of education in their lives."
Corporate recruiters are helping to sharpen that inquiry. Over the last five years, career placement officials here say, companies have dramatically stepped up their efforts, competing for the loyalties of students long before graduation.
An executive at Andersen Consulting, which has become one of the most aggressive of the new-style recruiters, said the change in approach arose from the same cost-cutting and efficiency pressures that drive the downsizing trend. According to Warren J. Dodge, a partner in the firm's New York office, Andersen recruits at fewer colleges than it used to, but focuses on its chosen schools with a new intensity -- grooming and developing potential employees beginning in their sophomore and freshman years, and, for promising minority candidates, even in high school. Mr. Dodge said Andersen tries not to pressure students. Other companies, he said, are the offenders.
"We want to be recognized not as a recruiter, but as a partner," he said.
One senior who is ready to be a partner is Mike Wickerham, a 22-year-old management major from Pittsburgh with a giant American flag on his wall and a firm belief that capitalism is a struggle in which he will prevail.
"I don't know where the country is going as a whole," he said. "But if there are only so many places, I'll have one of them."
Still, there are some rebels.
Alison Zampino would probably have more in common with the 1970 counterculture than with her own class. A psychology major from Belleville, N.J., with a pierced nose and a rough-edged style of dressing that owes nothing to J. Crew, Ms. Zampino, 21, said she is going to San Francisco after graduation with no job and no particular goal except to live in a place that she has heard is nice. She will worry about making a living when she gets there. She has no commitments at this point in her life, and she likes the feeling.
But this is not 1970, and Ms. Zampino is constantly on the defensive about her decision. Some of her classmates suggest that she is lazy, or too rich to care, or cluck that she is wasting her life, throwing away her main chance.
"They get this look," she said, "like, 'You just want to live?' "

Freeing air routes to Japan will help travelers but won't be easy.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AFTER an exchange of hard words last week, Tokyo and Washington apparently inched closer toward agreement on an expansion of air cargo flights across the Pacific. But that is just the overture to the main act: opening tightly restricted passenger service. American, Delta, Continental and Trans World Airlines, along with tourism businesses, have organized a group called Access U.S.-Japan to lobby their cause when President Clinton meets Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Tokyo next month.
A virtuous cause? Of course, said Clifford Winston, a specialist in transportation economics at the Brookings Institution. "The name of the game is serving more travelers at lower fares," he said. 
 But winning will not be simple. By linking the issue to a renegotiation of the treaty rights that United and Northwest now use to fly to Japan and beyond -- rights handed out in 1952, when America called the shots in non-Communist Asia -- Tokyo may be able to divide and conquer the American airline industry.
Under Washington's 44-year-old air pact with Tokyo, two American passenger carriers (Northwest and United, which replaced Pan Am) can fly as often as they like to Japan. They also have "beyond rights" -- the option to pick up passengers in Japan and fly them to third counties. This gives Northwest and United the ability to create hubs in Tokyo that offer one-stop links to the American mainland from a dozen Asian cities.
Washington negotiated limited access to Japan for other carriers in the 1980's, but both Delta and American are champing at the bit for more. And they have assembled an army of supporters from the Boston Chamber of Commerce to the Walt Disney Company.
The prize could be substantial. Dan Kasper of Coopers & Lybrand, the economic consultant for Access U.S.-Japan, estimates that a 25 percent cut in average fares could entice 4.8 million more people a year -- most of them Japanese tourists -- to make the long trip to Disneyland and other Sun Belt destinations.
American visitors to Japan would also get the benefits of the sort of competition that has made leisure travel within America the bargain of middle-class life. And since American carriers operate at lower cost than the Asian airlines, they would presumably hold their own in wide-open skies. So why is Washington apparently reluctant to press for more flights?
For one thing, Mr. Winston said, "the Department of Transportation worries about the airlines, not consumers." And since United and Northwest have no wish to rock the boat, Washington is playing politics as usual, balancing their influence against that of the new coalition.
A more justifiable concern is what Washington will have to give up to get Japan to approve more flights. Japan has made no secret of its opposition to the beyond rights of United and Northwest, which give them a cut of the juicy profits in the tightly controlled intra-Asian market. And it is very likely that Tokyo will insist on a reduction, or at least a guarantee against expansion of these flights, as payment for more competition between Japan and mainland American cities.
The question, then, is how to choose between second-best competitive outcomes when first-best is off the table. Michael E. Levine, executive vice president of Northwest, scoffs at the idea that a freer Japan-American mainland market would make a big dent in average fares. Revenues for a passenger mile, he said, are now only a few percent higher on these routes than on the hotly contested North Atlantic. In any case, he said, expansion of traffic into Japan will be severely limited for the foreseeable future by a shortage of runways at the two big international airports.
Mr. Kasper, by contrast, argues that beyond rights are not worth the fight since most of the beneficiaries are not Americans. And he speculates that longer-range versions of the new Boeing 777 will eventually make it practical for American carriers to bypass Japan and build new Asian hubs in, say, Hong Kong.
The most frustrating aspect of this issue is the anticompetitive reflex of the Japanese Government. Beyond rights, extracted at a time when Japan could not say no, obviously touch a nationalist nerve: Washington would react similarly if Air France proposed service from Chicago to Dallas. Fact is, though, the biggest losers from restraints on both Pacific and intra-Asian flights are the increasingly peripatetic Japanese.
One could even argue that the impulse of Tokyo to protect the Japanese carriers is myopic from its own business-first perspective. For just as Japanese competition eventually drove American auto makers to build better cars at lower cost, wide-open American competition would force Japanese airlines to prepare for the coming free-for-all in global air travel. But don't expect anyone to listen: In Japan, as in America, politics is the art of getting past the next election.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ENDORSEMENT;
Kemp Supports Forbes in Bid to Salvage Flat-Tax Plan as an Issue in the Campaign

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 6

 BODY:
Never has the normally shy and retiring Steve Forbes come as close to gushing as he did here today when he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Jack F. Kemp, the Republican Party luminary Mr. Forbes proudly described as "my guru-in-chief."
As Mr. Kemp endorsed Mr. Forbes's Presidential candidacy one day after Mr. Forbes took a drubbing in Tuesday's primaries -- six third-place finishes and a second-place finish in Connecticut -- the admiration flowed both ways between these pitchmen for the hope-growth-and-opportunity wing of the Republican Party. 
 "I want these issues to go forward and I believe Steve is a candidate of ideas and I'm endorsing those ideas here today," said Mr. Kemp, a former Congressman from Buffalo who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration.
By Mr. Kemp's own admission, his better-late-than-never endorsement of Mr. Forbes's Presidential candidacy has as much to do with his determination to rescue the flat-tax message as it does with rescuing the messenger.
As he campaigns with Mr. Forbes in Florida, Texas, California and other states with big delegate prizes, Mr. Kemp argues that his role will be to help Mr. Forbes accomplish a goal they have in common: to salvage the flat tax idea and to present it at the San Diego convention in August as an idea whose time has come.
Their joint devotion to this mission was underscored by Mr. Forbes, who turned aside questions that he was about to drop out of the race because of his poor showing in Tuesday's balloting.
"A lot of you thought that I was going to be ready to throw in the towel," Mr. Forbes said today. "And I stated unequivocally the issues and principles of this campaign are bigger than a single candidate, bigger than the campaign, and therefore I was in for the duration."
The Forbes-Kemp alliance at this late stage of the compressed primary season suits the agendas of both men.
"They are trying to make sure the whole idea of a flat tax is not destroyed by Steve Forbes's candidacy," said Eddie Mahe, a Washington-based political consultant. "Jack wants the opportunity to go out and reframe the issue." He said Mr. Kemp was too good a politician to believe that his getting in this late would stop Bob Dole.
By coming to the aid of Mr. Forbes, even this late in the primary season game, Mr. Kemp can send Mr. Dole a message. Endorsing Mr. Forbes is a "symbolic gesture presumably driven by Jack's exasperation with the Dole campaign for attacking the flat tax," said William Kristol, the top editor at the conservative Weekly Standard and a former aide to Vice President Dan Quayle.
"What encouraged me to get into the campaign," Mr. Kemp said, "was the fear that the Republican Party was going into 96-slash-97 without the vigor, dynamism, growth, inclusiveness issue I believe Steve stands for."
The ties between Mr. Kemp and Mr. Forbes go beyond their shared views on supply-side economics. Both have been involved in Empower America, a conservative research organization in Washington that has served as a base for Mr. Kemp. In response to a question at their joint news conference today, Mr. Forbes said he had made a contribution to the group before entering the Presidential race that was "less than six figures." The group has been a vehicle for Mr. Kemp's views on urban policy and the economy and on influencing the direction of the Republican Party.

HEADLINE: Reject Myths;
On Trade With Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, March 3) perpetuates myths about United States trade with Japan. First is that Japan is particularly closed to United States exporters. Japan has been the second-largest market for United States products after Canada. The United States runs a trade deficit with Japan because Americans like Japanese products. 
 A second myth is that the United States can solve its economic problems by focusing on trade balances with individual countries. While the overall trade balance is a concern, balance with a particular country is of no economic consequence.
A third myth is that trade protectionism affects trade balances. Given investment and savings, protection reduces exports by the same amount it reduces imports. Reducing the United States trade deficit requires the painful steps of raising United States savings or reducing investment.

HEADLINE: Scenes of Rebirth at the Mall;
New Stores for Juniors Succeed by Moving Quickly

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Resnick, an asset management firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. "If you've made a mistake, mark it down and get it out of there. Merry-Go-Round kept denying this strategy and building inventory, and it killed them." The company went out of business this year.
Wet Seal/Contempo, a survivor of the 1980's shakeout, is trying to avoid the problems of Merry-Go-Round. Wet Seal started in 1962 as a bathing-suit company and became a big hit with teen-agers in the mid-1980's before falling on hard times in the early 1990's because of a bad mix of fashions and the troubled economy. 
 After losing more than $1 million in the fiscal year that ended in January 1995 -- and with the company's stock down to $6.75 from a peak of $18 in March 1991 -- Wet Seal executives say they concluded that to seize the juniors market, they needed to make faster decisions about fashion.
First, though, they moved to neutralize one of their main competitors by buying the 238-store Contempo Casuals chain last summer from the Neiman Marcus Group for $1 million in Wet Seal stock and renaming the company Wet Seal/Contempo. Analysts say that Neiman Marcus, which is owned by Harcourt General Inc., let the chain go cheaply because it wanted to unload it quickly and make sure it fell into the hands of a company dedicated to keeping it open.
Kathy Bronstein, who became Wet Seal/Contempo's chief executive in 1992, had instituted a policy of micro-managing inventory from the top. She was able to carry the policy through the following year, when Edward Thomas was hired as chief operating officer and she turned her attention away from the books and toward merchandising. "I sign every order that goes out of this company," she said. "Right down to the last earring.
"We'll take a runway trend and translate it quickly," she added. "We don't test and reorder. We buy and we move on to the next thing."
With the acquisition of Contempo, Wet Seal roughly tripled the number of its stores, to 364 in 34 states, and its revenues, to $103 million in the fiscal year that ended in January from $36 million a year earlier. In its fiscal third quarter, which ended in October 1995, earnings reached 15 cents a share, up from 2 cents a share in the comparable period a year earlier. The company's shares closed yesterday on Nasdaq at $10.625.
The acquisition increased the company's clout with suppliers, which is critical for fashion retailers who need such leverage to get large orders quickly as trends change. And they change fast. Cigarette pants, with their skinny legs, were all the rage last fall, for example, but yards had barely been raked before women switched en masse to low-slung hip huggers.
Another way that some companies are setting themselves apart from the crowd is in tailoring their products to local customs. The Rampage Clothing Company, a popular Southern California chain started in 1982 by Larry Hansel, a 21-year-old entrepreneur with a chunk of cash he had saved by detailing cars, plans to move into new markets this year, starting with New Jersey. But its guiding principle is to move with great deliberation, and with an eye toward matching its merchandise to regional tastes and traditions.
"In each market we learn about the psychographic mix," said Nancy Mamann, the marketing director for Rampage. "Like in Texas, those are meat-and-potato girls. We're not going to give them mini T-shirts."
Margaret A. Gilliam, a retail analyst at CS First Boston, said this might be a good way to increase profit margins. "In the 80's, there was no regional assortment," she said. "Everything was rubber-stamped. But if you assort yourself right for each market you're in, you'll be right on color and sizes and end up with fewer markdowns."
Rampage, like Wet Seal, is also trying to expand its customer base by aiming at slightly older women, those in their 20's and 30's. Executives at both companies said they did not think of the junior market as simply an age category.
For this approach to succeed, there needs to be a distinct fashion message to relay.
In the early 1990's, the fashion industry did not quite know what to do with an anti-fashion fashion called "grunge" that started in Seattle's coffee shops and soon captivated the nation's youth. In essence, it involved wearing old shirts, which appeared to have been reserved for painting the garage, on dinner dates. Seventh Avenue attempted to turn this trend into actual lines -- and few people bought them. The failure of that merchandising effort was a blow to the entire retail industry.
But finally, there are colors and specific looks to knock off.
Rampage and Wet Seal/Contempo stores feature things like coats that imitate the style of the Italian designer Gianni Versace and Gucci hip-huggers. There are also lots of outfits for career women, like a short black bolero jacket or a neatly fitted pistachio-green blouse. On a recent Sunday afternoon, lines were long at the cash register at a Rampage store in Beverly Hills, and big purple chairs were filled with fathers and boyfriends who sat sullenly in waiting, nodding occasional approval at a floral dress or a pair of loafers.
"It's young and inexpensive," said Daniella Akka, 20, a student. "The Limited is not as hip. Not as trendy."
Like Wet Seal, Rampage is expanding. It acquired the troubled Judy's chain for $2 million in 1993, adding 28 stores to its roster of 12 Rampage stores and six Friends shops, which offer Rampage miniskirts and trendy shirts for the pre-teen set. But it is growing more deliberately than many of the big chains that ran into trouble after adding a dozen stores in each market indiscriminately, year after year. It plans to have 65 stores by the end of the year.
Mr. Hansel, the founder, is a bit of a fanatic about moving the most up-to-date styles onto the racks, but in small enough numbers that they will sell quickly. Markdowns have been the downfall of the apparel trade over the last few years, and by keeping the fashions in demand and inventory tight, vanishing margins can be restored.
"You can't just put more and more garments on the floor and mark them down," he said. "We realized that the way to survive was to attract more customers with fashion and life style rather than price."
Mr. Hansel isn't content with just jazzing up his shelves with the latest styles. He also wants to inspire his employees with the latest empowerment nostrums. To that end, he requires them to read the best-selling how-to-succeed manual "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People," by Stephen R. Covey, and keeps a library of similarly inspirational guides at his corporate headquarters. "We encourage people to become more spiritual," he said in an interview in his spacious downtown Los Angeles office, cluttered with spiritual tomes as well as posters of women's legs.
Rampage is also trying to gain leverage from its role as a supplier and a retailer. It makes several lines for department stores, as well as items exclusively for its mall stores.
Rampage now does about a quarter of a billion dollars in business annually, and recently it decided it was time to hire a chief financial officer, in preparation for an initial public offering this year, Mr. Hansel said.
Other regional companies rolling out fashion-smart stores, but slowly, include the Gadzooks Inc. chain, based in Dallas, with 126 stores in 21 states, and Buckle Inc., based in Kearney, Neb., with 167 outlets in 22 states, analysts said.
"Most of these organizations are very lean today," said Walter F. Loeb, who has his own retail consultancy in New York. "With fewer players, the ones who are left are going to be real winners.
"I really believe that juniors are going to lead the trends in fashions now."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Change Little in New York Region

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
In a further indication of the local economy's continued sluggishness, monthly unemployment rates in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region were virtually unchanged over the same period last year, according to Labor Department figures released yesterday.
The January unemployment rate in New York State, for example, was 6.2 percent, compared with 6.1 percent a year earlier. 
 In New Jersey, the January 1996 unemployment rate was 6.5 percent, down slightly from the 6.8 percent a year earlier.
In Connecticut, the rate was unchanged: 5.3 percent in January 1996 and January 1995.
"The economy simply doesn't have the momentum to make a reduction in the ranks of the unemployed," said John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
"You are also seeing the same type of picture nationally, where there has been little change in the unemployment rate since the spring."
The national unemployment rate for January was 5.8 percent, in line with its range of 5.6 to 5.8 percent since the spring.
According to the monthly report, New York City's unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in January, compared with 7.2 percent a year earlier. But Mr. Wieting pointed out that the January 1995 rate was the year's low, and he said the city's unemployment rate has been in the 8 percent range since July.
Mr. Wieting said, "In an economy such as this region's, which had a huge downturn in jobs from 1989 to 1992 and has lagged in recovery, part of the lower unemployment rate reflects that we haven't had substantial growth in the labor force, people actively in the job market."

Little Change For Treasuries As Gains Melt

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, paring early gains made on a report showing a rise in weekly jobless claims.
Market participants limited their buying yesterday, preferring to await today's employment report for February. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 4/32 , to 9330/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.46 percent, from 6.45 percent on Wednesday. But prices of some shorter-term maturities rose.
"A combination of surprisingly strong January manufacturing data and nervousness ahead of Friday's payrolls report managed to undermine the Treasury market's new-found optimisim," said Carroll J. Delaney, director of research for Sties, O'Donnell & Company.
He said yearly statistical reconciliations might push the recent sluggish new jobs data sharply higher,
Bond prices rose in early trading after the Labor Department reported that the number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 6,000 last week, to 363,000, after declining by 25,000 the previous week. The report pointed to continued weakness in the economy, bolstering hopes for a cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
But the market then "elected to hunker down in the bunker until the smoke clears on Friday morning," Mr. Delaney said.
Economists expect today's employment report will show, on average, an increase of 326,000 jobs to the nation's payrolls. Still, economists' forecasts for the payrolls number range from 275,000 to as high as 450,000.
Mr. Delaney said the market would be looking at the averaging of the January and February payroll numbers. The market, he said, is nervous about any upward revision for January, which showed a decline of 200,000 jobs, a drop attributed largely to severe winter storms.
"If the number comes in lower than expected, with a gain of 300,000 or less, then the market will likely be encouraged, particularly the short end, because the weakness raises the odds for further interest rate cuts by the Fed," he said.
If the data come in higher, he said, that raises the average number of jobs created and almost virtually kills any chance of a rate cut this month.
In other economic reports yesterday, the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, said its index of leading economic indicators fell five-tenths of 1 percent in January. But the decline was primarily weather related, some analysts said.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said the January decline by itself was not meaningful because of a blizzard.
"But the decline since the beginning of last year certainly suggest that there is potential for problems in the economy," he said. "While the economy may not be about to turn down, it clearly isn't running on all cylinders. That's why we expect the Fed to lower interest rates this year."

HEADLINE: In America;
A Job Myth Downsized

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Like a hit tune played incessantly on top-40 radio, we keep hearing that technological advances, especially computers, are throwing wages out of whack and otherwise making life miserable for American workers. It's a sad song. It tells us that the job crunch and the growing inequality in wages are, to a great extent, the natural result of the demand in a high-tech economy for highly educated, highly skilled workers. The dopes who can't cope are necessarily left behind.
"Once you lay out the hypothesis, it suggests certain pieces of evidence you ought to be able to find," said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
 You would expect, for example, increased job opportunities for highly skilled, highly educated white-collar workers. And you would expect to see increases in the absolute wages of those who work with computers, the folks with the technical skills that supposedly are so highly prized.
"Neither of those pieces of evidence is there," said Mr. Bernstein, who, with his E.P.I. colleague, Lawrence Mishel, has been studying the impact of technology on wage and employment trends.
Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Mishel believe the impact has been overstated. If high-tech workers are experiencing any sort of boom, they are keeping it carefully concealed.
"We are seeing wage declines for the vast majority of workers," said Mr. Mishel. "Workers in every industry you look at, including those that are the most technologically advanced, have been losing ground."
Common sense tells us that technology has had some effect. Newspaper printers have gone the way of the buffalo, and telephone operators are not far behind. Children chatter on the Internet and automatic teller machines are ubiquitous. But technology has always displaced workers, and it has always demanded more highly skilled workers. What Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Mishel are finding is that technology is entering the workplace at roughly the same rate that it always has. There has been no surge in technology, no technological shock, that has coincided with the sharp increase in wage inequality that began in 1979 and has not let up.
Those who argue that there is some kind of panacea in simply upgrading the skills of the technologically inept are deluded. The most startling thing about the so-called downsizing phenomenon is the high level of talent that is being shown the door.
The United States already has the best-educated work force in the world. Twenty-five percent of all workers are college graduates. But no amount of college or sophisticated technical training has provided an adequate defense for workers in an era when nearly all of the workplace clout rests with the corporate powers that be.
Since 1979 the corrosive shadow of falling wages and underemployment has crept from one socioeconomic group to another -- from the low-skilled and least educated to those with high school diplomas to those with some college, and now those with degrees and high levels of technological skill.
Many factors were involved, including the downward tug of a devalued minimum wage, the drastic weakening of labor unions, the continuing effects of globalization and the shift to service employment, and the impact of immigration, legal and illegal.
But hovering over all of that was the ability of corporations to squeeze profits out of the wages of workers who, battered from many directions, felt powerless.
Said Mr. Mishel, "If everyone is afraid that the job they now have is the best job they can get, because if they lose it they go to a worse job, then no one -- white-collar worker, blue-collar worker, union or nonunion -- is able to put any pressure on the employer."
It is not a skills deficit that is killing the American worker, it's the wholesale loss of clout. Fearful workers are quietly taking whatever employers dish out. And employers are dishing out lower wages, fewer benefits and no security. Productivity improvements, like all other benefits, go automatically to the corporate side of the table, where they are turned into profits. There is no longer any need to spread the wealth. The folks at the top of the pyramid, at least for the time being, have won.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Fraying of Hope

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Newspapers are an imperfect in strument. But at their best their rare best -- they can illuminate a profound problem that society has not perceived or understood. That is what The New York Times is doing this week in a series of extended articles called "The Downsizing of America."
The series has put human faces on those large, abstract figures of jobs eliminated at AT&T, the Chase Manhattan Bank and so many other companies. It has shown us not just individual pain but the social consequences of the ruthless new economy: the loss of community, the rootless family, the fraying of hope. 
 Here is James E. Sharlow, a $130,000-a-year plant manager for Eastman Kodak, 26 years with the company until he was laid off six months before he would have been entitled to a full pension. Or here is Steven A. Holthausen, once a $50,000-a-year bank officer, now a $12,000 tourist guide whose wife and children left him as a loser.
Some of the stories of ruined lives brought tears to my eyes. But the people described did not seek sympathy; they struggled to survive. And the point is not a sentimental one.
Since 1979, more than 43 million jobs have been lost in this country. More new ones have been created. But middle-class people have been laid off in larger numbers than before, and the new jobs tend to be lower-paid. A generation ago most of those laid off got other work that paid as well; today two-thirds work for less.
The struggle to stay in the middle class exacts a high price. Husbands live 1,000 miles from their families because that is where a job is. A highly skilled machinist, confronting the fact that this layoff is permanent, goes without health insurance for his family.
A particularly significant phenomenon is the weakening of community life -- of the private associations that everyone from de Tocqueville on has seen as a crucial factor in American society. People desperate for work do not have the time or the will to volunteer for churches or Boy Scouts or the United Way. Fewer and fewer people feel attached to any community.
The Times series should provoke fresh reflection on where our society is going in a world driven by market economics. What social and economic policies might reduce the damage to individuals and communities?
One thing seems plain. We cannot look to the magic of the market for solutions. A culture provides the values of community and caring; if the society does not supply them, the market certainly will not. If the society does, the market adjusts to them; thus Japanese companies have resisted layoffs despite several years of recession.
In the whirling economy of America today, hardly anyone can expect lifetime employment with a single company. It follows that people cannot look to companies for lifetime security -- health care, for example. But people must have that security in order to move from one job to another with a degree of confidence.
Government has to act to provide the needed assurance. That is why Congress is working on a proposal to make health insurance portable -- to guarantee that someone laid off in San Diego will not be turned down by the insurance company at his new job in Chicago because of a pre-existing condition.
Another evident need is to boost economic growth -- to overcome Alan Greenspan's shibboleth that anything more than 2.25 percent growth a year would be dangerously inflationary. And if we want to avoid the menace of social resentment, we must reverse the trend of enriching the very rich -- the trend that has seen the C.E.O.'s of some major American corporations go from 35 times the wage of the average worker 20 years ago to compensation that is today 187 times the average wage.
The irony is that we are confronted with these daunting new social and economic realities at a moment when the American public has had dinned into it the notion that government is evil and should be dismantled. The new realities are a dispositive answer to Gingrichism. We need a much bigger government commitment to education. We need more college scholarships, not fewer.
There must be, there will be government responses to the social costs of downsizing. Pat Buchanan has offered his unconvincing solution: Build tariff walls around the country. Will President Clinton offer better ideas?

HEADLINE: Several New Reports Give A Mixed View of Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Several new statistics gave a mixed reading on the economy today, as economists awaited the Labor Department's employment report on Friday.
Despite the January blizzard in the Northeast, consumers added to installment debt at a hefty annual pace of 12.1 percent in January, the Federal Reserve reported. This compared with a rate of 11.6 percent in December, revised upward from a 9.3 percent rate estimated a month ago. 
 The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, calculated that its index designed to signal turning points in the business cycle dropped five-tenths of 1 percent in January as the blizzard shrank the length of the average workweek to its lowest point in more than 12 years.
Still another report found that first-time claims for unemployment insurance climbed 6,000 in the week ended Saturday, retracing about a quarter of the preceding week's improvement.
Analysts said the latest data provided little solid information about the state of the economy, which they said seemed to be grinding out further meager gains.
"They suggest to me that we're still in the doldrums, especially the manufacturing sector," commented Evelina M. Tainer, chief economist at Indosuez Carr Futures in Chicago. "We're going to have a soft, sluggish first half and a rebound in the second half," she predicted, with total output expanding an average of 1.3 percent at an annual rate through mid-year and 2.8 percent thereafter.
The installment debt compilation, once regarded as a quite useful indicator of consumer behavior, is now denigrated by many analysts because of the rise of home equity loans, which are not included, and the increased use of credit cards for convenience rather than as a means to borrow. Moreover, the series does not show extensions or repayments, only the net change in the amount outstanding.
Still, analysts said, the economy is unlikely to be at risk of a significant downturn so long as installment debt continues to rise at double-digit annual rates. Revolving, or credit card, debt rose at a 16.1 percent pace in January, the fastest since June, today's report showed, while automobile credit slowed to a 9.3 percent rate of increase from 14.4 percent in December.
Interest rates on new car loans averaged 9.74 percent, down sharply from 10.52 in December.
The category of "other" debt, which includes loans for boats, college or vacations, expanded at a 9.8 percent pace compared with 2.1 percent in December, the Fed reported.
"The consumer's balance sheet is not yet as overextended as it was in the late 1980's," Joseph Liro, economist at Wood Gundy, advised clients last Friday. "Therefore we believe the consumer can sustain at least a moderate pace of spending through 1996."
The sizable decline in the recently privatized index of leading indicators, which has also lost esteem over the last several years, had little effect today not only because most of its components have been previously reported but also because of the blizzard's overwhelming effect in shrinking the workweek.
Excluding the workweek item, the index would have edged up one-tenth of 1 percent instead of falling five-tenths of 1 percent, the Conference Board said. Nonetheless, the index has moved lower in four of the latest five months and eight of the latest 12.
After the workweek, negative impacts were generated by lower building permits, a decline in consumer expectations, a rise in first-time jobless claims, quicker deliveries by suppliers and lower stock prices.
Positive contributions came from a rise in unfilled factory orders for durable goods (also reflecting the blizzard), higher prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, more orders to factories for consumer goods and a slightly expanded money supply.
The companion index of coincident indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in January after rising that much in December, while the index of indicators that tend to move only after the economy at large was unchanged in January after rising three-tenths of 1 percent in December.
The Labor Department's report on jobless claims listed 363,000 last week, up from 357,000 in the Feb. 24 week, with the four-week average inching down by 1,000 to stand at 370,750. Some analysts found signs of marginal labor market improvement in recent claims figures but there was little correlation between them and the monthly figures to be published Friday.

Dollar Rallies Against the Mark But Ends Lower in Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar edged lower yesterday on profit taking after an overnight rally fed by signs of German economic weakness.
The dollar surged to a five-week high against the German mark in Asian and European trading, bolstered by a report showing the German economy shrank by five-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995. That report fueled rising speculation that Germany would soon cut official interest rates, which would enhance the relative value of United States assets. 
 Hints of rate cuts by the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, also spurred dollar buyers.
"The rally in the dollar against the mark was predicated on the bad economic figures in Germany and anticipation of rate cuts," said Michael Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at the Refco Group.
By comparison, the American economy looks far stronger, and traders eagerly awaited today's employment report for February for confirmation of that view.
The Federal Reserve has reduced United States short-term interest rates three times since last July, but a strong gain in the number of jobs being added to payrolls may delay any further monetary easing.
"If the U.S. is not going to cut rates and Europe is, there's a fundamental reason to see movement into the dollar," Mr. Malpede said.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4763 German marks from 1.4770 marks on Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 105.25 Japanese yen, down from 105.40 yen. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5295.
The dollar's advance failed to cross a key technical level at 1.4850 marks, which encouraged many investors to book profits rather than risk big losses should the currency sell off after the payrolls data.
"The fact that we tested, but did not fly through that level just gave the market the opportunity to lock something in ahead of the employment numbers," said Jim Blackwelder, vice president for corporate foreign exchange at NatWest New Jersey.
But most market activity revolved around the mark and its performance against currencies in Europe and Japan. The dollar remains a secondary trading concern, dealers said.
"It's been weak currencies that have been taking the dollar higher, rather than the market getting convinced that the tide has turned and the dollar should be making higher levels," Mr. Blackwelder said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Decision on Mexico Drugs Draws Opposition in Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Angered by President Clinton's decision to declare Mexico a cooperative partner in the war on drugs, lawmakers in the House and Senate are trying to overturn the decision on the ground that Mexico has done little to shut down the huge pipelines for cocaine and other illegal narcotics that stretch across the border into the United States.
A House International Relations panel summoned top Administration counternarcotics officials to Capitol Hill today to defend Mr. Clinton's decision. At the hearing, Republican lawmakers sounded incredulous as they cited reports that more than two-thirds of the cocaine used in the United States flows through Mexico. 
 "When you see that 65 to 70 percent of the cocaine coming into this country is coming in through Mexico or from Mexico, at that particular time it would make one wonder as to what extent the Mexican Government is cooperating with us," said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican of Florida and a sponsor of the legislation disapproving of Mr. Clinton's decision on Mexico.
The proposed legislation reflects a deep strain of discontent among lawmakers who say that the Administration has adopted a unjustifiably lenient approach toward Mexico and other countries. For some Republicans the issue is a potential campaign theme charging that Mr. Clinton has put international trade and foreign policy goals ahead of the battle against drugs.
So far the Administration does not appear worried by the maneuvering in Congress. Today, Robert S. Gelbard, the top narcotics control official at the State Department, said Mexico has begun to show signs of progress under President Ernesto Zedillo.
Since Friday, when the White House announced its list of countries that are cooperating in efforts to combat illegal narcotics, a growing number of lawmakers have criticzed the decision on Mexico.
Many said that, narcotics issues aside, the Administration decided it could not find Mexico as uncooperative because such a step would have caused deep friction with a major trading partner and the recipient of a $20 billion American aid package to support the plunging peso.
Technically, Mr. Clinton made the decision under a law that requires the President to compile a report each year on which countries are trying to combat drug trafficking. The President can either certify a country as cooperative or decertify it, which can lead to economic sanctions.
Mr. Shaw's legislation would overturn Mr. Clinton's certification, a step that would force Mr. Clinton to repeat the entire certification process for Mexico or suspend economic aid to Mexico. Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate by Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican of New York.
President Clinton's decision followed weeks of fierce internal discussion over Mexico and Colombia, officials said today. The outline of the final decision was reached on Feb. 28 at a White House meeting with Presidential aides and top officials from the Departments of Justice, Treasury and State.
During these deliberations, the Mexican Government sent Clinton Administration officials a private note promising more aggressive efforts on narcotics issues, support for legislation against organized crime and money laundering, and swift enactment of the laws once they are passed.
The officials were unanimous in their support for certifying Mexico, but were convinced that a lenient gesture toward Mexico should be accompanied by stringent measures elsewhere, for example, in Colombia. Mr. Clinton decertified Colombia, which meant a cutoff of most American economic aid.

HEADLINE: Power Talks for Long Island

 BODY:
Obedient to Gov. George Pataki's initiative, the Long Island Power Authority, a New York State agency, has voted to open negotiations with the Long Island Lighting Company over a state takeover that could give some relief to Islanders, burdened with the highest utility rates in the continental United States. The decision is an important step but one that leaves wide open all the complex questions about Lilco's future.
The Governor's plan is to dismantle Lilco by selling its generators and gas facilities to other companies and holding its transmission and distribution lines in state hands so as to qualify for tax benefits that would lower rates by 12 percent. That much of the plan makes financial sense, but it would still leave Long Island with the highest electricity rates outside Hawaii. 
 The plan has acquired some hopeful if wary supporters in recent weeks. The Long Island Association, representing civic and business interests, has posed hard questions but applauds the momentum toward energy relief. Consumer and environmental groups are going along, pressing for new economies from technology and fuel conservation. Nassau and Suffolk counties retain their strong differences over the plan's tax consequences and how some of the rate relief should be allocated.
Negotiations will be tricky. Unless the plan can produce savings beyond the projected tax benefits, the result might not be worth the huge effort.

Russian Shepherd of Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 7

 BODY:
When Dmitri V. Vasiliev was a student of Marxist economics, he was taught that the stock market was a casino for the super-rich.
"They stressed it served a narrow circle and was not in the interests of the broad masses of people," Mr. Vasiliev recalled with a smile. 
 Today, with an eye on those broad masses, he has a new passion: creating Russia's first mutual funds.
As the 32-year-old head of Russia's version of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the former Marxist is now an unabashed advocate of free markets. And he sees mutual funds as the key to building capitalism, energizing the anemic stock market and helping Russia raise the money that is badly needed for investment.
With many Russians deeply distrustful of investment schemes and the stock market experiencing growing pains, Mr. Vasiliev has his work cut out. But the potential payoff, he insists, is great.
According to Government estimates, Russians are sitting on at least $20 billion in household savings. And Mr. Vasiliev figures that if 10 percent or so could be drawn into the stock market, this could help the economy exceed foreign investment in Russia last year.
"There is a huge supply of money, including hard currency, for which there is no use," Mr. Vasiliev said. "It is money kept under the pillow or bed, as we say."
With his banker's business suit and studious manner, Mr. Vasiliev looks out of place in Russia's cut-throat political scene. By his own admission, it has been a long, strange trip.
As a student in St. Petersburg, Mr. Vasiliev was a confirmed Marxist. But as the cold war wound down, he began to study Western economics on his own.
Mr. Vasiliev served as a key aide to Anatoly B. Chubais, the free-market advocate, who rose to the rank of first deputy prime minister before being ousted in January by President Boris N. Yeltsin.
When Russia established its Federal Commission on Securities and the Capital Market in 1994, Mr. Vasiliev became the deputy chairman and executive director under Mr. Chubais, who served as chairman.
Now, with the Communists riding high in the polls, this is not the most auspicious time to be an economic reformer. Mr. Yeltsin's attempt to distance himself from controversial economic changes, and Mr. Chubais's departure, have led some to wonder if Mr. Vasiliev will be among the next casualties in Russia's political wars.
Still, he soldiers on. "I can say that my work was and is supported by the Prime Minister," Mr. Vasiliev said.
Even without the political considerations, his task would not be easy. With a capitalization of about $20 billion, the Russian stock market is tiny compared with that of major markets in the United States.
Mr. Vasiliev's commission completed a plan in December to protect investors' rights, which is still awaiting Mr. Yeltsin's signature. Some key elements, such as the strengthening of the law on securities fraud, require legislative approval.
Another big problem is attracting money from small Russian investors. Not only do they face prohibitively expensive brokerage fees and red tape, but also pyramid schemes -- like the one at the investment company MMM, have made investing synonymous with scandal for many Russians.
"The capital market today is imbalanced," said Bernard Sucher, managing director of Troika Dialog, an investment bank and brokerage dealer. "If you are a small Russian investor, there is no way of accessing the securities market here."
The scarcity of Russians willing to take the risks has made the market overly dependent on wary foreign investors.
"The market in Russia today moves on foreign money deciding to come or leave," said Christopher Smart, director of research for Pioneer First Voucher, which is planning to start a mutual fund. "Economically, the real long-term hope for this market lies in mobilizing domestic capital."
And this is where mutual funds come in. Last summer, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree authorizing the creation of the funds, leaving Mr. Vasiliev to create the regulatory structure. Mr. Vasiliev hopes to issue licenses for the first mutual funds before the country's presidential election in June.
The funds are to be of two types: open, meaning that they are required to redeem shares within 15 days of a request, and interval, which will be obliged to redeem shares at least once a year. Foreigners will be able to invest in the funds.
Among the companies planning to set up mutual funds are Pioneer First Voucher, in which the Boston-based Pioneer Group has a controlling interest.
Other applicants include Russian investment groups like Asko-Kapital as well as Dubna, whose management includes former nuclear scientists. Major Russian banks and brokerage companies, like Troika Dialog, also plan to set up funds.
Mr. Vasiliev hopes to rehabilitate failed investment schemes and turn them into respectable mutual funds. But his commission has received only five applications from such unlicensed companies, and only one, Russki Dom Selengo, has been given temporary permission to proceed.
Some skeptics say the Government has been moving too slowly.
"There has been a lot of noise around this idea of mutual funds, but no result so far," said Sergei Skatershchikov, president of Skate Press, a financial data and research company. "In the short period, I do not really expect this industry to develop."
But other specialists argue that Russian stocks are undervalued and that Russians do not have a lot of investment alternatives. Even so, much may depend on politics.
"If the Communists win, I think Western investors will treat Russia quite cautiously, and there will be less domestic investment," Mr. Vasiliev said. "Our Communists are not Polish Communists. They are worse."
But, characteristically bullish, he quickly moved away from that thought. "If the elections have success, and I believe in Yeltsin's victory, we can expect a significant development of the market in the fall of 1996," Mr. Vasiliev said.

HEADLINE: Organized Labor's Hope for a Comeback

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When AT&T announced in January that it would lay off 40,000 employees, the company's biggest union, the Communications Workers of America, had not been given a clue. But when another telephone company, Nynex, wanted to sharply cut costs, the union agreed to use its influence with state regulators only after signing a contract that preserved the jobs of nearly all of Nynex's 40,000 blue-collar workers.
In today's economic climate, with labor on the defensive almost everywhere, the AT&T decision was routine. So was the Nynex example a fluke? Or does it offer a model for other unions struggling to cope with economic forces that have made job insecurity and stagnant wages exemplars of the current era? 
 While New York is a special case, the once-mighty House of Labor sees deals like that between Nynex and its workers as its best hope for rebuilding its crumbling structure.
Only last year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the umbrella group for most unions, turned to an insurgent candidate, John J. Sweeney of the Service Employees. Mr. Sweeney, acknowledging that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. itself shares blame for labor's decline, has vowed to move away from its Washington offices and resort hotels to reach the workers of the new economy.
"Our message to American workers is simple but powerful," Mr. Sweeney said in December. "Whether you wear a blue collar, a white collar, a new collar, or no collar, we can help you make your job better."
But labor faces an uphill fight. As recently as the early 1980's, A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions still represented about 25 percent of the total work force. Today, they are under 15 percent.
The decline has been feeding on itself. Management has crippled the strike, once organized labor's strongest weapon, by threatening to dismiss strikers and by continuing to operate with replacement workers. Well into the 1970's, unions conducted hundreds of major strikes a year. Last year, there were 31.
And it is not clear how successful unions can be in swimming against the economic tides. "Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank announce a merger that will put 12,000 people out of work -- and their stock goes up," Mr. Sweeney complained. "Does a rising tide now sink most ships -- except for the luxury yachts?"
Under Mr. Sweeney, unions are trying to develop new weapons.The idea is to apply pressure on a company's lifelines -- customers, suppliers and government regulators.
Two years ago, Nynex agreed to refrain from using three everyday downsizing tools -- demotions, forced transfers and large-scale layoffs. The union also worked out generous early retirement terms for 2,500 workers.
What made the deal possible, Jan Pierce, a vice president of the local C.W.A., said, was its ability to influence the New York State Public Service Commission, which sets telephone rates. "We made it clear that if they wanted help in the commission," Mr. Pierce said, "they had to respond to our issues, and that meant no layoffs."
Hoping to apply similar leverage elsewhere, Mr. Sweeney sought a moratorium on layoffs and wage cuts at Kaiser Permanente, the big health maintenance organization. Rebuffed, he said he would try to convince its customers to switch to other insurers. The key to the union's goals, Ray Abernathy, its spokesman, said, was "a national leverage campaign."

 BODY:
OLIVER STONE, RICHARD DONNER and LAUREN SHULER-DONNER, film makers who have all worked in New Mexico, have taken a stand in behalf of elderly buffalo in that state.
Mr. Stone, the director who filmed "Natural Born Killers" in New Mexico in 1993, wrote to Gov. Gary E. Johnson last month opposing a plan to issue licenses to kill aged bulls at Fort Wingate in the western part of the state.
Fish and game officials approved a lottery for the licenses last fall because, they said, the animals had lost their teeth and were starving. The plan has been suspended because of a Federal District Court ruling that the Government must conduct an environmental assessment of the impact of the hunt. Two of the nine bulls in question have since died. 
 "It seems clear that the majority of people are being forced to abide by the wishes of a gun-toting few," Mr. Stone wrote in his letter on Feb. 13. "Is that democracy in action? At the very least, the bison at Fort Wingate should be allowed death with dignity, not slaughter at the hands of those collecting souvenirs. "
Mr. Donner, director of "Lethal Weapon" and "Maverick" and who directed "Superman: The Movie" in New Mexico, and his wife, who is a producer, have also written a letter of protest.
ALAN RICHARDSON, deputy secretary for the New Mexico Economic Development Department, said yesterday: "If you see some of the carnage these guys put on the screen, it is surprising they would take such a stance on this issue. What we're talking about in hunting the buffalo is being humane." NADINE BROZAN

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Deere seems poised to ride positive trends in farming.

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne 

 BODY:
AFTER nearly a decade of the blues in the heartland, there's a lot of optimism rising along with the corn and wheat in the Midwest. Commodity prices are climbing, as is demand for American grain exports. Farm income is going up. And legislation making its way through Congress promises to bring more acreage under cultivation and more dollars into farmers' pockets.
All these factors are lifting the share price of Deere & Company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment. Deere, with $10 billion in sales, is an unusually sophisticated company: Its corporate headquarters, just off a cornfield in Moline, Ill., is an architectural masterpiece designed by Eero Saarinen, with an impressive art collection and swans fluttering in the corporate pond. Right after World War II, the company saw the trend toward larger farms and designed bigger equipment to match -- a move that pushed Deere into the No. 1 position, where it has since remained. 
 With most costs fixed and with its manufacturing process about as efficient as possible, Deere shares are typically buffeted more by cyclical economic trends than by any savings the company can wring. Right now, all the signs are positive for Deere's product mix of large -- 100 horsepower and up -- tractors and huge combines, which can cost more than $100,000 and which bring computers and satellite technology to the harvest. The company also makes smaller tractors for smaller farms overseas, heavy earth-moving equipment and flashy tractor-style lawn mowers for the suburbanite who wants to make the backyard feel like the back 40.
Deere's shares closed yesterday at $40.625 -- after trading last year at less than $30 -- and analysts all point to the same positive trends. But they differ on how much further these trends will cause Deere's stock to rise.
A series of supply shocks in farmlands overseas -- caused by pestilence, droughts and floods -- along with a rising demand for grains from developing countries that now enjoy richer diets have combined to lower worldwide grain supplies and raise prices.
For the first time in nearly a decade, Government data show that American farm incomes are rising somewhat, and as incomes rise, so does the demand for new farm equipment. Bills that would phase out farm subsidies along with lots of regulation have passed both houses of Congress; a conference committee is now working out the differences. The law, when it comes, is expected to hasten the trend toward corporate farms and increase the demand for bigger farm equipment.
For those reasons, analysts like John E. McGinty at the CS First Boston Corporation rate Deere a buy; he sees it rising to $52 a share in the next 12 months. While Mr. McGinty and other analysts see some of Deere's rivals, like the Case Corporation and the Agco Corporation, as cheaper plays, he remains positive: "The fundamentals are there." Mr. McGinty's only concern is that Deere might use its strong cash flow for "something stupid, like making a bad acquisition."
John Mackin, a Morgan Stanley analyst, rates Deere a "strong buy." He sees Deere earnings rising to $3.15 a share in 1996 and $3.55 a share in 1997, with a 12-month target price of $46 a share. "At Morgan Stanley, we have an upbeat view of the economy," he said. "And economically sensitive businesses like farm equipment will grow."
Others are less sanguine. Lisa Shalett, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company, feels that the supply-demand imbalance in grain will right itself over time, pushing down prices. And she thinks that the farm legislation, while generally positive, may have less impact than many predict. Ms. Shalett, who has a "neutral" rating, believes Deere is "fairly valued" at $40 a share.
The most negative is Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., who recently downgraded Deere to a "hold." Mr. Levkovich thinks there is too much inventory buildup of Deere products at dealers. "I'm not disputing the bullish environment," he said. "I just haven't seen the follow-through in sales."
Mr. Levkovich says that when he lowered his rating, "many in the investment community began to ask 'Has Tobias lost his mind?' " But he defended his view, calling the rising inventory a "reality check" on the Deere euphoria.

Manor Care Inc., the nursing-home and hotel giant, said yesterday that it would spin off its hotel business into a separate corporation in which it would retain no ownership interest. Analysts said the lodging unit, Choice Hotels International, could be worth almost $1 billion.
The spinoff -- which the company said would probably take place in six to eight months and would be tax-free -- has long been considered likely by analysts. Some of them compared the spinoff to somewhat similar strategies employed by Marriott, Promus and other hotel companies. But Harold Vogel, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said, "It's part of the convergence we're seeing in other industries, not just hotels." 
 Manor Care said the transaction would make it easier to raise money, and Stewart Bainum Jr., the company's chairman, described the move as "a logical last step in the company's push toward decentralization," a process that began almost two years ago.
Choice Hotels is the world's second-biggest hotel franchiser, after HFS Inc., with 2,959 hotels and more than 700 others under development. The unit, which includes such brand names as Comfort, Quality, Clarion, Sleep Inn, Rodeway, Econo Lodge and Main Stay Suites, had revenue of $342 million in the year that ended Nov. 30, 1995.
Scott Mackesy, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said the hotel unit could be worth almost $1 billion but was likely to be worth closer to $935 million. "Manor Care has been operating two distinct business that didn't really have a lot of synergies," he said. "And the timing for the spinoff makes sense because the valuation of lodging companies in the market is at or near peak levels."
Manor Care, based in Silver Spring, Md., has almost 200 health care operations in 28 states, owns 82 percent of Vitalink Pharmacy Services and holds a controlling interest in In Home Health Inc. Its total revenue for the year that ended Nov. 30 was about $1.3 billion.
Shares of Manor Care rose $3 yesterday, to $42, on the New York Stock Exchange.
David P. Wolfe, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, said the impending split boded well for investors. "We've been observing Manor Care as a lodging group but couldn't cover it because of its health care component," he said. "Now we'll get a chance to look at it as a stock that represents its own hotel franchise."
The management of Choice Hotels, he added, "is very well versed and has a very good mission statement."
The lodging company will get its own seven-member board -- a prospect that pleases Donald J. Landry, the president of Choice Hotels, who will remain president of the spun-off unit and add the title of chief operating officer.
"It will strengthen our unit by giving us a board that will only watch over the hotel business," he said. The spinoff will also allow Choice Hotels to "use our cash flow and our debt capacity for the hotel sector," Mr. Landry said.
A big reason for the recent spinoffs and divestments among hotel companies is that the industry has turned around in recent years. Last year, occupancy rose to a 12-year high, and profits rose to $5.5 billion, according to Smith Travel Research, which tracks hotel performance throughout the United States.
Mr. Landry said that since late 1991, when the market was still depressed, Manor Care had invested more than $200 million in acquiring 77 hotels and renovating and repositioning 20 of them.
This year and next are expected to be even better for the industry. Coopers & Lybrand has estimated that occupancy will increase to 67.2 percent in 1997 from 65.9 percent in 1995 and that profits will rise during that time to $3,500 per available room from about $2,400.

HEADLINE: Congress Sends White House a Compromise Foreign Spending Bill

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
In a sharp retreat from Republican plans to eliminate three American agencies, lawmakers agreed today on final legislation to allow President Clinton to dismantle only one of the three.
Republican sponsors insisted that if all three were eliminated, it would save $1.8 billion. Democrats countered it would cost more to dismantle the agencies than it would save. 
 The compromise bill, worked out in a conference session of the House and the Senate, is expected to be passed easily by Republican majorities in Congress.
Earlier versions had brought threats of a Presidential veto, but the Clinton Administration had no immediate comment on the latest version.
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the three agencies -- the Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency -- had become obsolete in the post-cold-war world.
House and Senate negotiators agreed today on a bill consolidating all three operations into the State Department, thus eliminating them.
But the measure, adopted by a party-line voice vote, also gives President Clinton the right to waive the law for two of the agencies, thus effectively allowing him to pick only one for extinction.
The final version of the bill, which authorizes most spending related to foreign affairs, also allows full funding for Israel and Egypt, which receive the bulk of American aid, restricts aid to Vietnam unless it offers increased cooperation in accounting for missing Americans, ends the United States role in some international agencies, establishes Radio Free Asia to broadcast into China and bans the use of funds for the forced return of Vietnamese boat people.
The Senate conferees also agreed to drop a Republican proposal that would have denied foreign aid money to any group involved with abortions.
The measure authorizes about $13 billion for operating expenses of the State Department in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, a reduction of $500,000 annually below last year's spending.

HEADLINE: The Bludgeoning of Taiwan

 BODY:
China crosses a new and dangerous threshold today by firing unarmed missiles into the waters surrounding Taiwan's two principal ports. Bludgeoning Taiwan into compliance with Beijing's wishes may satisfy some craving among China's leaders for a show of strength, but it risks badly damaging China's relations with the United States and the rest of the world.
The Clinton Administration, which has bet heavily on expanding United States economic and even military cooperation with China, must quickly come up with words and deeds that will give Beijing pause, while not escalating its response to the missile tests into an explosive crisis. 
 The White House has called the tests "provocative and reckless." In private communications with China's leaders, President Clinton should make his concerns even clearer. He should dispatch elements of the Seventh Fleet through the Taiwan Straits, though not in the immediate area of the tests, to demonstrate his commitment to assuring freedom of international navigation.
China's purpose is apparently to frighten voters in Taiwan's first democratic presidential election later this month and to intimidate whatever government is elected. The missile tests have already unsettled Taiwan's economy, as airlines reroute flights and citizens rush to withdraw money from Taiwan's banks and stock market.
The tensions between Beijing and Taipei have a long history. Taiwan's status was left unresolved at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. When the United States recognized mainland China in 1979, it acknowledged Beijing's claim that there could only be one, indivisible China, but it never accepted the Chinese Communist assertion that the mainland had a right to impose reunification by force.
For years, Beijing seemed willing to tolerate Taiwan's de facto independence but drew the line at any steps that would codify that independence. Now Beijing seems to be saying that any Taiwanese diplomatic initiatives, including efforts by President Lee Teng-hui to seek representation in international organizations, are unacceptable.
It is unclear whether China is determined to drive Taiwan into submission, even if that requires the use of military force directly against the island, or will be content if Taiwan's leaders lower their international profile and do not so openly challenge Beijing. It does seem clear that increasing the pressure on Taiwan has become a test of leadership for the men maneuvering to succeed the ailing Deng Xiaoping.
This is a delicate and hazardous moment for American diplomacy. China has already shown its contempt for earlier American warnings about belligerence toward Taiwan. Washington must now be firm but not reckless itself. If China fails to moderate its behavior, Mr. Clinton and his aides will have no choice but to reconsider a policy toward China that has assumed a minimum level of responsible behavior by Beijing.

HEADLINE: Iran Tells the Europeans That It Doesn't Back Terror

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, March 7

 BODY:
The Government of Iran has opened a concerted effort to assure its Western trading partners that it is being wrongly tarred by the United States and Israel as being involved in the recent wave of suicide bombings in Israel.
More than a dozen Western ambassadors were summoned to a meeting today at which a senior Foreign Ministry official declared that Iran's position was being misrepresented. Iran has also backed away from a statement carried earlier this week on the official Iranian Republic News Agency that described the attacks as God's retribution and the beginning of the end for Israel. 
 In the aftermath of the bombings, Iran has found itself the target of unexpected criticism from Prime Minister Alain Juppe of France, and its diplomatic offensive reflected concern that European countries might reconsider their refusal up to now to join in an American campaign to isolate Teheran economically.
In an interview today, Deputy Foreign Minister Zavad Jarif refused to condemn the four recent bombing attacks in Israel. But Mr. Jarif, who met with the ambassadors this morning, said he had told them that despite American and Israeli claims, Iran provided neither military nor financial support to the militant Palestinian group Hamas, whose members claimed responsibility for the attacks.
"You either look for scapegoats or you look for causes," Mr. Jarif said. "You either blame someone outside the region, or you actively solve the problems that have created the difficulties."
The United States has stopped short of making a direct connection between Teheran and the most recent attacks. But it has accused Iran of providing financial and tactical backing to militant organizations, including Hamas, that have waged a violent campaign against the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. And this week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed to the latest bombings as an object lesson for countries that have insisted on maintaining trade ties with Iran.
The United States has said Iran provides about $100 million a year to Islamic organizations that carry out terrorist operations, much of the money going to the Party of God, which is based in Lebanon. It has said other recipients of Iranian money include the Palestinian Islamic Holy War and Hamas, which operate in Gaza and the West Bank.
Britain, France, Germany and other countries have long expressed deep skepticism toward Washington's claims about the extent of Iran's support of terrorism. They have also argued that Iran's behavior is more likely to be modified by engagement with the outside world than by economic isolation.
But with Mr. Juppe's remarks this week before the National Assembly, France, at least, now appears to be reconsidering its position, and the Prime Minister's suggestion that relations between Paris and Teheran might be in trouble has prompted clear signs of concern in the Iranian capital.
The French Ambassador, Jean Pierre Masset, was summoned on Wednesday to Iran's Foreign Ministry, where he was told that the Iranian Government had disavowed the state-run news agency's statement that appeared to condone the bombings.

NEW YORK
 
Dole Wins by Big Margin
 
Senator Bob Dole sailed to an overwhelming primary victory in New York, surmounting a challenge by Steve Forbes and cementing his standing as the commanding favorite to win his party's Presidential nomination. It was the first competitive Republican primary election in the state's history. Mr. Dole has collected close to one-third of the 996 delegates he needs to win the nomination. [Page A1.]
 
Mayor Giuliani, as promised, cast his vote for Senator Dole, saying it wasn't so difficult after all. [B9.]
 
In Nassau County, the primary was a test of county Republican PArty chairman's reputation for running the best political organization in the country. [B9.]
 
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato apologized for his role -- mostly successful -- in shutting other candidates out of the Republican primary. [B9.]
 
Giuliani Irks Bratton
 
Mayor Giuliani has blocked several high-level Police Department personnel moves proposed by Commissioner William J. Bratton, further straining their often tense relationship, senior police officials say. [B1.]
 
Subway Bomber Found Guilty
 
Edward J. Leary, a computer analyst from New Jersey who lost his job and carried his rage into New York City's subway, was convicted of firebombing two trains, as a jury rejected his claim that antidepressants had driven him insane. He was found guilty of attempted murder and assault, but acquitted of attempted grand larceny. [B1.]
 
Many of the victims of the subway bombings rejoiced at the verdicts, as they continue to try to rebuild their lives. [B4.]
 
A Tradition Called Big East
 
The Big East Tournament rolls into Madison Square Garden each year, bringing together many of the best college basketball teams in the Northeast vying for a spot in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. It might seem that college students would be the ones most excited about this ritual. But it is the men in the seats, some old enough to be their fathers and grandfathers, who seem to have the most fun. [B1.]
 
Bratton Takes On a Court
 
Police Commissioner Bratton tore into the State Court of Appeals as being too willing to toss out evidence, thereby creating "phenomenal burdens for our police." In a word, he called the court "screwball." NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Reclassifying Harlem Fairway
 
The city's Department of Buildings is considering classifying the sprawling new Fairway supermarket in Harlem as not just one, but three stores, so it can operate legally under zoning laws. City planners have said the 35,000-square-foot store needs a special permit allowing large retail stores to open in industrial areas. [B3.]
 
At the Helm of Queens College
 
Allen Lee Sessoms, the new president of Queens College, served as a negotiator on issues of nuclear proliferation in the Carter Administration, bargaining with skeptical world leaders. To him, budget negotiations at the college and dealings with the faculty and students seem almost as sticky, and his plans for a shake-up have been met with protest. [B3.]
 
Police Find Gun From Slaying
 
Detectives recovered the gun used to kill the owner of the Second Avenue Deli on Monday, the police said. But they have yet to find the man suspected of killing the owner, Abe Lebewohl, and now theorize that a getaway driver may have been waiting on First Avenue to help him escape, investigators said. [B5.]
 
Judge Blocks Notification Law
 
A Federal judge granted a temporary restraining order sought by three anonymous sex offenders, blocking New York State's plans to release the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders. [B6.]
 
REGION
 
Storm Brings Ice and Snow
 
A mix of ice pellets and snow snarled commuting for metropolitan area residents, as crusting ice sent cars spinning out of control and intermittently forced the closing of some bridges and highways and resulted in delays and cancellations at the region's airports. The icy conditions also caused a pileup of dozens of cars on the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, injuring one person. [B6.]
 
Economy Remains Sluggish
 
Monthly unemployment rates in the region were virtually unchanged over the same period last year, according to Labor Department figures, indicating continued economic sluggishness. [B6.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Yale Offers Tradeoffs to Unions
 
One day after clerical workers ended a monthlong strike, Yale University offered to make some tradeoffs in its contract proposals in an effort to end a deadlock in negotiations with two of its labor unions. [B5.]

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am about to lose my job after 30 years with the United States Foreign Service. I will retire 10 years earlier than colleagues were doing only five years ago. I have a good pension, but I don't know what lies ahead. 
 I am nevertheless baffled, in your March 7 article on the Bucknell University class of 1970, by the reference to "the world that once seemed rich and ripe with potential."
This class graduated into an America mired in a fruitless war in Southeast Asia and torn by race riots and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ahead lay Watergate and double-digit inflation. By those standards, the America into which the class of 1996 will graduate would seem pretty tame.

HEADLINE: Downsizing: The Trashing of America's Soul;
Bulletproof Logic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your front-page series on "The Downsizing of America": The rationale managers use to justify work force reduction is rarely mentioned. The logic is almost bulletproof. 
 Labor costs are the dominant cost of doing business in all but a few endeavors. For most jobs, the variation in individual work-related performance is likely to be greater than the range in compensation; thus it is possible to maintain productivity or work quality and decrease labor costs at the same time.
This situation is most likely to occur where worker output can vary (sales, management, nonproduction-line factory work, skilled labor and professions), but employment costs like benefits, overhead and investment are relatively fixed.
In 1993 the output of each full-time worker represented $50,000 of the gross national product. Considering only the economy's commercial sector, the average labor component of this output is 60 percent, or $30,000 a worker. Costs of materials and other business needs like advertising, distribution and administration are 30 percent, leaving only 10 percent, or $5,000 a worker, for corporate gross profit.
However, if labor costs can be reduced by 10 percent while labor productivity can yet be maintained by improvements in selection, training or work design, and with all other costs remaining constant, gross profit increases by 60 percent.
To increase profitability quickly, management can reduce labor costs most effectively by replacing older, higher-paid workers with younger workers, by transferring production to lower labor cost areas, and by automation.

Progressive Caucus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Downsizing of America": Yes, the economy is booming for the rich and the large corporations. But since 1973, 80 percent of working Americans have seen a decline in their living standard or, at best, economic stagnation. The middle class is working longer hours for lower wages, and the new jobs being created for their children are often low-wage, part-time or temporary jobs. 
 Your March 3 article said that "until Patrick J. Buchanan made the issue part of the Presidential campaign, it seldom surfaced in political debate." Wrong. The 50-member House Progressive Caucus has been discussing this crisis for five years.

Best for Entrepreneurs

Re "Big Holes Where the Dignity Used to Be" (front page, March 5), on James Sharlow's loss of a $130,000 job at Eastman Kodak: While I'm sympathetic to anyone who loses a good job after so many years of service, one question seems unanswered: Why didn't Mr. Sharlow, a skilled machinist and plant manager, try starting a business of his own? With all its problems and frightening unemployment trends, America is still the best place for an entrepreneur to exercise his or her wings.

Not a New Trend

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "On the Battlefields of Business, Millions of Casualties" (front page, March 3): You treat downsizing as news. Yet this trend has been going on for two decades. The Fortune 500 companies reached a peak in their share of total United States employment in 1969. They reached a peak in absolute terms -- total number employed -- in 1979. 
 Meanwhile, as of 1994, 72.5 percent of all jobs in the United States economy were in the service sector, not the Fortune 500 companies. More important, the service sector contained the highest number of best-paid jobs.
It is true that the information revolution, coupled with the lower labor rates overseas, is displacing many industrial jobs, just as manufacturing displaced farm labor 100 years ago. Those willing to change and learn are being rewarded in the service sector.

HEADLINE: Downsizing: The Trashing of America's Soul;
Military Suffers, Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I applaud your front-page series describing the problems facing many Americans in dealing with downsizing, I would like to call your attention to an area not mentioned: the military. The reduction in the work force of any particular company pales compared with those in the armed forces and civilian Defense Department employees. 
 The traditional place of employment for former military personnel with leadership experience has been middle management, where their attributes of loyalty, dedication and self-sacrifice were valued. As your series demonstrates, middle management is an endangered species.
For the jobs that remain, there is fierce competition from unemployed civilians who lost out in the corporate restructuring. Who would more likely be hired for an open position: a former bank vice president from the local area or an infantry major back from three years in Germany?
Military people, generally speaking, are not well equipped upon leaving the service to deal with the financial matters of everyday life. To compensate for lower pay, they have been provided with full services for themselves and their families -- medical, educational, housing, recreational -- that vanish upon discharge.
I sympathize with those in civilian life who have suffered downsizing. But the "peace dividend" for many people, after having served our country well, has been a particularly bitter pill.

HEADLINE: Physicist and Former Diplomat Faces a Big Test: Running Queens College

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Allen Lee Sessoms, the new president of Queens College, likes to quote Henry Kissinger, who once compared the politics of academia to that surrounding nuclear weapons.
Dr. Sessoms ought to know. A physicist, he has resolved issues of nuclear proliferation as a negotiator in the Carter Administration, bargaining with skeptical leaders from Argentina, Brazil, Iran and Iraq. 
 To him, negotiations at Queens College seem almost as sticky, with insurrections from the faculty, manifestos in the student newspaper and sensitive budget matters that put the future of the school at stake.
"I had to meet with heads of nuclear agencies, ambassadors, scientists and technical advisers to get them to agree to rules of peaceful uses of nuclear energy without taking steps that would get them closer to nuclear weapons," Dr. Sessoms said. "It was tough, but the experience in academics is directly transferable."
Raised in the hard-bitten environs of the South Bronx, Dr. Sessoms, 49, took over seven months ago as the eighth president of Queens College, long considered the jewel of the City University system.
A former professor of physics at Harvard University, Dr. Sessoms is not short on big thoughts for Queens College. Strolling through the tree-lined campus one recent brisk morning, he issued proclamations of his intents -- to make a "first-rate institution greater," put the school "on the cutting edge" and move it into "the 21st century."
To meet such lofty goals, he challenged the school's 600 full-time faculty members to justify research projects or face an increased teaching load. He has hired an adviser to help seek money from corporations, saying the college can no longer rely on Albany as its primary source. He is conducting an intensive review of more than 100 college programs to determine whether some should be scrapped, expanded or merged.
Some faculty members have objected to the shake-up, and 60 of them signed an open letter in the student newspaper this winter pillorying Dr. Sessoms's focus on increasing teaching time, accountability for results in research projects and tailoring the curriculum to train employees for private corporations that make donations. Dr. Sessoms inherited a $2 million shortfall this school year, and faces a $10.8 million cut to its $67.9 million operating budget next year if the Legislature does not significantly restore funds.
Barbara Bowen, an associate English professor at the college who signed the letter, was one of those who expressed concern over Dr. Sessoms's restructuring plans. "We don't want people outside the college to think we oppose change," Professor Bowen said. "I'm the first to say the curriculum can be changed, but I don't want to do the work of pretending to change it for intellectual reasons when we are really destroying the institution and getting rid of people."
But there are many who admire Dr. Sessoms's desire for change. Alan Van Capelle, 21, vice president of the student association, said Dr. Sessoms had challenged not only the staff but the whole college community to think of creative solutions to continuing problems. And Derek C. Bok, a trustee of the University of Massachusetts system, where Dr. Sessoms was executive vice president and vice president of academic affairs, did not express surprise that Dr. Sessoms had shaken things up already.
"In Boston, he raised questions about faculty hiring, promotion standards and student recruitment that really had not been raised for a long time, certainly not by the president's office," Dr. Bok said. "They were in need of close scrutiny. He refused to rubber-stamp things like proposals for promotions that did not meet the standards the university said it wanted to live up to."
Dr. Sessoms knows about criticism. He sharpened his skills negotiating with Russians and South Koreans about nuclear missiles as director of the Office of Nuclear Technology in the Department of State. He was also Deputy Chief of Mission in the United States Embassy in Mexico, and Counselor for Scientific and Technological Affairs at the Embassy in France.
Dr. Sessoms called his experience outside of academics crucial. "If you are caught up in the bureaucracy, you lose sight of what you're doing," he said. "I draw the analogy to chess. If you spend too much time worrying about where to move the pieces, you forget why you're playing the game. You have to get away to understand the reason we are doing this is to educate students."
Tall and tapered like the track athlete that he once was in high school and college (the quarter mile was his best event), Dr. Sessoms grew up in a four-story walk-up in the South Bronx. Encouraged by his mother, he took an early interest in science. His mother, a practical nurse at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, would conduct science experiments in the house after work. With a coffee can, a candle, baking soda and a match, for example, she would create an explosion to illustrate that expanding gases create force.
His father owned a bodega at 169th Street and Prospect Avenue, where he and his siblings worked after school at the cash register, stocking shelves and preparing sandwiches at the deli counter. During off hours, he said, they studied at the bodega.
"Academics have always been important in my family," Dr. Sessoms said, "and the entire neighborhood knew it, including the thugs. Living in 'Fort Apache' was great training. Survival where I grew up suggests you can survive anywhere and prosper."
With the discipline of his youth, the road to the Ivy League was not particularly difficult.
"Throughout my schooling," he said, "I went where the money was -- I'm from the Bronx. Whenever scholarships came up, I took them. That's how I ended up with two master's degrees." In addition to those degrees, one from the University of Washington and one from Yale University, he has a Ph.D. from Yale.
Dr. Sessoms, who is married to Csilla von Csiky, an economist whom he met while working in Vienna, said he might have attended Queens College had its profile been higher during his childhood.
Set in the heart of residential Flushing, the campus bustles with some 18,000 students. Students speak 67 languages and are from 132 countries on a campus that has been called the Ellis Island of higher education.
He said he would like to increase the diversity of the staff and student body.
"Queens College is very diverse," said Dr. Sessoms, who is black, "but there are very few African-Americans. That hit me in the face because that shouldn't be. This is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the city."
On the academic level, Dr. Sessoms is hoping to tighten Queens College's admissions standards by raising the average grade-point requirement for high-school seniors to 85, from 83, and increasing the average minimum combined S.A.T. scores required for admission to 1,200, from 1,100. The higher standards are being used in selecting this fall's freshmen.
The school has become known as a university treasure because of its ability to draw to its faculty distinguished Nobel Prize winners like Isaac Bashevis Singer, the late writer. Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, was recently hired as a tenured professor. The college has one of the largest programs of Jewish studies in the country and a nationally renowned music department. It also runs the Louis Armstrong archives.
"I should be able to take kids from places like Penn State, University of Michigan, University of Virginia and Harvard," Dr. Sessoms mused. "New York City needs that."

HEADLINE: The Politics of Layoffs: In Search of a Message

SERIES: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: The Issue of Jobs Rises at the Polls -- Sixth of seven articles

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT and ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:
Last fall, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, convened a meeting of about a dozen of the party's top political consultants to get some advice. Polls showed increasing disillusionment with the Republican Congress, but little evidence of increased support for Democrats. What positive message, Mr. Dodd wanted to know, could the party use to win over the growing numbers of disgruntled Americans?
On one side was a group of strategists in favor of appealing to middle-class voters by openly taking on corporate America, demanding to know why in a time of rising profits workers were being laid off and wages were flat. Such a message "gets the Democrats back home," said Carter Eskew, one of those who argued in its favor. 
 Others worried, however, that the appeal of the message was precisely what was wrong with it: it sounded too much like the voice of "old Democrats." It would, they warned, invite charges that the party was inciting class warfare, and could ultimately end up alienating important constituencies, not to mention some of the party's major contributors.
This difference of opinion reflects a continuing debate among Democratic office holders, and one of the central conflicts inside the Clinton re-election effort. Indeed, it illustrates the challenge both parties confront as they look to the November election: how to offer what one prominent Democratic pollster calls a "narrative" that would allow voters to make sense of a new, and often alarming, economic reality.
Even more contentiously, and certainly more publicly than the Democrats, the Republicans have been battling over what message to send to increasingly edgy voters.
Until the last few weeks, most party leaders believed the Republican Presidential primary campaign would be fought over more abstract issues like balancing the budget and cutting the Federal bureaucracy. But that expectation changed when Patrick J. Buchanan, who had been advocating steep tariffs and stiff curbs on immigration to protect American jobs, won the New Hampshire primary. Suddenly, issues like layoffs and the impact of foreign trade began to dominate the discussion. Mr. Buchanan's rivals found themselves scrambling for an alternative economic message, all the while denouncing his.
In the 15 years since Ronald Reagan was elected -- in times of recovery as well as deep recession -- millions of Americans have lost their jobs and begun to slide, some slowly, others rapidly, down the economic ladder. So commonplace has the news of corporate downsizing become that the notion of lifetime employment has come to seem as dated as soda jerks, or tail fins. And a growing number of Americans have come to doubt one of the basic precepts of the national faith: that their children will have a higher standard of living than they did.
"You can't really depend on your job any more," said Jay Lyons, general manager of Ridge Chevy Olds in Basking Ridge, N.J., just down the road from the headquarters of AT&T, which recently announced 40,000 layoffs. "I just heard about another company laying people off. This is almost daily now."
Both parties do have legislative proposals that their members argue would help dull the economic pain, from a middle-class tax cut to changes in the corporate tax code. But, by and large, the political system has been slow to respond, at least in part because there are no easy or politically palatable solutions to the two parallel and interrelated economic problems behind that pain: layoffs and stagnant middle-class wages.
Even Mr. Buchanan, who has made fighting the loss of American jobs one of the central themes of his campaign, acknowledged recently that he did not know how, if he were elected President, he would respond to an announcement of more layoffs by a company like I.B.M. or AT&T. "That's a very tough question, because I don't have the answer to it," he said last Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."
At the same time, there are many politicians, especially on the right but also on the left, who argue that the middle class is disillusioned not only because of economic change, but also because of social and political decline. And there are many in both parties who argue that their party's electoral prospects would best be served by focusing on these broad issues.
At this point, eight months from the election, it is too early to say if economic issues will be the central focus of the campaign. Still, as they gear up for November, people in both parties say it will be impossible for candidates to ignore them.
"The core issue in '96 is there is a large chunk of the electorate that is very uneasy," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who until recently worked on Senator Bob Dole's Presidential campaign. "All these major corporations are shedding workers. All around them people see their friends getting laid off. And the first question for any politician is what can you say to these people that can convince them the political system can even deal with the issue?"
 
The Republicans: Unified No More
The day after the House passed a balanced-budget plan last November, Speaker Newt Gingrich called it "the first blueprint to give our children lower interest rates, lower taxes and more freedom and more prosperity." As it turned out, this was a high-water mark for Republican unity.
At that point, key Republicans were speaking with near-unanimity about the nation's economic problems. What ailed America, they said, was that economic growth in recent years had been too slow, and interest rates too high. They also agreed on the cause: a bloated and growing Federal bureaucracy. This bureaucracy, they argued, was taking the hard-earned wages of middle-class taxpayers and giving them to others, be they welfare mothers or foreign investors clipping coupons on government bonds.
The solution was to balance the budget and give middle-class Americans a $500-per-child tax credit. This would not only give families more money in their pockets, they argued, but also encourage job-producing investments. Before long, the economy would be growing fast enough to insure a rising standard of living for everyone.
Even heading into the primaries, all but one candidate seemed to agree that these were the key issues. But that one, Mr. Buchanan, won the first primary, in New Hampshire, and almost at once the Republican unanimity showed signs of stress.
Mr. Buchanan has consistently -- and directly -- tried to appeal to workers displaced by economic change. In his speeches, he links middle-class anxieties to the rise of a global economy and trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"I was not discomfited by the shutdown of the government," Mr. Buchanan said a few weeks ago in Iowa, "but I was discomfited when I read that AT&T is laying off 40,000 workers just like that, and the fellow that did it makes $5 million a year, and AT&T stock soared as a consequence and his stock went up $5 million."
It is not even clear if Mr. Buchanan's economic message was the moving force behind his early success. In fact, a recent New York Times/CBS Poll suggested that it was his views on social issues, at least as much as economic ones, that attracted voters. But his message, which injected an unfamiliar note of economic populism into the primaries and led him to an awkward rapport with some lunch-bucket Democrats, forced layoffs and wage stagnation to the forefront of the Republican campaign.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Dole belatedly tried to respond to Mr. Buchanan, offering anxious American workers what he called the "four freedoms of economic security." But the list, which included the "freedom from deficits," failed to generate much interest, and a few days later Mr. Dole acknowledged he had not expected jobs to be such a big issue.
Even as Mr. Buchanan appears to be turning into a protest candidate in the wake of Mr. Dole's eight-primary sweep on Tuesday and his victory yesterday in New York, the rifts he has exposed in the Republican Party are potentially lasting, and potentially even more profound than those between "old" and "new" Democrats. Where Mr. Buchanan advocates high tariffs to protect American industries, for example, many Republicans see no role at all for the government in securing private jobs.
Representative John Linder of Atlanta, who is faced with major AT&T layoffs in his district, told a reporter not long ago that his inquiry was the first he had received about the job losses. "The good news to me, as one who doesn't think the government has a solution for everything, is that people aren't running to their government and saying 'fix this,' " he said.
Many conservatives also maintain that Mr. Buchanan is misguided when he says middle-class workers have got a raw deal. They make several counter-arguments, all of them vigorously disputed by many economists, who say the conservatives are basing their claims on a highly selective use of economic statistics.
One argument is that when fringe benefits are taken into account, middle-class wage growth has kept up with the growth of the economy as a whole. A second argument rebuts the existence of a "middle class squeeze" by insisting that Americans on the top and bottom are constantly trading places. And yet another argument is that while income disparities grew under Jimmy Carter, they shrank under Ronald Reagan, only to expand again under Bill Clinton.
"The disparities in incomes were worse in the 1970's; we had real stagnation," Steve Forbes, the publisher and Republican Presidential candidate, said in an interview.
Yet even before the recent successes of Mr. Buchanan, there were some prominent Republican strategists who wondered if the party was vulnerable to just the sort of appeal he has voiced. Although they all agreed with the party's economic prescription of cutting taxes and balancing the budget, they said they were worried that the rhetoric was inadequate, too disconnected from the frustrated lives of real voters.
In an interview back in November, Mr. McInturff, the former Dole pollster, said he was concerned that Republicans were not communicating the party's economic agenda in terms that made sense of voters' everyday experience. "As a party," he said, "we haven't connected the dots yet."
 
Democrats: An Awkward Position
The question of how to address the nation's growing economic anxiety is a particularly awkward one for a President who won election in 1992 by appealing to middle-class voters who were, in his words, "working harder for less."
Mr. Clinton has presided over a steady economic recovery, for which he would obviously like credit. Yet even as the recovery has produced rising profits for many corporations and their shareholders, it has produced only pink slips and falling wages for many of the voters who supported him.
Mr. Clinton tried to embrace both of these competing realities in his State of the Union Message in January. The economy, he said at the outset, "is the healthiest it's been in three decades." But just a few sentences later, he acknowledged the underside of that same economy. "While more Americans are living better," he said, "too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families."
For Mr. Clinton and for Democrats in general, one of the central challenges is to come up with a convincing "narrative" that explains why Americans are feeling so insecure in the first place. It was just such a explanation, many Democrats maintain, that allowed the Republicans to succeed so spectacularly two years ago.
"Part of the problem on our side," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, "is that the only coherent explanation that is out there is the Republican explanation" -- that so many Americans feel hard pressed because Washington is taking their money.
On factual grounds, Democrats dispute this explanation -- and many economists agree with them -- because Federal tax receipts as a proportion of the overall economy have actually remained steady in recent decades. Moreover, the Republican account does not address the widening disparity between the incomes of middle-class and wealthy Americans: middle-class incomes, Democrats point out, have been flat even on a pretax basis, even as the incomes of the wealthy have grown dramatically.
Politics being a visceral business, though, Democrats are not enthusiastic about engaging in a debate over economic statistics. Instead, they see their task as answering the Republicans' "narrative" with a better one. The difficulty, says Stan Greenberg, the Democratic pollster who uses the term narrative, is that there are too many competing explanations for what has happened to the American economy.
"The problem is there are many narratives, and they are complicated narratives," he said. "There's a trade narrative about the role of foreign competition and unfair trade barriers. There's a narrative about skills. There's a narrative about rising productivity, and that in the long run people will see increasing gains."
Each of these narratives also suggests a different set of policy solutions.
If the problem is unfair trade, then the answer, increasingly advocated by House Democrats, might be to adopt a tougher stance with America's trading partners.
If the problem is corporations passing on the profits from increased productivity to shareholders but not to workers, then a possible answer might be incentives to change corporate behavior. This is an approach that has been proposed by such prominent Democrats as Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader; Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, and, perhaps most vociferously, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
Mr. Kennedy is drafting legislation that would set a lower corporate tax rate for companies that have what he calls above-average records in areas like creating jobs, avoiding layoffs "simply to maximize profits," paying adequate wages and providing training for their workers.
Finally, if the problem is skills, then the obvious answer would be to improve educational opportunities. There is in fact widespread and even bipartisan agreement that American workers would be better off if they were better educated. But the consensus breaks down once the discussion turns to how to do this.
What approach Mr. Clinton should take has been a matter of intense debate among his advisers. On one side are those who argue that to win back the blue-collar white men who abandoned the Democrats in 1994, the President needs a strong populist appeal. This group includes Mr. Clinton's top advisers from 1992, like Mr. Greenberg and James Carville.
"If the Democratic Party can't talk about stagnating wages in a time of rising prosperity, why have one?" Mr. Carville said.
On the other side are those who argue that an economic populist appeal is too divisive, and that the Democrats can only forge a majority coalition by emphasizing broad, unifying issues like Medicare and education. This group, which includes most of the members of Mr. Clinton's new campaign team led by Dick Morris, also argues that economic growth is an accomplishment the President should boast about, not undermine.
From his recent speeches, Mr. Clinton seems to be trying to fuse these two messages, acknowledging voters' anxieties but rejecting a populist appeal.
Speaking at a public-works garage outside Detroit this week, the President called on the Federal Government to do more "to create jobs and raise incomes and give these people who are being downsized a chance to go right with their lives." He reiterated his calls for an increased minimum wage, tax deductions for college tuition and Federal vouchers for worker retraining.
But he pointedly avoided mention of the kind of redistributive tax changes his own Labor Secretary is advocating.
"We are not a people who object to others being successful," he said. "We do not resent people amassing their own wealth fairly won in a free enterprise system."
 
The Old Rules Fail
The bipartisan groping for a message to connect with economic discontent comes at a time of fundamental political uncertainty. Just as factory and middle-management jobs have become more insecure, so, too, have elected officials', and many politicians argue the two developments are related.
For years -- though political scientists constantly recalculated their formulas -- it was a simple truth that if the economy was good, the party in power won re-election. An ailing economy in 1976 and 1980 was a critical factor in those elections, and Congressional seats have regularly been won and lost over unemployment and inflation. One has to go back to 1968 -- in the middle of the Vietnam War -- to find an exception.
But in 1992, the rules failed. The country was at peace, the economy was in a recovery, and yet George Bush was badly defeated.
Two years later, the old rules performed no better. Once again the country was at peace and the economy was expanding. The models could not account for the devastating defeats that cost the Democrats control of both the House and Senate.
There are undoubtedly other factors at work besides changing economics. Innumerable polls suggest that voter volatility is a product not just of economic trends, but also of social trends, like concern over moral decline and a loss of confidence in government. But increasingly, politicians of both parties argue there is a profound connection between what is happening in the voting booth and what is happening at corporate headquarters and on factory floors.
The old models of voter behavior no longer work, these politicians argue, because they were fashioned at a time when economic growth translated directly into increased wages and job security. Yet for many middle- and lower-income workers, this is no longer the case. A low unemployment rate means little when a factory worker loses a $15-an-hour job and has to settle for one paying half as much.
"The people who have seen their wages and benefits erode and their job security vanish, they are politically up for grabs," Mr. Reich said. "They're not liberal, they're not conservative, they're anti-establishment. They blame whoever's in power."
But they have not turned off on government. The New York Times poll showed that 10 percent of the public had gone through a "major crisis" in their lives because of a layoff, either their own or a family member's. That group, as big as the flock of 19 million who voted for Ross Perot for President in 1992, is hostile to the economic system, to immigrants and to both political parties. But its members are dramatically more likely than other Americans to say that government can and should do something about the layoff problem. In these days of disgust with Capitol Hill, 78 percent of them said they believed that Congress could do something about the loss of jobs.
Those who have experienced a major crisis as a result of a layoff are also politically available. They are only slightly more Democratic than the rest of America, and a bit more educated. Bob Teeter, a Republican pollster, said the data suggested that the experience of layoffs had heightened their attention to government, and that they were a reasonable target for all politicians just because "they weren't overly anything."
Looking back, economists now say that the roots of today's economic insecurity can be traced back to the early 1970's. That is when the growth that had followed World War II began a 20-year slowdown, and when middle-class incomes began to lag.
Similarly, political analysts now go back to the early 1970's in an effort to understand today's uncertain environment. One of the defining traits of American politics over the past 25 years has been the defection of working-class, white voters, especially men, from the Democratic Party. These voters, who had been drawn into the party with the New Deal, left it for largely social reasons. But some of those reasons had an economic undertone; many saw their party as too concerned about blacks and the poor, ignoring the struggles of other working families.
Repeatedly Republicans have defined their success with this group as the prelude to an emerging political realignment, only to see their gains wash away in harder times, like 1982 and 1992.
One of the lingering -- and central -- questions about the 1994 election is: Was this the portent, finally, of a permanent realignment or will the coalition once again fragment under economic stress? The group that swung most dramatically in 1994 was white males, or "angry white males" as they were quickly dubbed -- particularly white men without college degrees. Exit polls showed their support of Democrats dropped in two years from 59 to 40 percent.
It is no coincidence, some analysts argue, that this is the group that has fared the worst recently. According to Lawrence Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, wages of white men with only a high-school education have dropped 17 percent since 1979.
In an article last fall in the liberal journal The American Prospect, Ruy Teixeira, the Economic Policy Institute's director of political science and Joel Rogers, a professor of law, sociology and political science at the University of Wisconsin, argued that the Democrats lost control of Congress because these voters had embraced the theory that wasteful government spending and high taxes were responsible for their declining standard of living. To win working-class white men back, the two said, the Democrats must offer "an alternative story that shifts the blame to other targets."
By some accounts, at least, this is precisely what Mr. Buchanan has done. And notably, Mr. Buchanan's support is highest among working-class white men. In the New Hampshire primary, about a third of his votes came from white men without college educations, and among this group he was far more popular than any of his rivals.
 
The View From the Ground
The politics of economic anxiety, of course, is not only being played out in the war rooms and on the hustings of Presidential politics. The story is also beginning to unfold in Congressional districts around the country, in places as diverse and far-flung as Houston and Erie, Pa. What emerges from conversations with voters and candidates in both cities is a sense that the debate could favor either party in the fall.
In the 25th District in Houston, which has had a growing number of white-collar layoffs, voters are doubtful that either party is even in touch with their anxieties. Many also say they doubt the government can do much except get out of the way.
Cliff Fehr was laid off a few years ago from his job as a sales manager at Tenneco Inc., and, after struggling, found a new sales and marketing job that paid about $30,000 less in annual wages and benefits.
"Politically, it changed me a little bit," Mr. Fehr, 51, said of his layoff experience. "I've always been on the conservative side anyway, but now I'm probably more conservative. I'm very concerned about jobs leaving the United States and going overseas, more so than I was before." Mr. Fehr said he was more inclined to vote for Republicans because he felt the party was more sympathetic to business.
Still, many people who have had job problems credit the government -- and, more specifically, Democratic policies -- with helping them get back on their feet.
One is Sergio Garcia, a former oil-production analyst who was laid off from Chevron when his entire division was eliminated three years ago. A government-financed retraining program allowed Mr. Garcia to acquire a degree in occupational technology and industrial studies; he is now a training coordinator for a consulting company.
"At this point, the whole issue of retraining is at least being addressed by the Democrats," Mr. Garcia, 44, said. "I retrained myself, but I got some help -- and that's the kind of thing this country needs."
The Democratic incumbent, Ken Bentsen, believes that he can seize the economic upper hand by emphasizing that he voted against several Republican proposals to cut funds for education and job training.
At this stage of the campaign, the two Republican hopefuls -- Brent Perry and Bill Brock -- are emphasizing conservative policies such as a balanced Federal budget, which they say are most likely to prime the economy and create jobs.
In Erie, the incumbent Congressman, Phil English, is part of the freshman Republican class that swept Newt Gingrich to power. Enough of his constituents have been voting Republican to keep the seat out of Democratic hands for 18 years. But Mr. English, who won the 21st District with only 49 percent of the vote in a three-way race two years ago, is himself performing a delicate balancing act as he fights to hold on in a district both parties see as a battleground.
General Electric is in the process of laying off 1,400 workers at its big locomotive plant in Erie, and both General Electric and the United Electrical Workers local acknowledge that Mr. English has worked hard to insure continued financing for Amtrak and the extension of the Export-Import Bank so that the company had an opportunity for more domestic and foreign sales. And he has also worked, against many of his Republican colleagues, to preserve strands of the safety net, like assistance for people who lose their jobs due to trade agreements and extended unemployment benefits.
Mr. English contends he is a moderating force on the Gingrich revolution who explains to his Sun Belt colleagues what life is like in the Rust Belt, and gets concessions. He seems comfortable with this role, and he argues that even though jobs are the issue his constituents most often raise, "most people recognize that the role of the Federal Government is necessarily limited."
Labor leaders like Jim Nelson, who followed his father into the presidency of the union local after about 15 years as a stockkeeper in the locomotive plant's steel yard, say that will not wash. They argue that the ultimate votes by Mr. English for the Republican budget and its cuts showed that his allegiance was to Speaker Gingrich, not to "the guy that carries a lunch box going through the gate of this plant."
Mr. English's Democratic opponent, Ron DiNicola, has told the union that, if elected, he would work to restore unemployment compensation and training subsidies to their old nontaxable status. But he has generally steered clear of offering policy prescriptions. Recently, he wondered out loud how the government could encourage General Electric to weigh a responsibility to its workers and the community with its duties to its "obligation to the bottom line."
As the General Electric workers look to the Presidential race, many of them do so with concern.
"The only candidate on the macro level who is talking about real world economic issues, unfortunately, is Pat Buchanan," Mr. Nelson said. "Bill Clinton is going to have to start talking about the things Pat Buchanan is talking about."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Rare Picture of New York Republicans Shows Support for Moderate Stances

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
In the first clear snapshot of Republican primary voters in recent New York State history, a survey of people leaving polling places yesterday showed that Republicans here tend to oppose a constitutional ban on abortion, reject religious conservatism and view themselves as being near the political center.
Until now, there has been remarkably little information available, outside of politicians' private polls, to characterize Republican voters, because there has been a dearth of Republican primaries. Yesterday's vote marked the first time that Republican Presidential candidates have competed in every Congressional district in the state. 
 The image emerging yesterday showed a Republican electorate that clearly considers itself at the heart of the political mainstream. The poll of 1,553 registered Republicans was conducted by the four television networks and The Associated Press.
Three-fourths of those polled called themselves moderate or somewhat conservative. Only about 1 in 8 listed conservative values as the most important quality they looked for in a candidate. And just a fifth said they identified with the religious right.
Asked whether the Republican platform should support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, 3 in 5 said no -- a ratio similar to those found in other Northeastern states but higher than in Southern states.
In perhaps its most surprising finding, the poll showed that 4 in 10 Republicans believe that the nation cannot afford to welcome new immigrants, indicating a simmering discontent with the policies that have given the state its varied immigrant heritage.
But although Patrick J. Buchanan has been the most outspoken advocate of restricting immigration in the Republican field, almost two-thirds of the primary voters said yesterday that they thought his views were too extreme.
Indeed, in its portrait of a moderate Republican electorate, the poll repeatedly provided evidence for why Senator Bob Dole, who has sought to cast himself as the party's centrist, won handily.
Mr. Dole also benefited heavily from the unalloyed support he received from the state's Republican Party, which provided hundreds of campaign workers to get out his vote.
The poll indicated that many of Mr. Dole's campaign themes struck a chord here. But it was difficult to know whether that was because people simply agreed with his agenda or because they had been influenced by the state party.
For instance, a fair percentage of the primary voters -- nearly 1 in 5 -- said that experience in Washington was the most important quality they sought in a candidate. Republican voters in other states have tended to rate Washington experience as less crucial than other characteristics, like vision or outspokenness, qualities that have more often been associated with Steve Forbes or Mr. Buchanan.
Mr. Dole and his workers in New York State have heavily emphasized his many years in the Senate, trying to portray him as the one candidate capable of getting things done.
The State Republican Party also tried, with some success, to use the state's complicated election laws to keep candidates other than Mr. Dole off the ballot. But as was the case in other states, nearly half of New York State's Republicans said they were satisfied with the candidates, suggesting that Republicans in the state were not overly offended by the party's efforts to winnow the field on Mr. Dole's behalf.
Voters were also evenly divided over what kind of tax system they wanted, with half supporting the flat-tax system endorsed by Mr. Forbes and half saying they liked the current system in which wealthier people are taxed at higher rates. Mr. Dole argued strenuously that the flat tax would be unfair to New Yorkers because they pay high state and local taxes yet would be unable to deduct them on their Federal tax returns under the Forbes plan.
Like Republicans in other states, New York's primary voters called taxes and the economy the two most important issues in the race. About 1 in 6 rated the deficit as the nation's most pressing problem, while about 1 in 14 said abortion was the issue that mattered most.
The survey seemed inconclusive on how New Yorkers felt about the Republican revolution in Congress. Asked about the Republican congressional agenda, about one-fifth said it had gone too far, while nearly half said it had not gone far enough. Almost 3 in 10 said it had struck the right balance.
The poll showed that most Republican primary voters are male, over 45 and middle class, earning between $30,000 and $75,000 a year. Most had completed college, and about half said they were Roman Catholics.
