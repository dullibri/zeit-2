HEADLINE: The Risks and the Benefits Of Letting Sick Banks Die

SERIES: Banks Under Stress - Fourth of five articles: Are Banks Dispensable?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
When banks fail, the carnage horrifies most onlookers. Not so some colder-blooded bankers and economists. They say bank failures, even huge ones, do not necessarily hurt, and may even help, the economy.
One reason is that there are too many banks starving for profit. Letting the hungriest ones die is good for the survivors, some argue. Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at the investment banking firm of Bear, Stearns & Company, said, "The end result will be a stronger, healthier banking system."
 
The Example of Texas
 Take one of the more spectacular basket cases, Texas. "If we looked at Texas, we'd see the future," Mr. Kudlow said. After oil and real estate prices collapsed in the mid-1980's, the Texas economy slumped, taking 7 of the state's 10 biggest banks with it. Two of the surviving three would have failed had an out-of-state buyer not rescued them. For all the pain, the Texas economy is stronger now than much of the rest of the country's, many economists say. 
 Some bankers themselves are not worried about bank failures. "You'd have to get an almost inconceivable rash of failures to take down enough banks to make a huge difference," John Rau, chief executive of LaSalle National Bank in Chicago, said in an interview.
This does not mean, however, that economists are unconcerned about the banking system. They are. But there are levels of concern.
They agree that some small banks can indeed be allowed to fail without far-reaching consequences. Most industrial countries have far fewer banks than the 12,926 that the United States has. Japan has 154; Canada, 66.
Economists do have strong disagreements about letting the big banks, even one big bank, fail. Some say those, too, should be allowed to go down in the flames of their own excess -- their making so many high-risk real estate loans, for example, or their financing of so many giant corporate mergers and acquisitions. Others say the punishment might be deserved, but that carrying it out could wreck the entire banking system.
They do all agree that the banking system itself must be preserved, even though many non-banking institutions -- investment houses and insurance companies, for example -- have invaded a portion of the money-lending business. Only the banks, they say, can really be in a position to keep the engines of the nation's economy humming: almost all American households and most of its businesses use banks to borrow money and, through checking accounts, to pay for what they buy. Without such credit and smooth flow of payments, the engines quickly halt.
Finally, though they find no evidence that the banking system is in any danger of collapse, virtually all agree that it has serious problems and that Congress must address them squarely in the weeks to come.
 
The Case for Attrition
 
Perils Seen In Protection
The arguing over the big banks is initiated by the "let 'em fail" school of thought, which contends that big-bank failures by themselves do not do permanent harm to the economy. To begin with, they say, the Federal Reserve can protect the economy from the fallout by regulating the supply of money. Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics, says the failure of a bank is no different from the failure of, say, Eastern Airlines. "So long as the quantity of money is kept from declining," he said, "bank failures have no greater effect than the failure of comparable commercial enterprises."
And it is clear that the banks, even the healthy ones, are not as important as they once were, or at least not as dominant in the money business. Borrowers and lenders have many more choices; funds supplied by life insurers, money markets, mutual funds, mortgage pools and checking accounts at brokerage houses have all ballooned. The banks' share of business lending has slipped from four-fifths, to two-thirds, since the early 1970's.
The failure of a large bank does create the risk that large uninsured deposits, especially money from other banks, will be lost, causing the other banks to fail. But some economists think the risk is trivial. "The short-run costs are quite minimal," said George G. Kaufman, a finance professor at Loyola University. He points out that most banks minimize their exposure by spreading their deposits around at several banks.
 
An Example From Chicago
 Take the case of the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois, a Chicago bank that dealt mostly with other banks and businesses. A post-mortem of the rescue showed that only two of Continental's customer banks would have lost more than half their capital had the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation not taken over Continental and absorbed the losses that would otherwise have been borne by large depositors.
But what happens to money that big depositors begin to quietly pull out of a big but weakening bank -- making a so-called silent run? "They put it in some other bank or money market mutual fund," said George J. Benston, an Emory University finance professor, who added that the money market fund was likely to put the money back into a bank C.D. "The money stays in the banking system," he said. "Silent runs just redistribute money from risky to safe banks."
According to James Moynihan, a bank analyst at Advest Inc. in Boston, this is precisely what is happening now: "Depositors are looking at bank rankings and are going from weak banks to stronger banks."
The American Bankers Association, which represents thousands of small banks and argues that small and large bank failures should be treated alike, says that providing unlimited Federal protection only for deposits at the big banks would create perverse incentives for depositors to keep their money in risky institutions, ultimately increasing the likelihood of bank failures. David L. Littman, a senior economist at the Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, said, "If everybody's safe, nobody's safe."
 
Too Big to Fail
 
Strong Support For Rescues
On the other hand, the "too big to fail" school contends that there are some banks whose failure would pose grave risks to the national economy. This line of thought is probably the majority view, at least among those with the power to do something about such things, and its adherents include the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who told a Senate committee in the summer, "There may be some banks, at some particular times, whose collapse and liquidation would be excessively disruptive to the financial system."
To buttress their position they, too, cite the Continental Illinois case. The Federal regulators then could not be certain that a chain reaction would not occur if they failed to bail out Continental. At the height of the crisis, Continental had $9 billion in overnight funds in London and deposits from hundreds of other banks.
C. Todd Conover, the head regulator in the Continental takeover and now a managing director of KPMG Peat Marwick, recalled: "We didn't know what would happen if those deposits were not honored. We weren't sure we knew all the linkages. But we didn't think it was a great opportunity to find out."
 
The Role of Foreign Deposits
 The international nature of banking has become as important a factor as any. If foreign banks and investors were to lose faith in the safety of United States banks, for example, and withdrew some of the billions they currently have on deposit in commercial banks in this country, the result could be severely wrenching. Robert Hormats, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs, said, "If our banking problems intensify, foreign money becomes more reluctant and costs more."
The collapse of a mid-sized West German bank in 1974 provided ample evidence of how quickly and how far one bank's problems can spread internationally. Testifying before the House Banking Committee last year, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve, said the Herstatt Bank collapse "created a lasting impression of the grave dangers associated with the sudden and uncontrolled collapse of an important financial institution, especially one with significant international operations."
When it closed, Herstatt was in the midst of completing millions of dollars worth of foreign exchange deals. As a result, banks had $620 million frozen in short-term Herstatt accounts. Their inability to get their money produced a chain reaction of other missed payments. As a result, the daily volume of transactions that originated overseas and were cleared by American banks dropped by roughly 25 percent in the days after the failure, temporarily disrupting the flow of payments that keeps the global economy going.
So now, minute by minute, the Federal Reserve monitors the balances of large banks that process international payments, like Citibank, Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan.
And in early January of this year, as the crisis at the Bank of New England mounted -- nearly a billion dollars was withdrawn in two days -- regulators detected a surge in withdrawals from other banks in the New England region. It was at this point that L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., and his regulators moved in and took over the bank, simultaneously announcing that they would guarantee all deposits in total, regardless of the $100,000 limit on insurance.
Paul Samuelson, a Nobel laureate in economics, who was in downtown Boston when news of the bank's insolvency started to spread, said: "Nobody could know what was going to happen when the Bank of New England started to shake. There were honest-to-goodness runs."
As a practical matter, most economists believe that keeping big banks open should at least remain an option, and they support the F.D.I.C.'s decision to do so at the Bank of New England. Mr. Litan of the Brookings Institution said, "Any responsible person would have done what Seidman did."
 
The Need for Banks
 
The Only Source For Many Loans
So the primary reason to prop up a big bank is to prevent a chain reaction that would break the banking system. But if the big investment and brokerage houses, insurance companies and industrial corporations have indeed invaded much of the traditional banking territory, why should anyone care whether banks survive? Can't the non-banking institutions simply step into the breach?
In truth, a nation must have a rock-solid banking system, in which the banks perform two basic functions the other institutions are simply not equipped to do on the scale required. If you did not have the banks, you would have to invent them.
First, they act as conduits between savers and borrowers, who, it is hoped, are skillful entrepreneurs. The well-run banks help channel resources to productive uses, and help reduce the inherent risks. Second, but of equal importance, they provide consumers and businesses with a place (checking accounts) to keep money that they will need back quickly; in this way, the banks handle nearly everybody's financial transactions.
 
Serving the Middle Market
 Despite the presence of the other institutions, most borrowers cannot easily bypass the banks: Individuals seeking unsecured credit, small businesses, home builders, homeowners -- most of them need banks. To lend to these groups you have to know the borrower and it is really only banks that have the distribution systems and the contacts.
"There hasn't been much erosion of banks' role in the middle market," said Tom Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers. After some bank failures, there has been anecdotal evidence that borrowers' lines of credit and commitments were blocked off, as other lenders pulled back. The borrowers least likely to find substitute sources of credit quickly are the small local businesses whose loans are too small to interest larger lenders.
Henry B. Ellis, former president of Mbank El Paso, said that in the late 1980's in Texas "the banking system completely stopped supplying capital."
"That eliminated liquidity within the Texas market," he said. "We had no access to other markets either." The key to the gradual recovery of the Texas economy was that the failed banks were bought by out-of-state banks.
Still, William C. Ferguson, president of Ferguson & Company, a Washington consulting company, said of situations in which another bank takes over one that has failed: "It's just extremely hard to replace those credits. The new loan officers don't know the company. Besides, acquiring banks are very cautious." Further, he added, failures encourage regulators to cast a colder eye on surviving banks.
 
Storehouses for Savings
 In addition to lending, banks provide a place for millions of depositors, small and large, to keep their money in insured accounts.
It is true that depositors have more choices than they used to; most money market funds allow shareholders to write checks on their accounts. But the fact is that 90 percent of all American households use banks or savings and loans for their checking accounts; the amount in money market funds is equal to about 10 percent of what is held in bank and savings and loans. And as the crucial links in a global payments' system, banks process most of the financial transactions that businesses, governments and households make. That makes the system vulnerable to disruptions.
Commercial banks clear nearly $2 trillion -- or 800 million separate transactions -- every day, by estimate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Only a tiny fraction, perhaps 1 percent, of all payments are made with cash.
 
Assessing the Dangers
 
The Differences From the 1930's
Despite the very real problems of the banks, nearly everyone agrees on one point: The banking system is not teetering on the edge of a 1930's abyss. "This is a different environment," said Henry Kaufman, president of the consulting firm Henry Kaufman & Company and a critic of the heavy borrowing and easy lending of the 1980's.
For starters, even the gloomiest prognosticators do not expect to see a repeat of the bank panics of the 30's, when more than a third of the nation's banks shut their doors. Not only is there a safety net that helps keep banks operating, but there are also no signs of the kind of severe deflation that destroyed banking assets during the Depression and caused borrowers to default on nearly 50 percent of the value of all bank loans. In the first nine months of 1990, the banks charged off only 1.5 percent of their loans, though that was more than twice the rate at the end of the 1982 recession. And while it is true that real estate prices are falling in many parts of the country, prices over all are still rising.
And most borrowers' incomes are not greatly endangered. H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said, "The ultimate collateral behind the banks' asset base is that the nation's income is extraordinarily stable." He pointed out that since World War II, total real disposable income has fallen in only one year, 1974, and then by only 1 percent. "Consumers have $17 trillion to $20 trillion in wealth," he said. "Nothing has happened to destroy that wealth."
Finally, it seems clear that if the nation's money supply did start to shrink, the Federal Reserve could be expected to step in, something it did not do in the 30's. John P. LaWare, one of the Federal Reserve's governors, said, "I wouldn't want to prejudge the votes of my five associates, but we would try to avoid repeating that mistake."

HEADLINE: About New York;
Haitians Talk Of New Pride And Going Home

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The usual crowd was coming and going at Augustine's Barber Shop at 172 Park Place in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn on Saturday morning. The shop looks like any barbershop with its striped poles and bathing beauty calendar, but a pile of French-language newspapers and snapshots on a mirror identify it as the Haitian meeting spot it is.
The photos show what happened to operatives of Jean-Claude Duvalier after the fall of his hated dictatorship in 1986. In one, a decapitated head sits in dirt. In another, one can barely discern that a pile of ashes used to be a human. 
 "Every 10 people I talk to, it seems like four or five are going back," said Sylvain Benoit, the barber who owns the shop. He recently bought it from the widow of Ferdinand Augustine. Mr. Augustine was shot to death by two youths for no apparent reason at 5:20 P.M. on Sept. 12 in front of the shop. The killers haven't been caught.
Mr. Benoit would rather have his friend than a barbershop. "That's not what he deserved. He was a hard-working person. He paid his taxes. He didn't bother anybody."
New York's Haitian diaspora is at a delicate point of transition. Most fled the bloody oppression of the Duvalier regime, then, brick by brick, built a new life here. They got a foothold, but, like all immigrants, live on the precarious margin where danger is greatest. And they face prejudice from both whites and native blacks.
So many feel they have never really belonged. With a new democratic government in Haiti, people talk and talk of returning.
A dinner dance at a Kennedy Airport hotel Sunday night suggested the dimensions of change. "100 Percent Haitian and Proud of It!" a banner proclaimed.
And there she was! Marjorie Judith Vincent, the Haitian American who reigns as Miss America, glittered in an elegant silver gown.
 There was other good news. Washington ended its ban on Haitian blood donors in December, admitting they are no more at risk of having AIDS than other groups. That followed a protest by tens of thousands of Haitians, suggesting to people who had long felt powerless that together they could exercise influence.
There was the shy presence of David Opont, who epitomized resistance to brutality by struggling to recover from the horror of being set afire in a robbery last March. The Haitian Americans, not used to having nationally admired heroes, clapped long and hard for him.
Others proudly mentioned that Pierre Toussaint, a Haitian American buried in New York, was moving steadily toward becoming the first black American saint.
Just getting together was cause for celebration. The dinner dance was the first gathering of the Greater Haitian Economic Development Corporation, a new group dedicated to addressing the community's needs.
By far the most important thing, though, was the sea change back home. The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was inaugurated on Feb. 7 as Haiti's President, suggesting the sun is rising after the 29-year darkness of the Duvalier dictatorship and the five years of violent confusion that followed it. "Rebirth of a Nation" was the celebration's theme.
Haiti never looked better. "My parents would love to go back," Miss America said.
Many at the barbershop -- where the sounds were of endlessly clipping scissors, a TV wrestling match and Haitian Creole -- felt the same way.
Michael Pardovany, a hospital floor waxer. said that he hoped to buy land and move back in five years. "Back home is a nice country," he said. "We don't have money, but people have respect."
Joseph Pierre, a cabdriver, wants to try to set up a business in Haiti. "Everybody loves his country," he said.
Fritz Darius, also a cabdriver, said he would return if he found work. He longs to return to Petite Riviere, a farm town of 4,000 north of Port-au-Prince. "This place is too fast for me," he said.
Wesner Jean, a clerk in a nursing home, was proud to show off the envelope of $5 bills he had collected from fellow workers to aid the Haitian Government. He too would like to return. But his children, two in American colleges, have never learned Creole.
The question for many is whether homesick Haitians who have built a life here, however imperfect, will throw away hard-won gains. "I really can't complain," allowed Rene Jeantine, a carpenter.
And going back to a new Haiti, still the hemisphere's poorest country, might not be easy.
At the banquet, Pierre Armand, chairman of the new group, said that he returned in 1979 to work on economic reform. But he came back in five years. "I couldn't take it," he said.

HEADLINE: Cases Under 'Sam' Law: Notorious but Few

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Their names conjure up memories of some of the most notorious crimes in recent New York history -- Jean Harris, Mark David Chapman, Jack Henry Abbott, to name a few.
In fact, there are only a few. Only 10 cases have come before the New York State Crime Victims Board under the so-called Son of Sam law since it was enacted in 1977, and the Son of Sam case itself was not one of them. In all, the board has taken $134,000 from criminals and handed out $71,450 to victims. 
 "This is small-time stuff," said Angelo Petromelis, a member of the victims board. By comparison, he said, it distributed $12 million in 1990 alone to 11,125 crime victims not involved in Son of Sam cases.
The real issue, he said, "is whether the principle in social justice -- that people who commit these crimes should not be able to enrich themselves -- violates freedom of speech."
"That's what the Supreme Court is going to decide," Mr. Petromelis said.
 
Five Years in Escrow
 Contrary to popular perception, the Son of Sam law does not prohibit criminals from reaping profits from their stories. "The money is not confiscated," Mr. Petromelis said. "We hold the money in escrow until a civil court determines whether the criminal owes money to a victim." If no claims are upheld after five years, the money reverts to the criminal.
Of the 10 cases handled under the law, said Lorraine Felegy, the board's general counsel, three have involved relatively unknown criminals. "But the other seven are major cases," she said.
The case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear involves Henry Hill, a mobster who was paid for his story in "Wiseguy," a book written by Nicholas Pileggi that became the basis for the movie "Goodfellas." In 1987, after Simon & Schuster paid Mr. Hill more than $96,000, the victims board ruled that the money should go to the families of Mr. Hill's victims if any appeared to claim it. None have.
Two other cases are being adjudicated. One involves Jean Harris, who was convicted of murdering her lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower, the "Scarsdale Diet" doctor, and who wrote about it in "A Stranger in Two Worlds."
 
Sicilian Who Was Poisoned
 The other involves Michele Sindona, the Sicilian financier who was involved in the collapse of several banks and who was found dead of poisoning in prison in 1986. He had cooperated on a book, "Power on Earth," agreeing that payments would go to his son.
In the case of Mark David Chapman, the man who killed John Lennon, the board has placed in escrow $8,626 that Mr. Chapman received for a magazine article. "The only ones that could get a judgment, I think, are Lennon's son or his wife," Mr. Petromelis said.
The board has collected $15,818 from Jack Henry Abbott, who was convicted of stabbing a young actor to death outside an East Village restaurant in 1981. Mr. Abbott, who spent much of his life in prison, became a celebrated author after he wrote a book about his life, "In the Belly of the Beast." After the killing of Richard Adan, an actor and waiter at the restaurant, Mr. Abbott wrote another book, "My Return." Mr. Petromelis said the board was awaiting a final determination on damages in a suit brought by Mr. Adan's family.
No one has sought damages against R. Foster Winans, the former Wall Street Journal columnist who was convicted of inside trading and who wrote a book about it, 'Trading Secrets." But the board is holding $20,029 of Mr. Winans's money.
 
'Dog Day' Case
 The only case in which any victims have been paid involves John Wojtowicz, the bank robber portrayed in the movie, "Dog Day Afternoon."
"This was the very first case we collected on," Mr. Petromelis said. "We got $75,062. Of that, $20,000 was paid out to Robert Barrett, the bank manager.
"Then there were two tellers: Maureen Tosto, she got $15,000, and Santa Morello, she got $19,500," Mr. Petromelis continued. "Then his ex-wife was paid $16,950." Mr. Petromelis said the board has collected $14,411 more from continuing showings of the movie.
Paradoxically, the law has not been invoked in the Son of Sam case. When the law was written, it covered only convicted criminals. But David Berkowitz, the suspect in a series of murders that gripped New York City in the late 1970's, was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial.
"There was a book and approximately $120,000 that was to go to him," Ms. Felegy said. "Eventually, in 1987, a court ended up distributing the $120,000 to a number of the victims.
"That's what would have happened if we could have applied the statute," she added. Since then, the law has been amended to cover such cases.

HEADLINE: Surprise Gain At Hewlett: Stock Jumps

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company today reported unexpectedly strong earnings, attributing the gain to sales of new products and cost-cutting efforts. Analysts said the quarter's strong results could mark the end of a malaise gripping the computer company that last year prompted the return of its co-founder and chairman, David Packard, to active management.
The numbers were well above Wall Street analysts' estimates and sent the company's stock soaring $5.50, or 13.7 percent, to $45.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the Big Board's third most active, with a volume of 2.7 million shares, and the percentage gain was within the top 10 for the day.
 
New Machines Due
 Analysts said the stock move also reflected anticipation that new line of computer work stations to be introduced soon would be owerful and competitive. 
 For its first fiscal quarter, ended Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $205 million, or 83 cents a share, up 18.4 percent from $173 million, or 72 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Its revenues rose nearly 10 percent, to $3.4 billion from $3.1 billion.
"If you'd asked most analysts on the Street, they were expecting flat-to-down earnings," said Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist Inc. in San Francisco. "This is at least a dime's worth of surprise."
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said its sales gains were strong across all its major product lines, including large multi-user computers, work stations, personal computers and printers. Orders grew 12 percent over the first quarter of last year, to $3.7 billion. Domestic orders grew 3 percent, while those from outside the country grew 20 percent.
Besides the sales gains, Hewlett-Packard's bottom line benefited from reduced expenses. The company shut down for the December holidays and cut employment by 1,000 positions during the quarter through hiring controls and attrition. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses totaled 37.7 percent, compared with 38.8 percent.
"Our backlog increased by $300 million during the quarter, but we remain cautious in light of continuing economic and political uncertainties, including weakness in the U.S. economy," said John A. Young, the president and chief executive.
 
Testing Sun and I.B.M.
 Next month, Hewlett-Packard is expected to announce a new line of work stations based on RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, which will significantly outperform comparably priced machines from Sun Microsystems Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation. Analysts say the new machines, whose prices will start at $12,000, will do much to regain market share for Hewlett-Packard from its rivals.
The new work stations "will signal that Hewlett-Packard is back and they're mad," said Mr. Herwick of Hambrecht & Quist. "Everything one hears about the performance of these new systems is amazing."
Rather than compete directly with Sun for the lowest price, Hewlett-Packard is likely to challenge its rivals on the basis of price for performance, said Russell Crabs, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn.
"The performance of these boxes will beat even I.B.M.," he said. "On a price-performance basis, they're going to look very inexpensive."

HEADLINE: Trying to Economize, New York Creates Its Own Alcatraz

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PINE CITY, N.Y., Feb. 14

 BODY:
On a broad, flat tract of land here along the drably named Institution Road, New York State is transforming a modern maximum-security prison into its own version of Alcatraz.
While hardly as escape proof as the Federal penitentiary on an island in San Francisco Bay was, the New York prison, Southport Correctional Facility, has the same mission: to take the worst prisoners. They will include those who have dealt drugs behind bars, attacked guards, even murdered inmates. At Southport, they are being kept isolated, shackled at the waist and wrists when allowed out of their 6-by-10-foot cells and made to spend their daily recreation hour in newly built cages. 
 Troublesome inmates in New York's 66 other prisons have usually been moved to wings of Spartan "special housing units," where all but their most basic privileges are removed. But since the beginning of this year, about 300 of these prisoners have been sent to Southport, a three-story, 798-cell prison about 50 miles west of Binghamton.
More are on the way, and state officials expect the transformation of the prison to be complete by April 1. Among the inmates will be 126 who are in protective custody because they are considered at risk from other inmates. As the new inmates are moved in, Southport's other inmates are being transferred to other prisons.
Civil libertarians criticize the absence of rehabilitation and strict limits on inmates' movement, like the use of cages and shackles, that they say will make the inmates more intransigent. But prison authorities say that special housing has long been used and that Southport simply consolidates that practice.
 
Sharply Different Mission
 Consolidating unruly inmates in one prison will save about $3 million a year in salaries at Southport, said James Flateau, a spokesman for the Correctional Services Department. He also said it would relieve pressure on overcrowded special-housing wards in other prisons.
When Southport opened in September 1988, it offered extensive classes and clean hallways under one roof. Now the staff, faced with a sharply different mission, is wrestling with the logistical puzzle of confining special-housing inmates.
"We're looking at a much more complicated situation," said Robert J. McClellan, Southport's superintendent. "We have been here seven days a week working on this."
 
Meals in Cells
 Southport was suited for the new use because of its recent design and extensive security features, the superintendent said.
Special-housing inmates are let out of their cells infrequently. At Southport, they leave the cells for showers twice a week, a haircut every few weeks and an occasional visit from the outside. Meals are delivered to inmates' cells. In a corner of the prison yard used for recreation, workers have been building cages. Some of the pens, measuring 16 by 8 feet, are for individ ual inmates to exercise in. Larger ones will be for up to four inmates.
Guards are receiving special instruction, Mr. McClellan said. "Every day the corrections officers will have to deal personally with inmates," he said.
"There will be a lot of one-on-one contact, or should I say, two-on-one contact, and the officer has to relate well with the inmates."
Since the program began, there have been more than a dozen cases of special-housing inmates throwing urine and feces at guards and there have been a couple of fights in the recreation pens, Mr. McClellan said. But he said there had been fewer problems than he had anticipated. To protect the guards from being pelted and sprayed, workers are installing plastic to cover the metal-mesh doors of the cells.
Southport ended its vocational and academic classes on Feb. 1, and the instructional wing is now being emptied of chairs, tables, chalkboards. The equipment and most of the teaching staff of 25 are being moved to nearby prisons. Three senior teachers have stayed at Southport. They spend their days going from cell to cell, dispensing books and briefly conducting lessons through the locked cell gates, always remaining outside them.
 
'It Had to Be Done'
 "This place used to be as clean as a hospital," one teacher being transferred remarked recently. "Now it's all torn up. It's sad."
Many workers said they were upset about being transferred but understand that the system needs such a prison. "It had to be done some place in the state, but it's unfortunate we got picked for the job," said Mike Woodhouse, who teaches a vocational class and is being moved to another prison.
Like the prison teachers, the chaplains plan to visit inmates cell by cell.
"I am not sure what it's going to prove," said Sister Josepha Twomey, a nun who is the prison's chaplain for Catholic inmates, "locking somebody up 23 hours a day, particularly for six months or a year or two years."
When the prison is completely converted to its new purpose, by April 1, the staff will have shrunk to 350 from 450, officials say. About 44 of the staff reductions will be corrections officers, all of whom have been transferred. While the dangerous inmates remain isolated, Southport's 126 inmates in protective custody are being given relatively more freedom than they might receive in a less-secure prison, officials say. These inmates are the ones now doing the jobs traditionally reserved for prisoners, like working in the kitchen and laundry.
It is this last feature that has prompted prisoners' rights advocates to term the program a mixed blessing. They praise the increased security for inmates in protective inmates but question whether the dangerous inmates can be rehabilitated.
 
'The Traditional Technique'
 Ed Koren of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project said grouping these prisoners might lead to more tension and confrontation with guards.
"As a separate facility it may be something new," Mr. Koren said, "but it's the traditional technique to segregate and isolate your problems. If you lock up a person for long periods of time, without any programs, you're not going to change his mind. You're going to leave them more embittered than when they came in."
Prison officials say they wonder if they will have enough staff to handle the inmates when the program is fully operating. They say, for example, that it takes seven minutes to shackle an inmate when he leaves his cell. That has not been a problem in winter, when few inmates care to brave the cold outside. The question, said Melvin Hollins, the first deputy superintendent, is "what will things be like on July 4?"

HEADLINE: Gas Is Nearing Pre-invasion Price

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The price of gasoline at the pump is within a penny of where it was before the Persian Gulf crisis began in August, not counting tax increases, according to a survey released yesterday by the American Automobile Association.
According to the association, the price fell 2.9 cents last week, to $1.135 a gallon for unleaded regular self-serve. That is 6 cents a gallon higher than last summer's pre-invasion price. But Federal taxes rose 5 cents a gallon on Dec. 1. 
 The nationwide average price is also affected by tax increases by individual states. For example, Massachusetts raised its tax by 4 cents a gallon on Jan. 1, Delaware by 3 cents, Arizona by a cent and many Florida counties also raised their taxes.
 
Price Drops Likely to Continue
 The association declined to say that the drop last week actually put the price lower than what it was before the invasion, when tax increases are excluded. But Jerry Cheske, a spokesman, said the price was down in 8 of the last 10 weeks, and would probably fall again, holding out the likelihood that gasoline prices may sink below August's level.
Since the invasion, the peak price measured by the association in its weekly survey of 1,250 stations around the country was $1.387 a gallon on Dec. 4. That was one-tenth of a cent under the all-time peak recorded by the organization, just before the Easter holiday in 1981, during the oil shock brought on by the fall of the Shah of Iran.
Mr. Cheske said the recent fall in prices "goes against the perception that gas prices go up quickly and come down slowly." He added, "They are going down fairly rapidly now." He noted that prices usually declined around this time of year, but not as rapidly as they were now.
John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said if the price today was numerically equal to the price in August, it was lower in real terms because inflation was running at 4 to 5 percent a year.
Mr. Lichtblau said that for consumers, the impact of the crisis "has been over for practical purposes for the last three or four weeks." He added: "I get this naive question, How come the prices only go up, they never go down? All you have to do is watch the prices at the pump; they clearly do go down."
And the price may go lower, he said, because crude supplies were ample, and after the war, "some oil from Iraq and Kuwait might come into the market, but not instantly."
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil closed yesterday at $20.07, down 81 cents. Oil had traded in that range in July, and went above $41 a barrel in October. In contrast, gasoline's maximum increase was only about 30 percent.
 
Touchy Issue for Consumers
 Gasoline prices have been an exceptionally touchy point with the public. Another sensitive point has been oil company profits, which jumped sharply in the last quarter of 1990, mostly because the crude oil pumped from company wells was suddenly worth substantially more.
But not everyone is happy that pump prices have almost returned to August's level because prices at intermediate levels, and market shares, have changed. James G. Daskal, the general counsel of the Service Station Dealers of America, said his organization's 60,000 members had been through "the worst period for service station dealers since decontrol, in 1982."
Mr. Daskal said, and autombile association numbers confirm, that dealers were not able to pass through all of the 5-cent-a-gallon Federal tax increase on Dec. 1. In addition, Mr. Daskal said, the markups of dealers had thinned as prices rose, and were still in the range of 1 to 3 cents a gallon of unleaded, compared with 2 to 4 cents when the crisis began. Worse, he said, dealers make 10 cents a gallon or so on premium grades, but those sales "have just gone out the window," as motorists switched back to less expensive lower-octane fuel.

HEADLINE: Skinner Testifies on Airlines

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said today that the nation's airline industry, rocked by huge debts, low traffic, rising fuel costs and recession, would remain competitive.
Despite pressure from the Congress and the industry, Mr. Skinner, in testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, appeared to rule out any significant bailout for the troubled carriers. "Of one thing we are confident, consolidation is no grounds for panic," he said. 
 Mr. Skinner said the industry's financial difficulties had produced almost desperate marketing strategies by carriers and "some incredible air fare bargains."
But he said that unrealisticaly low prices were bad in the long run and that airlines must cover their costs or eventually go out of business.
So far this year, Eastern Airlines ceased operating, and Pan Am filed for bankruptcy protection.
Continental Airlines Holdings also is operating under bankruptcy protection, and Trans World Airlines has said it may be forced into Chapter 11.
Mr. Skinner told reporters that the Administration opposed a plan by some industry members to allow airlines to retain a 10 percent ticket tax.

Candles in the Snow Honor Suffering

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass., Feb. 19

 BODY:
The vigil began here barely an hour after a man carrying a cardboard peace sign strode to the center of the town common on Monday afternoon, doused himself with paint thinner and perished in a plume of fire seconds after striking a match.
All day and all night in a snow that turned to freezing drizzle, people laid flowers, fruit and candles where the man died, and hundreds of students and townspeople turned out for a memorial service on the common this afternoon, even before the police had released the victim's name. 
 The public self-immolation of 30-year-old Gregory D. Levey, the third American known to have burned himself to death in apparent protest of United States policy in the Persian Gulf, would probably produce pity and bewilderment anywhere else. But here in a university town that has been a focal point for antiwar activities and other protests, it generated instant martyrdom.
Even as some of their fellow students berated them for glorifying the sorry deed of a disturbed individual, many people at the vigil said they hoped that his death would bring some cohesion to a protest movement that has floundered.
"This man said the war was wrong, and he made the ultimate sacrifice," Jennifer Cannon, a 22-year-old junior at the University of Massachusetts, said of Mr. Levey.
Mr. Levy, who graduated from UMass in 1984 with an English degree, worked sporadically as a substitute teacher in nearby South Hadley and had no known links to any local antiwar groups. A Hampshire College student, Aaron Fincke, who along with Ms. Cannon and several other students stayed up all night keeping candles lighted at the death site, said Mr. Levey's suicide was "more than just a rash act of someone on the edge."
"It was a moral outcry," he said.
The vigil in the cold here quickly became a blend of mourning and protest. Candles were passed among the crowd, Buddhist chants were recited, and signs reading "Stop This Crazy War" and "Talks Not Troops" were held aloft.
"There's no question about it, this poor soul overnight became a kind of a cult hero," said Timothy Banks, the owner of a shoe store across the street. "Nobody seems to really know a thing about him, but these kids have turned this man's death into a rallying point."
The events began shortly after 1:50 P.M. on Monday, when Mr. Levey, several witnesses said, quietly walked to the center of the common and began stuffing his shirt and pants with newspapers.
After dousing himself with the thinner, which the police said he had bought shortly before at a nearby hardware store, he lighted one match that went out, then a second that quickly ignited the thinner. He raised his arms once, then fell into the fetal position.
"It was just a lot of billowing black smoke," said Jeffrey Kittay of Rye, N.Y., who was visiting Amherst with a high-school-age son. "Several people, myself included, tried to put the fire out with our coats, but it just wasn't possible."
A police officer arrived a few minutes later and put out the fire with an extinguisher, but by that time Mr. Levey's torso was horribly burned.
"At first, it looked like one of those trash fires," said Ernie Follansbee, the manager of the shoe store across the street. "Then I got over there and I saw legs sticking out with argyle socks and loafers, and I said, 'My God, there was a human being in there.' "
Mr. Levey, who was the son of Robert Levey, the restaurant critic for The Boston Globe, and stepson of Ellen Goodman, a Globe columnist, lived by himself three blocks from where he died. Both his landlord and a work associate described him as deeply reclusive. The associate, Cecilia Buckley, said he had worked intermittently as a substitute teacher at a nonprofit agency that provides special-education services.
Mr. Levey's act reminded some of a Life magazine photograph of a Vietnamese Buddhist monk burning himself in protest during the Vietnam War. "But I think it has Christian elements as well," said Elizabeth Ahearn, who at 2 A.M. was holding a candle against the wind and rain. "You take upon yourself the pain of the world."
Others paid respect to the victim but did not approve of what he did. "To have a sign that says stop the killing and then go kill yourself doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?" said Gordon Fletcher-Howell, a Vietnam War veteran.
The two other incidents involving self-immolation in protest of the gulf conflict occurred in Northern California. At least eight Americans burned themselves to death in the Vietnam War-era protests.
There has not been unanimity about the gulf war. Indeed, a small group of Amherst student lined up at the edge of the common early today, singing "God Bless America" and "The Star-Spangled Banner" and urging support for President Bush.
An economics professor at UMass, Samuel Bowles, recalled the departure of a student who had been called up for duty in Saudi Arabia. The day he left, Professor Bowles asked him to stand in a lecture hall. "There was just an explosion of applause for him," Mr. Bowles said. "And this was in a class where if you asked for people's opinion on the war policy, I think that almost all would say they were opposed."

HEADLINE: Limited's Net Climbs 12.5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Limited Inc. said today its fourth-quarter profits rose by 12.5 percent from a year earlier as sales increased 10.2 percent.
The specialty apparel retailer said it earned $172.2 million, or 48 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 2. That compared with $153.1 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Sales increased to $1.74 billion from $1.58 billion a year ago.
Limited has fared better than other retailers whose earnings were hit hard by the recession and the Gulf War. Uncertain consumers have sharply curtailed their spending for clothes and other non-essentials.
Leslie H. Wexner, company chairman, said improved performances by the Victoria's Secret store and catalog operations and the Lane Bryant division were responsible for the company's higher earnings.
For the full year, the company earned $398.4 million, or $1.10 a share, up 14.6 percent, from $346.9 million, or 96 cents a share, the previous year.
Sales rose 13 percent to $5.25 billion from $4.65 billion a year ago.
Limited operates 3,864 specialty stores through Limited Stores, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, Express, Victoria's Secret, Structure, Limited Too, Abercrombie & Fitch, Henri Bendel, Cacique, Victoria's Secret Bath Shops, Bath and Body Works, and Penhaligon's.
It also distributes apparel through the Victoria's Secret, Lane Bryant Direct, Roaman's and Lerner Direct catalogues.

HEADLINE: French Company Makes Bid Of $1.8 Billion for Square D

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The Square D Company, a big electrical-equipment manufacturer that has been the object of much takeover speculation in recent months, said today that a French company had proposed acquiring it for roughly $1.8 billion.
Square D, based in Palatine, Ill., outside Chicago, made its announcement after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Square D shares rose $1.75, to $52, compared with the bid of $78 a share. The stock is expected to open sharply higher on Wednesday, but whether it actually rises to $78 will depend on investors' perception of the chances that the bidder, Groupe Schneider, another giant electrical-equipment manufacturer, will succeed. 
 That remained unclear tonight. In a letter to Jerre L. Stead, Square D's chairman and chief executive, Groupe Schneider's chairman, Didier Pineau-Valencienne, asked that Square D directors consider the bid by March 1. In a statement, Square D said it would respond "in due course."
But the initial indication from Square D was that it would resist. Mr. Stead said in a statement that it was in the best interests of Square D's shareholders "to operate independently" and for Square D "to pursue its long-term strategic plan." Mr. Pineau-Valencienne, meanwhile, in his letter to Mr. Stead, indicated that the two companies had been talking for nearly two years and it was only because the talks had been unsuccessful that Groupe Schneider was now proceeding with a takeover proposal.
It was also unclear whether the offer was hostile. On the one hand, the offer was made despite the wish of Square D's senior management to remain independent. But Mr. Pineau-Valencienne said in a statement that his offer was contingent on Square D board approval and that his company was prepared to discuss "all aspects" of the proposal -- including, presumably, price. In a telephone interview from Paris, Mr. Pineau-Valencienne said, "We have made our proposal in a friendly way and we hope that our arguments will be looked at in a positive way by the board."
Still, analysts said that Groupe Schneider's $78-a-share proposal, which came in the form of the letter to Mr. Stead rather than through a formal tender offer, might be hard for Square D's directors to turn down. The analysts noted that the proposed takeover price represented a 50 percent premium over Square D's closing price today and that the company's stock had traded as low as $33 in the last year.
In Groupe Schneider's favor, Square D has not been doing well of late. Its operating earnings fell 9 percent in the fourth quarter, to $41 million. Full-year operating earnings dropped 12 percent, to $178 million. And sales have been flat. The company's results reflect the general slowdown in economic activity. As the economy has sunk into recession, factories have ordered less of Square D's automation equipment, and orders from utilities for Square D's electricl distribution gear have also slumped.
 
Ideal Combination Is Seen
 But Mr. Pineau-Valencienne said in the telephone interview that Square D and Groupe Schneider would make an ideal combination given the two companies' similar product lines and geographic fortes. Square D is a leading player in the electrical-equipment business in this country, whereas Groupe Schneider is a powerhouse in the same product markets in Europe.
At a time of increasing globalization in the electrical-equipment business -- Siemens and Westinghouse, for instance, have announced various cooperative ventures -- a combination of Square D with Groupe Schneider would create the world's largest maker of medium- and low-voltage distribution equipment. A Square D-Groupe Schneider combination would also have the No. 1 position in control devices for electro-mechanical automation equipment.
"It is an industrial proposal, not a financial proposal," Mr. Pineau-Valencienne said.
Although not well known among consumers, both companies are giants. Based in Paris, Groupe Schneider employs 80,000 people and reported sales in 1990 of 50 billion francs, or about $10 billion, and net income is expected to be around 930 million francs, or $186 million. Square D employs about 21,000 people and has sales of roughly $1.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Youth Critically Wounded at School

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A 15-year-old boy waiting for his brother outside a Brooklyn school was shot in the head and critically wounded yesterday, the police said.
The youth, Antione Robinson, was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition last night and undergoing brain-scan tests, a hospital administrator, Frances Sasso, said. 
 The police last night charged a 14-year-old with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. They said Mr. Robinson was shot at 3:15 P.M. at the corner of Hull Street and Saratoga Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, outside Junior High School 271.
Lieut. Eugene Albright, commander of the 73d Precinct homicide squad, said "one member of one group fired into the other group" as they faced each other about half a block apart. He said the groups of youths had had confrontations before.
Lying with a blood-soaked bandage around his head in the emergency room at Brookdale Hospital last night, the teen-age victim said he was shot as he tried to stop several youths from harassing his brother. He said he had not seen who shot him.
 
Joking in Emergency Room
 The youth talked to a reporter who had entered the room without permission of the hospital but identified himself to the youth and an uncle, who stood at the side of the gurney. The youth fell asleep from time to time but when awake, he spoke calmly and coherently and even joked at times with his uncle. As he talked, he fingered his intravenous tubes. He said he had lost feeling on his right side,
Mr. Robinson, who attends Boys and Girls High School and aspires to be an actor, said he tried every day to pick up his 12-year-old brother, Shaliek, because of the dangers at the junior high school.
"Kids start trouble and I don't want my brother to be in any of it," he said. "I try to pick him up every day."
Yesterday, he said, he left Boys and Girls with two friends to pick up Shaliek to play Nintendo's Captain Skyhawk video game at the red-brick apartment house where he lives with his mother, a sister and two brothers.
 
'These Guys Started Trouble'
 "I met up with them at the school and all these guys started trouble," he said. "They didn't want to take anything; they just wanted to fight. When I got there they were beefing with my brother.
"I walk up and said what's the beef? Next thing I know I'm shot."
The uncle, Michael Robinson, 33, who is unemployed, described Antione as a headstrong but decent young man. He said Antione felt a special responsibility toward his family because he is the oldest male. Antione's father died of a stroke two years ago, Mr. Robinson said.
"He's very determined," Mr. Robinson said. "He knows what he wants out of life. He wants what's best for his family, his brothers and sisters."
"I know what he's going through, he added. "I've been in here under similiar conditions myself. I got into a knife fight during a gang war."
He continued: "I just don't know about this world anymore. They send all our brothers and sisters overseas to fight in this war and they got the biggest war right here."
The gun used was not recovered. A spent 9-millimeter shell was discovered near the scene of the shooting, and investigators said they believed a 9-millimeter bullet hit the teen-ager.

HEADLINE: New Age (Relax!) Comes to Turbulent Poland

BYLINE: By GABRIELLE GLASER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Edward Mielnik took a long draw on his Marlboro, sipped a cup of sweetened black coffee -- his third in an hour -- and told the crowd gathered at the International Center for People and Earth Renewal that their biggest problem was stress. "You all need to relax, to breathe better," he said.
Although its forum would hardly be recognizable in Marin County, the new age is dawning in Poland. While Poland has few hot tubs, new-age "guides," as they are called here, see their inspirational mission as particularly essential in a country where many are worried about the turbulent transition to capitalism. 
 "It is in these troubled times that people seek us," said Mr. Mielnik, who instructs about 100 people in "united relaxation therapy" each week.
"People are worried about their health, their futures, the future of the country, the problems of the Earth," said Mr. Mielnik, who does not count cigarettes or caffeine consumption among the threats he sees. Sitting at his desk beneath a portrait of the planet Saturn, he reached for a plate of chocolate eclairs kept for visitors. "We are a contact center for these people," he said. "That's why I'm here."
In the last few years, holistic healing centers, massage-therapy studios, gyms, natural-food stores, "breathing clinics" and other establishments intended to promote well-being have sprung up throughout the country.
Many who visit such centers, as well as those who run them, say the clinics offer solace to Poles who have broken with the Roman Catholic Church but still long for spirituality in their daily lives. Many believe that the treatments are a natural outgrowth of folk medicine, long a tradition in Poland and other Eastern European countries. Some say the interest in nowy wiek, as new age is called here, is another example of the growing influence of the West. American movies are shown in almost every Warsaw theater. There are fan clubs for Cable News Network broadcasters, who are seen a few minutes a day on Polish television.
Whatever the reason, the spread of new age is part of a national search for a cultural and social equilibrium. If the drab ways imposed by Soviet-style Communism are dead and buried, what next? While few here see the new-age activities as threatening, many worry that democracy will lead to a cultural invasion, a McDonaldization of Poland. And so Poles are now trying on various styles. Some will undoubtedly persist; others will be as forgotten as Marxist-Leninist political theory.
Anna Skowronska, a 31-year-old massage therapist in Warsaw, said that she had sought alternative styles of living for a decade, but that she had been hindered by the Government and the church before settling into her current profession a year ago. "Under Communism, to be different was unthinkable," she said. "And the church does not encourage people to be independent, so it has been kind of difficult."
More than 90 percent of Poles identify themselves as Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church has often been seen as the country's strongest center of power, and ever since Poland's first democratic government took office in June 1989, the church has exerted force in a number of ways. Last summer, it put pressure on the legislature to introduce voluntary religious education in public schools, and it has urged lawmakers to ban abortions, the country's most common form of birth control, in a vote expected later this year.
"In Poland in my lifetime there have been two forces: the Communist Party and the Catholic Church," Mrs. Skowronska said. "There was never room for anything else. Now there is, and I want to be a part of it."
There are few resources to which Poles can turn to sort out the difficulties of life here: the average monthly wage is $100 and while many consumer goods are now available, their prices are out of reach to many Poles. Inflation has risen about 200 percent over the past year.
Poland's alcoholism rate is among the highest in the world, and doctors say depression strikes a great number of people. Psychotherapy has yet to achieve the wide acceptance in Poland that it has in the United States.
Mr. Mielnik blames both Poland's former Communist regime and the Catholic Church for causing "neuroses" among his countrymen. "We help people draw positive energy from their inner selves and their environment to help neutralize the negatives," he said.
Agnieszka Kaminska is among those who swear by the new treatments available in Poland, and goes twice a week to work out and take breathing instructions at the "harmonizing gym" in a fashionable Warsaw neighborhood. Mrs. Kaminska, who is 30 years old, gave birth to her third baby in three years last November and hopes not only to lose some of the weight she put on but also to gain some peace of mind.
"Since I have been coming here I have fewer worries," she said as she stretched to the rhythms of airy flute music in the green gym. "I have learned to breathe better, to exhale some of my stresses. With three babies there is a lot of noise in the house."
Many Poles -- Government statistics say one in three -- have relatives living in the United States, mostly in Chicago and the Northeast. But California, many say, is the golden state of their dreams.
"We understand life isn't perfect in California," said Agata Rychlowicz, 24, a doctoral student in American Literature at Jagiellonian University in Cracow. "There is crime and poverty and earthquakes. But it still seems like a sunny place of enlightenment where people are happy."
Others, like Mrs. Skowronska, the massage therapist, have another theory.
"The Earth is divided between plus and minus, negative and positive," she said. "Poland is in between. In India, for instance, people are more interested in spiritual things than they are in material goods. In New York I think people want money more than they want calm. I'm not sure where California lies, but it must be like Poland, in an in-between zone."

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Falling Short of Victory

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Moscow is trying to do to the U.S. in the Persian Gulf in 1991 what Washington did to Britain and France in the Suez crisis of 1956. Then, these U.S. allies did not have the power to rebuff American demands for a cease-fire in the war against Nasser's Egypt. Today, the U.S. can resist Soviet pressures, and apparently has -- and should.
 President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles prevented their allies from gaining a clear-cut military success and capitalizing on it. Nasser was thus salvaged as an Arab champion and transformed imminent military defeat into political victory. 
 President Bush is rightly reluctant to surrender his decisive military advantages in return for a muddy political settlement. Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal would require Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, but it would also unacceptably preserve Iraq's existing military power and protect Saddam Hussein's political position.
 The parallels between the Suez and gulf crises are by no means exact, yet they are remarkable.
 After a series of U.S. diplomatic blunders, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. Britain and France argued that this threatened their vital oil link to the gulf. They conceived a plan for Israel to attack Egypt and for them to intervene between the combatants as a cover to topple Nasser.
 Mr. Eisenhower recounted a letter from Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister, as "equat[ing] any exercise of allied restraint and patience to the arguments that had prevailed during the rise of Hitler during the years prior to 1939" and arguing that Nasser's plan was to expand his power until he could "hold the Western world for ransom".
 Mr. Dulles maintained that European worries about being denied oil were "exaggerated." Ike rejected the Hitler analogy and argued that Nasser was essentially an Arab nationalist who symbolized "the desire for slapping the white man down."
 Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles couched their public statements in the language of anti-colonialism and international law. But what they really worried about was Moscow's exploitation of Arab nationalism to entrench itself in the Middle East. When push came to shove, they posed as defenders of Arab nationalism and forsook their allies to achieve the larger goal of containing Communism.
 Through the U.N., they forced their allies into an immediate cease-fire and an unconditional withdrawal. Had the allies and Israel been given a bit more time for military victory, and had they and the U.S. followed up with offers to mediate Arab-Israeli conflicts and promote economic development, the Middle East might have been spared its tempestuous future.
 Now, the Soviets say they want to prevent further bloodshed and the political upheavals that might attend a bloody end to the gulf war -- and remove Iraq from Kuwait. Those aims coincide with Washington's. But Moscow also seeks to enhance its role in the region by trying to limit sharply what the U.S. and its allies can demand of Saddam Hussein.
 Mr. Gorbachev keeps faith with Mr. Bush by pressing for immediate, complete and unconditional Iraqi departure from Kuwait. But apparently he would allow Iraq to leave with all its arms and thus permit Baghdad to remain an imminent threat to its neighbors.
 Mr. Gorbachev's proposal also apparently calls for the partial lifting of the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq. This would do nothing to guard against a renewed long-term threat from Iraq.
 After a cease-fire, the sanctions represent the coalition's only instrument to insure that Baghdad will have to destroy its nuclear, chemical and biological facilities and stockpiles. It is the only tool to make more difficult Iraq's manufacture and purchase of better long-range missiles.
 The point here is not that Mr. Bush should appear bloodthirsty and reject the Soviet ideas out of hand; rather he should do what he apparently has done, privately press Moscow to demand much more of Baghdad.
 Nor is the point that he should immediately launch a ground attack. The games now being played by Moscow, Teheran and Baghdad demonstrate the effectiveness of the current effort to bomb supply lines and troops and continue the blockade.
 The message is this: At the last Middle East crossroads, at Suez, Washington failed to fathom the clarifying effects of decisive victory and thereby missed an irretrievable opportunity to work for lasting security. For all the flack he may take, Mr. Bush sensibly seems to be avoiding that same mistake.

HEADLINE: A Shabby French Sulk

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is senior columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
In much of Europe, the war in the gulf is increasingly called "the American war," despite the coalition of 28 states against Iraq. The careful consultation that brought international consensus is frittering away amid charges that it was all a manipulation by Washington.
This is a sign that Saddam Hussein's political war is spreading beyond the Arab world to U.S. allies, including those taking part in the military war. President Bush played into the perception that the U.S. is dragging others to obey America's will by refusing to consider negotiations. If Baghdad accepts Moscow's peace proposal, it will sharpen European criticism of Washington. 
 Soon after the invasion of Kuwait, word was spread among Arabs that it was all an American plot to justify U.S. hegemony in the gulf by force and long-term domination of the world's oil supply. The idea was that the U.S. deliberately provoked the crisis, setting a trap for Mr. Hussein, to guarantee American superpower status well into the 21st century, despite declining economic strength.
Now the same tale is coming from Europeans, especially in France, and from all sides. For example, Didier Motchane, a Socialist who has taken to open criticism of Francois Mitterrand since the resignation of Mr. Motchane's close friend Jean-Pierre Chevenement, as Minister of Defense, said, "France has accepted to help the U.S. restore a world domination that its economic situation no longer assured."
On the right, Jacques Chirac, the former Prime Minister, says the same thing, if in private, specifying that President Bush foresaw a mighty European economic power and a mighty Asian economic power 20 years from now, both without oil. So he set out to make control of oil America's equalizer. No doubt Mr. Bush would be pleased to hear somebody thinks his vision stretches 20 years ahead.
The Communists and far-right nationalists scarcely go further in their criticism. Part of this is the old anti-Americanism rising again, the Gaullist obsession with proving independence and, as politicians are insisting once more, making "France's difference heard."
The day news broke that Baghdad would withdraw from Kuwait, some television commentators rushed to predict that President Bush would reject a cease-fire even before they heard Mr. Hussein's unacceptable conditions. "And, of course," one predicted, "Britain will align itself completely with the U.S., as usual." It wasn't until a French correspondent in Washington came on the air that there was a reminder that "nobody is aligning with anybody; all have accepted the same U.N. mandate."
Part of the French sulk is the result of belated and irritated recognition that Germany has eclipsed France as a European power, even if it too is showing a boisterously revived anti-American minority.
CNN has added to the sense that it's an American war, not only because American force predominates but also because an American network is the major purveyor of everybody's information, with perhaps an unwitting American slant.
Above all, it is Washington's talk of a permanent U.S. presence in the gulf and Secretary of State James Baker's suggestion of a Middle East NATO, withdrawn but not forgotten, which fed the notion of an oppressive Pax Americana lying ahead.
It is true that without America's lead, Saddam Hussein's ambitions would have succeeded with impunity. It is also true that the U.S. never wanted to go it alone, and a perverse fantasy to say it sought the war. The European argument that the U.S. will derive all the "benefits" because it supplied most of the force is even more disgusting than refusal or reluctance to contribute to the sacrifice, which serves Europe's interest.
Washington needs more of the skillful diplomacy it showed at the start of the crisis. Europeans need to reconsider whether they want to put relations with the U.S. at stake to pursue internal feuds. Even their own ability to unite is damaged by demeaning attempts to shift the blame for the war as well as the burden.

HEADLINE: Rights Report Doesn't Condemn Algeria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Gang of 6 at the U.N." (editorial, Feb. 7) demands the following comments:
You have most certainly not read the Human Rights Watch report that you characterize as "devastating" toward Algeria, one of "six flagrant rights abusers." I strongly suggest you read the report first. Or, you can also ask Human Rights Watch. It has visited Algeria very recently. It knows, and we know.
You accuse Algeria of having opposed the application for consultative status of Human Rights Watch. This is a lie. And here is the proof: Algeria is not even a member of the United Nations committee involved. It is simply an observer (just like the United States, Britain and about 20 other countries) and, as such, cannot participate in the committee's decision making.
Indeed, your editorial, and its reference to Algeria, was disinformation pure and simple.
It seems that you have targeted Algeria, which condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on the very day it took place, because it opposed the presence of foreign troops in the Persian Gulf region and the recourse to war, convinced that the crisis could have been solved through political and peaceful means within an Arab framework.
How vocal were you in denouncing real violations of human rights, such as the destruction of the entire economic, social and scientific infrastructure of Iraq and the ruthless and savage bombing of residential areas, causing thousands of casualties among the civilian population (and euphemistically referred to as "collateral damage"); the intolerable lot of the Palestinians in the occupied territories, who have lived in fear and hunger during the last three weeks of curfew imposed by Israel; the cynical Israeli assessment that it will take months to distribute gas masks to the Palestinians?
Do you not denounce these out of fear of tarnishing the image of a "moral, clean and just" war? Is it out of fear of tarnishing the image of a "peace-loving and restrained" Israel, the very Israel that assassinates with impunity the children and the women of the Palestinian uprising?
How then could there be a just and equitable new world order, when flagrant bias and double standards continue to prevail toward all Arab causes?

HEADLINE: Raytheon Is Looking Beyond the Pentagon

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: Lexington, Mass.

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company, the maker of the highly successful Patriot missile-defense system and other sophisticated military hardware, has proved itself to be one of the most technically proficient and profitable Pentagon contractors. But it has yet to prove that in can make sustained profits on its more mundane products, like Caloric stoves.
In the wake of the Persian Gulf war, Raytheon stands to benefit substantially from new orders for the Patriot. But as one of only a handful of big Pentagon contractors that have diversified to reduce their dependence on military work, the company and its incoming chairman, Dennis J. Picard, see the best opportunities for long-term growth in the company's nonmilitary businesses, where profits have historically lagged behind the high-technology weapons operations.
 
Hodgepodge of Businesses
 With the Pentagon's budgets expected to continue declining for years, Mr. Picard will be focusing more of Raytheon's resources on improving the performance of the hodgepodge that makes up the rest of the company, including the Amana, Caloric and Speed Queen appliance brands, the Beech line of small aircraft, engineering companies that build and modify electric utilities and other big industrial projects and even a textbook publisher. 
 Mr. Picard hopes to increase the nonmilitary businesses to 50 percent of Raytheon's sales, from 40 percent now, while continuing to wring some growth from the few new Pentagon programs available. But his real challenge will be to bring the profitability of the commercial divisions -- including the money-losing appliance lines -- up to that of military business. Aggregate operating profits in the nonmilitary divisions last year were just 20 percent of the companywide total, despite representing twice that much in sales.
Operating profits in the electronics segment, which includes Raytheon's military business, rose 12.2 percent last year, to $667 million, and accounted for nearly 80 percent of the company's total operating profits.
"Given the environment we are in today, it pays to be a diversified company," said Steven Binder, an aerospace and military electronics analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. "The defense budget will continue to be under pressure and there will be a continued decline in outlays. For a company like Raytheon, it's good to be in commercial businesses as long as they're yielding a good return on assets."
Besides the Patriot, which accounts for 12 percent of sales and is its largest single project, Raytheon manufactures a host of other missiles and electronic systems, making it the nation's second-largest supplier of military electronics, behind the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Aircraft Company.
Yet the bulk of the growth in the company's sales, which increased 5.4 percent last year, to $9.3 billion, came from the commercial businesses the company acquired in the last 25 years.
Some of the nonmilitary businesses have proved to be disappointing, and some analysts criticize the company for what they see as a lack of focus. Raytheon executives do not even try to establish that there is more than a token amount of synergy in the company's welter of holdings, but they do point to their increasing success at squeezing more profits from the nonmilitary divisions after years of lackluster performance in that area.
Operating profits at the Beech Aircraft Corporation continued a three-year recovery last year, rising 82 percent, to $80 million, while the engineering unit earned $49 million, up 58 percent. The only part of the company not to show improvement was the appliance business, which was hurt by the downturn in consumer spending, high operating costs and a one-time charge for closing an old plant. The appliance unit lost $8 million last year after earning $41 million the year before. Raytheon as a whole, however, had $557 million in profits last year, up from $529 million in 1989.
Today Raytheon faces an economy in which the engineering units are likely to continue doing well, the small-aircraft business is likely to be flat and the appliance business will remain under severe pressure. The bottom-line result, analysts said, will be a steady, if unspectacular, flow of profits to balance the military business both on the bottom line and on Wall Street, where investors have been shunning all but a few of the pure military contractors.
"Basically Raytheon has been able to sustain earnings growth over the long haul at high single-digit rates because of being diversified, and that's pretty good," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc.
 
Patriot's Success
 Raytheon can probably afford to be patient with its nonmilitary businesses for a few more years because its military work is likely to hold up quite well despite the precipitous decline in Pentagon spending. The Patriot's success alone will help keep the company's order books jammed.
Mr. Binder of Bear, Stearns estimated that the backlog of Patriot orders could reach $5 billion by the end of the year, up from $2.3 billion at the end of 1990, because of likely orders from Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, Greece and other nations.
The Pentagon is wrapping up a five-year program of Patriot purchases, but the budget proposals sent to Congress by the Bush Administration earlier this month included additional financing that could benefit Raytheon. The Administration wants to spend $88 million for software upgrades for the Patriot. In addition it is ordering $140 million in new spare parts for the system, and the budget for the Strategic Defense Initiative contains $170 million for the study of an advanced version of the Patriot.
The architect of Raytheon's diversification was Thomas L. Phillips, an engineer who will retire on March 1 at age 66 after serving as chief executive since 1968. His successor, Mr. Picard, who is 58, is also a former missile engineer. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Picard declined requests for interviews.
 
Microwave Pioneer
 The diversification effort started in the mid-1960's, when Mr. Phillips was looking for a way to find a commercial market for Raytheon's expertise in microwave technology, an offshoot of the company's longstanding work in radar. (Executives still like to tell the story of the Raytheon engineer who discovered the cooking properties of microwaves in the late 1940's when he stood too close to a device called a magnetron and a candy bar in his breast pocket melted.)
Mr. Phillips's first gamble was to buy Amana, a top manufacturer of refrigerators, and to team Amana's appliance engineers with Raytheon's scientists. The result was the first consumer microwave oven, the Amana Radar-Range, which dominated the market for seven years until the mid-1970's, when Japanese and other foreign manufacturers came in with lower-priced products.
Most attempts by Pentagon contractors to diversify away from military products have been disastrous, as when the Grumman Corporation tried to build city buses or when the Boeing Company tried to break into the business of selling subway cars. Among big Pentagon suppliers, the Rockwell International Corporation is one of the few that has made the transition to primary reliance on nonmilitary products.
Despite its promising start with Amana, Raytheon's diversification, too, has had its share of problems. Take the acquisition of Beech in 1980 for $800 million. The deal seemed promising. Beech was a leader in the general aviation market -- the business of making small civilian planes.
But soon after the deal closed, demand for small planes among private buyers and commuter airlines plummeted. The market did not begin a recovery for eight years. Beech's profits all but evaporated until the last two years. The company's engineering units also had a difficult period during the 1980's, partly because of the problems faced by their customers in the petroleum and energy industries. Attempts to break into businesses like word-processing flopped.
 
Strong Outlook for Engineering
 Most analysts think the engineering units will show the highest growth rates in the next few years. The company's United Engineers subsidiary is aggressively competing for contracts to help reduce emissions from electric utilities, a business that is expanding rapidly.
Beech is more of a question mark. Mr. Rubel said the general aviation market had softened again after its modest rebound, largely because fewer companies are buying corporate aircraft. Beech is being helped by a contract to supply the Air Force with 211 of its Beechjet 400 for use in training tanker pilots. But even with that lift, Mr. Rubel said he sees Beech's profits doing no better than remaining flat in the next few years.
The appliance business is the biggest problem facing Raytheon. The largest company within its appliance segment is Amana, which is generally regarded as healthy, but the money-losing laggard in the appliance division is Caloric, which primarily makes electric and gas ranges.
Spurred by sluggish demand and high costs, Raytheon closed one Caloric factory last year, taking a $17.5 million charge in the third quarter. Raytheon is trying to reduce costs at Caloric and throughout the appliance division by modernizing plants and combining the Amana, Caloric and Speed Queen units as much as possible.
Raytheon's combined appliance lines, however, are only the fifth largest in an industry where market share and profits are increasingly concentrated in the top two or three brands, like Whirlpool and General Electric, and some analysts think Raytheon may one day sell out. For now, however, the company insists that it is committed to the business.

While the pundits debate the condition of the economy, 1,500 consumers a year have been clamoring for a recipe that is a holdover from the Depression. In response to their requests, the recipe for mock apple pie is back on boxes of Ritz crackers, after a 10-year hiatus.
The pie is made with cracker crumbs, water, sugar, lemon juice, cream of tartar, margarine and cinnamon. It contains no apples, yet it tastes something like apple pie. A spokeswoman for Nabisco Brands said that decades ago, apples were not as readily available out of season and those that were available were expensive, accounting for the popularity of the mock apple pie.
Actually, the recipe is a lot older than Ritz crackers. Pioneer families crossing the Great Plains in the 19th century also made pies like this when they ran out of fresh or dried apples, using apple juice or apple-cider vinegar in place of the lemon juice.
 
Food for the Philharmonic
The New York Philharmonic will hold its annual fund-raising Radiothon over WQXR on March 1-3. In this year's catalogue are dozens of food gifts, as well as dinners contributed by more than 100 restaurants. Food gifts range from a $10 jar of jam from Martha's Vineyard and to a $550 gift certificate at Zabar's. There is also a lime cheesecake made by a member of the orchestra.
The catalogue, from which gifts can be ordered before the Radiothon, is available by calling (212) 721-4900.
 
For Cookbook Collectors
A new spiral-bound book called "Just Cookbooks" by Mary-Margaret Barile (Heritage Publications, 1990) is a directory of source material for cookbook collectors and writers. It lists dealers, publishers, mail-order companies, suppliers of recipe software for computers, newsletters, auction houses, libraries and other resources. It is available for $10.95, including postage, from Heritage Publications, A21 Church Street, Arkville, N.Y. 12406. Telephone: (914) 586-3810.

Fit to Eat? Perhaps Not
EIGHTY-FIVE percent of food-borne illnesses could be avoided if people handled food safely after buying it, the Centers for Disease Control say. To help consumers, the United States Department of Agriculture has just published a pamphlet called "A Quick Consumer Guide to Safe Food Handling."
The fold-out pamphlet provides tips on every step, including shopping, storage, preparation, cooking, serving and reheating. A chart shows how long various foods can be stored safely.
The free pamphlet can be obtained by writing to Safe Food, Consumer Information Center, 574-X, Pueblo, Colo. 81009.

HEADLINE: How Fed Chief Got War News

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
On the night war broke out with Iraq, Jan. 16, most Americans were glued to their televison sets. Not Alan Greenspan. He got his news from his computer terminal. He remembered that night in his testimony today before the Senate Banking Committee.
"I recall vividly sitting by my computer screen on the night of the air attacks on Iraq," he said. "It became fairly clear at that point that the war would not evolve into a pattern which would create a major destruction of oil resources in the Middle East.
"And when that became apparent as the night evolved, you could basically see not only the price of oil coming down very sharply across the world, but you could see the effects minute by minute in the exchange markets, in the interest rate markets, in the gold markets, all arbitraged across and around the world."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Day Mixed, But Rises Against Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed against leading currencies yesterday, but strengthened against the German mark after United States officials expressed concern about any further declines in the American currency.
The dollar finished at 1.4960 marks, up from 1.4935 on Tuesday. The dollar briefly rose above 1.5000 marks, but failed to stay above that level. 
 Dealers said the threat of an imminent ground war in the Persian Gulf helped pare the dollar's advance. Investors fear that a ground offensive may not be brief.
The dollar finished slightly lower against the Japanese yen yesterday, at 131.50 yen, down from 131.58 yen.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in Congressional testimony that the dollar's recent weakness was unwelcome. He said a weak dollar could hurt the economy by pushing up long-term interest rates.
In addition, Treasury Under Secretary David C. Mulford said currency rates reflected economic fundamentals better now than in the past, a statement dealers took to mean the White House did not favor a further dollar drop.
"I think the U.S. Administration and the Fed don't want to devalue the dollar at all," said John Lyman of the Bank of Tokyo's office in New York. "We're starting to see a fair amount of verbal support of the dollar."
In morning trading, a rise of four-tenths of a percent in consumer prices last month lifted the dollar amid the belief that the Fed might be more reluctant to push down interest rates out of fear of fueling inflation. Lower rates, while helping to revive the economy, reduce the return on dollar-denominated investments.
The effect of the price data was muted, however, by a 12.8 percent plunge in housing starts in January, a drop that brought starts to their lowest level in nine years.
Meanwhile, traders awaited Iraq's response to a gulf peace plan presented by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
In other trading, the British pound closed at $1.9500, down slightly from $1.9505 Tuesday.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar closed in New York at 131.43 yen, down from 131.58 on Tuesday.
The dollar closed at 1.2790 Swiss francs, up marginally from 1.2780, and at 5.0865 French francs, up from 5.0825 Tuesday.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose slightly, with bullion for February delivery settling at $364.70 an ounce, up 20 cents.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Risks to Recovery

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that he expected a recovery from the recession to begin "reasonably soon." But he said the war with Iraq and questions about the health of the banking system and the availability of credit gave his forecast "an unusually high degree of uncertainty."
"It would be most unwise to rule out the possibility that the recession may become more serious than already is apparent," said Mr. Greenspan, the Government's most influential economic policy maker and leading forecaster. "Nonetheless," he continued, "the balance of forces does appear to suggest that this downturn could well prove shorter and shallower than most prior post-war recessions." 
 Mr. Greenspan was not asked about and did not comment on the Government's report today that consumer prices rose by four-tenths of a percent last month and by twice as much if energy and food prices were excluded from the calculation. But he said he expected the overall inflation rate this year to be lower than it has been for several years.
 
 Before Senate Panel
 Mr. Greenspan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, as he is required by law to do twice a year, to discuss monetary policy and the state of the economy.
Sometimes in these appearances, it is possible to decipher the Federal Reserve's intentions about raising or lowering interest rates. But Mr. Greenspan carefully avoided such hints today, implying that he was genuinely unsure which way the economy would turn and thus which way the Fed should step.
"The major mistakes in monetary policy are often made at turning points, and it is very difficult to avoid them," he said at one point. And toward the end of the hearing, he declared: "I have been very purposefully slightly evasive so as not to be able to leave such conclusions one way or another, because I do think it is important that we not be in a position where we cannot be responding to continuous data as it emerges over time."
One interpretation of his remarks is that the Fed plans to stand pat for at least several weeks to give the interest rate reductions of late last year and early this year time to work their way through the economy. Mr. Greenspan did say, however, that the reduced threat of inflation gave the Fed the flexibility to lower rates if that should prove necessary. And he took issue with economists who argue that the Fed's hands were tied by the scarcity of credit and other current economic conditions.
 
Consensus Forecast Issued

Along with his testimony, Mr. Greenspan released the consensus forecast for 1991 by the Federal Reserve Board governors and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. They expect the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, to rise between three-fourths of a percent and 1.5 percent; inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, to rise between 3.25 percent and 4 percent, and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter to be 6.5 percent to 7 percent.
Those ranges are similar to the predictions of the Bush Administration, the Congressional Budget Office and many private economists. The Administration, for example, has predicted that the G.N.P. will rise by nine-tenths of a percent, that prices will rise 4.3 percent and that the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter will be 6.6 percent.
Last year, the G.N.P. rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the Consumer Price Index rose 6.1 percent and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter was 5.9 percent.
Mr. Greenspan said the recent drop in oil prices, the decline in interest rates, the high level of exports and the lean inventories in most businesses enhanced the chances of economic recovery soon. "Indeed," he said, "there is some possibility that once the economy turns around, the expansion could become fairly robust."
On the other hand, he said, "downside risks are obviously there and not difficult to identify."
 
Worry on Credit Crunch

Mr. Greenspan said that "an extended war with Iraq" could undercut public confidence and spending, and he worried aloud about the Fed's inability so far to relieve what he repeatedly called the credit crunch, or the reluctance of banks to lend money even to relatively creditworthy ventures.
"We are looking at the credit crunch as being the most critical thing that confronts monetary policy at this particular stage," he said, and he promised that "we will continue to move against the credit crunch until it gets resolved."
Mr. Greenspan declined to say what those moves would be, although he said one step could come in the next few days when bank supervisors from the Fed and other Government agencies issue new regulatory guidelines that could improve bank profits. One of those regulations, he suggested, would change the way real estate collateral is recorded on banks' books.
The chairman did seem to rule out a further reduction in the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserve in cash or interest-free at regional Federal Reserve banks. Recent experience has shown, he said, that banks need reserves at the current level to cover day-to-day transactions. But he advocated, as he has done many times before, a change in the law so that interest could be paid on bank reserves.
 
His Role on Panel

On another matter, Mr. Greenspan seemed to have little inkling of what President Bush meant when he announced in his State of the Union Message last month that Mr. Greenspan, who has long advocated abolition of the capital gains tax, would head a commission to study "technical differences" between the White House and Congress over capital gains.
The announcement was widely seen here as an effort by the President to get the capital gains issue out of the political news this year.
"I'm awaiting the views of the President, the Administration and the bipartisan leadership of the Congress with respect to what type of assignment they would like us to pursue," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Legislator Offers Option on Taxes And School Subsidy in New Jersey

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, Joseph V. Doria Jr., today unveiled a plan to revise Gov. Jim Florio's education and property tax program to shift money from school aid to property tax relief for homeowners.
The plan, which calls for moving $244 million from school aid to tax relief, differs substantially from a proposal put forward last month by the president of the State Senate to shift $395 million into property tax relief from the $1.1 billion in increased school-aid that Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature last year. 
 The Assembly plan would not offer direct property tax relief to commericial and industrial property taxpayers, as the Senate plan would, and the Assembly plan would lapse after two years, in constrast with the Senate proposal, which would be permanent. Most important, perhaps, it protects most of Mr. Florio's planned aid to poorer school districts.
"Philosophically, this is a very different approach," Mr. Doria said when asked how he differed with his fellow Democrats in the Senate. "The Senate plan is based on the belief that property tax relief is a priority and education is secondary."
 
Seeking Compromise
 The Governor and the leaders of the Assembly and the Senate, who are all Democrats, are now under intense pressure to come up with a compromise program in the next week so that Trenton can tell the state's 587 school districts how much shool aid they will receive and permit them to draft budgets for the 1991-92 school year.
But the Senate president, John A. Lynch, immediately attacked the Assembly plan as not going far enough to ease the plight of homeowners.
Senate Democratic leaders have said privately that they believe Mr. Doria's proposal represents the Governor's position.
At issue is exactly how far the three men will go to revise the Quality Education Act, which was enacted to raise $1.3 billion from income taxes on more affluent New Jerseyans and use it to aid poorer school districts and relieve the rising property taxes of middle-income homeowners.
All three men embraced the Florio package before it was passed last spring, but after the public reacted angrily last fall they agreed that the education act should be revised.
Mr. Lynch has argued, angrily at times, that Democrats should give top priority to relieving the plight of middle-income voters in time for legislative elections next fall. Mr. Doria and Mr. Florio both wish to defend large increases in aid to poorer school districts, which they say have long suffered unfair treatment under the state's tax system.
In a news conference today Mr. Doria, together with the Democratic majority leader of the Assembly, Wayne R. Bryant, described their plan, which includes these points:
*The $244 million in property tax relief would be distributed to residential property owners in the form of a tax credit; all homeowners in a single municipality would receive a credit of the same amount.
*Most of the money for property tax relief would be taken from the transition aid now designated to help affluent districts as they lose state aid in the next five years. Under the Lynch plan, increased property tax relief would come in part from reducing school aid to poorer districts.
*The Doria plan would impose "floating caps" on how much most school districts could increase their budgets, ranging between 7.5 percent and 9.2 percent, except for the 30 poorest districts. The Lynch plan would impose an 8.5 percent cap on increased district spending, except in the poorest districts, where the cap would be 13.5 percent.
The Assembly proposal would also revise the Quality Education Act to continue state support for teachers' pensions for two years. Mr. Florio's plan last year included the shifting of pension costs from the state to school districts, a move that enraged school administrators and the New Jersey Education Association, the state teachers' union, which is a powerful force in Democratic politics.
But the Senate president had little positive to say about the Assembly plan, reflecting, politicians here said, the growing philosophical and political divide between Mr. Lynch and Mr. Doria. "The plan appears to be strongly weighted in favor of the urban centers at the expense of the suburbs," Mr. Lynch said. "I must say the plan leaves me disappointed."
Mr. Lynch said he was particularly disturbed that the Doria plan placed less stringent limits on school district spending than his plan, and that the property-tax relief would be financed for only two years. In addition, Mr. Lynch said that Mr. Doria's decision to provide property-tax relief to homeowners but not businesses might violate the State Constitution.
"It discriminates against large and small business owners who are also fighting to survive during these tough economic times," Mr. Lynch said.
Closed-door meetings are expected between Assembly and Senate leaders through the weekend. Legislators and aides to the Governor say that if an agreement is not reached by the first week of March widespread disarray at the state's school districts, which are waiting to prepare their budgets, would be politically damaging to all Democrats in Trenton.

HEADLINE: Federal Regulators Tell New England Governors of Plans to Help Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Feb. 20

 BODY:
Federal banking regulators told a meeting of New England governors, bankers and business executives today that new accounting rules to benefit banks would be announced within a week.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also told those attending the New England Governors Conference here that he was considering helping banks by making direct investments of F.D.I.C. capital. 
 Robert R. Glauber, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said the new accounting proposals would include provisions that place more emphasis in real estate appraisals on the income produced from a property and its long-term prospects rather than the deeply depressed price at which the property could be sold in the current market.
The appraisal issue is important to banks because the value of many of their loans for commercial real estate projects depends on the value of the projects backing those loans.
Banking regulators also proposed to allow banks to "split" bad loans into two parts, if accountants and the Securities and Exchange Commission agree. Part of such loans could be written off as losses, while the remainder, which could pay full interest and be backed by sound collateral, could be included in the banks' financial statements as good loans.
Currently, all of a troubled loan paying partial interest or with collateral worth less than the loan is reported as "nonperforming," meaning that it is delinquent by 90 days or more or so troubled that repayment in full is not expected.
Such changes would be welcome news for political leaders in New England, who have complained that excessively harsh treatment of banks by regulators was pushing the region deeper into recession by causing banks to cut back their lending.
"There is a tremendous amount of fear among bankers about examiners and how loans will be treated," said Robert V. Wilkie, an official at the Sugar River Savings Bank in New Hampshire. "I hope to see some change to standards that are not so harsh."
James B. O'Brien, head of commercial real estate in the Boston office of Coldwell Banker, said, "The accounting changes and changes in appraisal practices will help." He added that "without some changes, the banks in this area would face huge loan write-offs" in coming months.
On the proposal for the F.D.I.C. to make direct investments in banks, Mr. Seidman said that although there was no need for a national program for such investments, there were some cases where they could be less expensive for the deposit insurance fund than closing institutions.
Gov. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire said his state was exploring an idea under which several of its weakest banks would agree to a merger, greatly reducing their costs and possibly increasing their ability to attract private capital to supplement any investment from the F.D.I.C.
Lawrence Connell, chairman of the New Hampshire Savings Bank, an insolvent bank that is also the largest savings institution in the state, said his bank was exploring many ways to raise capital and that merely cutting costs was not enough.
"Bankers in the region are realizing that consolidation is necessary," Mr. Connell said.
Mr. Seidman declined to comment on the idea for New Hampshire banks, but he warned that in general "assistance from the F.D.I.C. is not a way to save the shareholders of those banks." Nor, he added, does the F.D.I.C. see potential investments in banks as a tool for regional economic development.
Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. had enough money for a few investments in banks, but that a recapitalization of the deposit insurance fund would be needed for any broad-based program of such investments.
The F.D.I.C., which has about $8 billion in its bank deposit insuance fund, has been meeting with banking leaders to develop a plan to raise more money for the fund. It does not want to rely on taxpayer funds to pay losses at failed banks.
Ira Stepanian, chairman of the Bank of Boston Corporation, the largest banking company in the region, said capital investments by the Federal Government would probably not be needed if the industry moved ahead with mergers and consolidations, which would reduce costs. With lower costs and more profit, he said, the remaining banks could accumulate and attract the capital needed to be more active lenders.
Mr. Stepanian said regulators should encourage the consolidation of the industry when they select a buyer or buyers for the Bank of New England and its affiliates. Since that bank was seized by the Government in early January, the Bank of Boston has emerged as a bidder in competition with several companies not in the region, like the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco.
Selling the Bank of New England to an out-of-region buyer would not necessarily lead to more lending in the local market, Mr. Stepanian said, and would not solve the fundamental problem of too many banks chasing too few customers. A local buyer is better, he said, because it would allow for reduced costs, which would make more money available for lending in the local market.

Better to Call The Melting Pot A Motley Quilt

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Census figures to be released today are all but certain to confirm an epochal demographic shift: For the first time in nearly four centuries, non-Hispanic whites no longer constitute a majority in New York City.
Visions of Newark or Detroit? Typically, the changing complexion of America's cities has provoked a hue and cry among some indigenous whites when a tipping point pivoted them into a racial minority. Some felt vulnerable and fled -- hastening the quiet evolution that produced the change in the first place. 
 But New York may be less likely to mirror those cities where a single racial or ethnic group emerged as the new majority. In contrast, New York -- despite or perhaps because of its preoccupation with race and ethnicity -- may simply become more cosmopolitan.
"The truth is," says Louis Winnick, an urban analyst, "New York City has become a polity without a clear-cut ethnic majority."
Mayor David N. Dinkins's metaphorical mosaic is no tile of two cities. The minorities that now collectively constitute a majority are striking in their diversity. Because they are not monolithic, they may seem less threatening to whites than they were once perceived to be, when unscrupulous real-estate brokers and others profited from racial conflict (although many whites may still feel more comfortable with Asian immigrants than with American blacks).
"The social distance between Jamaicans and Haitians, and of both from native blacks, is considerable and is comparable to the distance between Soviet Jews in Brighton Beach and Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg," said Mr. Winnick, whose book, "New People in Old Neighborhoods," chronicles another Brooklyn community.
By that definition, all New Yorkers are members of minorities, which is how it has been for hundreds of years. The Dutch replaced the Indians, and then the British predominated until the mid-1800's, followed by Irish, Germans, Jews and Italians, all of whom, though white, were no more homogenous than thesuccession of non-white immigrants. (Imagine how some white Anglo-Saxon Protestants greeted 19th-century census figures that proclaimed the ascension of Catholics and Jews.)
 The 1990 census documents a fundamental shift that began decades ago and that was affected by migration and fertility rates. Together, blacks and growing numbers of Asian and Hispanic New Yorkers probably became a majority in the mid-1980's.
What does this mean? Among many whites, Mr. Winnick said, "there's an unspoken thought that something ominous is happening."
"The fear is that people think New York will become one big Harlem, but it won't," he said."The real worry is not the ratio, but the objective things: education, crime, jobs."
Growing numbers of black and Hispanic New Yorkers have climbed into the middle class, but black and Hispanic unemployment and dependency have been higher than with non-Hispanic whites. Celebrating or tolerating diversity may be difficult when many people are still unable to reconcile differences between blacks and whites, even before Asian and Hispanic New Yorkers complicate the equation.
"A lot of whites are simply not comfortable sending their children to a school where the predominant number of students is not of the same group as they are," said Charles V. Hamilton, a Columbia University professor of government. "That will also be reflected in neighborhoods, because people simply don't feel as comfortable living in communities where they are in the minority." Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, agreed that many white New Yorkers seem to feel "besieged by people of color."
In 1989, Mr. Dinkins was elected the city's first black mayor by a coalition of minorities, organized labor and progressive whites. The political power of black, Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers will be tested again this year in special elections for an expanded City Council. But for the time being, the latest census figures may count for less than meets the eye.
Years ago, Nathan Glazer and Daniel P. Moynihan wrote in "Beyond the Melting Pot" that "the classic heterogeneity of great cities has been limited to the elite part of the population," but "the heterogeneity of New York is of the masses." If that remains largely true, it means that most power is still wielded by whites.
"New York, the most powerful center of communications and finance in the world, will not experience a major social transformation," the sociologist William Julius Wilsonsaid yesterday. "People should not view these changes with alarm."

Money Funds Mixed, Ending 5-Week Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday, after five straight weeks in which yields declined.
Money fund yields continued to weaken, reflecting falling rates in the general money market, analysts at Donoghue's said. Over the next month or so, rates on the short end of the market will be influenced by the performance of the economy, they said. 
 Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said the Fed had done all it was going to do for now in pushing down short-term interest rates and would wait for the next round of economic data and the impact of its last credit easing. He said he expected yields to flatten over the next few weeks.
Tax-exempt money funds this week show the average number of days that securities were held in portfolios was unchanged at 49 days. Assets increased $80 million, to $91.3 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield for the week fell 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.22 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield fell 9 basis points, to 4.51 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield is 5.86 in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 6.29 percent in the 33 percent bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the USAA Tax Exempt Money Market fund produced the best return on investment for the third consecutive week, with a yield of 5.46 percent. The fund is managed by the USAA Investment Management Company of San Antonio.
Assets on taxable funds rose $3.5 billion, up from last week's $2 billion, to a record $451.3 billion. Consumer fund assets received almost the whole inflow of cash, $3 billion, for a total of $340 billion, while institutional fund assets rose $500 million, to a total of $111.3 billion. About $1 billion of the new money went into Government and Government agency securities, with the remaining $2 billion among all the other funds.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield rose by 11 basis points, to 6.56 percent, while the 30-day fell 11 basis points, to 6.79 percent. A new fund, American Performance Cash Management, paid the best return on investment this week, with a yield of 8.42 percent. The fund is managed by AMR Investment Services of Dallas.
By comparison, Bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds and are included in The Bank Rate Monitor national index, showed the average rate of return at 5.65 percent, down 4 basis points from last week.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Weather and War Reports Push Oil Up at Least 41 Cents

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil futures prices were driven higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday by forecasts of colder weather in Europe and reports that American-led forces were poised to begin a ground war to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
Crude oil futures settled 41 cents to 76 cents higher in New York. The contract for delivery in March expired at $20.48 a barrel, 41 cents higher than Tuesday's close, and the April contract, which now moves into the near-term delivery slot, closed at $19.55 a barrel, up 76 cents. 
 Wholesale home heating oil futures finished 0.81 cent to 4.09 cents higher, with March at 64.72 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.3 cents to 2.08 cents higher, with March at 60.72 cents a gallon. But natural gas was unchanged to 2.5 cents lower, with April at $1.355 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The rally was led by heating oil, which rose sharply in line with home heating oil prices in London amid forecasts for a return to unusually cold temperatures in Europe.
Lack of movement on the Soviet Union's plan to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis also supported oil futures when Iraq did not immediately respond to the Soviet proposal.
"A lot of people were thinking there was a strong likelihood we were going to see some sort of peace proposal that was going to be a factor," said Peter Beutel, energy director of the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures prices fell slightly, reflecting increased chances for rain in a leading Brazilian soybean area and disappointment over a lack of grain sales to the Soviet Union.
Wheat futures finished 1 1/2 cents to 2 cents lower, with March at $2.52 1/2 a bushel; corn was 3/4 cent to 1 1/4 cents lower, with March at $2.39 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower, with March at $1.08 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 1/2 cents to 5 cents lower, with March at $5.73 1/4 a bushel.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures rose on reports of cash prices and strong retail beef demand. But pork futures retreated.
Live cattle were 0.05 cent to 0.50 cent higher, with February at 79.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 cent to 0.30 cent higher, with March at 89.02 cents a pound; live cattle were 0.20 cent lower to 0.02 cent higher, with February at 51.85 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.03 cent to 0.50 cent lower, with February at 64.25 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Most of Growth in 80's Was in Major Metropolitan Areas

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
The nation's flirtation with a return to rural areas in the 1970's ended abruptly in the 1980's, as 90 percent of the decade's population growth occurred in metropolitan areas of more than one million people, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.
Figures from the 1990 census show that for the first time, a majority of Americans, 50.2 percent, live in these large metropolitan areas, as against 45.9 percent in 1980. 
 "We are a country not only of city dwellers, which we have been, but of large-city dwellers, a country of metropolitan-dwellers," said Richard Forstall, chief of the bureau's population distribution branch.
The New York metropolitan area remained the country's largest, with 18,087,251 people, up 547,719, or 3.1 percent, from 1980. The Los Angeles metropolitan area, with 14,531,529 people, remained second, but narrowed the gap by adding 3,033,980 people, for a gain of 26.4 percent over the decade.
 
Growth in Sun Belt
 Most of the other big gainers were in the Sun Belt. Orlando, Fla., was up by 53.3 percent, Phoenix by 40.6 percent, San Diego by 34.2 percent, Dallas-Fort Worth by 32.6 percent and Atlanta by 32.5 percent.
Across the country the pattern was for metropolitan areas to grow fastest on their fringes, where land was plentiful and housing less expensive. Many central cities stabilized or even grew in population during the decade, but were still smaller parts of their metropolitan areas.
The figures released yesterday were from the Census Bureau's list of 284 metropolitan statistical areas, defined as urban cores of at least 50,000 people and the surrounding communities that are dependent on them economically, socially and culturally.
The New York metropolitan area, for example, consists of not only New York City, Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley, but also northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Conn.
 
Half Live in 39 Areas
 The bureau said 77.5 percent of the country's 249,632,692 million people now live in metropolitan areas, up from 76.2 percent in 1980. And nearly 125 million people live in the 39 metropolitan areas with more than one million people.
In the 1980's, metropolitan areas grew by 11.6 percent, while non-metropolitan ones increased by only 3.9 per cent.
This constituted a reversal of the pattern in the 1970's, when non-metropolitan areas grew by 15.1 percent and metropolitan areas by only 10.2 percent.
Margery Turner, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a private research organization in Washington, said the popularity of rural areas in the 1970's reflected economic trends, like increased mining and oil drilling in the Southwest. Likewise, the return to urban areas in the 80's is a product of new economic trends.
"The growth of the big metropolitan areas reflects the shift in the economy from manufacturing to service industries, especially those involving communications and information," she said.
 
Some Cities Decline
 Carl Haub, a demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, another Washington research organization, noted that the rapid growth of metropolitan areas was not tantamount to a resurgence of population in core cities. To the contrary, many cities, like De troit, actually lost population during the 1980's.
"What you're seeing is a metropolitanizing phenomenon," he said. "Instead of a single city sitting like a hub with spokes going out in all directions to people who are dependent on it, you're seeing a lot of satellite cities. They are related to the older city, but they are also employment centers in their own right, and they relate to each other as well as to the core city."
Such a pattern is well established in the Northeast, where "satellite" cities like White Plains or Danbury are plentiful around New York.
"It's a newer phenomenon in the Sun Belt," he said. Much of the growth of Phoenix, for example, was the result of ballooning population in adjacent towns like Tempe and Scottsdale.
 
4 More Areas Added
 The Census Bureau redefines its metropolitan statistical areas after each census; the figures for 1980 are for the redefines areas. In 1980 four new areas were added: Charlotte, N.C; Salt Lake City; Orlando, and Rochester. Charlotte achieved metropolitan status then because of annexation of new areas, but the others did so through population growth.
Florida dominated the list of most rapidly growing metropolitan areas during the 1980's. Naples recorded the largest increase: 77 percent. In addition to Orlando, other big gainers included Fort Pierce, up 66 percent; Fort Myers, up 63 percent; Ocala, up 59 percent; and West Palm Beach, up 50 percent.
In many cases immigration was a major factor in the growth of metropolitan areas, though the nature of this immigration differed.
Jeff Passel, a researcher at the Urban Institute, noted that California registered a net increase of 3.2 million newcomers during the decade and that 2.3 million were from other countries. By contrast, 2.3 million of Florida's 2.8 million newcomers came from other states. "Places like Orlando are not a major destination for immigrants," he said.
Five metropolitan areas with more than one million residents lost population during the 1980's. Four were centered upon aging industrial cities, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburg and Buffalo, while the fifth, New Orleans, suffered from the economic downturn of the oil industry.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Turning Budget Gap Into Tool to Sell Policy Shifts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, doing his best to squeeze oratorical lemonade from fiscal lemons, has been speaking often these days about the "opportunities" afforded by the state's $6 billion budget gap. The state, he reasons with relish, must "reform, refocus and renew" its policies and priorities.
 Those who endorse Mr. Cuomo's plans to cut costs through initiatives like closing psychiatric hospitals and loosening sentencing laws are applauding the policy shifts. But they are asking a question that is central to Albany politics: what took so long?If carried out in the past, many of Mr. Cuomo's proposals might have softened some of this year's pain, the critics contend. But the bounty of the last half-decade never offered state leaders the political imperative -- some have called it the political cover -- to push for or accept unpopular proposals. 
 Now, in a year when money must be saved in every nook of the state budget, a sensitive change in political direction can be sold more as a cost-cutting device than a shift in policy.
"This fiscal crisis gives the Governor a better chance to fight for these changes because it gives him the ability to ask the ultimate question: 'What is your alternative?' " said Assembly Speaker Mel Miller.
Eve Brooks, the executive director ofStatewide Youth Advocacy, a nonprofit group that lobbies for children's programs, said the state was able to focus in rich budget years on dividing an expanding pie rather than examining the underpinnings of state government.
"Had we done this kind of priority setting two or three years ago, we might not have had such a problem this year," she said.
 
A Case in Point
 Perhaps the best example is the proposal in the Governor's budget for the 1991-92 fiscal year, which starts on April 1, to close Gowanda Psychiatric Center in southwestern New York. Although the number of patients at Gowanda has declined for years, while the cost of operating it continued to grow, the Governor did not consider shutting itsdoors until this year.
The primary reason, said Richard C. Surles, Mr. Cuomo's Mental Health Commissioner, has been the entrenched opposition of the labor unions that represent workers at Gowanda and other psychiatric hospitals being considered for closing.
Last spring, the Public Employees Federation used an aggressive $25,000 advertising campaign to fight off a plan to lay off 262 mental health workers in outpatient clinics. Some of the advertisements attacked Mr. Surles personally, saying that he was "creating thousands of personal tragedies" and that the mental health system under his stewardship was "careening out of control."
The union effectively argued that the cuts would harm patient care and worsen homelessness, and the Legislature restored the jobs. Later in the year, the Public Employees Federation and the Civil Service Employees Association combined to contribute almost $700,000 to legislative campaign committees and candidates. Neither contributed to Mr. Cuomo's campaign.
Only the magnitude of next year's budget shortfall, which represents one-fifth of the size of this year's entire budget, led Mr. Surles and the Governor's Budget Division to conclude that closing hospitals might be politically possible. "My strategy had been, because of what I learned last year, that layoffs were an unrealistic strategy in New York," Mr. Surles said.
 
Praise for Decision
 Evelyn R. Frankford, a mental health analyst for the State Communities Aid Association, commended the decision to close the hospitals but said the state's community-based mental health services had been neglected in the interim.
"The decision to close and consolidate some psychiatric centers has been long in coming, and if made years ago would have produced the community system and the savings that we all want," she said.
Similarly, Mr. Cuomo had been loath in previous years to recommend giving judges more discretion in sentencing nonviolent offenders who commit their second felonies. Existing law requires that second-time felons serve terms in prison.
Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, speculated that Mr. Cuomo has resisted such a change in the past because the Governor has felt the need to "offset" his opposition to the death penalty.
The Governor's new proposal would allow judges to sentence nonviolent second-time offenders to alternative programs. About 5,000 of the state's 55,000 inmates would qualify. By keeping even half of those convicts out of jail, prison space could be created for violent felons without building new prisons.
If he is successful in amending the law on second-felony offenders and in pushing through other changes in the structure of the prison system, Mr. Cuomo plans to cancel construction of five prisons scheduled to be built for $235 million.
Gerald C. Crotty, the Governor's secretary, said the prison system, which has grown by 28,000 beds during Mr. Cuomo's two four-year terms, was only now large enough to allow such "economies of scale."
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, which conducts research on prison issues, commended the Governor for endorsing the changes. But he questioned why it took a fiscal crisis to convince him to do so.
 "As a political leader who generally has high standing, he should have been willing to step forward during the normal course of events because it makes sense from a fiscal stand and because it provides a more efficient and equitable system of justice," he said.
Many of the policy changes hidden within the numbers in Mr. Cuomo's budget have been seen repeatedly in past budgets. As always, the Governor has proposed eliminating state boards and commissions, consolidating some state agencies and restructuring the state's school aid formula to favor the neediest districts.
But a number of other proposals, like laying off 7,200 state workers and reducing the state's Medicaid coverage, mark a stark departure for Mr. Cuomo, and many have brought immediate resistance from some of his loyal constituency groups -- labor, minorities, liberals and the poor.
After laying off a total of 5,464 state workers in his first eight years, he has proposed laying off an additional 7,200 this year. He has also called for cancelling Medicaid reimbursement for services like dentistry, podiatry, audiology and clinical psychology and has proposed that some Medicaid recipients pay a part of the cost of their care.
 "The fiscal situation makes a lot of things easier," said Anne W. Crowley, Mr. Cuomo's press secretary. "It makes things a lot more achievable."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Fall

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market participants sifted through a wealth of new information yesterday and apparently concluded that, on balance, the news was negative, because prices of Treasury securities fell and yields on long-term bonds inched back above 8 percent.
Developments that influenced prices during the session were disturbing new inflation figures, a report that showed the housing industry continues to contract, a wealth of comments from Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, and an auction of $12 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes. 
 Market participants drove down prices after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose four-tenths of a percentage point in January, and double that amount if food and energy prices are excluded.
Analysts said the price increases were at least partly aberrational, and continued to hold to the view that the recession put downward pressure on prices.
Still, the January figures, "were a surprise, no question," said Donald Ratajczak, head of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. "But at this point I am not willing to give up the ghost on our forecast."
Mr. Ratajczak is projecting that for the twelve months ending Dec. 31, 1991, the consumer price index will rise at a 2.9 percent rate.
 
 Fed's Inflation Outlook

In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed is only slightly less optimistic about the inflation outlook than Mr. Ratajczak.
In presenting the Fed's semi-annual economic forecast, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank expected consumer prices to rise at an annual rate of 3.25 percent to 4 percent this year. In July, the last time the Fed provided Congress with economic projections, the Fed was anticipating prices would rise at an annual rate of 4.5 percent to 5 percent in 1991.
"There is no question that the January consumer price numbers overstate the underlying core rate of inflation," said John R. Williams, a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company.
"Lower inflation will be the hallmark of the next couple of quarters for the fixed-income markets. And if inflation rises at a 4 percent rate or less, that suggests that 7 percent bond yields are not out of the question."
In addition to providing new statistical forecasts on the economy and inflation, Mr. Greenspan, in his comments, led market participants to infer that the Fed may not be finished pushing down short-term interest rates.
Of particular interest to traders were remarks Mr. Greenspan made about the problems facing the nation's banks that have prompted them to pull back on lending, a situation the Fed chairman suggested has not yet been remedied.
"Greenspan's testimony was bullish in the sense that there were some remarks that indicated the credit crunch was his single most important priority," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm.
 
Attempts Offset Credit Crunch

"Attempts to offset the credit crunch really has only one implication," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. research and consulting firm. "The Fed will continue to lower rates as long as the economy continues to sag."
A report on housing activity in January reaffirmed economic weakness: housing starts fell more than 12 percent last month, to 850,000 units at an annual rate, the lowest level in nine years.
Prices firmed somewhat during Mr. Greenspan's testimony, but weakened later, after results from the two-year Treasury note auction were announced.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 6.87 percent, down from an average 7.09 percent yield at the last two-year note sale on Jan. 23 and the lowest rate on a new two-year Treasury note in nearly four years. The two-year notes sold on March 24, 1987, carried an average yield of 6.43 percent.
Wall Street firms bought the bulk of the $12 billion issue, and prices of most Treasury securities fell a bit further after the results were announced.
Reflecting the selling, the new two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 6.89 percent.
The Treasury is expected to sell $9 billion worth of new five-year notes today. Those securities were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 7.50 percent, compared to 7.45 percent late Tuesday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 7/32 in late trading, down 15/32, to yield 8.03 percent, up from 7.98 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent ten-year notes were offered at 99 9/ 32, down 3/8, to yield 7.85 percent. Traders said an offering of $1.5 billion worth of new World Bank ten-year global bonds probably helped to depress prices of outstanding ten-year Treasury issues.
Shorter-term Treasury maturities did not fare as badly.
By late in the day, the 6 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 99 14/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.08 percent.
Short-term Treasury rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.93 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged at 5.91 percent.
The World Bank offering highlighted activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
The 8 1/8 percent issue, which was offered simultaneously in Europe, Japan and the United States, was priced at $99.178, to yield 8.247 percent, 42 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent ten-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities acted as lead managers for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A number of other issuers also priced new debt offerings, including United Technologies, which offered $250 million worth of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 8.75 percent securities, which mature March 1, 2021, were priced at $97.52, to yield 8.99 percent, 96 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is non-callable for life, is rated AA by Moody's and AA-3 by Standard & Poor's.
The decline in Treasury prices and the heavy supply of new issues combined to push down prices in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds.
Traders said that prices of most issues slipped by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point.
Prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds remained under downward pressure.
Market participants said prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt issues fell by 1/2 of a point to 3/4 of a point.
"We need the Fed to ease or the war to end before this market will do better," one municipal bond trader said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Soviet Union;
Awaiting Reply From Iraq, Soviets Debate Peace Plan

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Another day came and went today with no signals from Baghdad on whether it would agree to the Soviet initiative on Kuwait, as the debate in Moscow continued on the merits and motives of the Soviet plan, Iraq's options and Washington's response.
The Kremlin continued to say it expected a quick response from Baghdad on the confidential proposals that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev handed to Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq on Monday. 
 "I am sure we will get a response, and we want it as soon as possible," said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly Churkin.
 
Iraqi to Return 'Soon'
 The Baghdad radio announced tonight that Mr. Aziz would be sent to Moscow "soon to convey the leadership's response to the Soviet proposal." The broadcast did not give any suggestion of what the response would be.
As suspense over the Soviet plan took center stage in the Persian Gulf crisis, debate swirled over why Mr. Gorbachev had chosen this moment to make his offer and to warn that the West was about to overstep the limits of the United Nations Security Council mandate sanctioning force to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
Western suspicions that Moscow was trying to reclaim a role in the Middle East crossed Soviet suspicions that Washington was trying to obliterate Iraq. But Moscow insisted, evidently to Washington's satisfaction, that the plan adhered fully to the United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
The details of Mr. Gorbachev's plan continued to be shrouded in secrecy and speculation. It was generally presumed to call for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, as demanded by the United Nations, coupled with a Soviet-backed package that would look to Iraq's security and steps toward a broad Mideast conference.
 
Not a Rejection, Soviets Say
 President Bush declared that the plan "falls well short of what would be required," but the Soviets insisted this was not a rejection.
The youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, citing "well-informed sources close to the Kremlin," said the first point of the plan committed President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait within a specified time. If the United States-led coalition agreed, a cease-fire would be declared.
Beyond that, the paper speculated that Moscow would propose a Middle East conference, replacement of allied forces by a pan-Arab or United Nations force, and possibly the lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq.
The debate over Iraq reached deep into domestic Soviet politics. For the right wing, the idea that the West was battling a recent Soviet ally with Moscow's blessing seemed another humiliating symbol of Moscow's surrender of its global influence. The notion of NATO forces waging a ground war with the latest in modern weaponry so near the southern Soviet border seemed to cause special alarm among the military.
 
Images of Civilian Victims
 Right-wing legislators in the Supreme Soviet invoked emotional images of civilian victims in Iraq, while moderate speakers, including Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh and his predecessor, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, countered that Kuwaiti victims of the Iraqi aggression should not be neglected.
On the international side, the initiative seemed a revival of Moscow's old fear of being locked out of the Middle East. Soviet commentators noted that the move had potential benefits whether the war ended or not.
If it did, Moscow would be credited with avoiding carnage and would emerge as something of a "defense attorney" for Iraq in subsequent forums. If the war continued, Moscow could still benefit in the Arab world for having tried to help.
Yevgeny M. Primakov, the envoy Mr. Gorbachev has dispatched several times to intercede with Mr. Hussein, suggested in an interview on Soviet television on Tuesday that the West had motives that ranged beyond the liberation of Kuwait in pursuing its attack on Iraq. He described demolished bridges and ministries he had seen recently in Baghdad as evidence that the Western bombing went considerably beyond attacks on military targets.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Hussein Sending Response
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 20 (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein decided today to send his Foreign Minister back to Moscow to convey Iraq's response to a Soviet offer Moscow hopes will spare the region all-out war, the Baghdad radio reported.
The radio said President Hussein presided at a Revolutionary Command Council meeting that studied the proposals by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, which Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz brought to Baghdad from Moscow on Monday. The council decided to send Mr. Aziz to Moscow "soon to convey the leadership's response to the Soviet proposal," the radio said.
Also today, Information Minister Latif Jassim ridiculed statements attributed to the commander of the United States forces in the gulf, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, that the Iraqi military was "on the verge of collapse." Mr. Jassim said, "This is just another fabrication of this damned criminal's rotten mind."

HEADLINE: Mayors Win Concession on U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
In a move that appeared to further weaken President Bush's proposal to shift $15 billion in Federal assistance from Federal to state control, a spokesman for the nation's governors told the Senate today that the states have no interest in assuming control over community development funds or other programs whose loss would threaten the cities.
The move came at a Senate Budget Committee hearing that also brought angry testimony from two big-city Mayors, David N. Dinkins of New York and Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, and strong hints from Democratic members that the President's proposal would have tough sledding in the Democratic-controlled Congress. 
 Many members of Congress, particularly Democrats, view the proposal as a move to starve the cities and eventually to wean them off much Federal assistance.
Under Mr. Bush's proposal, $15 billion in money now being made available to state and local governments under various specific programs would be turned over exclusively to the states as block grants, to be parceled out as the states deem necessary. The proposal, first mentioned by the President in his State of the Union Message last month, immediately drew criticism from the nation's mayors but won expressions of pleasant expectation from most, though not all, of the governors.
In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee today, Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association, said the governors supported the block grant concept.
 
Easing the Cities' Fears
 But Governor Ashcroft, who said he spoke for the nation's governors, made a clear attempt to lessen the fears of cities that the President's proposal will cheat them, telling the committee that "the governors are not interested in including grants that are currently targeted to local government."
The Bush Administration did not specify what programs would be shifted to block grants, instead providing a list of programs as examples of what the states might take over.
What particularly outraged the mayors was inclusion on the list of $3.1 billion in Community Development Block Grants for housing, parks, child care and other social services. Urban areas now get two-thirds of that money, and the states get the rest.
Mayor Flynn and Mayor Dinkins, along with Mayor William J. Althaus of York, Pa., also testified later before the House Budget Committee. They said that because most legislatures were dominated by rural and suburban interests, cities could get short shrift if the states took control of money now earmarked for the cities.
But Governor Ashcroft said he and the other governors would specifically exclude the Community Development Block Grant program "and would not threaten resources that are now being made available to the cities."
While the mayors welcomed the concession, Mr. Althaus said a compromise was not acceptable to the cities. "We would insist that this particular proposal be taken off the table," he said. "It is not workable and not in the interest of the people concerned."
Mr. Flynn told the House committee that the proposal was a diversionary tactic intended to get cities and states warring among themselves.
Mr. Dinkins, like the other mayors, aimed most of his fire at the block grant proposal, contending that it amounted to an "abandonment" of the cities.

HEADLINE: Bush Asserts Need for Foreign Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Saying he was committed to "the power of the marketplace," President Bush presented an energy policy today that he asserted would save energy, increase domestic production of fuels and improve the environment without new taxes or harsh Government edicts.
Because the policy includes only a very limited effort to improve gasoline mileage -- the factor in the energy balance most experts believe easiest to influence -- Mr. Bush appeared to set the stage today for a major battle with Congress. 
 The plan gives considerable attention to oil. In contrast to the energy policy initiatives undertaken by Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter in the oil crises that occured during their terms, the Bush proposal asserts that the United States will have to live with a high level of dependence on foreign oil. The nation should reduce its vulnerability to sudden price increases, the new plan says, through diversifying supply, improving the ability to switch to other fuels and raising efficiency.
The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, defended the policy's approach to energy efficiency, saying that its critics "want Government control of how you run your life."
 
 Skepticism on Mileage
 Congressional reaction was especially skeptical on the issue of raising the fuel-economy requirements on automobiles, which swallow 40 percent of the oil used in this country. Representative Philip R. Sharp of Indiana, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it would be "very hard" to raise automobile mileage unless changes were required by the Government.
Currently, auto makers are allowed a small exemption from the fuel-economy standard if they build cars that run on something besides gasoline. The Administration is proposing to do away with limits on the credits auto makers can earn with vehicles using alternative fuels. Critics say this step might create huge numbers of low-mileage vehicles that could run on methanol or some other substitute, but in all likelihood would be run on gasoline.
Mr. Sharp said that this was possible, but he added that no one would market the fuel before vehicles were in place to use it.
Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, called the Bush proposal "breathtakingly dumb" and added, "Under this plan our consumption of imported oil will increae dramatically, even as our soldiers are engaged in combat in the Persian Gulf."
Some analysts believe the war has created a political opportunity for new policies. Wilfrid Kohl, the director of the International Energy Program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said: "Obviously the Administration is not reading anything larger out of this gulf crisis. I think they're terribly mistaken, and I think the Democrats know that."
A centerpiece of the plan, most details of which had become public in the last two weeks, is to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area east of the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska that is currently protected. That aspect, combined with the absence of new mandates for energy conservation, drew bitter comments from environmental organizations.
"The White House staff equates energy efficiency with sacrifice, and apparently doesn't mind sacrificing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge," said Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But efficiency, he said, was simply performing the same work with less fuel.
 
Industry's Point of View

Reaction from the oil industry, meanwhile, ranged from lukewarm to cold. Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade organization, said the proposal was "a good start in a reasonable direction." But a requirement for alternative fuel for fleet vehicles might save oil at an unjustifiably high cost, he said.
Mr. DiBona said the plan, if enacted, would not halt the decline in American oil production. "We would be doing very, very well to hold production at anything like constant," he said. And while the Bush Administration projected that the plan would hold imports to 40 to 45 percent of demand, Mr. DiBona said it would be difficult to cut the level that now prevails, which he said was about 50 percent.
At the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents smaller oil and gas drillers, Denise A. Bode, the president, borrowed a phrase from President Bush's reaction to the Soviet peace plan and said that his energy plan "falls short of the mark." It does not stabilize the price of oil and gas, which is needed for more investment, she said, and it does not eliminate tax inequities.
The industry says it would increase domestic production if it were given subsidies to do so.
 
Disagreeing With the Critics
 Mr. Watkins, in a briefing for reporters at the Energy Department, said that a goal of the policy was "to wean ourselves away from this voracious appetite" for oil. Linda G. Stuntz, a Deputy Under Secretary who supervised the drafting of the policy, said that "tinkering" with cars was "not nearly as good an answer as looking for fundamentally different technology," in this case, alternative fuel.
The Administration also disagrees with its critics over how much difference would result from raising the current standard, 27.5 miles a gallon; the Senate approved a bill last year that would have raised the standard to about 40 miles a gallon, and the sponsor, Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, said it would save 2.8 million barrels a day by 2005. But Mr. Watkins said yesterday that it would save only 500,000 barrels a day, compared with letting the market take its course, in which case, he said, consumers will choose increasingly efficient cars as the years go by. "It's not as though people are going to sit around at 27.5 miles per gallon," he said.
But proponents of a change point to Government statistics showing that new vehicles sold last year were less efficient than those sold in the previous two years, suggesting that over the 1990's, market-driven improvements will be small, especially if the current low price of gasoline persists. Senator Bryan said yesterday that a bill like his would save almost 10 times as much oil daily as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was likely to produce, and added that raising auto efficiency standards was a proven success.
"No one argues that we would be better off today if our automobiles were less efficient," he said.
 
 
AIMS OF THE NEW STRATEGY

 
Projected results of the nearly 100 policy changes proposed by the Bush Administration, based on its computerized model of energy production and consumption patterns. The Administration expects the following results in the year 2010:
 
Increase domestic oil production by 3.8 million barrels a day and reduce demand by 3.4 million barrels a day, from projected levels.
 
Hold oil imports to 40 to 45 percent of demand. The model projected 65 percent reliance on imports if no action is taken.
 
Increase the amount of domestic oil that can be profitably pumped by 20 billion barrels to 75 billion barrels.
 
Increase by 16 percent the production of electricity from renewable sources, like hydro, solar and wind.
 
Reduce total energy consumption by 7.5 quadrillin B.T.U.'s. If no action is taken, the model projects a rise in consumption from 85 quadrillion B.T.U.'s to about 100 quadrillion B.T.U.'s
 
Save consumers $750 billion in gasoline, home heating oil and other liquid fuel bills and $130 billion in electric bills, through increased efficiency.
 
Cut gasoline and home heating oil prices by 10 percent.

Stocks tumbled yesterday as investors turned skittish and took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 33.17, or 1.1 percent, to 2,899.01, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell almost the same, suggesting that the downturn swept broadly across the market.
Averages among the smaller stocks also fell, but to a lesser extent. 
 Losses in the blue chips were widespread, with declines of a point or more for 3M, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, American Express, Boeing, General Electric, I.B.M. and Merck.
Big Board activity, while fairly strong, dropped to 185.7 million shares from 189.9 million the day before. Declines led advances by more than two to one, but while 2 stocks fell to new lows, 73 rose to new highs.
One stock at a new high price was Honeywell, which rose 1 1/8, to 55 5/8, after hitting a new high of 56 1/2. The electronics producer said profits from continuing operations rose in both the fourth quarter and the year, with gains in all business segments.
"Traders I've talked to from the big investment and money management firms seem to think the market's focusing more on economic fundamentals than the war in the Middle East," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. Still, he said, many analysts look for things to bounce back fairly quickly.
"The main concern in the short run, of course," he said, "is the gulf crisis. But the analysts I talk to are in the bullish camp. They believe that despite the uncertainties in the gulf, the war will be over with a decisive allied victory shortly, that the end of the war will help revive the economy, bring interest rates down and perk up corporate profits."
The big market winner yesterday was Square D, the electrical-equipment producer, whose stock soared $20.25 a share, to $72.25, after climbing to a new high of $75. More than 3.7 million shares changed hands after Groupe Schneider of France proposed on Tuesday to buy the company for $78 a share, or roughly $1.8 billion.
In another big takeover situation, NCR, target of a hostile A.T.&.T. offer of $90 a share, rose 1 1/8, to 91 7/8.
In other movers, Upjohn, the big drug company, climbed 3 1/8, to 44 1/2, in heavy trading after jumping to a new high of 44 3/8. But Lilly, another big drug producer, fell 1 3/4, to 79 1/2, while Pfizer fell 2 1/2, to 101.
The Dow dropped sharply at the start of trading, acting in sympathy with the bond market, which slumped over fears that inflation had picked up again and might prevent the Fed from bringing interest rates down further.
Dr. Sohn, of Norwest, said Congressional testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, disappointed traders. "They had anticipated some encouragement for an easing of monetary policy in the near future," he said, "but Greenspan was being deliberately vague, pointing out that the Fed had done enough and wanted to wait and see how economic activity unfolds in the coming weeks and months."
 
STOCKS LOWER IN TOKYO
 TOKYO, Feb. 21 (REUTERS) -- Japanese stock prices were slightly lower at midday today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues was off 6.56 points, or 0.03 percent, to 26,192.23 at the end of the morning trading session. On Wednesday, the Nikkei gained 31.81 points.

HEADLINE: Reforms in Banking Call For a Shrinking U.S. Role

SERIES: Banks Under Stress: Windows on the Future - Last article of a series

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The proposals for bank reform are piling up -- from the Bush Administration this month, from Congress in several bills, and from bankers, economists and Government regulators in their numerous public statements. They disagree on many points. But a common ground appears to be emerging, and it is this:
The nation's 12,926 commercial banks should move into a second phase of deregulation, one in which the Government's role as a savior of failing banks through deposit insurance would shrink. The proposals, in fact, focus mainly on how to minimize the next banking crisis -- so the Government will not get stuck with another huge bailout bill -- and not so much on how to restore failing banks to good health in the current crisis. 
 Given the growing consensus to move deeper into deregulation, a new banking law, if Congress manages to enact one this year, would probably force banks to acknowledge, much more openly than in the past, that they are operating with a big chunk of uninsured deposits.
Two levels of banking would in effect be created, or two "windows." At one, customers would have their deposits federally insured. At the other, interest rates on deposits would be higher, but the deposits themselves would not be insured. Billions in pension fund savings held in one account, for example, would lose coverage, and some family savings beyond $100,000, deposited in multiple accounts at one bank, would also go uninsured.
"The banks will be happy to open for you an uninsured account, perhaps giving you a red deposit slip rather than the green one that you'll get for the money you put in your insured account," Robert R. Glauber, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance and the chief author of the Administration's bank reform proposals, said in an interview. "There will be clear labeling for consumer protection, with the uninsured deposits probably earning higher interest," Mr. Glauber said.
 
Between the Lines
 Nowhere in the bank reform bills is two-level banking spelled out, but politicians and bankers say the concept comes through clearly between the lines of the Administration's proposal and those put forth in Congress. L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, would like banks to literally operate separate teller windows, one labeled for insured deposits, the other for uninsured. Depositors would have no doubt about which of their funds were protected and which would be subject to greater risk.
A heated debate is developing over the details of this new phase of deregulation -- for example, over which Federal agencies should supervise the banks, how much capital banks should keep on hand to help reimburse depositors in emergencies, whether they should be allowed to sell insurance and who should be allowed to own banks. But virtually every proposal embraces the concept of shrinking Federal deposit insurance, if not all at once, then over a year or two. What opposition there is comes most loudly from small banks, but it appears insufficient to stop the trend.
In recent years, Federal insur- ance has made good on 99 percent of the deposits in banks that failed, the Treasury Department reports. Bank reform, whatever the version, would reduce this to 70 percent or less.
"Most of the people we do business with know that their money is not insured and I don't see the monumental risk in being explicit about this," said Thomas C. Theobald, chairman of the Continental Bank Corporation in Chicago, whose major clients are companies, individuals and even smaller banks that deposit millions, often through the purchase of Continental's certificates of deposit.
 
The 2 Windows
Higher Interest In 'Risk' Sector
 In this proposed new world of explicit banking, money deposited at the "safe" window would be lent to borrowers who do not usually default in hard times. Consumer credit and small-business loans, for example, fall into this safe category. In the unlikely event that these loans were not repaid and the depositors lost their money, the Federal Government would reimburse them, much as it has reimbursed depositors who lost their money at failed savings and loan associations and, increasingly, at commercial banks.
Insurance under the Bush proposal and most of the others would be limited to $100,000 per person per bank, with an extra $100,000 for a retirement account. Family accounts created by opening a joint account in the names of two people who already have individual accounts at the same bank would no longer qualify for insurance. The new laws would also eliminate various procedures under which pension funds and brokers obtained Federal insurance for millions in deposits, usually by breaking them up into $100,000 units. Eventually, individuals would be allowed to insure only $100,000 in savings, no matter how many banks they used, if Mr. Bush can override opposition in Congress to this extra limitation.
Such restrictions would make the "risk" window an increasingly busy place. The risk tellers would also take in deposits and lend them out. But as the quid pro quo for forgoing the protection of Federal insurance, the risk window depositors would earn higher interest rates than their more cautious brethren. And the tellers at this window would deal in the riskier class of lending, such things as loans for office construction and corporate takeovers. Or the deposits might be invested in mutual funds, which the banks would now be allowed to operate.
 
U.S. Supervision Maintained
 The advocates of this system argue that the risk window would not be all that risky. For one thing, Federal regulators would supervise the lending practices. Extra capital would have to be ept on hand so that banks could reimburse depositors out of their own pockets if loans were not repaid.
Potential depositors would stay away from the risk window, presumably, even though the returns would be higher, if they concluded from public disclosure that the tellers were making loans that were too risky.
Along with their red deposit slips, depositors at a risk window might even get a prospectus stating precisely how their funds were invested, and warning of the risks. This would be the same sort of prospectus that goes out today to the millions of Americans who put money, uninsured, into a T. Rowe Price or a Fidelity Group mutual fund.
But the Government would be off the hook if risky lending in, say, the mid-90's produced another wave of loan failures similar to today's experience with real estate lending. "We would get what everyone wants," Mr. Seidman said, "more lending outside the insured banking system and the collapses, if they came, would also be outside the system."
The goal, in effect, is a sufficiently safe system, with less Government insurance as a backup. Or, as Mr. Seidman put it, somewhat doubtfully: "We are attempting to get on a horse and ride off in two directions at once."
 
Branching Out
Adding States And Businesses
 Apart from the creation of new categories of banking, there appears to be agreement among Bush Administration officials and key Congressmen on other measures. The McFadden Act would be repealed so that banks would no longer be prohibited from operating across state lines.
Banks would also be authorized to branch out, for the first time since the 1930's, into various non-bank businesses, among them financing new stock issues and providing other services now usually prohibited under the Glass-Steagall Act.
These new entrepreneurial businesses would operate behind "firewalls" -- in separately incorporated divisions that could not go to the bank operation for help if one of the non-banking ventures failed.
Firewalls may sound sensible in theory, but many experts question whether a banking company's entrepreneurial venture, if it got into trouble, could in fact be prevented from draining capital from the healthy bank operation. "What the marketplace tells us with almost unfailing regularity is that in times of stress, some parts of a financial entity cannot safely be insulated from the problems of affiliated entities," Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has told the Senate Banking Committee. Others reiterate this criticism.
 
Current Failures
Who Will Pay The Depositors?
 As for dealing with the industry's present troubles, there is no absence of squabbling. As bank failures proliferate today, the main disagreement is over who is to reimburse depositors once the F.D.I.C.'s funds are depleted -- the Government or the banks themselves. The total cost is likely to be $25 billion or more, by most estimates.
If the Government foots the bill, it might do so through a fresh appropriation to the F.D.I.C.'s fund, which is expected to decline to $4 billion this year from $18.3 billion in 1987. If the burden falls to the banks, it might come in the form of higher premiums for Federal insurance. Or the banks might be allowed, for the first time, to sell stock to a commercial corporation.
That sort of cross-fertilization would be unsound, in the view of Mr. Corrigan and others. They believe that banks have a special role in the nation's financial system -- to funnel deposits that must be repaid more or less on demand into longer-term loans for ventures that expand the economy. "I look with concern, if not alarm, at the economic, financial -- and perhaps even social -- implications of Exxon owning Chase Manhattan, Ford owning Citicorp, or RJR Nabisco owning J. P. Morgan," Mr. Corrigan has said. The advocates of corporate ownership counter that the "firewall" and the Federal regulators would prevent a corporation from interfering unduly with its subsidiary bank.
 
Opposition Seems to Dwindle
 But more generally, opposition to the Administration's approach to bank reform appears to be dwindling. The Wall Street investment houses and the insurance industry, once adamantly opposed to letting banks into their fields, became less and less outspoken as banks found ways in the 80's to get into their businesses anyway.
And many bankers endorse the Bush proposals, not only for the obvious reason that the industry's horizons would be allowed to expand, but more important, because the banks themselves must finance the Federal insurance fund administered by the F.D.I.C. The commercial banks now pay 19.5 cents in premiums for every $100 in insured deposits. Shrinking the coverage, as the Administration proposes, would probably keep premiums from rising.
"We applaud the direction and many of the specifics that the Bush Administration has outlined," said Thomas L. Ashley, president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies. "The President is trying to get deposit insurance back in line with market discipline."
 
The Risk Window
What if Deposits Were Not Paid?
 In the new two-window banking system, the risk windows would operate similarly to private financiers -- the General Electric Credit Corporation or the Household Finance Corporation, for example -- which have made huge inroads into bank lending over the last 20 years.
But what if a big private lender fails, or one of the newly created risk operations at a big commercial bank goes under? Although the private lenders have avoided major failures in recent years, cracks are developing in the insurance industry. The Equitable, for example, has lost millions recently because it went heavily into real estate lending, and now many of these loans are in default.
What if a big insurer like Equitable or a money center bank like Chase Manhattan were unable, because of loan losses, to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in uninsured deposits in teachers' pension savings, for example, which are often "deposited" at higher rates outside the banking system?
Would the Federal Government turn its back?
The answer seems to be no for now.
For the next few years, at least at the biggest banks, when the chips are down, the Government will bail out major lending institutions heading for default, even if the deposits at a bank's risk window are not insured. That is the message in the reform proposals.
Is this not taking the risk out of the risk window? The answer appears to be yes at banks that are so huge that their failure would endanger the nation's financial system. The Bush Administration says it is striving mightily, however, to limit the number of institutions that would qualify for bailouts.
 
Determining U.S. Responsibility
 The policy of saving big banks, called the doctrine of "too big to fail," has been liberally practiced in recent years, starting with the bailout of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company in Chicago in 1984 (predecessor to Mr. Theobald's Continental Corporation) and the recent saving of the Bank of New England. In each case, the Government ignored its own ceiling on Federal deposit insurance and in effect reimbursed all depositors.
The liberal use of the doctrine is over, Mr. Glauber says. "We are significantly changing and limiting too-big-to-fail," he said. "We say the F.D.I.C. is out of the business of paying off uninsured depositors."
But he adds, "We do say that the Federal Reserve can make the decision that an institution is too big to fail." That loophole means that in practice, too big to fail might end up being administered in the 1990's much as it has been over the last seven years.
The Bush proposals would shift responsibility for administering the policy to the Treasury as well as the Federal Reserve, and out of the hands of the F.D.I.C. But Mr. Seidman says the Treasury and the Fed have had a say in all the F.D.I.C.'s bailout decisions to date, and often were more eager than the F.D.I.C. to go through with a bailout.
 
Limitations Doubted
 "I don't see that too-big-to-fail is going to be limited," Mr. Seidman said. "There is nothing in any of the proposals that are restrictive enough to make a lot of difference."
Mr. Seidman cites the Bank of New England as a case in point. Among the various bailouts over the last decade, that bank's failure presented the least risk to the financial system, some critics argue. But Mr. Seidman said, "Treasury declined to veto our decision to bail out the bank, and the Federal Reserve extended the bailout to foreign exchange losses and to other things we had not planned to cover."
The Federal Reserve indeed views the too-big-to-fail doctrine as a necessity. "There has to be enough flexibility to permit an ad hoc approach, if we or some other Federal agency concluded that a bank's failure would hurt the financial system," said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor.
 
Bankers Offer Another View
 The banking industry has a different viewpoint: If the Fed decides to invoke the policy, then the bailout money should not come from the F.D.I.C.'s insurance fund, financed with premiums paid by the banks. Even Mr. Theobald, whose Continental Bank benefited from a bailout, takes this view: "If the Fed wants to go beyond the $100,000 insurance limit, it should do so with taxpayers' dollars."
Neither the Bush proposal nor those introduced by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, contain such a provision -- although critics say the Fed would be more reluctant to authorize a bailout if taxpayers had to finance it.
Whoever ends up paying the bill, phasing in the change will take time. "At this stage, it is almost impossible to get out of too-big-to-fail," Mr. Glauber said. "But we might be able to say: 'Time out. New rules will go into effect two years down the road, and when the time comes, we'll play under the new rules that limit deposit insurance.' "
He went on, "What we want to do is set up a system where people no longer anticipate that the Government will step in with a bailout, but at the same time there has to be a provision to let the Government step in."
Mr. Seidman and Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, also express the hope that the doctrine can be phased out gradually. "If you are going to make the policy change from too-big-to-fail, then you want to give sufficient notice," Mr. Clarke said. And Mr. Glauber concluded, "The key is to get the balance right; we now use the doctrine too much."
 
Quicker Shutdowns
Goal Is to Limit Federal Bailouts
 The use of the too-big-to-fail doctrine might be minimized through considerable Federal supervision. Senator Riegle and Representative Gonzalez want regulators to shut an institution as soon as it seems to be getting into trouble -- and not, as in the Bank of New England's case, when loan losses have become so great that the bank no longer has any capital left to reimburse depositors and must call in the F.D.I.C. The Bush Administration agrees.
The goal, in sum, is to fall back as infrequently as possible on a Federal bailout. What's more, the bailouts simply perpetuate what economists describe as overcapacity in banking: too many lenders chasing too few borrowers. "If you frustrate the market's attempts to consolidate banking, you contribute to the pressures that will force other banks to fail," said Martin Mayer, the banking expert and author.
 
Small Banks Are Fearful
 The most vociferous opponents of the too-big-to-fail doctrine are the small banks. For Kenneth Guenther, the executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, the plan could bring about the eventual disappearance of the smaller banks -- many of them community operations that lend, say, to the corner grocer. His association represents 6,200 small banks.
"You are setting up a system where the financial giants of the world, whose failure would cause the greatest systemic risk, would have 100 percent coverage, while tens of thousands of community banks would find their insurance capped," he said. "This is a prescription for slowly encouraging the migration of deposits from small banks to the too-big-to-fail institutions."
Viewing the policy as a fait accompli of the Bush Administration, Mr. Guenther argues that at the very least, bank reform should continue the present practice of insuring individuals up to $100,000 for each bank in which they have deposits -- rejecting in effect the Bush plan to eventually limit insurance to $100,000 per person, no matter how many banks are involved.
Mr. Seidman, while favoring the too-big-to-fail doctrine in the short term, expresses a similar concern that banking could become concentrated in the big-city banks, mostly on the East and West Coasts. "Our country has always been populist, if you will," he said. "There has always been a general desire of the debtors to want to beat the creditors. So we have developed a decentralized banking system, without the concentration of power in the big, bad Eastern bankers."
 
Hunting Solutions
Some Suggest Return to the Past
 A few have suggested that one way out of the present situation would be to return to the regulations of the past, when banks put ceilings on the interest rates they paid to depositors and charged higher rates for loans. The spread -- between a 5 percent savings account and an 8 percent auto loan, for example -- guaranteed profits to a bank and made deposit insurance a seldom used safety net.
But as inflation in the 1970's raised interest rates, consumers sought yields higher than those offered by banks, and money market mutual funds were born to help meet this new demand. Finally, in the late 70's and early 80's, the interest rate ceilings on bank deposits were lifted and the banks, no longer sure of a profit, engaged in ever riskier lending to earn enough money to pay higher rates to depositors.
Some call for a partial return, to reduce the likelihood of future bank failures. Lowell Bryan, a bank expert at McKinsey & Company, proposes an adjustable interest-rate ceiling on deposits, tied to Treasury rates. Inflation, he notes, has subsided, reducing the competition among banks, money market funds and private lenders for deposits.
Most experts say the old days cannot be retrieved, if only because new technology and instant communication permit consumers to search the world for the best returns. As Mr. Clarke put it: "The genie is permanently out of the bottle."
 


GRAPHIC: A consensus is emerging that the Government's expensive role in insuring banks should shrink. To accomplish this, two levels of banking would be created.
 
The Safe Window
Chart: Two-Window Banking of Tomorrow
 Here, a customer would deposit money that would be F.D.I.C. - insured for up to $100,000. Loans made from this window would be conservative and unlikely to default. The banks' main responsibility here would be the safety of the deposits.
 
The Risk Window
 Deposits would earn higher interest rates but would not be insured. Loans from this window would be made for riskier ventures, and banks would have to hold more capital in reserve to offset the risks.

HEADLINE: Concerns Raised on Mexican Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, today ran into a fusillade of hostile questions at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on a projected free trade agreement with Mexico, signaling a tough battle ahead in selling a pact to Congress.
The principal concerns were about weaker Mexican environmental rules and lower Mexican wages that under free trade conditions, several lawmakers said, might erode standards in this country. 
 Representative Donald J. Pease, a Democrat representing an industrial area outside of Cleveland, said he feared the agreement would cause factory wages to slide in his district as companies struggled to meet the low-wage Mexican competition.
 
 'Lax Tax Record'
 Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of Jersey City, said that Mexico had a "lax track record" in enforcement of environmental rules and that as a result more American companies might move south of the border to cut costs.
While expressing their concerns, many of the lawmakers still voiced general support for the free trade idea. Sam Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's Trade subcommittee, told Mrs. Hills that despite the antagonistic questioning, "I think you will have successful negotiations."
A number of other concerns, involving items ranging from steel and beer to fruits and vegetables, were highlighted as the committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters in the House, held its first hearing on President Bush's request for authority to negotiate a trade agreement with Mexico.
 
 North American Trade Zone
 The goal is a comprehensive North American trade agreement linking 360 million people who produce $6 trillion of goods and services a year in what would become the world's largest free trade zone. Canada would participate in the negotiations, which could lead to certain modifications -- what officials are calling "enhancements" -- in its two-year-old free trade pact with the United States.
Provided the Bush Administration gets the authority to negotiate an agreement that would then be submitted to Congress for approval or disapproval without amendments, the United States would start talks with Mexico in June and try to wind them up by the end of the year.
Mrs. Hills, who spent nearly four hours fielding questions at the packed hearing, said those who do not support freer exchanges with Mexico view trade as a "zero sum game" and did not take into account mutually reinforced growth that would make both Mexico and the United States more prosperous.
 
 'Win-Win Situation'

"Reduced barriers will improve the efficiency and productivity of U.S. and Mexican industry and enhance their competitiveness in international markets," she said, calling a free trade pact a "win-win situation."
She strongly disputed assertions that jobs would be lost or that standards would slide in the United States as a result of a trade agreement.
A number of Government studies, including ones published by the Labor Department and the International Trade Commission, have projected overall benefits for the economy.
On the question of environmental standards, she said environmental issues might needlessly complicate an agreement about lowering tariffs and other trade matters, but stressed that the Administration still "wants to insure that Mexico does as much as is humanly possible to protect the environment."

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in January, and twice as much if gyrating food and energy costs were excluded. But economists said inflation at the retail level was not as bad as it seemed.
Separately, new housing activity skidded to its lowest levels since the early 1980's, with builders starting just 850,000 new homes and apartments at an annual rate, 12.8 percent below the depressed December level. Permits for future construction fell 4.7 percent. 
 Taken together, the reports provided a mixed reading of economic performance last month, with the price figures tending to support the notion that downward momentum was being contained and the housing figures reflecting an industry mired in deepening recession.
 
War and the Credit Crunch
 Even housing, however, was said by various specialists to have shown signs of rebound in early February.
"Hopefully, we are near the bottom of this recession," said Mark Tipton, president of the National Association of Home Builders. He attributed the January drop in housing starts to a sharp decline in consumer confidence before the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf and "a severe credit crunch," or a reluctance of banks to make loans.
Patrick C. Jackman, the Labor Department official who supervises the data-gathering for the price index, said most of the unexpected jolts in today's report could be explained away and that inflation seemed likely to remain in check.
"If I were Mr. Greenspan, I certainly would not change my policy based upon these numbers," Mr. Jackman said, referring to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 
Greenspan's Forecast
 Indeed, the Fed chief projected at a Congressional hearing today that consumer prices would rise by 3.25 to 4 percent this year, down from 6.1 percent in 1990. The Fed chairman also said that he expected a recovery "reasonably soon," but saw risks to the economy from the war, the health of the banking system and availability of credit. [Page D19.]
The consumer price figures, which were worse than expected, pushed up interest rates in early trading in the credit markets, but upon closer examination traders and investors appeared to have decided that there was little danger of a sustained rise in inflation.
Much of the increase reflected the imposition of luxury and other taxes on Jan. 1 and presumably temporary advances for new cars, resort lodging and fresh fruits and vegetables.
"The rate of inflation is likely to be lower" in coming months, said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He contended, for example, that a 1.3 percent January jump in the price of new cars, the biggest increase since May 1981, was unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.
 
1991 Models Costlier

The Labor Department said the January rise reflected the continued introduction of higher-priced 1991 models as well an end to rebates on some models. The introduction of new models, starting in the fall, has been slower than usual this year.
The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the January Consumer Price Index covering all urban consumers followed two months of three-tenths of 1 percent increases. It was marked, among other things, by a 2.4 percent drop in the price of energy, and was partly offset by a nine-tenths of 1 percent jump in the price of food and beverages.
Exceptionally cold weather in late December, especially in California, sent some food prices soaring, with oranges up 37.2 percent and lettuce up 24.5 percent. The price of alcoholic beverages advanced a record 4.9 percent, partly reflecting a Jan. 1 rise in Federal excise taxes but also reflecting industry increases put through at the same time.
Cereal and bakery products jumped 1.3 percent, but dairy products fell for the third straight month and beef, pork and seafood also fell.
 
Housing Component Up
 The housing component also rose much faster than in December, increasing eight-tenths of 1 percent. That was the largest increase since mid-1982. A big factor, however, was a 6.8 percent jump in out-of-town lodging costs, reflecting greater-than-usual increases in vacation areas. Mr. Jackman speculated that advertised hotel and motel discounts applied mostly to weekend and other brief trips and not to longer stays.
But household fuels also rose 1.5 percent as increases for electricity and natural gas -- up 2.8 percent and 1 percent, respectively -- more than offset a 5.6 percent drop for fuel oil. Local phone service rose 4 percent.
The transportation component dropped 1.2 percent as gasoline fell 6.9 percent and used cars, tires and automobile body work also cost less. Besides new cars, the cost of auto financing rose and there was another sharp increase in airline fares that brought the advance to 13.4 percent over the latest five months.
Apparel jumped 1 percent, reflecting smaller-than-usual price reductions for fall and winter clothing, as well as an earlier-than-usual introduction of higher-priced spring and summer clothing, the department said. The subindex for watches and jewelry climbed 4.3 percent, partly reflecting the new Federal luxury tax.
 
Medical Costs Rise

Medical care rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, somewhat less than the eight-tenths of 1 percent average in the second half of 1990, while the "other" goods and services category rose seven-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month. The latter category includes tobacco, on which taxes were also raised last month, and school tuitions.
The eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in the so-called core inflation rate that excludes food and energy compared with a four-tenths of 1 percent average monthly rise in 1990.
Before rounding, the consumer price index covering all urban consumers rose 0.4470939, a rate that if maintained and compounded over 12 months would produce annual inflation of 5.5 percent.
Prices in the New York City area rose 1 percent last month, today's report also showed, with one of the main factors being the jump in out-of-town lodging. Mr. Jackman said that if many New Yorkers wintered in, say, Miami the cost of Miami lodging would be incorporated in the New York inflation rate.
The index now stands at 134.6, which means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-1984 now costs $13.46.
The C.P.I.-W covering urban wage earners and clerical workers also advanced four-tenths of 1 percent last month following two months of minimally smaller increases.
Housing Starts
The housing figures, which are compiled by the Commerce Department, showed that starts of new homes ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 850,000 last month, down from 975,000 in December and barely half the 1,543,000 started in January 1990, which was exceptionally warm. Last month's was also the lowest since January 1982, which had an annual rate of 843,000 units.
Single-family dwellings accounted for most of the decline, falling 15.6 percent to a rate of 632,000, the lowest since June 1982, when 613,000 houses were started at an annual rate. Buildings with five or more units accounted for 189,000 at an annual rate, with smaller multiple-dwellings accounting for 29,000.
By region, the drop in the Northeast was just under 30 percent, to a rate of 77,000 a year. The Midwest and South had 15 percent declines, to 198,000 and 340,000, respectively, while the West posted a tiny advance to 235,000.
Amid the gloomy figures, however, the home builders' group and other analysts said they see some signs of revival. Mr. Tipton, of the home builders association, said he expected construction to begin rising after another two months or so because of lower interest rates, a restoration of confidence and evidence from a survey in the first half of February showing 42 percent of builders experiencing "high to average" traffic in their subdivisions, up from 24 percent who ranked traffic that high a month earlier.
Mr. Rippe of Dean Witter also found "some positive signs" emerging in housing, including a faster rate of sale of existing homes and increasing affordability of housing over the past six months.
Permits for future construction fell 4.7 percent last month to a rate of 804,000, 5 percent below the revised December rate of 844,000 and far below the 1,739,000 rate of January 1990 when there was a rush to beat new Federal requirements for accessibility by the handicapped to multi-family dwellings.
Permits for single-family units were 6 percent lower, at an annual rate of 606,000, with the rate about unchanged at 99,000 in the Northeast, modestly higher at 187,000 in the Midwest and lower in the South and West with 301,000 and 217,000, respectively.
The Commerce Department's report also showed that shipments of mobile homes for December ran at a rate of 167,000, 8 percent less than in November.

Discreet Maneuvers Over War Issue

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Much of American politics has seemed frozen since the war began in the Persian Gulf, and few expect that to change very soon. Even so, beneath the seeming truce on partisan maneuvering, professionals in both parties are engaged in quiet, careful efforts to manage the war issue as they head into the 1992 campaign.
These efforts vary widely. In recent week, newspapers have begun receiving strikingly similar letters to the editor urging support for the troops and denouncing the attention given to war protesters. The campaign, it turned out, was courtesy of the Republican National Committee, which mailed sample letters to 500,000 regular party contributors, suggesting they send the missives to their local newspapers. 
 Campaign committees in both parties are conducting war-related research on Congressional voting records. Republicans are trying to build a case that Democrats opposed not only the resolution authorizing the use of force in the Persian Gulf, but also many of the weapons that have proven so effective there. For its part, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent members home for last week's recess with statistics and "talking points" about the party's "major role in insuring that we purchase the right weapons and weapons that work."
At the level of Presidential politics, the war has chilled any overt maneuvering by Democratic hopefuls; this is not the time to make a case against the Commander in Chief. But perhaps even more significantly, the war has raised anew an issue that has haunted Democratic candidates for at least a decade: national security.
The speeches of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and an influential party strategist, offer a taste of what could come, if the war goes well: "I think it is important that we remember and that we not let the American people forget that had Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis been elected President, the Berlin Wall would still be standing and Saddam Hussein would be in Saudi Arabia today."
The Democrats' strategic imperative is getting the political debate back to domestic issues -- notably the economy. "My assumption is this: that the key and most pressing and most salient issues in 1992 are going to be the economy and the domestic agenda," said Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "We certainly would hope and trust that by that time, the war will be long over."
Some Democrats are trying to jump-start the domestic debate by casting issues like the pending civil rights bill, which supporters say would reinforce legal protections against job discrimination, in terms of what it would mean for American soldiers in the gulf. In the meantime, Democratic Congressional leaders have carefully closed ranks with the White House and expressed, again and again, support for the troops.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, said: "I don't think we've had as powerful a symbol in America for a long time as we have in the troops. They are going to be the political icons for the next cycle."
The Republicans face their own obvious risks in the Persian Gulf war, first and foremost the impact of American casualties when and if a ground offensive begins. One prominent consultant said last week that the worst case for his party was a prolonged war and an economy still stalled in recession in 1992. Republicans still remember the slide Mr. Bush took in the public opinion polls during last fall's budget struggle.
All of this strategizing and planning is, to a large extent, muted and subterranean; both parties are keenly aware of how little the public likes the notion of seeking partisan advantage from a war. Perhaps the clearest measure of this came when the White House quickly distanced itself from the remarks of the new Republican chairman, Clayton K. Yeutter, who said that Democrats in the 1992 campaigns would come to regret their votes against the use of force.
A senior Republican said: "It's in the Republicans' best interest for support for the war to stay bipartisan now. That was Yeutter's mistake. At the end of the day, the President will get credit, and at the end of the day, if the war goes well, those who supported it will get credit. But there's plenty of time for that to happen."
Meantime, beneath the surface, both parties are planning for the time when the truce no longer applies.

HEADLINE: Senate Vote Revives Sanctions for a Role In Chemical Arms

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Senate passed legislation tonight requiring the President to impose sanctions on countries and companies developing or using chemical or biological weapons.
President Bush rejected an almost identical measure last year. But Congress had adjourned by the time he announced his decision and there was no chance to try to override a veto. Mr. Bush said then that he could not accept the bill because it did not give him the authority to waive all sanctions if he thought the national interest required him to. 
 But tonight, the White House accepted the bill after Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the minority leader, and Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, pressed for acceptance of only modest changes. These amendments would allow Mr. Bush to delay the imposition of sanctions against foreign companies while he sought to get their own governments to punish them. The Dole-Garn amendment did not allow any delays or waivers in sanctions against countries that use poison gas or germ warfare.
The amendment and the bill itself were passed without opposition on roll-call votes. It was clear all along that the bill had enough support to pass, and perhaps to overcome a veto. Last year, the Senate adopted it, 92 to 0.
Among the leading Republicans speaking for mandatory sanctions was Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Repbulican. He insisted that failure to impose sanctions against Iraq for using poison gas, and against German companies that had aided Baghdad, had encouraged those companies to help Libya, too.
The bill, the Omnibus Export Amendments Act, also included provisions that would ease controls on exports of high technology to East European countries if they agreed to protect that technology; establish procedures for updating lists of prohibited exports; reauthorize and expand export-promotion activities of the Commerce Department, and extend the Export-Import Bank subsidy program to help support American exports.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Cuts Prime Rate to 8 3/4%

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank after Citibank, said yesterday that it was cutting its prime lending rate to 8 3/4 percent from 9 percent.
The cut by the huge San Francisco-based bank, which takes effect today, comes less than three weeks after many banks lowered their rates from 9 1/2 percent, and less than two months after all of the nation's largest banks, almost in unison, cut their prime rates to 9 1/2 percent from 10 percent. 
 The prime rate, which once applied only to business loans, now has a wider impact. Home equity lines of credit, credit-card interest rates, mortgage rates and even some traditional installment loans like auto loans have increasingly been tied to the prime. A reduction therefore could be felt by a broad spectrum of borrowers.
Frank McCormick, senior economist at the Bank of America, said the bank's rate decision was in large part a reaction to a general decline recently in the bank's cost of funds -- money it borrows and re-lends to customers at higher interest rates.
But the timing, Mr. McCormick said, was dictated by comments made yesterday by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, in testimony to Congress.
"Chairman Greenspan left the door open to a further decline in short-term interest rates," he said. In fact, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that "the Federal Reserve will need to remain alert to possible contingencies and will have to continue to respond flexibly to information about evolving trends."
Many market analysts interpreted those words to mean that the Fed would like to see lower interest rates, which might push the rates for Treasury bills and certificates of deposit down further.
Still, those factors would affect all banks, and as of close of business yesterday, none of the other large banks had taken a similar step. Bank of America announced its cut after the banks on the East Coast had closed.
P. Kenneth Ackbarali, the senior economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, expects, however, that by early next week most major banks, including his own, will have followed suit. He noted that certificates of deposit, a good indicator of the cost of money to banks, have been trading at around 6.55 percent, and that the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, has been dropping.
"We're surprised at the timing of Bank of America's move, but there is definitely overwhelming pressure on the banks to lower the rate," Mr. Ackbarali said. "And if we all do -- and if consumers think the gulf war will be short, as they seem to lately -- then it will have a stimulating impact on the economy."
 
 Other Views

But Robert Giordano, the director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, thinks the opposite.
"What Bank of America is doing is aggressively going after other banks' market share, because most of the other major banks are under too much earnings pressure and too many capital constraints to follow suit," he said.
Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikkko Securities International Inc. in New York, told The Associated Press that he expected banks would be slow to follow suit. "In fact," he said, "this time I would expect that until the Fed really signals another move, we could have a split prime rate."

HEADLINE: Transit Deficit Has Tripled in 7 Weeks

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
New York City transit officials said yesterday that the Transit Authority's budget deficit had tripled since the beginning of the year to an estimated $215 million.
The shortfall is likely to force officials not only to raise bus and subway fares but also to cut services. It has been caused by a combination of proposed cuts in state aid, a drop in ridership and declining revenues from the city's real-estate taxes, the officials said. 
 The Transit Authority's executive director said he was certain that fares would need to rise to more than $1.25 from the current $1.15 and that the authority would seek an increase of more than 10 cents from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.
 
'A Graver Situation'
 Last Friday, officials estimated that the budget gap would be $130 million to $140 million.
But new information indicates that revenues will be lower, said Mortimer L. Downey, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Transit Authority. In addition, last year's deficit of up to $15 million must be made up, he said.
"We are faced with a graver situation than we thought, and we have to move much quicker," said David A. Winfield, the Transit Authority's executive director.
Mr. Winfield said a number of factors have increased the projected budget gap to $215 million from the $70 million estimated in January. Among them are these:
*A decrease in ridership in January. Far fewer people rode the system than expected, meaning fare receipts for the year could be $38 million less than anticipated.
*A possibility of decreased revenues from taxes on real-estate transactions. Based on January receipts, these revenues may be $37 million less than expected. Transit officials also said they expected a shortfall in revenue from the mortgage recording tax of $40 million to $45 million.
*Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget proposal to cut $12 million from state subsidies. The State Legislature will be debating that budget soon, and the M.T.A. is expected to lobby hard for more money.
*A decrease in municipal subsidies based on real-estate taxes. Officials said the subsidies were $10 million below expectations for November and December.
 
Possible Funds Shift
 Given the swelling deficits, Mr. Winfield said, a fare increase of more than 10 cents is certain. "This is coming faster and harder than we can deal with it, and we thought a 10-cent adjustment could handle it," he said.
Transit officials hope a fare increase could go into effect in the next few months.
Mr. Winfield said it could be necessary to shift money planned for improving the subway and bus systems to subsidize operating costs.
The projections were announced at a meeting of the M.T.A. finance committee. Speaking to committee members, Mr. Downey said an increase of more than a dime would be difficult, logistically as well as politically.
Recalling the lines of riders that were created when token clerks, used to selling $1 tokens, had to make change for $1.15 tokens, he said: "Remember that the amounts you come up with for the T.A. can be awkward -- $1.29? If they can do it for stamps. . . ."
The acting M.T.A. chairman, Daniel J. Scannell, broke in, saying, "And you've seen the lines at the post office."
State legislators who represent the metropolitan region said they would fight efforts to raise the fare or cut services.
 
Role of Legislators
 "At this point, further service cutbacks and a fare hike are just going to create a spiral of decline which can destroy the whole system," said Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Assembly Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee.
But legislators also said they would oppose Mr. Cuomo's proposal to cut $12 million in combined state and city aid to the mass-transit system. "The best investment the State of New York could make in economic development is to shore up the transit system of the City of New York," said State Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan.
Mr. Nadler, also a Manhattan Democrat, said he, too, would work to dedicate to mass transit a portion of the 10-cent increase in the gasoline tax that the Governor has proposed. Both Mr. Nadler and Mr. Leichter said trimming the Transit Authority headquarters staff could help narrow the budget gap.
Mr. Downey said the agency had already cut about 250 management positions and had frozen salaries, and he said staff reductions alone would not repair the budget. "The T.A. went through a pretty painful process of eliminating the fat already, and I think all the significant savings have already been realized from that process," he said.
 
'Not Crying Wolf'

Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit users group, said legislators would have to choose between raising more tax revenue for mass transit or listening to their constituents complain about increased fares and decreased service.
The M.T.A. is "not crying wolf on this deficit," he said. "They're crying reality. Legislators will have to decide what's more politically painful: enacting new transit taxes or letting the fare go up to as much as $1.40 in April or May, and I don't think there's any avoiding that dilemma."
Stephen B. Dobrow, director of the Committee for Better Transit, another consumer group, said that unlike in the mid-1970's, when the state bailed the city and its transit system out of bankruptcy, the state now has its own financial crises.
"If it was only the transit mess, it wouldn't be so bad, but it's an everything mess," he said. "Everything is more difficult because there are so many problems at the same time."
 
Labor Talks
 Mr. Downey also said the Transit Authority's problems could worsen. In estimating a $215 million gap, he said: "We've taken a mid-range on the ridership loss and a mid-range on the taxes. If everything went to the downside, it would be a larger number."
He said the biggest variable in the deficit calculations was the labor negotiations that are planned.
Mr. Downey said the Transit Authority expected to realize as much as $45 million in savings through greater investment earnings from its pension fund, which is managed by the city.
But he warned that labor negotiations, which will begin this spring, might consume those savings. The Transit Authority budget provided for a 1.5 percent wage increase, but the city recently negotiated increases of more than twice that for teachers and other employees.

HEADLINE: For Record Companies, A Battle of the Parties

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In the past two days, gripped by Grammy fever, the major record companies have been fighting what one press agent called "the battle of the bashes," trying to outdo each other in lavish, imaginative party-giving.
It all began on Tuesday night at the Plaza Hotel, where Clive Davis, the president of Arista Records, gave a cocktail party and sitdown dinner for 500 guests. The gala exemplified the giddy mixture of civic and corporate pride surrounding the Grammys, which this week brought an estimated 6,000 people to New York and made the city feel like Hollywood East. 
 Mr. Davis's party was attended by most of the major record company presidents, and by such celebrities as Brooke Shields, Mort Zuckerman and M.C. Hammer. The evening featured entertainment by Arista artists, including Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, Kenny G and Jeffrey Osborne, and culminated in an all-star finale of "Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand."
The Arista party overlapped with two official functions involving the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. A thousand people, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, attended an early-evening party at the Rainbow Room welcoming past and present Grammy nominees. In his speech, the Mayor urged those present to use their positions as artists to speak out against racism and to address social issues. The chairman of Warner Communications, Steve Ross, was the host of a party at Gracie Mansion attended by Quincy Jones and Phil Collins, among others.
 
New York in Miniature
 At a cost of $250,000 last night, the Time-Warner labels (Warner Brothers, Elektra and Atlantic) turned Roseland into a replica of New York City, complete with a graffiti-embellished subway station, a miniature Central Park, assorted ethnic eating places and a Donald Trump look-alike selling hot dogs.
The Polygram labels spent almost as much to transform the Ritz, on West 54th Street, into a New Orleans Mardi Gras environment, while the Sony labels took over the entire Rainbow complex on the 65th floor of the General Electric Building. Capitol-EMI and its associated record companies occupied 21. MCA Records celebrated at the Four Seasons and RCA at Tatou, on East 50th Street.
The hoopla was an indication of just how confident the nearly $7 billion record business continues to be in the face of the recession and the Persian Gulf war. While there have been ominous predictions of a downturn in the concert business, record sales have remained stable. The parties also demonstrated just how important the Grammys have become to the industry, both in prestige and in economic impact.
"The public has come to look to the Grammys as a signal that a star has really arrived, and the impact can be enormous," the president of Sony Records, Tommy Mottola, said yesterday. "Depending on the timing, a Grammy win can increase the sales of an album by anywhere from half a million to two million albums."
 
Rap Is Bumped
 A major-category nomination alone can have a significant impact. "Mariah Carey," the debut album of a Mottola protegee, received five nominations. In next week's Billboard, the three-million selling album reaches No. 1 on the pop album chart for the first time. It is the first non-rap album to top the chart in well over six months. The impact of several nominations has also strongly affected the sales of the debut on SBK Records of the South California trio Wilson Phillips.
Charles Koppelman, the head of SBK Records, credited the MTV cable channels with helping to make the difference. "MTV and VH1 have been a major contributor to the Grammys by expanding the audience tremendously," Mr. Koppelman said. "Because it's a visual medium you have much greater identification with the artists. That visual identification gives the Grammy telecast a greater impact."
Beyond its impact on specific records, the Grammy festivities show just how much record companies value their images as imaginative, free-spending enterprises. Record companies live or die on the quality of the talent they attract. Given the steadily rising costs of producing records and music videos, the signing of a new pop act represents a minimum investment of $500,000.
As one weary press agent explained: "For every record company, this is a time when you show off your stars. In this business, success is so much a matter of perception. If people perceive you as being successful, they'll give you other good artists, because success breeds success."

HEADLINE: Decorating Simply Without Sacrificing Standards

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
THESE are the times that try New Yorkers' stressed-out souls.
Tassels and brocade and Biedermeier period rooms and "Bonfire of the Vanities" details do not seem to fit the spirit of this interior decorating moment. Yet decorating goes on: these days New Yorkers seem to be having fun and trying not to spend too much on stylish, livable rooms. Call it the sophisticated new homeyness. 
 "Welcome to the chateau," is the usual wry greeting that Marc Manigault, a stylist, gives visitors to his West Side apartment. "I tried to keep it cozy and simple so people can just relax here, without running out somewhere."
Howard and Mindy Partman, who are fashion retailers, see it this way: "Creativity and color are what keep us going and make us feel good."
And as Barbara Toll, the owner of an art gallery in SoHo, said, "I was not interested in coming home and lying in bed and looking at more art."
A stylist who specializes in boutique windows, a couple who design and sell trendy clothes and a dealer in contemporary art: these are people who earn their livelihoods by being attuned to the moment. And this, they feel, given the economy and a war, might not be the most appropriate moment to get carried away about decorating. They might be earnest about their design standards, but right now they are sure enough of their taste to keep things simple.
"Wood floors and basic beige walls -- that was it," said Mr. Partman, who moved into his 1930's apartment building just before his wedding a year ago. It is within walking distance of San Francisco, the couple's clothing store on Lexington Avenue between 70th and 71st Street.
They asked Ivan Dolin, a friend and interior decorator, for help, and he told them " 'Don't get too involved; after all, it's a rental,' " Mrs. Partman said. "We were tired of everything that was overdone."
The Partmans brought their individual collections to their new shared home. He likes furniture -- a chair by Ettore Sottsass, modern lamps, a 60's portable bar -- preferably with a strange twist. She collects eyeglasses ("dozens and dozens") and handbags ("they have to be hangable") and flea-market finds.
Among them are the medieval-style painted wood heads above the fireplace. The fireplace wall was given Mr. Dolin's ripped-wallpaper treatment.
"I wanted an alternative to an expensive mantel," Mrs. Partman said.
Mr. Dolin added: "It was very expensive and came from England, but we didn't need that much. The magenta color clashed with everything we had already. That was perfect."
He emphasized the Partmans' brightly hued minimalist look with bold black and white tiles for the kitchen floor, large rugs made out of vintage carpet runners and a sweeping 50's turquoise sofa with triangular yellow pillows. Mr. Dolin painted a frame around the window so the couple could forgo fancy window treatments.
"We were willing to spend some money," Mr. Partman said, "but it became more challenging to find ways of not having to."
"Freebies" was the way Mrs. Partman described the green vinyl chairs at their kitchen table. "They came from a restaurant my father had years ago, and we found lots of them in my mother's basement."
One of the couple's first tiffs revolved around a 1920's children's piano, which Mrs. Partman brought home from a flea market.
" 'Where will you put it?' " she remembered his asking. "I said I didn't know."
The piano is now a night table.
Ms. Toll's decor is "nonaggressive, noncompetitive and nonarbitrary," according to Michael Formica, a Manhattan interior designer who helped her with her SoHo loft.
His first impression of the art dealer's dark loft was "all-brown, even though there was nothing brown in it." He suggested Ms. Toll paint the quarry tile floor white.
"I suddenly felt optimistic," his client recalled.
Mr. Formica also suggested that the space could be "pretty." That clinched the job.
Though Ms. Toll wanted a large painting to be the focus in the living and dining rooms, she did not want art to dominate the bedroom and sitting room that are now her private oases on the island of Manhattan.
In the living room area, balloon shades made out of muslin filter the light and provide privacy from the street. But because there was hardly any natural light in the bedroom, the 12-foot high wall behind the bed was a good place to display Ms. Toll's always-evolving collection of drawings.
"It works," she said, "because if I sit in the sitting room part of the bedroom I can look at the drawings, but I don't have to if I'm in bed."
Apart from the mismatched French Art Deco night tables, the most striking element in the bedroom is the curved upholstered headboard and its matching striped pillows.
"I saw it as a funny play on the teen-age room of the 60's," Ms. Toll said. They made it "in a severe material to make it look less frilly."
The synthesis of art and decor reaches its subtle peak in the dining room, where it's hard to tell art from furniture.
On one wall, a dark red vinyl-covered chair is poised next to a painting of pastel stripes. "It's by John Armleder and one piece of art," she said. "The chair was found on the street, and its tufted buttons provide the circular counterpoint to the painting."
On the adjacent wall, eight Italian leather-backed chairs are lined up like a small regiment under a painting by Louise Fishman, "as if they were waiting in a ballroom for an event," Ms. Toll said.
Mr. Manigault, who shares a two-bedroom co-op apartment with Masazumi Chaya, the ballet director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, furnished the high-ceilinged rooms with overscale seating and accessories to avoid clutter and emphasize dramatic effects.
Huge black pots sit atop tall columns and frame the dining room table. In a corner, an impressive forest of bamboo reaches to the ceiling.
"We have light, but no direct sunlight," Mr. Manigault said. "The banana and fishtail trees and even the palms all died."
Mr. Chaya came up with the solution: crisscrossed thick bamboo poles that go from pebbled planter to the 12-foot ceiling. They require no maintenance -- and they cannot be ignored.
Mr. Manigault approached the den with the same bold strokes. He installed a wall of shelving for his records, compact disks and videotapes, a mountain of stereo equipment and three large television sets.
"I love TV," he said. "And I have to be able to tape 'Knots Landing' when I'm watching 'L.A. Law.' "
A few months ago, when Mr. Manigault's mother came to visit, she wanted to watch her favorite soap opera. "There were 12 remote controls," he said, "and she turned everything on except the TV."
He added, "The next day she decided to go to stay at my sister's, where things are simpler and where, she said, you don't need a college education to work the TV."

Mets' New Offer Doesn't Overwhelm Gooden

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
With Dwight Gooden's deadline for a contract extension 48 hours away, the Mets said today that they had mailed a revised offer to the right-hander that would make him the third-highest-paid player in baseball.
Frank Cashen, the team's general manager, said at a news conference in his office here that the proposal was for three years and that its annual value fell between the $4.05-million-a-year deal the Dodgers awarded Darryl Strawberry and the $4.7 million Jose Canseco is collecting from the Oakland Athletics. Roger Clemens, whose new deal is worth more than $5 million a year, is the highest-paid player. 
 "It's a new and improved offer," said Cashen. "And I make no apologies for it."
 
Agent Seems Flexible

 It stands, though, to make only modest headway in the negotiations with Gooden. The 26-year-old ace of the staff, who with a career record of 119-46 has the highest winning percentage of any pitcher in history with 100 or more triumphs (.721), has insisted for weeks that he wants an extension for four years at a yearly rate that compares with the four-year, $21.5 million deal the Red Sox signed with Clemens.
 Gooden has maintained that if an extension is not signed by Friday he will end negotiations with the Mets and declare for free agency at the end of the season.
"Of course, that won't get it done," James Neader, Gooden's agent said of the deal as described by Cashen. "But it at least will initiate talk. It gives us the chance to get it done."
Neither Neader nor Gooden, however, was prepared to say that the offer represented enough encouraging movement for the Feb. 22 deadline to be removed. Both, though, expressed mystification at why the Mets had waited so long to begin negotiations in earnest and then chosen to complicate them further by mailing their offer instead of delivering it more directly.
"It's their choice, their doing," said Gooden, who sounded distinctly unimpressed by the offer. "We'll find out if they are right or wrong."
 
Due to Report Today
 Gooden, who is in the final year of a contract that will pay him $2.25 million this season, is scheduled to report here Thursday for the opening of spring training. Neader said that there was no chance Gooden would not report, but indicated that Gooden was entirely prepared to finish out the contract with the Mets and that he remained fully confident he could attract a contract comparable to Clemens's in the free-agent market next fall.
"Dwight Gooden can command those dollars whether it's now or later," Neader said. The agent added that plans were in place for Gooden to take out a multimillion-dollar insurance policy to safeguard himself against injury if he decided to end negotiations with the Mets.
Obviously irritated by what he termed the "artificial end date" publicly imposed by Gooden, Cashen took pains to say he considered the former Cy Young Award winner a "special" individual and one the Mets were eager to sign.
 
Holding Firm
 "Dwight Gooden is a valid and vivid part of this organization," said Cashen, who only last November endured an avalanche of criticism after Darryl Strawberry's departure to Los Angeles. "I have not laid down any arbitrary barriers. The negotiating door is always open to him: today, tomorrow, before the start of the season, during the season."
The Mets, it would appear through their repeated references to Clemens's contract as an "aberration," have only opened that door a crack at the moment, and they acknowledged that it could slam shut altogether if Gooden refused to move off the issue of the length of the extension.
"Four years, for me, would be a deal-buster," Cashen said. The general manager said "prudence and logic" as well as a look at the history of long-term contracts for pitchers convinced him that an extension to Gooden of four years would not be in the best interests of the organization.
 
Cashen's Reasoning
 As well, he added that the uncertain financial future of the sport in light of the country's economic recession and the team's steeply escalating payroll -- the Mets, whose payroll of slightly more than $20 million last year was the highest in the National League, expect it to top $30 million in 1992 -- had reinforced his resolve to be cautious in contract negotiations.
"I'm not here to plead poverty on behalf of the Mets," Cashen said. "And however inappropriate I might consider the decision of the Red Sox, we recognize Boston's need and right to do what's right for their organization. But we would defend with equal vigor our right to do what's right for our organization."
Of negotiations with Frank Viola, Cashen said the star left-hander and his agent had taken the "more commendable" route of not installing any deadline and that discussions were expected to continue. Viola's response to the club's preliminary offers has been unenthusiastic.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Will Choose, Despite White House;
Civil Rights Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker expresses puzzlement about President Bush's preference for statehood for Puerto Rico in "The 51st State?" (column, Feb. 9). He portrays the President as politically naive. Puerto Ricans are Democrats he suggests; and insinuates that the President, a Republican, is ill advised in wanting Puerto Ricans to have the right to vote in Federal elections.
Mr. Wicker seems to underestimate the value the President places on fairness. I doubt that Mr. Bush is unaware of the possibility that Puerto Ricans would not rally behind the Republican Party under statehood. His endorsement of statehood responds to his knowledge that Puerto Ricans do not enjoy equal treatment as United States citizens. Yet we fight and die for this country side by side with everybody else.
There are more men and women from Puerto Rico in the Persian Gulf today, proportionately, than there are from each of the 50 states. Yet Puerto Ricans did not elect the President that sent them there.
The issue of statehood for Puerto Rico is one of civil rights.
Mr. Wicker portrays Puerto Ricans as opportunists. He argues that statehood would be devastating for Puerto Rico, resulting in the loss of what, to him, are indispensable tax exemptions and in significant unemployment. He suggests that Puerto Ricans prefer statehood anyway because of a welfare mentality: "One reason" -- for the preference -- "is that many islanders are too poor to pay income tax, and statehood would make many eligible for nearly double welfare benefits -- causing an estimated $17 billion rise in Federal outlays for Puerto Rico, a short-term bonanza."
In a poll conducted in Puerto Rico last summer by the newspaper El Mundo and Channel 40 of Puerto Rico, and reported in the national press, those polled ranked considerations about which status would bring more assistance from the Federal Government as last in importance of seven choices they were given. The prospect of more employment opportunities and the right to vote for the President and Congress were clearly the most important issues for Puerto Ricans.

HEADLINE: Louis O. Kelso, Who Advocated Worker-Capitalism, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Louis Orth Kelso, a lawyer and economist who sought to revolutionize capitalism through employee stock ownership plans, which he invented, died on Sunday at the Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 77 years old and lived in San Francisco.
He died of a heart ailment, said a spokesman for Kelso & Company, where Mr. Kelso was chairman. 
 For nearly 50 years Mr. Kelso propounded his theory of worker-capitalists, in which workers would borrow money to buy capital assets, including exisiting companies that are automating and eliminating jobs.
 
A Reward for Company
 "The employee stock ownership plan, known as ESOP, was invented to democratize access to capital credit," Mr. Kelso and his wife, Patricia Hetter Kelso, wrote in 1989 in The New York Times.
"In human terms, it is a financing device that gradually transforms labor workers into capital workers. It does this by making a corporation's credit available to the employees, who then use it to buy stock in the company. The earnings of the company itself are used to pay for the stock. The company's reward from an ESOP -- in addition to a motivated work force of worker/owners -- is the low-cost financing of its own capital needs."
The first employee stock ownership plan was put into effect by Mr. Kelso in 1956 to enable the employees of Peninsula Newspapers Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif., to buy the newspaper chain. It has since been used by hundreds of companies, including Avis, Exxon, Standard Oil of California and Atlantic Richfield.
Born in Denver on Dec. 4, 1913, Mr. Kelso received degrees in finance and law from the University of Colorado. He practiced law in Denver with Pershing, Bosworth, Dick & Dawson from 1938 to 1942 and after serving in the Navy in World War II, briefly taught constitutional law and municipal finance at the University of Colorado.
He then moved to San Francisco and became a partner with the law firm of Kelso, Cotton, Seligman & Ray. In 1970, after he failed to persuade conventional banking investors to adopt ownership-broadening financing techniques, he founded Louis O. Kelso Inc. to promote employee stock ownership plans and also founded Kelso Bangert & Company, investment bankers.
 
Presidency of Institute
 Kelso Bangert & Company eventually became Kelso & Company, and Mr. Kelso served as managing director and chief executive. He was also president of the Kelso Institute for Economic Research and was a board member of the Institute for Philosophical Research in Chicago.
It was during his years in the Navy, as an intelligence officer in Panama, that Mr. Kelso first formulated his concept of employee ownership. The idea remained relatively dormant until the mid-1950's, when he met the philosopher Mortimer J. Adler. Together they wrote "The Capitalist Manifesto," published by Random House in 1958. They wrote a second book, "The New Capitalists: A Proposal to Free Economic Growth from the Slavery of Savings," published in 1961 by Random House.
Mr. Kelso refined and expanded on his idea in a third book, "The Two-Factor Theory: The Economics of Reality," published by Random House in 1968. This book, also titled "How to Turn Eighty Million Workers into Capitalists on Borrowed Money," was written with Patricia Hetter, whom he later married.
 
Push for New Laws
 They also collaborated on "Democracy and Economic Power: Extending the ESOP Revolution Through Binary Economics," published by Ballinger Press in 1986 and reissued in January by University Press of America.
Mr. Kelso was instrumental in having Federal and state laws passed to encourage expanded employee stock ownership. He also helped push for changes in the tax laws that were beneficial to employee stock ownership plans.
In addition to his wife, Patricia, he leaves two daughters from a previous marriage, Martha Brookman of Woodside, Calif., and Katie Balestreri of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Dinkins Inner Circle, Persistent Disarray

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
More than a year after he took office, Mayor David N. Dinkins's City Hall staff is plagued by internal disarray so persistent and open that other government officials, community groups and even some mayoral aides complain that important policy goals have suffered.
Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged that his administration has problems, saying that the biggest is a general failure to communicate effectively with New Yorkers. But some of his own aides and outside critics say the troubles have deeper dimensions. 
 Mr. Dinkins has long favored a chain of command that delegates much responsibility to his staff. He rides his aides hard butdoes not always make sure that they pull in the same direction, they say. As a result, some of his senior advisers say squabbles among his top aides aggravate what they cite as the Mayor's own weaknesses -- a ponderous style, stubbornness and a schedule so overcrowded that he often rushes from subject to subject.
 
Difficult Interplay
 Commissioners complain that they cannot get to see the Mayor enough, and jockeying is so pronounced among the five Deputy Mayors that in recent interviews some of them harshly criticized each other on the condition that their names not be attached to their remarks.
At the center of the squabbles is thestrange and difficult interplay among the Deputy Mayors. There is Mr. Dinkins's nominal right-hand man, Norman Steisel, who carries the title of First Deputy Mayor but worries, colleagues say, that he lacks the Mayor's unstinting confidence and is thus not always forceful enough with others in the Mayor's inner circle.
For example, Mr. Steisel's staff drafted a plan to combine or eliminate several city agencies as an efficiency move, but then he abandoned the plans when other senior Dinkins aides, with longer personal ties to the Mayor, complained to Mr. Dinkins.
Then there is Bill Lynch, the Deputy Mayor for Intergovernmental Affairs, who is subordinate to Mr. Steisel by title but closer to the Mayor by dint of long service as campaign manager and chief of staff when Mr. Dinkins was the Manhattan Borough President.
Mr. Lynch, a former community organizer as subtle as Mr. Steisel is blunt, has recently mused in an unusually public way about his self-perceived failings in a government role that he is not sure he likes. "He feels he's part of a process that is not serving the Mayor well," one Deputy Mayor sympathetic to him said.
 
Internal Stress
 Aides to both Mr. Lynch and Mr. Steisel say the two deputies like and respect each other but do not always understand each other. In a recent meeting of Deputy Mayors, Mr. Lynch implored Mr. Steisel to "lead us," one senior aide said, and Mr. Steisel's reaction was to ask another aide why Mr. Lynch was playing mind games with him.
This internal stress is becoming more than just a matter for City Hall gossip. Members of the City Council, the State Legislature, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and others have all made unusually pointed criticisms of City Hall's management in recent weeks. Last week, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, warned that mixed messages from the Dinkins administration -- one external sign of the internal confusion -- had endangered the city's credibility in the financial world.
"The management problems are perhaps matters of perception," Mr. Regan said in a speech to the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group, "but are illustrated by the often-reported switches in fiscal signals coming from City Hall -- for example, pay raises coupled with layoff announcements."
People who must deal regularly with City Hall -- from politicians and lobbyists to interest groups and reporters -- say they are often unsure who can answer questions definitively, let alone whom to go to for decisions and action.
Mr. Dinkins himself, when asked who could speak authoritatively for the administration, said in a recent interview, "Depends on what it is." He added that he relied on each of his five deputies, or combinations of them, to handle particular areas, and then to make the final decisions with him.
Mr. Dinkins's first year has been unusually difficult, dominated by steadily deepening fiscal problems. He also had to confront both high expectations and deep skepticism as the city's first black mayor, as have other black politicians around the country. But his own aides concede that stresses within the staff have made it harder to cope with such headaches.
Outsiders say the internal problems have slowed adoption of policies and programs on issues from the homeless to labor negotiations to maintaining strong ties to Mr. Dinkins's core electoral coalition of black and Hispanic voters.
 
An Albany Victory
 Ten days ago, Mr. Dinkins won the biggest victory of his administration, securing an agreement with the Legislature on a plan to hire thousands of police officers and expand the justice system, a program the Mayor called "motherhood and apple pie." But politicians in Albany and on the City Council were soured enough by the fight to charge that the victory came despite City Hall's efforts as much as because of them.
Last year, Mr. Dinkins took particular pains to say he would form an administration reflecting the city's diversity. That has thrown a mix of former community advocates together with longtime city officials who have served in a number of administrations but did not know Mr. Dinkins well, like Mr. Steisel.
"The mix between outsiders and insiders produces clashes," said one senior aide who has worked for several mayors. "That's a constant frustration and also a challenge for all of us to recognize and pull together.
"The Mayor compartmentalizes people. To the extent he does that and gives off that impression, it makes it harder to weld a team together."
 
Control Over Schedule
 Mr. Dinkins said he was seeking to assert greater control over his schedule and wanted to meet more often with his commissioners. But he also expressed some annoyance at any suggestion that he is too isolated from the people running his government.
If anyone needs to speak with him, he said, "it's very simple: all you do is call me up and leave a number."
"Whatever complaints they've got," he said, "they cannot say I don't return phone calls."
Other administrations have had troubled first years. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch had well-chronicled staff problems, which led him after 19 months to shrink his staff from seven deputy mayors to three overnight. Another Mayor, John V. Lindsay, lost his press secretary and his chief deputy within his first year in office.
"It's come to be a historical imperative that sometime around the first year there are fireworks at City Hall," said Gordon J. Davis, a former Parks Commissioner who served on Mr. Dinkins's transition team. "I'm surprised there haven't been. I think it's a necessity, but it hasn't happened and I'm not close enough to it to say why."
Mr. Dinkins has given no hints that he plans big changes. So far, the only senior official to resign is the press secretary, Albert Scardino.
Every mayor creates his own structure at City Hall and Mr. Dinkins's is led by Mr. Steisel, a former Sanitation Commissioner as burly as the garbage collectors he once bossed.
But both supporters and critics of Mr. Steisel say his gruffness masks an insecurity with his standing, which leads him at times to be too deferential to his colleagues, hesitating to lead the administration's charges, especially in building political support -- a criticism Mr. Steisel called "ridiculous."
At the same time, these aides say, Mr. Dinkins takes the "first" in Mr. Steisel's title seriously, often making other deputies reluctant or unable to step in.
At Mr. Dinkins's other hand is his chief political aide, Mr. Lynch, who in recent conversations has talked openly about the disappointment of many of the Mayor's grass-roots supporters over the administration's inability to mount new programs.
The old campaigner, Mr. Lynch's friends say, is deeply distressed in a government role he is not sure he likes, but feels powerless to change, and has considered leaving.
Mr. Lynch says he is staying and he rejects suggestions that he is not good at government. "There are some frustrations, sure," he said.
 
Full Confidence
 Mr. Dinkins said that he has full confidence in all his deputies and that they need not always agree. "The awareness that there's more than one perspective, if you will, that's damn healthy and desirable," he said.
But his aides say the differing perspectives do not always get blended.
When two other longtime Dinkins aides, Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife, who is in charge of planning, and Deputy Mayor Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, who is responsible for finance and economic development, complained to the Mayor about proposals to combine or eliminate city agencies under their purview, Mr. Steisel abandoned the plans, which had been drafted at his direction, aides said.
"They know how to play him," one senior aide sympathetic to Mr. Steisel said of the relationships of Mr. Lynch, Mrs. Fife and Ms. Hernandez-Pinero with the Mayor.
The fifth Deputy Mayor, Milton Mollen, a former appellate judge who now oversees public safety, has been most visible as the chief lobbyist for Mr. Dinkins's plan to hire thousands of police officers and expand the justice system.
Mr. Mollen said he viewed passage of the plan as a "victory for determination, and flexibility in dealing with the concerns of the Legislature, even when some of the things were not truly relevant but nevertheless things we had to deal with."
 
'Reeked With Merit'
 But he also said the plan had passed because it "reeked with merit" and conceded that in pressing for it, the administration made some missteps that left it politically vulnerable. When the Council proposed that the five borough presidents have no say in how the money for the crime plan would be spent, the administration intially acquiesced, even though the City Charter specifies that the borough presidents together have the right to jointly propose 5 percent of discretionary mayoral spending.
Only when the borough presidents complained loudly to the Mayor and threatened to sue did the administration agree to include them.
The Mayor and his staff often fail to follow through on the most elemental details of planning. On Feb. 10, Mr. Dinkins appeared at a church fund-raiser for Representative Floyd H. Flake, the Queens minister who has been indicted on charges of diverting church funds to his own use. The stop never appeared on the Mayor's schedule -- an inadvertent lapse, he said. When reporters asked about it, he lectured them on what they had missed.
"I got a very wonderful reception from an audience that was 99.9 percent African-American, at a time when some were suggesting the African-American community was displeased with my trip to Israel, for whatever that's worth," he said.
The Mayor said of his overall efforts: "We're getting some things accomplished that people said we could not get accomplished, and I'm satisfied that it's going to get better because we are smarter every minute. We're learning more and more every day, and I think people to some degree are coming to accept me for who I am and what I am."

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary Makes Careful Overture

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
In her first public appearance with the leaders of organized labor, the new Labor Secretary, Lynn Martin, made it clear today that she was unlikely to kick up dust any time soon.
Mrs. Martin showed support for some goals of labor that the Administration has previously endorsed, like removing the "glass ceiling" that often blocks the promotion of women and members of minorities into top management. 
 But she also seemed unlikely to break with President Bush on initiatives he has opposed, like requiring employers to grant leaves to new parents, or civil rights legislation that incorporates what the Administration considers hiring quotas for women and minority workers.
Mrs. Martin, who has been confirmed by the Senate and is to be sworn in Friday, said, "I am a Republican and I work for the President," according to several union presidents who attended her closed-door appearance before the 35-member executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 
Briefing by Kirkland
 "She said she was against quotas for civil rights," Lane Kirkland, president of the federation, said at a briefing for reporters. Unions and Democratic leaders in Congress seek legislation allowing workers to use company personnel statistics to support complaints of discrimination against women and minorities. The President vetoed such legislation last year, arguing that it would lead to hiring quotas, an assertion proponents of the bill deny.
As a Republican Congresswoman from Illinois, Mrs. Martin did break with the White House last year. She supported a bill, later vetoed by President Bush, to require employers to allow family leaves after the birth and adoption of children or to attend to seriously ill family members.
Her stance on the bill and on a few other issues, despite an overall voting record that unions judged strongly anti-labor, has raised hopes here that Mrs. Martin might prove the Trojan horse in the White House.
Mrs. Martin gave up her seat in Congress to run against Senator Paul Simon, a Democrat who defeated her in November. Speaking to reporters about her conversations with Mr. Bush about her appointment, she said, "At no time did he suggest that I change."
 
Issue of Replacements
 The family-leave legislation being reintroduced this year is still "a case of mandated benefits, and that's where there's a problem," she said. But she did not indicate whether she, as well as the President, perceived the legislation as a problem.
The issue that most angers unions is the hiring of "permanent replacements" by companies when workers go on strike, and Mrs. Martin revealed little of her own views on the matter. Labor sees the widening use of permanent replacements by strikebound employers like The Daily News in New York, Greyhound and Eastern Airlines as undermining its already greatly diminished place in the economy.
 
Issue of Replacements
 Unions complain that, when employers hire replacements and keep them after a strike, strikers lose their jobs and unions lose their most effective weapon, the strike, in seeking better pay and working conditions. "She hasn't made up her mind" on the issue, Mr. Kirkland said. "That's what she told us."
The Administration has yet to state a position on permanent replacements, but one senior official, who commented only on the condition of not being identified, said he and some colleagues felt that banning the practice, which the law has permitted for more than 50 years but which was rarely used until the 1980's, could lead to waves of strikes and disruption of the economy.
Mrs. Martin and the Administration may have to take a position soon because of widespread expectations that the House of Representatives is close to approving a bill to end the use of permanent replacements. During a visit here Tuesday, the new chairman of the House Education and Labor Commitee, Representative William D. Ford of Michigan, said the bill already has 193 co-sponsors in the House.
Mrs. Martin was quiet on the issue of a resolution supporting a national health care program that the executive council, after hard debate, adopted here. The council voted in favor of having the Government require all employers either to provide health insurance or pay a tax for Government-provided health insurance.
Congressional leaders who visited the labor meeting cautioned unions not to expect quick action on the issue, given the certain opposition of thousands of employers, many of them small, who do not provide insurance.
"I don't think we will do national health insurance in this session," Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington told reporters after meeting with the council. "But we'll begin the national debate."
Despite the chilly reception Mr. Kirkland gave the President's announcement of Mrs. Martin's appointment, he and the union presidents received her warmly here, much as they used to receive her predecessor, Elizabeth Dole.
Mrs. Martin adopted much the same conciliatory approach as Mrs. Dole, promising to keep her door open to unions, to funnel their views to the White House and to dwell more on issues on which labor and the White House agree rather than on those they dispute. Unlike any Republican predecessor the union leaders here could recall, she spent three days here, dining and meeting with them and sounding them out -- but without making major commitments on issues.
"We have high hopes, but we're realists," said Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. He said he was encouraged by the interest she showed in worker safety and programs to retrain workers who lose jobs in old industries. "But on parental leave, striker replacement, health-care reform, she's going to be on board with whatever the Administration is."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Robert Tisch Agrees to Buy 50% of the Champion Giants

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI

 BODY:
Preston Robert Tisch, the billionaire president of Loews Corporation, agreed yesterday to purchase 50 percent of the Super Bowl champion New York Giants for a price believed to be at least $60 million.
"I think it's one of the great franchises in the sports world," Mr. Tisch said. "I grew up as a New Yorker and in Brooklyn." 
 Mr. Tisch, whose brother, Laurence, is chairman of CBS, said he would leave the football operations in the hands of Wellington Mara, who will continue to own the other 50 percent of the club.
 
Concern Over CBS Link
 Paul Tagliabue, the National Football League commissioner, said in a statement yesterday that the agreement to buy the team included a guarantee that there would be "total separation" between the league and CBS, which is one of the five networks that televise N.F.L. games. Loews Corporation owns 22.9 percent of CBS.
"I've never been involved with CBS," Mr. Tisch, who is known as Bob, said when asked if there was a possible conflict of interest. "I'm an outside director of CBS." He said that he was the sole buyer in the deal and that it was being done personally, not corporately. For the deal to go through, it must be approved by 21 of the 28 N.F.L. owners, whose next scheduled meeting is in March.
Mr. Tisch is buying the half of the team owned by Tim Mara -- Wellington Mara's nephew -- and his mother, Helen Mara Nugent, and sister, Maura Concannon. Wellington and Tim Mara have been at odds for years, and even the success of recent seasons, including Super Bowl victories in 1987 and last month, did not end their dispute.
 
'The Time Was Right'
 "We considered selling the team twice before, in 1984 and 1986," Tim Mara, who is 53 years old, said yesterday. "But this is the first one we seriously considered. I just felt that at this point in my life the time was right."
In 1925, the year before Mr. Tisch was born, Timothy Mara, who was Wellington's father and Tim's grandfather, purchased the National Football League franchise for New York for $500 from his earnings as a legal bookmaker. He put it into the Polo Grounds and named it the Giants after the baseball team that played there. Five years later, ownership passed to his young sons, Jack and Wellington, although he retained control.
When Jack Mara died in 1965, his half of the franchise went to his widow, Helen, and his two children, Tim and Maura. The 64-year-old Mr. Tisch, who served as Postmaster General in the Reagan Administration from August 1986 to March 1988, said he would not be involved in football decisions.
"Wellington will continue to be responsible for the day-to-day football operations, and I'll handle the financial aspects," Mr. Tisch said. "I will take an active part in that part of the operation."
 
Young's Role
 He said George Young, the general manager, would continue to have the final say on player contracts.
Mr. Tisch would not put a dollar figure on the transaction. When asked about the purchase price, Tim Mara said $60 million "is low."
More than $60 million would be in line with the estimated value of one of the league's premier franchises. The Giants' ticket revenues exceed $15 million a year. Like all other N.F.L. teams, they will earn $28 million from television this year.
A high-ranking official of another franchise, who insisted on anonymity, said the Giants were worth between $120 million to $130 million. A club owner who spoke on condition of anonymity suggested those figures could be on the low side.
 
Value Hard to Assess
 The value of sports franchises, most of which are privately held, is difficult to estimate because of fluctuations in the market based not only on general economic conditions, but also on the success or failure of the team.
Based on a 20 percent sale, the Chicago Bears, one of the most successful pro football franchises, were valued at $120 million in 1990. In the case of the Giants, total ownership of the team, fresh from a Super Bowl triumph, may be worth even more than twice the value of the half-interest Mr. Tisch is buying.
Financial success, though, could not overcome the animosity between the Maras as the Giants suffered through 15 years of mostly losing football after the glory years of the early 1960's. In 1978 the pair brought their feud into the open over Wellington's desire to bring in a general manager that Tim did not approve of. Finally, in 1979, Pete Rozelle, then the commissioner, stepped in.
 
Team Has Prospered
 On Valentine's Day, Mr. Young was installed as the club's general manager, and, often acting as a buffer between the uncle and nephew, has seen it prosper. There have been two Super Bowl championships, achieved under Coach Bill Parcells, and an unending string of season-ticket sales of all 76,000 seats in Giants Stadium.
Mr. Tisch, of course, is no stranger to prosperity. He and Laurence were estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth $3.1 billion. Between them, their 27.3 percent of Loews is worth almost $2 billion.
The roots of the family fortune trace to 1946 when Laurence, studying law at Harvard, persuaded his parents to sell two summer camps and use the proceeds to buy a hotel in Lakewood, N.J. Robert graduated from the University of Michigan in 1948 with a B.A. in economics, and the brothers invested the hotel's profits and before long had one of the fastest-growing corporations in the country.
Mr. Tisch, who has had a longstanding interest in owning a football team said: "The Giants came into my life last November. Wellington and I had lunch and I heard there was a possibility Helen was selling."

HEADLINE: Doing Business Screen to Screen

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
By most measures, the business of holding video conferences was a boom waiting to happen. Thanks to an unpredictable confluence of events, ranging from the Persian Gulf crisis, to corporate curtailment of foreign and domestic travel, to a sizable drop in the cost of meeting screen-to-screen, video conference rooms are filling up.
 "It's incredible," says Holly Owens, director of the Sprint Meeting Channel, a unit of U S Sprint based in Atlanta. One big company, she said, has reserved meeting times in 900 video conference rooms on the Sprint network between now and July. The company expects to hold 140 meetings between managers in the United States and foreign cities. "We've never seen anything like that before," Ms. Owens said. "Video conferencing was popular before, but nothing like it has been since January 15," shortly before war erupted in the Persian Gulf. 
This blooming of the video conference comes after important advances in computer chips that helped manufacturers correct balky, slow-motion, screen images and other technical bugs, as well as slash prices. The fully equipped conference room can be outfitted for less than $50,000, down from $90,000 just four years ago. And like just about everything in electronic wizardry, many analysts predict that prices will continue to fall. In fact, the PictureTel Corporation, one of three makers of video conference equipment, recently displayed a complete system priced at $39,700.
 Managers at Air Products and Chemicals Inc. plan to hold 60 hours of video conference meetings between the company's headquarters in Allentown, Pa., and its office outside London this month because of worries about terrorism and travel budget cuts. That is up from 20 hours in January.
 Prior to the war, the company figured that video conferences between Allentown and Houston, where it was working with the Bechtel Corporation to design and build a new polyvinyl plant, had reduced travel expenses by more than $100,000 in the last two years.
 "In some cases, we've cut weeks out of the whole construction process" said Virgil W. Palmer, Air Products' head of telecommunications planning. "We can get key people in two locations to sit down together, work through their problems and issues and then go off and implement the changes without ever having been in the same room."
 
80% Occupancy
 At Brown & Root Inc., an engineering and construction unit of the Halliburton Company, the video meeting room at its Houston headquarters is occupied 80 percent of the time, up from a prewar reservation rate of about 50 percent.
 A group of five research engineers at the Hewlett-Packard Company, in Palo Alto, Calif., canceled a trip to Waldbronn, Germany, a week after the war broke out, but still conducted the meeting as scheduled by using one of the company's 29 video meeting rooms. Reservations at the Hewlett-Packard rooms in Europe have risen nearly threefold this month, said Brad Whitworth, a spokesman.
 Companies that do not have video meeting systems of their own have besieged "public" rooms, like those connected by Sprint, often to tie down reservations for the same times that they had been scheduled to be shaking hands or sipping tea out of town.
 After the war started, a team at J.C. Penney Company postponed a meeting in Japan with a potentially important business contact. But Penney managers recovered by booking a room in Dallas and the session went on virtually as planned Tuesday night.
 "They couldn't travel and we couldn't travel, but this was a way to continue our discussions," said Al Lynch, director of a new division of international development at Penney. "The consensus on both sides was that it was a very successful meeting. The transmission from Japan was very clear.
 " If I were to have my preference, I would have had this as the second meeting, rather than our first. But this was a very meaningful supplement. You do get some rapport, but it's not the same thing." Stunted Growth
 The growth in video conferencing, as dramatic as it has been recently, has also been stunted because most meetings must use coding equipment made by the same producer and must be confined to two rooms. But later this year, when makers of coding devices adopt the same standard for transmitting video images, the possibilities for video conferences will rise. And, within another two years, equipment will be available for groups meeting in several locations simultaneously.
 Video conferencing equipment has been available since the late 1970's, when Compression Labs Inc. of San Jose was founded, but until recently it was scorned as too costly and unworkable. In the early 1980's, users paid $1 million to dress up conference rooms, and then $1,200 for each one-hour, coast-to-coast telephone call to link the rooms. Few companies considered a video conference worth the expense.
 But in the last two years, the prices have fallen so much that many managers eager for alternatives to travel said that the new equipment caused them to take a closer look. Prices for equipment now average about $50,000 a room. Rates for video conference calls over digital networks coast-to-coast are as low as $30 an hour at the slowest transmission speed, down from $96 an hour as recently as 1985.
 
2,500 Video Conference Rooms
 Sales of the boxy computers that compress and reassemble video images, and can transmit them great distances over telephone lines, are rising. The number of meeting rooms equipped for video teleconferences in the United States rose to 2,500 last year, from 700 in 1988, according to American Telephone and Telegraph.
 "The technology and the economic justification for video teleconferencing were catching on very rapidly prior to the war," said Herbert R. Maher, a telecommunications analyst at Tucker, Anthony Inc., in Boston. "But the publicity that it's gotten as a result of the war has caused a lot of people to try it."
 Mr. Maher said revenues for makers of video conferencing equipment increased by 90 percent a year in the last two years, to $110 million in 1990, and will exceed $500 million in 1994. Most equipment sold in the United States is made by three manufacturers: Compression Labs, PictureTel of Peabody, Mass., and VideoTelecom Corporation, of Austin, Tex. Analysts said large Japanese electronics makers, including Sony and Matsushita, will enter the fray soon. The order backlog at Compression Labs, the largest manufacturer with $51.8 million in 1990 sales, has risen to $26 million. "We've got our hands full," said David Belove, a spokesman.
 
Cost Is Falling
 Managers at the Syntex Corporation, which plans to install its first four video conferencing systems in the next year, figured that the average cost of aone-hour video meeting between its headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., and New York City has dropped to $250, from $750 a year ago.
 The pharmaceutical company, concluded after a four-month study last year that it saved $1,700 in travel expenses each time a video meeting was used in place of a trip. Most people said the video meetings were as useful as face to face meetings.
 Syntex senior executives are counting on video meetings to improve productivity more than anything else, said Hans Wolf, vice chairman and chief administrative officer. Fewer than 4,000 of Syntex's 10,000 employees live and work in the San Francisco Bay area, so many of its scientists and managers travel frequently.
 "We are a research-oriented company operating in every continent except Africa with a very high percentage of professionals, many trained as scientists," he said. "The time of our people is worth a lot more than saving $1,700 a day in travel costs. Our primary goal is to avoid travel."
 For that reason, Syntex is buying equipment for a new site that will open next year 40 miles from its Palo Alto home office in San Jose, as well as for a research unit in Boulder, Colo., and a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico.
 
Less Travel
 "There won't have to be as much travel between Palo Alto and San Jose," Mr. Wolf said. "It doesn't sound very far, but just the driving can take a couple hours out of your day."
 Video conferences are possible in most major metropolitan areas, where long-distance telephone companies like A.T.&T., Sprint and MCI, which are battling for bigger shares of the growing business, have completed fiber-optic networks required to transmit the digital signals.
 Ellen Curtis, senior product manager at Syntex, said there were limitations to video conferece calls, but overall she is pleased with the technology.
 "Depending on what the purpose of the meeting is, a video conference can be 90 percent as effective as being there in person." she said. "Maybe 100 percent, if your purpose is communicating information. It's a little tougher when you're there for a brainstorming, creative purpose, especially knowing that the dollars are ticking away. That may not be the best utility for it."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about video conferences misstated the number of rooms on the Sprint Meeting Channel reserved by one big company after the start of the Persian Gulf war. It was some, not all, of Sprint's 900 rooms.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Iraqi Leader;
Text of Hussein's Radio Speech Dealing With War and Peace

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Following is the text of a speech by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq broadcast today on Baghdad Radio, as translated by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, an agency of the United States Government:
O great people; O stalwart men in our valiant armed forces; O faithful, honest Muslims, wherever you may be; O people wherever faith in God has found its way to your hearts, and wherever it found what embodies it in the sincerity of your intentions and deeds; O lovers of humanity, virtue, and fairness, who reject aggressiveness, injustice, and unfairness. In difficult circumstances and their events, some people -- more often than not -- lose the connection with the beginning and preoccupy themselves with the results -- or forget, when there are resemblances -- the connection between any result and the reasons that gave rise to those events, and on whose basis those results were based. 
 Furthermore, in difficult circumstances, which difficulty is hard to describe, the mind and consciousness are generally preoccupied with what influences the life of the individual concerned with that circumstance. Thus, he bases his opinion and position on it without connecting every individual case with what is collective. The future is even absent at times, or not given very great importance as a indispensable weight for assessing the [inaudible] of each case, regardless of whether that case, or individual item that is being assessed, is connected to the past and present or to the reasons and beginnings, or whether it is part of the results; and regardless of whether it was part of the simple results and individual items, with limited effect, or of the major results that have a comprehensive effect that go beyond the individual, a number of individuals, or only a specific sector in the society, to the society as a whole and where it goes beyond the transient and quick moving present to the future as a whole.
 
The Boycott of Iraq
Some have either completely forgotten these influential facts in the life of man, whether in this or that direction, or the presence of these facts in their minds has become weak. Many facts between causes and effects, or between the prelude to and the results of the circumstances and events that preceded 2 August and what took place on 2 August and afterward, have been missed.
This description was in most cases applicable to some Arabs and to many foreigners so that some of them could not remember what Zionism and U.S. imperialism have done against Iraq, beginning with the Irangate plot or the Iran-Contra scandal in 1986 until the first months of 1990, when the plot against Iraq reached its dangerous phases when U.S. and Western media began to prepare for the Israeli aggression against us, but which we confronted in the statement of 8 April 1990; when the Americans cut off bread from Iraq and canceled the grain deal concluded with U.S. companies in the third month of the same year, that is 1990; and when they raised the slogan of an economic, technologic, and scientific boycott of Iraq and worked to make Europe and Japan do the same.
We know that recalling the preludes and causes leading up to the results, and recalling the grounds for an event or events in a permanent manner and in all [inaudible] is not an easy undertaking. This is because doing so requires a high degree of awareness, or because this requires a vital connection between those recalling the backgrounds and preludes to these events, and the kind of immediate and long-term suffering produced by their causes and effects.
Those whom we describe as forgetful or being unaware of the connection between a given cause and a given effect do not all enjoy the same degree of awareness that provides the elements of [inaudible] what is required. Most of them have not suffered the causes and effects of the circumstances, especially in the world arena. Therefore, we have faced serious difficulties in making them understand that what happened on 2 August, despite the clarity of the entirely just historic dimension, is basically not a cause within the course of the conflict between Iraq -- as a bastion of faith and honorable aspiration -- and Zionism and U.S. imperialism. The events of that day are one aspect of the results of the battle or the conflict that preceded 2 August. The measure taken on the glorious day of the call is a means of self-defense, and one aimed at defending all honorable principles and values of Iraq. Although [inaudible] an offensive form, and account of the events of this day should not be taken out from the general context of developments. A correct account of this requires that it be placed within its comprehensive framework.
 
The U.S. Alliance
The failure of some world circles, especially among politicians who are [inaudible] against the Arabs [inaudible] to understand has been boosted by the fact that -- regardless of the details -- the objective of these circles is to harm Iraq's accomplishments.
Some tyrannical Arab rulers, who betrayed the nation's principles and aspirations of their peoples, cooperated with and stopped to this tendency. They accepted degradation and humiliation, even inside the palaces and seats of their rule. They chose the path of obeying the tendentious foreigner and his evil, hostile intentions.
This flood of media campaigns officially conducted against us by 30 countries further complicated the prospect of establishing a link between causes and effects, and between what happened to the Arabs and to the Iraqis prior to 2 August, what happened on the day of the call to glory, and what happened after 2 August. All the accumulated extensions and influences of these countries accompany these campaigns, and are affected by them. Nevertheless, the noble person has remained noble, and is guided by the facts -- not merely through what he sees and hears, but through that which his heart and his faithful empathy with jihad and his destiny with the Iraqi stance lead him.
This is the stance of the people in this nation. What has guided them in this direction has been their long suffering at the hands of the ranks of injustice, the unjust, and the Arab rulers who are their allies and who betrayed the nation and sold out honor and religion to the foreigner. Some of those rulers chose this course as an indispensable path to assuming their places on the seat of power, and undeservedly impose themselves on their people. It was the advance price for their agentry. Other rulers stooped to this after they discovered that there was no other way to keep the seat of power -- taking into account the nature of rule they have chosen -- except by complying with the will of the U.S. intelligence services. This applies without exception to the Arab rulers who are siding with the United States today and supplying its aggression under the Arab cover and with funds it needs, and with the false and fraudulent talk of Arab ability. Evil is what they are doing.
 
Origin of Dispute
Traitor Fahd, the betrayer of the two mosques, and lightheaded Hosni, the ruler with which noble Arab Egypt has been afflicted, stand at the head of the list. Faced with this state of affairs, we found that the enemy media and the enemy policy dropped a heavy screen on every event, stand, or cause that preceded 2 August 1990 that could shed some light on these incidents and explain their true nature. Palestine -- whose just cause dates back more than 40 years -- as well as its future and the positions on it has been one of the most important pillars of the conspiracy in which the oil rulers have participated as conspirators against Iraq, led by the agent sheiks of Kuwait and the Saudi rulers.
Biased people have even tried to neglect the fate of Palestine as being one of the causes of these events. The tendentious media, which have widespread influence and impact, and the suspect politicians and those who seek personal objectives -- backed by Zionism everywhere -- began to focus on the 2 August events to depict them as having taken place without any basis or background and as though our attention were being devoted only to these events. They even issued orders to silence voices and prevent them from mentioning any historical background that would explain to the foreigner or the Arab what he does not know about the reality of the relationship that exists between Kuwait and Iraq, and that Kuwait is part of Iraq, but was annexed following the partitioning conspiracy to weaken the Arab nation, harm its status and role, and weaken every Arab country that has some kind of leverage.
In view of this deluge of the falsification of facts, and of this large number of countries participating in the aggression, or those who have been confused about the real reasons for the results, it is insufficient to respond and clarify through media and political statements alone, in view of our modest influence. Measures and actions are inevitable in order to place the innocent, who do not know the [inaudible] before a rational debate that bypasses the smokescreens and misinformation launched by hostile information media.
 
Feb. 15 Initiative
Something must be done to place the enemies in an embarrassing situation or in an impasse -- something that will drive them to behavior and positions that will make those who have been anesthetized by hostile media wake up to new facts or new [inaudible] that will reveal to them the facts, free from covers, so that they can appear as they are: crystal clear. Thus came the 15 February initiative, which the Revolution Command Council statement fired at the enemy goal -- to use the terms of sports and athletics -- so as to shake the nets of the enemy court.
Either an acceptance that pleases friends, or rejection that annoys the enemies. This may divide their ranks, which are founded on rancor and rallied around wrong. Certain people who have been misled will discover what will help them to realize that what has happened, and the root of what has happened, was not caused by 2 August and what followed. What preceded 2 August does not go back to 1990, its events, and circumstances alone, but goes back to every iota of dignity and pride, faith and tenacity toward right, rejection of the wrong, and hostility to criminal usurper Zionism, support for the poor, and the fight against injustice and corruption. These stands are the qualities of Iraqis or what has been revived in them by the revolutionary leadership.
The rancor against Iraq has been created over time. With every aspect of capability added to it or created, to become a serious pillar of its characteristics and potential, with steadfastness in the face of the aggression exposing the weakness of some of the Arabs vis-a-vis the aggression of Zionism and the ambitions of the Americans, with every book that has been written with the sweat in support of the blood of struggle, with every effort and every stage of building in Iraq's lofty edifice, with every floor in the building of its new civilization or a wheel in every factory or plant which has been built as a symbol of loftiness and as an introduction to a new happy and prosperous life under firm faith in God, the homeland, and the nation, and with the slogan of the poor have a right in the wealth of the rich, because they are members of the same people or members of the same nation, and all of them are the sons of Adam and Eve.
 
The Egyptian Stand
To those who ask about the rancor of Hosni and others like him toward the leadership and people of Iraq, and to those who were alarmed by this rancor harbored by those who ate and drank under Iraqi hospitality and were given attention which they do not deserve: We say that we do not regret the hospitality and good intentions accorded by us or the people of Iraq toward people whom we wanted, at the time, to be brothers of the Iraqis, when they stood in the ranks of the faithful, with noble convictions, and honorable intentions. But since they have committed treason, no one will feel sorry for them. May God's curse be upon them until the day of judgment. We say that these misled people have derived their rancor against you, O Iraqis, and against your leadership, from the attributes which you possess and which have characterized your leadership. These misled people have apparently found in every call for honor and purity of intention, and in every call stating that the ruler or leader should be part of his people, an insult aimed against him personally by the people of Iraq and its leadership.
Each placard you raised when you went out to receive then, those who rejected the Zionist scheme and U.S. imperialism and denounced their agents, was viewed by them as a placard directed against then. Each word said about the importance of the fairness of the ruler or leader, and about his lightweight guilt guilt when the money he carries is lightweight, was considered a personal attack against them. Each denunciation of weakness, submissiveness, and the acceptance of humiliation was a insult to them.
 
The Iraqis
Yes, noble mujahedeen sons in Iraq: That group of Arabs, and maybe other rulers, and even some foreigners, have found that every positive feature in you and your structure reflects, in a shining mirror, their shortcomings and defects before the people and the nation. Each call for power, invincibility, faith, capability, nobility, pride, dignity, courage, liberation from the foreigner, abstinence, and the liberation of the soul from the ill-gotten money; and each attempt to highlight the correct qualities of an official, in accordance with Arab and Muslim standards, was considered an instigation against them and a call to and indoctrination of their peoples to triumph over them.
It seems this is why some Arab rulers were filled with hatred against you. This, along with covetous designs, is also the reason that may fill some foreigners with hatred against you. But, brothers and sons, stalwart and honest men, and glorious women, what more can we do? Would anything other than this have left even a grain of honor, faith, glory, and pride; or would it have left a gift that we would taken pride in and a future toward whose doors and shining promises we race?
Would any action to the contrary -- in which we would follow the heels of the foreigner in the direction that he wants -- leave a drop of honor for the men and free women? Would any such act leave faith and its rites anything but decaying bones and fine dust that meets no need? Is there [inaudible] that our great Iraqi people and glorious nation takes pride in other than this course? We will all maintain our character and will demand anything else that will boost and entrench faith and cleanse souls to the satisfaction of [inaudible] and the nation.
There is no other course than the one we have chosen, except the course of humiliation and darkness, after which there will be no bright sign in the sky or brilliant light on earth. We have chosen this course. The Iraqis have chosen this course in an era where many characteristics became manifest. They continue to ask and work for what will make them more brilliant, faithful, and lofty. There is no other course. We will protect it with our souls, funds, and hearts. We will proceed on this course, irrespective of the nature of the political efforts which we are exerting and whose formulation and directions Tariq Aziz carried to Moscow, and which, if rejected, will expose all the covers and will only maintain the premeditated intentions of the aggression against us without any cover and without any slogans that will lead to intermingling.
 
Bush and Fahd
After the 15 February 1991 initiative sprang from its sister initiative of 12 August 1990, what did Bush say, and what did his servant Fahd say? Bush rejected it, and regarded it as a cruel hoax before he understood it. Fahd, who chews his words just as camels chew the grass of their pastures, became an eloquent orator to say the war against Iraq will continue until Iraq does this and that. Note, O observers; note, O people who have been distracted by the 2 August 1990 events from the real intentions of the aggression; note and examine that which you have overlooked. The Iraqis and good people became aware of it at an early date.
Note how Bush and Fahd have designs regarding matters that were not included among their slogans, either before or after 2 August, and not until a short time ago. Note how they now have ambitions for greater things -- lightheaded Hosni speaks in the same strain -- in order to reveal their true intentions and not accept the 15 February initiative. Remember how in the period that preceded the announcement of the initiative, they and others in the West used to say that as soon as the word withdrawal is said, everything will be possible afterward.
Note how they now have revealed their greed more clearly than they did -- even in the moment preceding the announcement of the initiative. Note what their media are talking about now. These media are speaking about depriving Iraq of strength and capability, and of the manifestations of progress, honor, and good example. They want to deprive Iraq of every quality characterizing truly faithful people and good sons who are faithful to their people, homeland, and nation. Shame on them, and shame on their cowardly act, and all they do.
 
Determination of Iraq
Note how those who at one stage of the struggle wanted to make of the word withdrawal an introduction to the undermining of our Armed Forces' determination and resolve and to sow disarray in their ranks no longer are interested in such a word now -- or so they claim. They have started to neglect it and to talks about what is new, now that this has become a gratuitous gain, as they believe.
They forgot that our people and armed forces -- in addition to their evident great determination for jihad, which is a dowry to the wedding of jihad and sacrifice -- are also fully aware that every step we make should be countered by what it deserves in terms of guarantees and by an action that keeps the future open before the Iraqis and the Arabs and all the faithful who reject injustice in the world and that the word withdrawal has been placed by the Iraqis, the Arabs, and the good men of this world within this context and within the proper framework.
From this premise, and in the context of the comprehensive approach, it is the entire 15 February initiative, as a new beginning, that will make the Iraqis more determined and more resolved if the initiative is rejected. Their armed forces will become more capable. This will result from the exposure of pretexts and disclosure of the true nature of the premeditated intentions. All this will make them more patient and steadfast and better prepared for the battle which God blesses and which good men support -- after which there will be only a glorious conclusion, where a brilliant sun will will clear the dust of battle, and where the clouds of battles will be dispelled to make room for a brilliant moon surrounded by a halo, whose size will be commensurate with the sacrifices that are required by the duties and conditions of victory and by the patience that God Almighty expects from the people of holy war.
 
The Land Offensive
O brothers, O people: Note how those who feared a ground battle have now avoided the showdown for over a month. They have persisted further in killing civilians [inaudible] and destroying property with their long-range aircraft and missiles with rancor that dwarfs that of Hulegu [grandson of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan]. They are doing this in an [inaudible] to cover up their inability to confront our land forces in southern Iraq. Note how they, and certain people who do not know the Iraqis' faith and capability, now portray matters as though the mere fact of not launching the land offensive is a gain to Iraq that the Iraqis should respond to it with further concessions that would harm their principles, dignity, and rights, as well as the Arab nation's rights and security. Notice how they are indulging in illusions. With any initiative, Iraq does not seek a temporary truce or capitulation which the failures and shameful people want or have illusions about the possibility of achieving.
O fair people, note all this, as the Iraqis have noted, acknowledged, and concluded. Note all this so as to excuse the Iraqis from any subsequent action, and to understand the justness of the Iraqi position. God is great. Mercy and immortality for our martyrs and our nation. Dignity, glory, and victory for the heroes of this path, the sons of our nation and mankind. God is great, God is great; accursed be the lowly.

HEADLINE: Israel Asserts New U.S. Aid For Housing Is Insufficient

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Only hours after the United States finally approved a long-disputed $400 million in loan guarantees for housing Soviet immigrants, Israeli officials warned today that the sum was grossly insufficient.
"In fact, it's a very small sum that only accounts for 3 or 4 percent of the overall figure," the Immigrant Absorption Minister, Yitzhak Peretz, said today. 
 As he spoke, leaders of the Jewish Agency, the semi-public office with the largest role in immigration matters, were meeting here, working out agreement on the private fund-raising goal for the coming year.
After several days of debate, the agency's leaders said they had decided to seek $1 billion in donations from the world's Jews -- 60 percent more than was raised in the current year's fund-raising drive, already a record.
The new figure would have to be approved by fund-raisers in the United States and Europe. If past practice holds true, American Jews would be asked to contribute about 70 percent of the $1 billion.
 
$10 Billion Need Seen
 Last month, Israel's Finance Minister told a visiting American official that Israel would also need another $10 billion in grants and loans from the United States Government over the next few years. Washington's reception to that request was cool.
The Administration approved the $400 million in housing loan guarantees Wednesday after it had held up the package for a year while negotiating with Israel over assurances that the money would not be used to build housing in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip or in neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. The guarantees will enable Israel to get commercial loans at lower rates.
The action came as Israeli officials are lowering their estimate of the numbers of immigrants expected this year because of the Persian Gulf war.
Before the war began, Israeli officials repeatedly said they expected a million Soviet immigrants within two or three years. About 185,000 arrived last year.
But earlier this week, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the gulf war and the Iraqi missile attacks on Israel had forced Israeli officials to revise the estimates.
"Before the war, it looked like this number would arrive within three or four years," he said, including 1990 as one of those years. "Perhaps now it will take another year or two."
 
300,000 Expected This Year
 In the short term, officials say immigration this year is likely to be 25 percent lower than expected -- 300,000 people instead of the 400,000 projected earlier.
About 10,000 Soviet Jews have arrived here in the five weeks since the war began, compared with about 35,000 in December. While fear of attack is an important reason Soviet immigration has dropped, there are others as well.
For one thing, on Jan. 1 Israel seriously reduced the financial benefits given to all new immigrants because the state could no longer afford what it had been offering.
Word of that circulated among Jews in the Soviet Union, and many people who arrived in December said they rushed to get here before Jan. 1.
In one sense, the decline is good for Israel, since the Government is more than a year behind in building housing for the newcomers. The gulf war, with its missile attacks on Israel and attendant problems, has seriously worsened the economic problems already affecting the nation, hindering Israel's ability to absorb the immigrants.
 
Appeal by Shamir
 Those are among the reasons that Mr. Shamir, Mr. Dinitz and others called on the world's Jews to give even more money than the unparalleled donations already given.
"I cannot deal in specific numbers," Mr. Shamir told the group of visiting Jewish leaders, but he then urged his audience to "double and treble your efforts -- and even more."
Even with the increased fund-raising and reduced immigration, the Jewish Agency has still been forced to propose reducing immigrant benefits even more -- changing some gifts to long-term, low-interest loans, for instance.
Mr. Peretz, who competes with Mr. Dinitz for influence in the immigration field, said he thought that would be a mistake.
 
Some Blame Foreign Jews
 "We're expecting that when the crisis ends that we'll return to same numbers as we had in December," he said of the immigrants, "on the condition that the Israeli Government and the Jewish Agency don't cut the aid to immigrants but strengthen it."
Behind all this, some in Israel are blaming foreign Jews for the shortfall in cash, despite the record donations last year.
As an example, an editorial in the daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot on Tuesday complained that Jews who live in other countries "are clenching their fists."
"Russian Jews are their brothers as much as they are our brothers, perhaps even more," the editorial said. "But when it comes to responsibility and sharing it, they, our brothers abroad, disappear. And the gentlemen in the Jewish Agency are left to absorb the complaints and the scorn."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Stock Surge At Fannie Mae

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DESPITE the relentless grim news from banks and savings institutions, the stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, has been performing well lately.
As a for-profit corporation created by Congress, Fannie Mae buys residential mortgages from banks and savings institutions; it then holds them for its own investment portfolio or packages them into securities for sale to institutional investors. 
 Despite gloom in the real estate market and yawning volumes of problem loans at many banks, Fannie Mae's stock has surged 35 percent since Jan. 1. Shares reached a record high of $47.25 last week and have since eased a bit, closing yesterday at $43.875, unchanged, on the New York Stock Exchange. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, which performs a similar function, is also seeing its stock move higher.
To be sure, the current market rally has lifted most stocks, but not as much as Fannie Mae's. The Dow Jones industrial average is up about 11.3 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor's index of financial stocks has climbed about 22 percent.
So why the outstanding performance of Fannie Mae? For one thing, the popularity of the stock stems partly from the troubles of lenders elsewhere. Banks and savings institutions have been forced to take huge write-offs for problem loans on office buildings, shopping centers and other failed commercial projects, while Fannie Mae sticks to residential lending. The failed commercial loans have reduced the capital of banks and savings institutions, forcing them to sell more of their residential mortgages to raise cash. The result is a big realignment in the financial services industry, as banks and savings institutions serve more as agents or brokers than as lenders.
According to David S. Hochstim, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company, 65 percent of all new mortgages in 1990 were resold to investors in the secondary markets -- up from about 45 percent in 1988 and 1989.
Falling interest rates may give Fannie Mae an additional lift this year. It buys only fixed-rate mortgages, because adjustable-rate loans are impossible to package for investors. Demand for fixed-rate loans tends to increase during periods of low interest rates, as home buyers seek to lock in lower payments.
Yet Fannie Mae's flirtation with new stock highs presents particularly interesting questions for investors. On one hand, earnings have soared tenfold since 1986 -- from $105 million, to $1.1 billion in 1990. Fannie Mae has also had 11 straight quarters of higher profits.
On the other hand, two-thirds of the profits of Fannie Mae come from its own portfolio of mortgages -- loans the company did not repackage as securities but kept for itself. If home prices plummet, as they did in Houston during the mid-1980's and as they are now doing in some parts of the Northeast, Fannie Mae could find its assets far less valuable.
The other risk Fannie Mae faces is exposure tointerest rate changes. If the interest generated from its mortgages fails to keep up with its cost of borrowing, earnings could plunge.
Fannie Mae has tried to insulate itself from that risk, however. Unlike banks or savings institutions, which rely on deposits for funds to lend, Fannie Mae raises money by selling debt securities to institutional investors at rates just above Treasury security rates. That has made it easier to match up income it receives from interest on new mortgages with rates it must pay for funds to buy the mortgages. But investors are still unsure.
Even at its current levels, Fannie Mae's stock still trades at only about 10 times its 1990 earnings. That is on a par with or below the stocks of other lending institutions.
But Bruce Harting, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, argues that Wall Street's judgment has been clouded by the recent disasters in commercial real estate lending, which is not part of Fannie Mae's business. Salomon Brothers estimates that the nation has an oversupply of office buildings that will take eight to ten years to work down. By contrast, Mr. Harting said, housing starts have followed the growth in new households fairly closely.
By law, moreover, Fannie Mae is barred from buying mortgages greater than $191,250. Thus, it steered clear of the most overpriced areas that are now most vulnerable to deflation in housing prices.
In addition, Fannie Mae tightened its underwriting requirements in 1986 and has reduced the foreclosed properties in its inventory from about 10,000 in 1987 to 3,585 in 1990. Loan write-offs last year totaled $233.5 million, about one-tenth of 1 percent of its portfolio and its mortgage-backed securities.
These measures have made Fannie Mae officials confident about the future. "Even at a time when the banks are having extreme difficulty, we're still there," said Timothy Howard, the company's chief financial officer. "There is no credit crunch in housing."

Armco to Lay Off 500 Plant Workers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ASHLAND, Ky., Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Armco Steel Company said it would lay off 500 employees at its Ashland plant for 8 to 12 weeks. The company said the layoffs, to begin next month, would be made as it idled some operating units. Company officials blamed the recession and depressed demand for Armco's products for the move. Company officials said about 2,700 employees would remain on the job.
The laid-off workers will collect about 65 percent of their take-home pay through state and company unemployment benefits, an Armco official said. Armco, based in Parsippany, N.J., produces carbon flat-rolled steel for the automotive, appliance, construction and manufacturing markets.

Made in the U.S.A., but by Sharp

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Japan's largest maker of flat-panel display screens, the Sharp Corporation, said today that it would begin producing some of them in the United States. The announcement appears to be a largely political gesture intended to defuse a new and increasingly contentious high-technology trade dispute.
Sharp is the leading producer of the ultra-thin video screens, which are used in laptop and notebook computers. Its decision -- which is likely to be followed by other Japanese screen manufacturers -- comes less than a week after the Commerce Department accused those manufacturers of selling their products below fair market value.
 
 Following Car Makers' Lead
 
 With its decision, Sharp appears to be following a strategy that has worked brilliantly for Japan's auto makers: to produce a good portion of their product in the United States, with American workers, making it far more difficult for Congress to take punitive or protective measures. Sharp said that in 1993 it plans to produce a half-million screens a year at the United States plant, or roughly a third of its projected market for this country.
The announcement marks the first time that any Japanese maker has moved production of the screens to the United States. There is a smattering of American flat-panel producers, but they are widely considered to be well behind their Japanese competitors and far too small to make the kind of investments needed to produce the screens in volume.
In the coming decade, virtually all computers -- and many types of television sets as well -- are expected to display their information on the sleek, thin panels, experts say, making it increasingly important for the United States that some production technology reside there.
At a news conference here today, Sharp officials said that at least for the first few years, the $30 million, 250-employee plant they are building in Camas, Wash., near Portland, Ore., would perform "final assembly" operations. That means that the most difficult technology involved in manufacturing flat-panel displays -- producing the 10-inch computer screens from silicon, without a single flaw -- would remain in Japan. In the United States, the company will add peripheral electronics and the frame used to mount the screens in various types of computers.
Sharp will produce only its simplest screens in the United States. The most expensive, sophisticated screens, involving color displays that use a new technology called "active matrix," will remain in Japan.
Sharp officials denied that they were moving only a minimum amount of production and technology to the United States in hopes of preventing Congressional action against the Japanese producers.
 
No Economic Reason Seen
 "If you include U.S.-made parts, half the value added of these screens will be in the United States," said Toshio Toda, the deputy general manager of Sharp's liquid crystal display group.
But industry officials said there was no economic advantage for Sharp in producing the screens outside Japan. Because the screens are small and light, and require little direct labor, shipping them around the globe is relatively easy.
"It is a familiar pattern," said John Stern, who heads a trade group office for American electronics makers in Tokyo. "After there are allegations of dumping, production begins to move to America." The term "dumping" refers to the practice of selling screens below the cost of producing and marketing them.
Whether the Japanese are dumping has turned into a divisive issue for American industry. The small American companies working on flat-panel technology, which filed the initial complaints in Washington against Japanese competitors, said that unless the United States took action the domestic industry would slowly die.
But the biggest computer makers in the United States, including the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., pointed out that domestic screen makers do not make the kinds of screens needed for the next generation of portable computers. It would be ridiculous, they said, to force the Japanese to raise prices, and thus increase costs to American computer makers.
 
The Japanese 'Are Ahead'
 "The Japanese are clearly ahead in flat-panel displays," John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple, said here last week. "What is happening in America is really small-scale stuff compared to what is happening in Japan, and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
Mr. Sculley and his fellow producers seemed to score a modest victory when the Commerce Department issued its preliminary ruling last week. The department concluded that the price differences, or "dumping margins," on which any import tariffs are calculated were relatively small.
Nonetheless, the ruling seemed to galvanize the Japanese makers. Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Sony and others are all investing heavily in flat-panel technology, concluding that it is a critical link in the food chain of high-technology parts that are common to a huge range of electronic goods. But tariffs and a growing American unease that the technology, which originated in the United States, was being hoarded in Japan could create a morass of political problems.
Last year a Sharp executive said that his company would move production to the United States "when it becomes a necessity politically." But that moment has apparently not arrived for other companies. The Toshiba Corporation, which has a joint venture in the technology with I.B.M., is building new operations in Japan. I.B.M. has announced no plans to fabricate the screen in the United States, though it is widely assumed that eventually it will also move some production there.

Honda to Lift Civic's Mileage

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb 21

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company said today that it would replace its Civic CRX HF subcompact model this fall with a version that would achieve 65 miles a gallon in highway driving and 50 miles a gallon in the city.
The mileage ratings, if achieved, would represent a sizable increase in the fuel efficiency of the Civic CRX HF, which now travels 52 miles on a gallon in highway driving and 49 miles on a gallon in the city, the highest figures of any vehicle with a four-cylinder engine. 
 The mileage targets for the new Civic Hatchback VX were made in remarks today by Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's American operation. Mr. Elliott was one of several automobile company executives who testified before a United States Senate subcommittee that is considering a proposal to increase fuel economy standards.
A Honda spokesman would not elaborate on how the company was able to achieve its mileage targets in preliminary testing, except to say it was not a result of any breakthrough technology.
The Geo Metro subcompact, made by Suzuki for General Motors, is the current mileage leader, with 58 miles a gallon in highway driving and 53 in the city. The Geo Metro is powered by a three-cylinder engine.

Continental's La Guardia Service Rises

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

Continental Airlines said yesterday that it would add 32 flights to nine cities from La Guardia Airport, largely filling the vacuum left by the collapse of Eastern Airlines.
The airline said it would begin new flights to Florida on March 21, and to cities in the South and Midwest on April 8. Some of the routes were already being served by Continental and some will be new ones for the airline. The added service will make Continental the second-largest carrier at La Guardia behind USAir. 
 Continential will use 64 landing and takeoff slots and 6 gates at La Guardia that it bought at an auction of Eastern assets held earlier this month. Continental paid for the assets by assuming about $54 million in lease obligations held by Eastern, which is being liquidated under the supervision of the bankruptcy court.
 
'La Guardia Is a Gold Mine'
 "La Guardia is a gold mine," John Nelson, Continental's executive vice president, said in explaining why the airline was expanding during a recession and while it is seeking to reorganize under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Continental was forced to enter bankruptcy by the huge costs of its debt, a legacy of when it was one of the rapidly expanding companies of Frank Lorenzo, who also owned Eastern. Mr. Nelson said Continental had obtained permission from its creditors to undertake the La Guardia expansion.
He said that the airport was the preferred departure point for business travelers from Manhattan, which has the world's largest concentration of such travelers.
"The flying that we do out of La Guardia is immensely profitable," he added. He predicted that the new flights would soon be profitable, because many are on routes used by business travelers, who tend to pay full fares rather than discount fares. He added that there would be no special promotional fares to inaugurate the new routes.
Edward Starkman, an airline analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said that the expansion at La Guardia would allow Continental to feed more traffic to its major hubs, like Houston and Denver. He also said the new gates would allow Continental to use more wide-bodied airplanes, like the Airbus A300, providing more capacity.
"It's going to mean a lot," he said, adding that before the expansion, Continental was often unable to meet the demand for seats on flights out of La Guardia.
Continental, which is the largest carrier at Newark International Airport and the largest carrier in the New York metropolitan area, now serves much of the eastern half of the country and Texas from La Guardia.
Continental will have to add some employees for the expansion, Mr. Nelson said. The number of new jobs, however, is not expected to reach the 1,350 vacancies created with the demise of Eastern's La Guardia operations.
The service to Florida will be made up of four daily flights to Fort Lauderdale and Miami, three daily flights to Orlando and West Palm Beach, and two daily departures to Tampa. The other new flights will be five daily to Atlanta; four to Buffalo; three to Columbus, Ohio, and four to Detroit.
The expansion comes at a time when most airlines are cutting back on flights and resorting to layoffs as air travel has shrunk since the Persian Gulf war began on Jan. 16.
 
Gulf War's Effect on Traffic
 Mr. Nelson said that Continental's traffic was not as severely affected as other airlines', however, since the carrier picked up some of Eastern's traffic after it shut down on Jan. 18 because many Continental routes overlapped those of Eastern.
He said that while traffic had declined by about 30 percent for the industry since the war began, Continental's decline was only about 10 percent.
Mr. Nelson also said that Continental had taken a step to widen its reservation system and is expected to reach an agreement to have its System 1 computer-reservation system incorporated into the Worldspan system owned by several other airlines.

HEADLINE: Waking From a Dream: New York City Lays Off 400

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Linda Moses was sick and tired of being sick and tired, so the single mother dangling on welfare decided to get some schooling and some job training. In November of 1987 she realized her modest dream of independence through a job as an office aide for New York City. That dream is now ending with a pink slip.
Today or Saturday will be the last day of work for more than 400 people who are part of the first wave of municipal employees laid off as grim testament to the city's budget woes. Between March 1 and March 8 at least 200 more -- including Ms. Moses -- are to lose their jobs, and about 400 more will be out of work by June 30, when the city's fiscal year ends. 
Those layoffs are a handful compared with the 16,000 called for on Jan. 16, when Mayor David N. Dinkins released his preliminary plan for closing a budget gap of $3 billion in this and the next fiscal year. Just how many jobs will be lost -- and whose -- is still being fought out.
 
Accusing, Shifting and Lobbying
 Mr. Dinkins is now talking about many thousands fewer. The city workers' unions are continuing to lobby to hold on to jobs, while the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said yesterday that the Mayor's plan was "not credible" and that city government was growing instead of shrinking. And workers with seniority are being transferred in large numbers to other departments.
Still, as city employees scramble for new jobs, apply for welfare and take out loans, the budget gaps and red ink that were once government abstractions have become real.
Most of the layoffs this weekend involve workers known as provisionals -- employees who were not hired through competitive Civil Service procedures and who do not have Civil Service protections. The layoffs will be falling disproportionately hard on women and minority-groupmembers, who in general have less seniority and hold lower-level jobs. Many, like Ms. Moses, are single mothers who in the past relied on public assistance.
"I don't want to go back on welfare; it's degrading," said Ms. Moses, a Department of Housing Preservation and Development office aide with two children, mounting bills and no idea what she will do next.
"I felt real bad. Why did they have to pick me?" she asked yesterday, her voice shaking." I'm scared, I'm mad and frustrated and all of that."
Ms. Moses relied on welfare for five years. She received her general equivalency diploma in 1986 and got her current job in November 1987.
On Feb. 13, when her boss talked about the grim state of the city's economy, she knew it was all over -- the $380 and change she took home every two weeks, after taxes and a loan deduction, to take care of her two children, ages 9 and 4.
"What's going to happen to me and my kids?" she asked aloud. "I want to go back to school, maybe a two-year school. Get another job. Something real important, where they won't lay me off."
The layoffs this weekend are sprinkled throughout city agencies. A Personnel Department spokeswoman, Denise Collins, said yesterday that 159 or 160 sanitation workers had received pink slips, as had 105 in the Finance Department, 45 in the Department for the Aging, 31 in the Department of Youth Services, 15 in the Taxi and Limousine Commission, 22 in the Department of City Planning, 26 in the Department of Parks and Recreation and a total of 5 between the Department of Economic Development and the Department of Ports and Trade.
 
Numbers Are in Flux
 Since Dec. 31, 146 employees have been laid off, not including about 250 hospital and library workers not officially on the city payroll.
"The numbers constantly are in flux," Ms. Collins said. "People have rights, and it changes the numbers you've just done. With the civil servants the idea is to not have them on the streets. They are laid off in inverse order of seniority.
"For the provisionals, they're given booklets about job counseling, possible re-training and openings further down the road," she said.
That kind of help will be of little comfort to Deborah Richardson when she walks into her office in the Department of General Services on March 8 for her last day of work. She is a provisional employee who works as an office aide. March 12 would have been the second anniversary at her job for the single mother of three children, ages 10, 6 and 11 months.
 
Sense of Pride
 Ms. Richardson, who is 36 years old and spent "seven or eight" years on welfare, said she had obtained her job through a program for welfare recepients. She said she was proud to take home $573 every other Friday not because it ever went very far but because it was money she earned.
"I either have to go back on welfare or get some help," she said. "I was very delighted with the job; being at home a long time you have no choices. For the first time I had some money for little things: shoes, balloons for the kids. I haven't slept too well."
"I told the kids what happened," Ms. Richardson said. "I said, 'As of next week your mom's not going to work.' They were sad. They don't really understand."
An office associate in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Adrian Manigault, said yesterday that she was more angry than sad that she will be unemployed after March 1.
"We're laid off, and all these people with big money are still there," she said. "A lot of people are angry. The majority laid off are women with children, and they're black and Hispanic."
Ms. Manigault is 40 years old and was on public assistance for more than one-fourth of her life. She said she has a fantasy of sending her 16-year-old son to college to escape her fate of dreams deferred, but she is not sure how to do it now. "I'm mad at the system," she said. "I got back on my feet, I raised my kids, I thought it was going to be smooth going. Then they pull the rug from under your feet."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Impact Of the Gulf War

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
HISTORICALLY, wars have given a powerful thrust to the economy by increasing spending on arms and manpower, reducing unemployment, raising consumers' incomes and putting pressure on industrial capacity. World War II wiped out what remained of the Depression; the Korean War ended the 1949 recession, and Vietnam kept the longest expansion on record rolling.
Is the war in the Persian Gulf different from these in its economic effects? 
 The economic section of President Bush's budget message for the fiscal year 1992, which was developed jointly by the Council of Economic Advisers, the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget, states: "The precipitous loss of consumer confidence since July was due to an external development, the Persian Gulf crisis, rather than internal weakness. Confidence can be restored quickly if it becomes evident that there will not be a replay of the previous oil shocks."
And, in his Congressional testimony this week, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, repeated his view that "an extended war with Iraq" could damage public confidence and spending, but that with an early end to the war "this downturn could well prove shorter and shallower than most postwar recessions."
The two main surveys of consumer confidence lend support to the Administration's contention that the crisis in the gulf kicked off the recession and that an early end to the war would end it. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment stood at 88.2 last July; in August it plunged to 76.4 and kept falling until it hit 63.9 in October. Then it began to edge up, reaching 66.8 in January. The February data are not in yet.
The Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence fell even more steeply; it dropped from 101.7 last July to 84.7 in August, and slid to 54 inJanuary, the lowest level in 10 years. But, after Jan. 17, when the United States and coalition forces began their attack on Iraq, the Conference Board index apparently began to firm up.
"Survey results recorded in the first half of January were down sharply as last-minute peace negotiations failed," said Fabien Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. "But after military action began, consumer confidence picked up slightly, presumably because early indications suggested a short war. A reasonably quick victory might well provide the psychological thrust to invigorate the economy."
Are these measured changes in consumer confidence useful forecasters of the business cycle, or do they simply reflect real economic factors, as consumers currently assess them? They certainly wiggle about in reaction to breaking business, political or military news. A sudden event -- a President's heart attack, like Eisenhower's, or assassination, like Kennedy's, can give consumer confidence and the stock market a jolt, but with little lasting effect on the economy. That was even true of the stock market crash of October 1987.
Indeed, many economists believe that the true causal sequence between consumer attitudes andobjective economic conditions is the reverse of what the psychological approach assumes. When layoffs are rising, consumer confidence sinks. As the job picture starts to improve (just after consumer confidence touches bottom), consumers' spirits rise -- and they spend more.
George L. Perry, the Brookings Institution's chief forecaster, finds that surveys of consumer attitudes have little or no predictive value, say, six months into the future. But he thinks the surveys provide useful clues to the consumer's very short-term behavior. Thus, if the effects of a war, or the end of a war, on consumer attitudes is prompt and sharp, a quick and successful end to the war may provide enough lift to consumer spending to end the recession.
Consumer spending constitutes two-thirds of the gross national product. A surge of spending could lift the G.N.P. into positive numbers by the third quarter of this year, or possibly even before the second quarter is over.
Even in the longer run, psychological factors might act as a vital link between real incomes, consumer spending and economic growth: An optimistic public would convert income into expenditures at a higher rate than a pessimistic public, and thereby lead to more rapid growth, until the economy reaches its full-employment and capacity limits, and inflationary pressures intensify.
This view may be regarded as a translation into macroeconomics of the personal-psychological thesis of Dr. Martin E. P. Seligman's new book, "Learned Optimism": that an optimistic attitude may cure psychological depression by overcoming the resigned and helpless attitudes of individuals who habitually react to adversity pessimistically.
But "positive thinking," of itself, is no automatic cure for the ills of depression, psychological or economic. Ill-founded optimism can be a pipe dream that helps cause crashes or breeds crunches. The great virtue of pessimism is that it looks at reality and forces individuals, or a nation, to recognize their serious problems. A sound balance between optimism and pessimism can lead to both realism and constructive action, rather than an evasion of problems by happy-talk and wish-think.

HEADLINE: For Greenspan, Problems Not Confronted Before

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Like judges, economic policy makers rely on precedents. If the economy performed a certain way in a particular set of circumstances, then, the policy makers assume, it will perform a similar way when those circumstances recur.
 Alan Greenspan, who is not only the Government's foremost economic policy maker nowadays but practically its only one, has always depended on the lessons of the past. The problem for Mr. Greenspan now is that the economy faces conditions that he and other economists have never seen before. 
 Probably no other chairman of the Federal Reserve has had a firmer grasp of economic history, has logged more hours in front of the computer screen working with historical models or has more faith in the view that a master tailor could turn the economy into a seamless fabric with careful nips and tucks. He once told a visitor that at any one time there is one perfect interest rate and that his job description was to find that rate.
But in two days of Congressional testimony this week, the semiannual testimony he is required by law to give on monetary policy and the state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan seemed to be in a quandary about whether to lower interest rates further to counter the recession or stand pat and let the rate cuts of late last year and early this year work their way through the economy.
 
Outlook 'Unusually Clouded'
 The times warrant extreme caution, he told the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, because "the major mistakes in monetary policy are often made at turning points, and it is very difficult to avoid them." He made a similar statement today to the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy.
"The current outlook is unusually clouded," Mr. Greenspan said, "by uncertainties about the war and its effects." Not only does no one know how long the war will last, but economists have no experience with a war fought in large part with military stocks that may not have to be replaced.
Other circumstances are equally unfamiliar to the Federal Reserve and other economists, including these:
*The current recession is the first since at least World War II that began when interest rates were already falling.
*Despite one move after another, the Fed has been unable so far to counteract the persistent scarcity of credit.
*The financial system is extremely weak, and some economists believe a few bank failures could have devastating economic consequences.
*For the first time in memory, the Government has no fiscal policy to deal with economic hard times.
Mr. Greenspan said the "central tendency" of Federal Reserve Board governors and regional bank presidents was to believe that the economy would grow between three-fourths of a percent and 1.5 percent this year, a forecast in line with the ones made by the Bush Administration and many private economists. But Mr. Greenspan said the range of views among the 6 governors and 12 bank presidents was much wider, with one and perhaps more predicting the economy would shrink by as much as half of 1 percent this year.
"This divergence of opinion has its roots in the major uncertainties facing all forecasters today," the chairman said. He said he could not rule out the possibility of a long and deep recession.
 
Lending Curtailed
 Of all these uncertainties, the most serious and the hardest to fathom, in Mr. Greenspan's view, is the continued failure of banks to make loans to creditworthy customers. As long as banks are not lending, businesses will not invest, consumers will not spend and the country cannot pull out of the recession.
Mr. Greenspan says he knows what caused the problem: Reckless lending practices in the 1980's, much of it resulting from the favorable tax treatment of real estate projects, left banks with many bad loans. When the bubble burst, bankers became "very chary about extending credit, which would undercut their capital positions" and perhaps lead investors to feel the banks were undercapitalized. And "superimposed on top of that," Mr. Greenspan said in his testimony, some bank examiners, blamed for not having been tough enough in the past, became unreasonably tight in their supervision.
But the cure has proved elusive. Since fall, the Federal Reserve has taken a series of forceful steps, lowering interest rates and cutting the amount of reserves banks are required to hold, to improve bank profits and thus make renewed lending more attractive. But so far they have not worked.
In his testimony this week, Mr. Greenspan promised new steps. He said new regulations to be announced soon would change the way real estate collateral is recorded on banks' books. And for the first time, he encouraged banks to begin borrowing directly from the Federal Reserve at a rate lower than commercial rates. But he conceded that he saw no clear evidence that the credit situation had begun to ease.
 
'The Most Critical Thing'
 "We are looking at the credit crunch as being the most critical thing that confronts monetary policy at this particular stage," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate committee.
For the first time since he became chairman three and a half years ago, Mr. Greenspan was forced not only to explain the Fed's policies but also to defend them against repeated assaults.
Even in hindsight, he insisted repeatedly, the central bank was right not to lower interest rates in the first half of last year. He maintained that had it not been for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, which he could not possibly have predicted, the odds were much better than even that a recession would have been averted.
And pressed on why he had taken so long to recognize the credit squeeze, Mr. Greenspan said that the tighter lending practices early last year were healthy for the economy because they meant that banks were overhauling their lax practices of the 80's.
The Bush Administration has leveled similar criticism at Mr. Greenspan. But unless an economic catastrophe develops in the next six months for which the Bush Administration decides to make him a scapegoat, Mr. Greenspan's reappointment when his four-year term expires in August seems almost certain.
That is true as much because of his personality as his ability. Even those in the Bush Administration and Congress who disagree with him like him and trust him. Administration officials blame him for the recession but see him as a loyalist. Lawmakers see him as an honest broker. He never loses his temper in the face of criticism and never talks down to even the most mindless questioner.
Late in today's subcommittee hearing, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, a Massachusetts Democrat, strode into the room and asked a series of hostile and sometimes misinformed questions. Mr. Greenspan looked Mr. Kennedy in the eye and responded to the questions calmly and without condescension.
When Mr. Kennedy's questioning time was up, Mr. Greenspan suggested he drop by the Fed so they could continue their discussion. Mr. Kennedy smiled for the first time, said he would make an appointment this afternoon and left happy.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Saatchi Trims Debt Burden With Revised Capital Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from its preferred shareholders, the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the world's second-largest advertising concern, introduced a revised recapitalization plan today that would give such shareholders a much larger ownership stake but would significantly ease its debt problems.
The plan would give 75 percent to 80 percent of Saatchi to preferred shareholders and would leave common shareholders with about 15 percent to 20 percent. Under the original plan proposed on Jan. 10, preferred shareholders would have owned 60 percent to 65 percent of Saatchi, with the common holders owning 30 percent to 35 percent. 
 In response to the latest proposal, the price of Saatchi's common shares plunged 38 percent on the London International Stock Exchange today, closing at 16.75 pence, or 32.8 cents. The stock fell 10.25 pence, or 20.1 cents.
Analysts predicted that preferred and common holders would approve the plan, noting that preferred shareholders were in a strong bargaining position. They also pointed out that with Saatchi struggling in a tough business climate, the plan would save the company from possible financial collapse.
"You're not dealing with a situation where people have a lot of choice," said James D. Dougherty, an analyst at County Natwest Securities U.S.A. in New York. "The place is going bankrupt if they don't do something like this."
 
Unit Pledges Support
 Saatchi said it had been promised the support of the senior managers of KMP Humphreys Bull & Barker Ltd., a British advertising agency that Saatchi bought in 1985. Under the deal, the managers will be paid about 48 million common shares next month at the current market price, which means they will own about 23 percent of the common shares when the revised plan is voted on next month.
A spokeswoman for Southeast Asset Management, a Memphis investment firm that owns about 14 percent of Saatchi's common shares, declined to comment on the plan.
Under the revised Saatchi plan, 311 pounds, or about $608.9 million, in preference shares would be converted into equity. It also includes investor commitments that will enable Saatchi to raise about $117.5 million by selling new common shares.
Under the previous plan, Saatchi would have been certain to raise at least $49 million in new funds. But $39.2 million of it would have been an expensive loan from a limited partnership affiliated with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York, which Saatchi would not have to take under the revised plan.
 
Other Endorsements
 If the owners of Saatchi's common, Europreference and British preferred shares approve the plan, St. James's Place Capital P.L.C., a London investment firm controlled by the financier Jacob Rothschild, would become Saatchi's largest shareholder, with a stake of at least 12.5 percent. St. James's Place owns 20 percent of the Europreference shares.
"St. James's has given its full support to the new proposals and is delighted that it will be a significant shareholder," Clive Gibson, a director of the firm, said.
An investor group headed by ESL Partners II L.P., a Dallas investment firm that owns 17 percent of the Europreference shares, would own more than 10 percent of Saatchi if the revised plan is approved. In Dallas, Edward S. Lampert, ESL's general partner, pledged to support the plan.
A person representing investors with about 15 percent of the Europreference shares predicted today they would also vote for the plan, thus giving the revised proposal the backing of investors owning at least 52 percent of the Europreference shares. The person insisted on anonymity.
Altogether, Europreference shareholders would end up with about 65 percent of the common shares under the plan. British preferred shareholders would have about 15 percent.
 
Strong Position
 Saatchi's Europreference shareholders had a strong bargaining position because the advertising company faced the prospect of having to pay $413.1 million to redeem them in July 1993. The analysts said the financially weak Saatchi would have difficulty coming up with the money. The British preferred shares are redeemable in 2015.
The revised plan calls for exchanging each Europreference and British preferred share for 3.5 and 1.3 new common shares, respectively.
Saatchi is also optimistic that its 19 bank will agree to increase its credit by $58.7 million and will extend the life of the lines, which now total about $510 million, to January 1996 from January 1993, Simon Mellor, a Saatchi director, said.
In opposing the first plan, the preferred shareholders contended that because the new preferred shares would have no dividend for three years and because of Saatchi's shaky financial condition, the securities would not have had much value and would have been difficult to sell. They also said the plan would have left Saatchi with too much debt.
They also objected to the expensive Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette loan.

Prices of Treasury Securities Ease

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly yesterday, as dealers adjusted positions in order to place bids at the auction of $9 billion worth of new five-year Treasury notes.
The new notes were sold at an average yield of 7.51 percent, down from an average rate of 7.62 percent at the last five-year note sale on Jan. 24. It is the lowest rate on a new five-year Treasury security since the auction of Feb. 25, 1987. 
 Despite the low yield, traders said the level was very attractive, given the economy's weak condition and the prospects that interest rates will probably move lower.
"I think these fives will ultimately be a good issue, once they get distributed," one government bond trader said.
Dealers apparently did not think so much of the issue in the trading period following the announcement of the auction results, however. By late yesterday, the new notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.54 percent.
 
Improvement in Prices Seen
 Since Wall Street bought most of the issue, the distribution process may take a little time. But with no additional new supply of securities scheduled to be sold for some weeks, market participants said they anticipate a further improvement in prices.
"We don't have any supply for a while, and I think that puts the bulls in the driver's seat," the trader said. "As the distribution process unfolds, the market will get better."
Over the course of the last three weeks, dealers have had to absorb some $55 billion worth of new Treasury notes and bonds.
No new bonds will be sold until May, at the next quarterly refunding auctions. Note sales next month will be limited to another round of two-year and five-year issues.
Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company, said that at the moment, price movement "is toward the downside, due to the weight of all the securities, as well as the Fed's wait-and-hold strategy."
"Right now, we are in the midst of a fairly orderly consolidation phase, but on the next strong blast of weak economic news the rally will recommence," he added.
 
Testimony by Greenspan
 Traders said that testimony in front of the House Banking Committee by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, had no impact in the credit markets. And the speech by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, which some had hoped would mark an end to the Persian Gulf war, proved a disappointment.
"There had been some hope that Hussein would say something conciliatory, but that didn't happen," the bond trader said. "His speech didn't move the market much, but he was not a positive influence."
Word of Iraq's acceptance of a peace proposal offered by the Soviet Union came well after trading activity had ceased in the United States.
Also overlooked was another big drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 spot commodity prices. The index fell by 1.87, to 211.20.
"The CRB index is telling us exactly the opposite of what the producer price and consumer price data told us earlier," Mr. Liro said. "I don't know if anybody was trading off the CRB, but a lot of people were talking about it."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 29/32 late yesterday, down 10/ 32, to yield 8.06 percent, up from 8.03 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/ 32, down 1/4 point, to yield 7.89 percent. And the new 6 3/4 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.93 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.91 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late-offered rate of 5.90 percent. But one-year bill rates rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.94 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose sharply during the week ended Feb. 11.
The Fed has expressed concern about sluggish growth in the monetary aggregates, but the gains since the first of the year should allay some of their worries.
Including the most recent gains, M-2, the monetary measure most closely monitored by the Fed, has grown at a 3.3 percent annual rate since the end of the fourth quarter, well within the Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent, said Wayne Smith, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn.
"With M-2 comfortably in its target range, it probably won't be as much of a concern to the Fed" as before, Mr. Smith said. "But concern about M-2 was only a veil for worries about sluggish credit growth. If that doesn't pick up, the Fed will probably be moved to ease monetary policy again."
Release of the money numbers had little impact on prices in the credit markets.
Elsewhere, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues fell by about 3/8 point in fairly quiet trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices continued to slide, as dealers groped to rid themselves of a slew of new issues.
"The Street has lost lots of money this week," one municipal bond trader said. "Bonds are disappearing, but at lower prices. It has been bloody."
Traders said that prices of most widely quoted municipal bonds fell by about 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Prove You Need Fare Rise, Cuomo Demands of M.T.A.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The fight over potential fare increases on New York City's subways, buses and commuter railroads got into full swing yesterday when the Governor and ranking state legislators told the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to prove that higher fares were critical to offset rising budget deficits.
Discussing the issue at a family health center in Brooklyn, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said: 'It's not unusual for people like the M.T.A. or local governments or anybody else to put the pressure on you by saying, 'Unless you give more money, we're gong to raise the local taxes, we're going to raise the fares." 
 The Governor's comments were the latest salvo in what promises to be a continuing political and financial battle over increasing transit and railroad fares.
Senator Norman Levy, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, accused the M.T.A. yesterday of using the specter of a fare increase to try to force the State Legislature to increase subsidies for mass transit, possibly through a proposed rise in the gasoline tax.
 
$1.40 Fare Possible
 "I am concerned about the validity of the estimates that are coming from the authority and whether these deficits are just sword-rattling to try to generate additional revenues," Mr. Levy said.
But M.T.A. officials said they were prepared to make their case, warning that ballooning deficits could mean subway and bus fares might rise as high as $1.40 this summer, accompanied by proportionate increases on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
The revenue shortfall is a result of declining ridership, proposed lower state subsidies and a drop in revenues from city real-estate taxes, the M.T.A. officials said. They said they would meet with state legislators in Albany next week to argue for a fare rise.
"We are in such bad shape that it's inconceivable that we can put off a fare increase this year," said Mortimer L. Downey, the M.T.A.'s executive director and chief financial officer.
The M.T.A. estimates that the Transit Authority, which operates the city's subways and buses, will have a $215 million deficit for 1991 and that the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North will have shortfalls of $22 million and $17 million, respectively.
 
Further Losses Feared
 State and local officials and mass-transit consumer advocates have warned that higher fares would mean serious further loss of passengers at a time when subway and bus ridership have reached new lows. Recently proposed massive service cuts -- on top of substantial cuts made in the past year -- could have similar negative effects, the officials and advocates said.
Technically the 17 members of the M.T.A. board can approve fare increases without the agreement of lawmakers. But the State Legislature, particularly the Senate Transportation Committee, controls the authority's huge capital plans, giving it some influence over the fare increase.
At the same time the Governor appoints six of the board members and Mayor David N. Dinkins four members, and both exert considerable influence over their appointees. The remaining M.T.A. board members are appointed by the Executives of Nassau, Westchester, Putnam, Orange, Rockland, and Dutchess Counties.
 
Alternatives Sought
 Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a telephone interview from Albany yesterday that the Governor felt that a fare increase should be a last resort, but that the ultimate decision rested with the M.T.A. board.
Sharon Landers, director of the Mayor's Office of Transportation, said Mr. Dinkins was deeply concerned about a fare increase, particularly a big one that some riders might not be able to afford. She said that the Transit Authority should make every effort to cut administrative costs before raising the fare and that the Mayor's recent appointments to the M.T.A. board would vote in accordance with the city's position.
The process for raising fares, which requires public hearings, usually makes it impossible for an increase to go into effect before 60 days. But the M.T.A. can declare a financial emergency and raise the fare with only 30 days' notice.
 
Consumer Group Objects
 Gene Russianoff, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, a consumer advocacy group for New York subway riders, said that while he acknowledged the M.T.A.'s poor financial condition, increasing the subway and bus fare to $1.40 was totally unjustified. It would, he said, break a promise made by the Governor's Council on Fiscal and Economic Priorities five years ago to keep the fare at its current $1.15 until 1992.
"The Transit Authority is right to alert the public and Legislature that things are tough," Mr. Russianoff said, "but raising fares is not the solution. We need more subsidies for mass transit that are not so heavily tied to the regional economy."

HEADLINE: A Disappointing Deal for Browning

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Browning-Ferris Industries had little to celebrate as it quietly reached a preliminary agreement last week to sell its state-of-the-art hazardous waste disposal site 70 miles east of Denver to the Concord Resources Group, a recently formed joint venture of the Consolidated Rail Corporation and the OHM Corporation.
Although the price was not disclosed, interviews with company executives and bankers suggest that it was 20 percent less than had been hoped for when the site was put up for sale last summer. The price was even slightly under an internal valuation by Houston-based Browning-Ferris, which has a reputation for conservative accounting. 
 The gap between Browning-Ferris's dream deal and the one it finally struck reflected in part the weak market for most types of corporate assets in this recession. But it also highlighted uncertainties peculiar to environmental businesses, especially those in fields like hazardous waste where the investment demands -- as well as the regulatory and technology risks -- are substantial.
Browning-Ferris had reason to believe that it was in an enviable bargaining position when it began the process of selling its Last Chance site, which takes its nickname from a nearby hamlet. The Environmental Protection Agency has called Last Chance "the best designed land disposal site in the nation."
Moreover, analysts who follow environmental companies say that hazardous waste disposal, currently a $3 billion to $4 billion business, may be the most lucrative segment of the waste management industry over the next 20 years. The basic reason: As new regulations continue to expand the range of materials classified as hazardous waste, the number of legal disposal sites is declining.
Despite such prospects, Browning-Ferris decided last April to bail out of the hazardous waste business and concentrate on solid waste disposal and recycling. Browning-Ferris is the second-largest solid-waste disposal company in the nation after Waste Management Inc.
Browning-Ferris had tripped from one financial setback to another in hazardous waste, damaging its reputation with regulators and environmental groups. It was never able overcome a history of shoddy operations at landfills it acquired in New York, Ohio and Louisiana. When William D. Ruckleshaus, the company's chief executive, decided to retreat last spring, the company set aside $295 million after taxes to cover the costs of discontinuing the business.
In Last Chance, buyers were being offered the company's one hazardous waste jewel. "I think they basically put it together as well as humanly possible," said Tanelle Roberts, the engineer overseeing the permit process for the Colorado Health Department.
Moreover, the new owner would be taking over at an ideal time, just as the last regulatory reviews were completed, wiping away any fear that previous operations had created unknown perils that could lead to fines, remediation expenses or closures.
Browning-Ferris's expectations were also colored by its pride in Last Chance, formally known as the Highway 36 Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility. It is the first -- and so far only -- new hazardous waste site to receive state and Federal operating permits under new regulations established by the E.P.A. in 1984. More than $50 million had been sunk into the site since acquisition of its 5,700 acres began in 1980.
Last Chance is intended to handle a variety of liquid and solid wastes, including incinerator ash, sludges from other waste treatment operations, toxic metal plating sludge, contaminated soil and asbestos.
Materials to be sent to the site must be pre-tested at a laboratory in Denver and can only be accepted if they come in a scheduled delivery. They also will be retested at the site. All wastes to be buried will be solidified. The permit calls for disposal in four-acre cells that are 40 feet deep, lined with alternating layers of plastic and compacted clay and ringed with leak detectors.
 
Concord's Second Acquisition
 The Last Chance deal came within days after Concord Resources, based in Pittsburgh, had announced its first acquisition, the purchase of Stablex, a Montreal hazardous waste firm.
"This is a great time to be buying hazardous waste assets," said Swep T. Davis, Concord's chief executive, reflecting on the leverage willing buyers have in a slow market.
"From 1984 to 1988, sellers could be very rigid on bidding specifications, which sometimes read like ultimatums," acknowledged Clay Lifflander, the Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company banker who led the sales effort. "People don't like to feel like they are in an auction today. It's more like a negotiation."
The sales process began last June, when thick booklets describing the site were sent to those who had expressed an interest, along with a letter hinting that Browning-Ferris would welcome a pre-emptive bid. None came. Smith Barney executives began to realize that while the site clearly did not have any skeletons in its closet, it also had no record by which to judge Browning-Ferris's income projections.
Only potential bidders were allowed to see the projections, but there are some hints about the potential profits. At $200 a square yard, a rough industry average price last year, the site has already been permitted to receive 2.5 million cubic yards of material, or $500 million worth. And it has the capacity to receive 7.6 million more without violating any of its basic operating conditions.
Although it is the only permitted site in Colorado under the new regulations and is hundreds of miles from its nearest competitor, the problem for potential purchasers is calculating how much of Last Chance's income can be generated locally where its competitive advantage is strongest and how rapidly that demand might build.
Industry experts said Last Chance has several potential shortcomings. It is a long way from the nearest rail line, meaning that its waste will come from relatively long-distance truck runs. Moreover, several of the largest sources of hazardous waste in Colorado, like the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and the Rocky Flats military base, are so heavily contaminated that onsite disposal plans may be more economical than shipping wastes to another site, Mr. Davis said.
Browning-Ferris's marketing projections were repeatedly questioned as the number of interested parties fell to five and then to two, including Concord. Smith Barney declined to name the other finalist.
The finalists made several visits to the site, which is in an area so remote that there are only 250 residents in a 10-mile radius. They examined legal documents, met with regulators and pored over the multi-volume operating permit, which specified not only the equipment and operations needed, but also the types of employees the site must have, their level of training and operating details.
"The new owners won't make changes very easily," Augustus Cummings, the site manager, told a visitor last summer. "Everything is in the permit."
The process of preparing for a bid dragged into the fall, several months longer than Smith Barney had hoped.
 
Guarantee on Capacity
 One sticking point was whether Browning-Ferris would offer guarantees on how much waste the site could take. Browning-Ferris resisted that because it intended to close the books on its hazardous waste business. Ultimately, the company agreed to an "earnout" provision that tied its total compensation to the site's performance.
Completing the deal and clearing up minor permit modifications is expected to take three or four months, Mr. Davis said. Both sides are looking forward to testing Browning-Ferris's market projections.
"Browning-Ferris started the facility assuming that these sites are going to be rare and that has held up," Mr. Davis said. "There are about dozen new projects for all types of hazardous waste disposal under way around the U.S., but I don't expect more than three or four to get built and opened like this one."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Analysis;
U.S. Keeps Options Open

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
In its response this evening to the latest Soviet plan for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the White House took a tentative step toward becoming engaged in negotiations to end the war.
 Although the White House later rejected the proposal as approving only a partial Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the careful phrasing of the responses left open the possibility of Washington's entering at least an initial dialogue with Moscow, and indirectly Baghdad, about the terms for ending the war. 
 The Soviet proposal, according to Administration officials, leaves President Bush with a number of decisions. One is whether to encourage a negotiating process that might deprive the United States-led coalition, including its Arab allies, of a chance to decisively defeat President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi military -- something many of them have long sought.
Another is whether the cost of rejecting the Soviet proposal is worth a breach in Soviet-American relations and a potential domestic political backlash for taking the nation into a ground war that might have been avoided.
If the Bush Administration is annoyed with the Soviets for interposing themselves on the eve of an anticipated major ground war and preventing a clear-cut military conclusion -- and some officials no doubt are -- the White House kept it well hidden this evening, treating the initiative by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev publicly with great respect.
 
Iraq Scales Back Demands
 Since last Friday when Iraq first said it was prepared to consider a withdrawal from Kuwait -- in return for a lengthy list of political, economic and military concessions -- President Hussein has clearly scaled back his demands.
Unlike the earlier withdrawal plans presented by Iraq and the Soviet Union in the last week, the latest proposal appears to offer no political reward to President Hussein for pulling out of Kuwait. Apparently gone are Iraqi demands that a withdrawal from Kuwait be linked with an Israeli pullout from the West Bank or the convening of an overall Middle East peace conference. Also absent is the demand that Iraq be paid reparations for war damage inflicted by the allies, and the demand that the United States and other countries withdraw their military forces from the region.
Instead, the latest Soviet-Iraqi proposal begins with the principle of a complete and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and then goes on to lay down conditions under which that withdrawal should take place. They do not offer Mr. Hussein a clear reward, or compensation, he can cite for the tremendous losses the Iraqi people and economy have suffered as a result of his Kuwait adventure.
That is critical for the Administration, because it has been arguing for weeks that if it cannot destroy the Iraqi army in a ground war, it wants to make certain that President Hussein is dealt such a humiliating political defeat that his chances of surviving for long as the leader of Iraq after this war will be greatly diminished.
 
Some Points Acceptable
 Washington has no problem with the first of the Soviet plan's seven points, which calls for a complete, unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The Administration has not only demanded that there should be such a withdrawal, but also that it be in accordance with all 12 United Nations resolutions.
That is important because the 12 United Nations resolutions deal with more than an Iraqi withdrawal. For instance, resolution 660 "Demands that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its forces to the positions in which they were located on August 1, 1990." That would seem to mean that Iraqi units in Kuwait cannot just be driven over the border to Iraq but have to be dispersed around Iraq to their original bases. Resolution 662 demands that "Iraq rescind its actions purporting to annex Kuwait." In other words, the Iraqi Parliament must annul its annexation of Kuwait as its 19th province.
In addition, there is no mention in the Soviet plan of the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait or payment of reparations to Kuwait for the damage wrought by the Iraqis on that country, or negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences, all of which are contained in the United Nations resolutions.
 
Linkage Idea Abandoned
 But assurances on Kuwait came from Sergei Grigoriev, a Soviet spokesman who translated Mr. Bush's words for Mr. Gorbachev in their telephone conversation tonight about the peace proposal. Mr. Grigoriev, interviewed on the ABC News program, "Nightline," said, "It is the unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait; it is the restoration of Kuwait's independence and sovereignty, and it is the recognition of the fact that only the legitimate rulers of Kuwait can come back and be the rulers in their own country."
Mr. Grigoriev also made it clear that Mr. Hussein's previous demand that the withdrawal of his troops be linked to an Arab-Israeli peace conference has been abandoned in the current proposal.
"I can understand that this was dropped out completely, as the Iraqis are no longer raising this question," he said. "It was made very clear to Mr. Aziz that we are not raising this question, and no one is raising this question in connection with other issues."
The second of the Soviet plan's points -- that the Iraqi withdrawal would not begin until two days after the start of the ceasefire -- would be unacceptable to the United States, since Washington does not want to give the Iraqi forces any pause in the war until they start pulling out. The third point stipulates that the Iraqi withdrawal take place in a fixed, but as yet publicly unspecified time frame. The United States had wanted the limit to be four days so that the Iraqis would be forced to leave behind some of their heavy weapons.
 
U.S. Wants Arms Embargo Continued
 The fourth point states that after the withdrawal of two-thirds of the Iraqi forces, the United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq should cease to apply. Administration officials say this is unacceptable to Washington, which would only consider passing a new Security Council resolution lifting such sanctions after Iraq has completely withdrawn and lived up to the provisions of all other relevant resolutions on Kuwait. The United States could veto a Soviet effort to end the sanctions after only a partial withdrawal.
The United States and some of its allies have declared their intention of imposing at least a limited arms embargo on Iraq after it withdraws to insure that Baghdad cannot rebuild its chemical, biological and nuclear facilities or rearm in a way that could threaten its neighbors.
The fifth point -- that after the full Iraqi withdrawal, the causes for the remaining United Nations resolutions against Iraq cease to exist -- would also not be acceptable to Washington, since the United States sees an Iraqi withdrawal as only one element of fulfilling the United Nations resolutions.
The United States probably would not have any problem with the sixth point, which stipulates that after the cease-fire, all prisoners of war would be immediately released, but it might have a problem with the seventh -- that the withdrawal will be monitored by countries not directly involved in hostilities.

SOVIETS SAY IRAQ ACCEPTS KUWAIT PULLOUT LINKED TO TRUCE AND AN END TO SANCTIONS; BUSH REJECTS CONDITIONS: WAR IS TO GO ON

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Friday, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Moscow announced early today after talks with Iraq's Foreign Minister that President Saddam Hussein had given a "positive" response to a new Soviet peace proposal and had agreed to withdraw from Kuwait.
A breathless spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rushed into a press briefing at 2:40 A.M. Moscow time after the meeting with the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, and declared, "The response is positive." 
 "The two parties," he said, "came to the conclusion that it is possible to find a way out of the military conflict in the gulf, along the following lines." [Transcript of Soviet statement, page A6.]
 
U.S. Rejects Proposal
 In Washington, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, initially described the Soviet effort as "useful," although he said that President Bush had "serious concerns" about it.
But President Bush decided after a meeting with his national security advisers that the Soviet plan had to be rejected because it set conditions for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, his spokesman said.
Mr. Fitzwater had said earlier that the allied forces would in any case "continue to prosecute the war" while diplomacy continued.
 
Economic Sanctions Would End
 The seven-point Soviet plan outlined for the first time by the spokesman, Vitaly N. Ignatenko, called for the Iraqi withdrawal to begin after the end of hostilities and to be concluded within an unspecified time.
It also called for the removal of economic sanctions against Iraq once two-thirds of its forces were out of Kuwait and for all other United Nations resolutions to be lifted once all the troops were gone. That provision would appear to excuse Iraq from paying compensation to Kuwait. There was also no specific mention made of restoring Kuwait's rulers to power as called for by the United Nations.
Also conspicuously absent from the plan was any mention of a peace conference or a broader Middle East settlement that would include the Arab-Israeli conflict. Such a demand, which had been introduced as a condition in earlier Iraqi feelers, would probably have been strongly opposed at least by the United States and Israel.
 
Work Said to Continue
 Mr. Ignatenko said that the first point of the plan was a declaration by Iraq of a "full and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait." But in the preliminary version he outlined, the envisioned retreat was linked to a number of steps and qualifications. He said that work on concrete details of the plan was continuing and that the conclusions would be announced today to members of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar.
Though the proposals and their reported acceptance by Iraq were enthusiastically detailed at the Foreign Ministry, no commentary was offered by Mr. Aziz, and President Hussein had not spelled out any of its provisions in a speech on Radio Baghdad on Thursday.
The announcement in Moscow shifted the spotlight back to Washington, where President Bush had to decide whether the proposals were sufficient to call off the widely anticipated ground war and declare a cease-fire. He finally concluded that the offer did not provide for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal, among other United Nations demands, and that it therefore had to be rejected.
Moscow's announcement culminated a tense seesaw between war and peace as President Gorbachev pursued its 11th-hour mediating effort, Washington prepared a vast ground campaign, and President Hussein issued conflicting signals from his smoldering capital.
 
An Address by Hussein
 Mr. Aziz's arrival in Moscow came scant hours after Mr. Hussein had delivered a 40-minute address that seemed to close the door to any peaceful solution. In his speech, Mr. Hussein declared that Iraq was ready for "the mother of all battles." But he also said that his Foreign Minister was carrying a plan to Moscow whose rejection would expose "the premeditated intentions of the aggression against us."
Mr. Aziz's rush to Moscow capped a bold and unexpected Soviet mediating effort that began Feb. 9 with an announcement by Mr. Gorbachev that the Persian Gulf war threatened to exceed the mandate of the United Nations and that he was sending a personal envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, to Baghdad with a personal appeal to President Hussein.
The following days became a race between the beginning of a ground attack by the United States-led alliance and the Soviet diplomacy. Iraq raised hopes when it announced that it was prepared to withdraw from Kuwait and dashed them by saddling the offer with a host of conditions.
Then Mr. Aziz traveled to Moscow to receive a confidential peace plan from Mr. Gorbachev, while the Soviets held a flurry of private contacts with Washington and its allies.
Returning with Mr. Hussein's response shortly before midnight, Mr. Aziz was rushed straight to a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, which lasted two hours and two minutes. Foreign correspondents were summoned to the Foreign Ministry press center at midnight.
 
'The Effort Was Worthwhile'
 Mr. Ignatenko rushed into the press center breathless and excited 10 minutes after the meeting ended in the Kremlin. "Please excuse me for having kept you for so long, but I think the effort was worthwhile," he declared.
At the end, several Soviet and Arab reporters broke into applause, and Mr. Ignatenko happily joined them. The jubilant mood indicated that the Kremlin believed it had succeeded, even if Washington had yet to respond and there were still details to work out.
Mr. Ignatenko said that Mr. Gorbachev had telephoned President Bush to report on the talks with Mr. Aziz.
While the package presented today compelled Mr. Hussein to abandon Kuwait, it also freed him of paying compensation and left him in office.
The brief outline offered by Mr. Ignatenko left questions unanswered. The description of the plan as a list of "approaches" and "positions" suggested that it remained open to change and negotiation, and it was not clear at what stage Iraq was to declare its unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and when the allies were to call a cease-fire.
The preliminary package seemed to have both pros and cons from the allied perspective. Washington had declared, for example, that it will not call a halt to the bombing of Iraq until the Iraqis begin to withdraw from Kuwait. The allies have also been reluctant to lift sanctions before all forces are withdrawn, or to forgive Iraq the payment of any compensation for the millions stolen and destroyed in Kuwait by the occupying troops.
 
Other Elements Not Included
 On the other side, the proposals did not include several elements that had been mentioned before by Iraq and Moscow and that would have been difficult for Washington to accept. Foremost among these was the absence of any mention of a Middle East peace conference or of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Mr. Hussein had often before tried to depict his struggle as one that encompassed the greater battle to end Israeli occupation of Arab lands, and Mr. Gorbachev's initial declaration on the gulf war also mentioned the need to convene a peace conference with Iraq as a participant.

HEADLINE: Women's Milestone: Majority on Minnesota Court

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
Everyone knows that women are entering the legal profession in record numbers. But no powerful legal institution -- no law school faculty, no large corporate law firm, no appellate court -- has ever been dominated by women. Until now.
Last month, in the waning moments of his tenure, Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota named a fourth woman, Sandra Gardebring, to that state's Supreme Court. When she was sworn in on Jan. 4, it marked the first time that women had achieved the most critical of critical masses on a court of last resort: a majority. 
 It is no longer news when a woman is named to a state supreme court. Currently, at least one sits on 27 of them. But for the most part, one is where the count has remained, just as it has on the United States Supreme Court. Only one state, Oklahoma, has two women on its highest court, and none have three.
But the first woman named the Minnesota Court, Rosalie E. Wahl, named by Governor Perpich in 1977, turned out to be more prelude than token. A second woman, M. Jeanne Coyne, was appointed by Gov. Albert Quie in 1982. Governor Perpich named the third, Esther M. Tomljanovich, in August 1990 and Judge Gardebring on his last work day in office.
No one is predicting that the new female majority on the seven-member Minnesota court will instantly produce changes in its jurisprudence, though some lawyers anticipate heightened sensitivity to cases involving domestic abuse, child custody, spousal support, sexual harassment, employment discrimination and other issues of traditional concern to women.
 
Trend in Cases Is Predicted
 Edward L. Winer, a Minneapolis divorce lawyer, said he expected the State Supreme Court to accept more family law cases and to "be more sensitive to traditional homemakers' being forced to return to the job market." In at least three instances in the past several years, the court's women have dissented from rulings in which the male majority reduced support payments for older women who had spent their prime years rearing children.
"It's not a question of liberal or conservative but of a different set of experiences," said Aviva Breen, director of the State Legislature's commission on the economic status of women.
At the same time, no one is minimizing the symbolic significance of the event, both on and off the court. To boys and girls now growing up in Minnesota, Ms. Breen said, an important institution with a majority of women on it will never be such an oddity. Moreover, the women on the court say the new numbers afford them a peculiar kind of freedom: to be themselves, rather than to be perceived as standard bearers for their sex.
Now, they say, they can be liberals or conservatives, activists or strict constructionists, heavyweights or hacks -- all the things male judges have always been free to be, including very different from one another. "I wouldn't expect the women to vote as a bloc any more often then the men," Justice Gardebring said.
The four women come from widely varying legal backgrounds. Justice Wahl was a public defender and law professor before her appointment, while Justice Coyne was a partner in a large Minneapolis law firm. Justice Tomljanovich was a trial judge and Justice Gardebring a state administrator before being named to the state appellate court in 1989.
Their marital backgrounds, too, are varied. Justice Wahl, 66 years old, is the divorced mother of five; Justice Coyne, 64, never married; Justice Tomljanovich, 59, has been married for many years and Justice Gardebring, at 43 the court's youngest member, married only recently.
Public reaction to the historic change has been muted. Still, it appears to have occasioned a quiet pride in the state's political tradition. "To the extent that we elected Rudy Perpich Governor, it reflects a part of us: the part that feels liberal, likes the unconventional, likes to think of ourselves as socially advanced," said Eric J. Magnuson, a Minneapolis lawyer who often argues before the Supreme Court.
Privately, several male lawyers pleaded with Governor Perpich not to appoint another woman. "With the white male establishment, one woman was O.K. and two women were not bad, but when it came to a majority, they were dead set against it," recalled Mr. Perpich's son, also named Rudy, who is a lawyer and an adviser to his father. "Over and over, I heard, 'But Governor, only 15 percent of the lawyers in the state are women.' "
But no one has expressed such sentiments publicly. "To hear those comments, you'd have to go to the men's locker room at the athletic club," said Justice Wahl.
D. Gerald Wilhelm, the county prosecutor in Fairmont, Minn., doubted that critics could be found even in there. "I cannot recall a rational person being terribly upset over this," he said. "There are always some people who are going to gripe, but that's antediluvian thinking."
The men on the court seem unperturbed by the change. "It just all of a sudden happened, and I don't think anyone has thought of it yet," said Chief Justice A. M. (Sandy) Keith, 62. Justice Lawrence R. Yetka, 66, the Court's senior member, appeared equally nonchalant. "I don't feel picked upon -- yet, at least," he said. The seventh justice is John E. Simonett.
Mr. Perpich appointed Justice Wahl to what was then a nine-member court in 1977, at a time when only four other states had women justices. When she joined the court, its quarters at the time, in the east wing of the state capitol did not have a women's restroom. "They hadn't thought of it," she recalled. She used the public restroom in the corridor.
 
A Liberal Tradition
 Some say Minnesota's first reflects a continuing legacy of Hubert H. Humphrey and the liberal Democrat-Farmer-Labor coalition he helped build. Still, until recently the state courts here were white male bastions; with names like Knutson, Christianson, and Nelson, the roster of Justices read like the telephone directory of the fictional Lake Wobegon.
More attribute the development to Mr. Perpich. In Minnesota, one phrase usually suffices to explain the former Governor's politics: "He's an Iron Ranger." Technically, that means he comes from the northeastern part of the state, the area including Hibbing, Chisholm, and Ely, where Eastern European miners arrived in the early years of the century. In addition to iron ore and taconite, the area produced a tradition of liberal politics, unionism and intense identification with underdogs.
Though Minnesota's population of minority citizens is small, Mr. Perpich stocked the lower levels of the state courts with them. And of his four Supreme Court appointments, three went to women. "I wasn't consciously trying to create a majority," Mr. Perpich recalled in an interview. "As Governor, I decided that bench should be more reflective of society, and more than half of society are women."
Oddly enough, Mr. Perpich, who named many women to other top positions in his administration and championed women's rights, lost his re-election bid largely due to the votes of women offended by his anti-abortion stand. Undeterred, he named Ms. Gardebring, who favors a woman's right to choose abortion. She, like Justice Tomljanovich, was a longtime protegee of the Governor's, proving that new-fangled sexual politics can combine with old-fangled politics of loyalty from the Iron Range.
Whether women behave differently from men on the bench is unclear. Based on her analysis of the opinions of Justices William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor, Suzanna Sherry of the University of Minnesota Law School suggested that rather than devise abstract rules, women jurists are more likely to scrutinize the facts in particular cases, and might place a higher premium on what she called "fostering community" -- that is, they try to decide cases in ways that leave losing parties feeling less alienated or disenfranchised.
 
Demonstration of Differences
 The divergent personal styles and philosophies of the four women, as well as the changing complexion of the legal profession, were apparent during oral arguments the court held here in a special appearance earlier this month at William Mitchell Law School, the alma mater of the former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger here.
Half of the students in the audience were women. So, too, were three of the four lawyers sitting at the counsel's table. The women on the improvised bench questioned the lawyers, particularly the woman advocate, far more aggressively than did their male counterparts. The most barbed questions came from Justice Coyne, who proved that in an increasingly egalitarian age, women judges, too, can be called "crusty."
Later, a student asked the justices to assess the significance of the new balance on the court. The women justices disagreed even on that. "I don't thing men are going to have to run for the hills, but there is definitely a woman's perspective," said Justice Tomljanovich, recalling past humiliations she had experienced as a woman in her personal life.
Justice Coyne dissented, saying she was "not going to get very excited" over the change. "A wise old man and a wise old woman reach the same conclusion," she said. "In the vast majority of cases, it will have no impact whatever."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: White House;
PRESSING DEMANDS

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, Feb. 22

 BODY:
After meeting with his advisers until midnight, President Bush decided today that the United States could not accept the latest Soviet proposal for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, his spokesman said.
The spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the State Department sent messages to military allies informing them that Mr. Bush had come to the conclusion that the Soviet plan would represent a "conditional withdrawal." The Soviet Government will be informed of the decision later today, he added. 
 Administration officials said that Mr. Bush was prepared to go ahead with the ground war unless President Saddam Hussein of Iraq agreed to an immediate and unconditional withdrawal. "We're going to hold him to the line," a senior aide to Mr. Bush said.
 
2 Main Objections
 Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration's two main objections to the Soviet proposal were a provision that would begin lifting the United Nations sanctions against Iraq when a troop withdrawal was only two-thirds complete, and another that would nullify all of the United Nations resolutions after the withdrawal ended.
The Administration wants to keep some sanctions in effect, notably an embargo on arms trade with Iraq, and it particularly wants to enforce a resolution that would require Iraq to pay reparations to Kuwait, the White House spokesman said.
It was unclear whether Bush Administration officials were hoping that the Soviets and Iraqis would recast the peace proposal, or whether they would prefer a decisive military victory that would rob Mr. Hussein of his political and military strengths. The Administration still sees the Iraqi leader on the ropes, militarily speaking, and a decisive allied victory within reach.
Administration officials have said it would be difficult to reject a peace proposal that would prevent a costly ground war. But as one senior Administration official put it, the United States wants to avoid a situation in which President Hussein escapes "without paying any real price for having invaded Kuwait."
The idea is to leave Mr. Hussein with as little of his vast military arsenal as possible after the war ends. For the same reason, the United States can be expected to continue its bombing while any remaining diplomacy takes it course.
But the tone of the White House response to the latest Soviet proposal was initially more positive than its reaction to two earlier peace initiatives.
Mr. Fitzwater said that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telephoned President Bush on Thursday after meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, at 6:47 P.M Washington time, and that the two leaders spoke for 33 minutes.
Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev that his quest for peace was "useful," although he said he had "serious concerns" about the specifics of the proposal. Mr. Fitzwater, choosing his words carefully, said then that the United States would study the plan, consult with its allies and shape a response. But he said that the military coalition would continue "to prosecute the war."
Sending out his first feeler last Friday, Mr. Hussein said he was prepared to "deal with" the first United Nations resolution demanding his withdrawal from Kuwait, but only under a series of conditions that included a conference on the Palestinian issue, an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and payments by the allied forces to rebuild Iraq.
Mr. Bush denounced that offer as "a cruel hoax" and "dead on arrival."
On Monday, Mr. Bush received the first Soviet proposal for an end to the gulf war. He said it fell "well short of what would be required" because it contained references to a conference on the Palestinians and guarantees of Iraq's territorial integrity. It also did not offer a specific timetable for withdrawal.
The proposal unveiled by the Soviets on Thursday did not mention a conference on the Palestinian issue, which was a major element of the initial Soviet proposal that Mr. Bush rejected so forcefully on Monday.
 
Bush Attends Play
 On Thursday evening, President Bush went to Ford's Theater to see "Black Eagles," a play about black pilots during World War II, while his advisers conferred on the offer.
After returning from the play, he met with his national security advisers for an hour and 40 minutes to discuss the latest Soviet proposal, Mr. Fitzwater said. Members of the military alliance aagainst Iraq were also consulted before the President decided to reject the initiative, the spokesman said.
Mr. Fitzwater said that the United States was still insisting on full compliance with all 12 United Nations resolutions on Kuwait. Some of the demands set by the United Nations were not mentioned in the Soviet proposal, including the stipulation that Iraq annul its annexation of Kuwait and restore the deposed Kuwaiti Emir.
The Pentagon said after the proposal was announced on Thursday that American forces would continue to fight until they received orders for a cease-fire from the White House. Pentagon officials said privately that they were opposed to any cease-fire before a complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait because it could be dangerous for allied forces.
"The military operation will continue," a Pentagon official said. "We've had no order to do otherwise."
 
On Verge of Ground War
 That left the military poised on the verge of a ground war which, according to Administration officials and diplomats, would begin with an assault on Iraq's defensive lines in southern Kuwait by United States Marines and Arab forces, along with a flanking attack by the United States Army directly toward the Republican Guards dug in on the north side of Kuwait.
The apparent success of the Soviet mediation effort had created a potential dilemma for President Bush. Congressional leaders had observed that if Mr. Hussein agreed to withdraw from Kuwait without getting any major concessions, it would put Mr. Bush in a painful box: He might have to go along or risk being seen as unreasonably extending the war.
But Administration officials said the danger was that such a resolution could allow Mr. Hussein to continue with enough political and military strength intact that he would remain in power with plenty of oil money to rebuild his air force and army.
 
Hopeful to Skeptical Reaction
 The reaction in Washington, at the United Nations and around the world had initially ranged from hopeful to skeptical, as officials tried to learn the details of the peace plan.
"Let's be very certain we've examined it carefully," said Bob Dole, the leader of the Senate's Republican minority, on the floor Thursday night. "Let's remember that the Soviet Union has only been an observer in this process. They haven't contributed any materiel or any young men or young women to the gulf coalition forces. And let's remember that Saddam Hussein may be playing a stalling game."
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, was more optimistic. "It sounds like this may be what we're looking for, Saddam getting out without condition," he said.
 
A Pessimistic Mood
 The turn of events in Moscow followed a day in which Washington had been consumed by a growing sense that the Soviet mediation would fall through and that a ground war was, as one senior Arab diplomat put it this afternoon, "damn close."
The pessimistic mood had been reinforced by the Bush Administration's response to a radio address in which Mr. Hussein said that his army of occupation was prepared for a land war if President Bush continued to reject Iraq's conditions for peace.
The Bush Administration reacted by warning that it was moving ahead with plans for one of the largest ground attacks in modern history. The President took Mr. Hussein's speech as a signal that "he intends to continue the war," Mr. Fitzwater said then.
But the address on Baghdad Radio, couched in heroic and vague language and laced with quotations from the Koran, seemed more indirect and less categorical than the Administration's reading of it. It appeared to be directed primarily trying to push the Administration into a negotiated settlement. In retrospect, it seemed to be Mr. Hussein's attempt to lay the groundwork for a claim that he had defied the enormous military arsenal assembled against him.
 
'The Same Invective'
 "O, brothers, O people, note how those who feared a ground battle have now avoided the showdown for over a month," Mr. Hussein said. He accused the allies of "killing civilians and destroying property with their long-range aircraft and missiles" and added, "They are doing this to cover up their inability to confront our land forces in southern Iraq."
The speech described the war as a "conflict between Iraq -- as a bastion of faith and honorable aspiration and Zionism and U.S. imperialism." It included a litany of complaints about "what Zionism and U.S. imperialism have done against Iraq, beginning with the Irangate plot or the Iran-contra scandal in 1986." It also attacked other Arab leaders, including King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who Mr. Hussein said "chews his words like a camel chews the grasses."
After listening to Mr. Hussein's speech on Thursday morning, the White House dismissed it as "the same invective and disregard for the United Nations mandate that we have heard so often since Aug. 2."
 
Bush Listens in Study
 The President listened to the speech in his study off the Oval Office, then studied a translation of it with his national security advisers.
"We read the words very carefully," Mr. Fitzwater said, adding that the Administration's initial impression was that Mr. Hussein "intends to continue the war."
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the United States was on course for "one of the largest land assaults of modern times."
Reflecing the mood in the capital, a senior Arab diplomat said at midafternoon on Thursday that Mr. Hussein's speech was self-destructive and certain to set off a ground war.
The diplomat called the speech "music to my ears" because he thought it was the death knell for hopes of peace before a ground war. He said he had been concerned that the coalition would accept a settlement between the Soviets and Iraqis that left too much of Mr. Hussein's power intact.
The debate over the terms for a withdrawal centers on what kind of military Iraq should have after the Persian Gulf crisis, one strong enough that might allow Mr. Hussein to exert his power regionally in the future, or one so weakened and humiliated that its leadership, perhaps allied with opposition forces, would be tempted to overthrow Mr. Hussein.
United States military officials said it could take weeks for Iraq to withdraw the hundreds of thousands of troops occupying Kuwait as part of an overall 540,000-member army that extends into southern Iraq. An Army tank expert expressed doubt whether Iraqi forces could start the engines and start moving many of its top-of-the-line Soviet tanks, that have spent months buried deeply in sand berms with little or no preventative maintenance.
An allied demand for Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait in a matter of a few days -- the Soviet plan unveiled on Thursday included an unspecified time limit -- would force them to abandon thousands of pieces of heavy armored equipment that would cost billions of dollars to replace, military officials said.
"If he has to leave fast, he can't take all that with him," one White House official said. Asked how could such a large army could leave Kuwait on such a rapid schedule, given the devastation to roads, bridges and basic supplies like food, the official replied, "With their shoes on."
An Administration official, acknowledging that the United Nations mandate did not provide for stripping Iraq of its military equipment, said, "If he keeps that equipment, it could affect our ability to rebuild the peace and stability in the gulf, which is one of the objectives of the U.N. resolutions."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in World Trading, And Gold Prices Also Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world currency markets yesterday as traders believed a ground offensive against Iraq appeared to be near. Long after the market closed, however, the Soviet Union announced that Iraq had agreed on steps that could lead to an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and an end to the Persian Gulf War.
The White House said the United States would study the proposal and shape a response after consulting its allies. 
 The dollar tumbled in European trading after a speech by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in which he held his ground against withdrawal from Kuwait.
"Before he spoke there was anticipation of a pullout," said Andrew Busch, a trader with the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. But as soon as President Hussein said his position was unchanged, Mr. Busch added, traders began to sell the dollar and it hit the lows of the day.
Most traders said that they expected an allied-led ground battle to erupt and that investors were moving to the sidelines to await further war developments.
When dealing shifted to domestic markets, the dollar seesawed on comments from Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman. His characterization of the dollar's recent slide as unwelcome was initially bullish for the currency, and it moved higher.
But in further testimony before Congress, he indicated that banks remained reluctant to lend. And that, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA, was interpreted by the market as a sign that "more Fed easing is likely."
A move by the Fed to ease credit by lowering interest rates generally hurts the dollar because it makes dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors.
Traders said his comments made for choppy dealing, and the dollar was unable to recover.
In New York the dollar settled at 131.27 yen, down from 131.50 yen on Wednesday.
It cost $1.9568, meanwhile, to buy one British pound in New York, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.9500.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4925 German marks, down from 1.4955; 1.2745 Swiss francs, down from 1.2785; 5.0755 French francs, down from 5.0865; 1,117.25 Italian lire, down from 1,121.00, and 1.1495 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1527.
Gold prices also lost ground yesterday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $2 an ounce to settle at $362.70. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $361.25, down $2.45 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Oregon Shakes Up Pioneering Health Plan for the Poor

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 21

 BODY:
After coming under intense criticism for a list of medical priorities that placed headaches and thumb-sucking ahead of diseases like cystic fibrosis and viral pneumonia, Oregon health officials have overhauled the rankings and produced a list that is far more reflective of popular sentiment -- a kind of health care by democracy.
If the Federal Government approves, Oregon will use the list to expand public health care to thousands of people as part of its effort to become the first state to guarantee basic health care to all its citizens. 
 Medicaid, the Federal-state health care program for the poor, will finance treatment only for those procedures in the upper part of the list; the money saved by eliminating costly procedures at the bottom will be used to provide treatment for many more people. To spread the money around to every Oregonian who is without health insurance, fewer options for treatment would be available to the 190,000 who are receiving Medicaid now.
The final plan was adopted Wednesday by the Oregon Health Services Commission. As with the earlier draft list, issued in May, its emphasis is on preventive care and treatable life-threatening diseases that affect many people, rather than on conditions that are minor or, by contrast, fatal and incurable.
 
A Line-by-Line Vote on Illnesses
 But the earlier version was generated by computer, based on a formula that took into account the costs of treating 1,600 diseases and the benefits of such treatment -- a blend of objective and subjective considerations that included the average period of survival and the "quality of well-being" after treatment.
The new list uses the same formula as a base, but it reflects extensive polls and interviews with ordinary Oregonians, followed by a line-by-line vote by the 11 members of the health commission to move illnesses up or down the list. In the process, the list was boiled down to 800 by combining groups of related diseases -- several kinds of pneumonia, for example.
The commissioners, who approved the plan unanimously, said they used common-sense human judgments. "We realized that the initial formula did not take into account a lot of what people were telling us in public hearings and polls," said one member, Dr. Rick Wopat. He is one of five physicians on the commission, whose members are appointed by the Governor; the others are a social worker, a nurse and four representatives of patients' advocacy groups.
The new rankings move organ transplants from near the bottom to near the middle. Familiar ailments like pneumonia and tuberculosis move to the top of the list, replacing less well-known ones, like candidiasis, a fungal infection, and Wilms tumor, a type of cancer. Terminal AIDS, with less than 10 percent chance of survival, and several untreatable ailments are ranked in the bottom 10. AIDS detected in the early phases, for which some treatment is available, is ranked in the upper 25 percent of the list.
The cutoff -- the line below which no public financing would be provided -- is to be drawn later this year, after actuaries determine the full cost of the operations and the budget. Oregon now spends $700 million on public health care every two years; it gets 63 percent of that from the Federal Government. The new program is expected to increase health care expenditures by at least 10 percent.
 
Congressional Skepticism
 The plan requires a waiver of Medicaid rules from Dr. Louis Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. He has not indicated whether he will support the experiment, saying he is waiting to see how much it will cost. Proponents are also asking Congress to change the Federal law that governs allocation of Medicaid benefits.
The plan has been widely praised in Oregon, with proponents, including Gov. Barbara Roberts, calling it the first comprehensive attempt by any state to provide health care to all its citizens. John Kitzhaber, a physician who is the State Senate President and who proposed the plan, said: "No one else in this country has been willing to confront the inequities in our current system. It's the non-policy on the Potomac that has driven us to the situation we have now, where 37 million Americans are without medical insurance."
Critics, both here and in Congress, say the plan amounts to rationing of government health money. Representative Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Health and Environment Committee, said the plan set up a two-tier medical system: one for those with access to the costly miracles of modern medicine, one for those without.
That criticism was echoed today by Sandy Willow of the Northwest Seasonal Workers Association, an advocacy group for the poor. "At a time when so many people can indulge themselves by buying face lifts and tummy tucks," she said, "this state is saying they have no options but to determine which among the poor will be left to die or suffer for want of money."
Lynn M. Etheredge, a health economist who worked at the Federal Office of Management and Budget from 1969 to 1982, said Oregon's proposal was an example of the lengths to which states were going to deal with the rapidly rising costs of Medicaid. "In my view," he said, "we ought to avoid doing this until we have exhausted all other means of trying to control health care costs."
But in Oregon, the medical establishment, consumer groups and advocates for the poor are applauding the plan for its pioneering attempt to compile a comprehensive ranking of medical procedures. "Even if this list is ultimately not used, it's a very useful tool for everybody concerned about health care," said Wendy Van Elverdinghe, of Oregon Health Action Committee, a consumer group.
Dr. Kitzhaber, whose supporters in Congress see the Oregon plan as a potential model for a national health care system, said the existing system already amounted to health care rationing by default because it deprived so many people of any health insurance. In Oregon, for example, a family of four cannot qualify for Medicaid if its income is more than $6,493 a year.
Dr. Michael Garland, a medical ethicist at Oregon Health Sciences University, said, "Explicit choice is better than hidden rationing."
Dr. Tina Castanares, a member of the health services commission whose medical practice treats primarily low-income patients, said the plan would make care available to people who are seldom seen except in costly emergencies.

HEADLINE: New York City's Finances Worsening, Regan Says

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said yesterday that New York City's fiscal situation had sharply worsened, even in the last month or so, and that the Dinkins administration had not presented a "credible plan" to deal with it.
"It is a failure of leadership," he said. But he tempered his comments by noting that the administration faced a huge problem and was operating under especially strict reporting and accounting standards, required after the city's brush with bankruptcy in the 1970's. 
 Mr. Regan made his remarks at his Manhattan office, where he released a commentary on a preliminary budget issued by Mr. Dinkins last month. While Mr. Dinkins called for a shrinking of city government, the report said the Mayor's budget would continue to grow faster than the inflation rate.
The report is one of a series of critical reports due to be released in the next week or so that fiscal analysts say will likely paint gloomy portraits of a city teetering toward what could be a fiscal crisis, requiring deep service cuts and tax increases.
Mr. Regan's report said the $2 billion gap between revenues and expenses documented by Mr. Dinkins last month had grown to $3 billion, partly because of state budget cuts and a worsening local economy, and that many of the measures proposed to close the gap were uncertain at best. Mr. Regan is a member of the state's Financial Control Board, which oversees the city's finances, and is required by law to report on the city's fiscal plans.
"We have very difficult fiscal problems," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director. "But we have them well under control with plenty of time to deal with them." He said the city was doing far better than the state, which faces a $6 billion deficit. "I forget," Mr. Michael asked dryly, "who is the State Comptroller." 
Mr. Regan's analysis shows that despite a local recession, spending, supported by city taxes, is scheduled to rise 7.1 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30 and 5.9 percent in the next year, higher than the local inflation rate. Tax increases will pay for most of the rise in spending, his report said.
He called on Mr. Dinkins to make deep permanent changes in how the city operates, demanding productivity increases and work-rule changes from city workers, changing Civil Service laws that "entrench low-priority functions and employees," supporting cuts in Medicaid benefits and reducing services in city hospitals.
Mr. Regan's report is based on assumptions that a recession in the local economy will be somewhat longer and slightly worse than the Dinkins administration expects. It predicts that the city will be unable to win approval for some of the taxing authority it is seeking and that it will have difficulty carrying out $400 million in budget cuts at the Board of Education for next year.
The report estimates that there is a $277 million gap in this fiscal year's budget and puts the city's gap next year at nearly $1 billion above the gap expected by the administration. Of this, $500 million comes from reductions in state aid and $174 million in lower tax revenue, with the balance from higher spending on city programs.
Mr. Dinkins presented a plan to close a $2 billion gap. But Mr. Regan said about half of this plan was uncertain, including some of the $580 million in tax increases proposed by the administration and cuts in education aid.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Journal;
In One City, 2 Campuses Worlds Apart on War

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Two black Avia hightop sneakers rest at the bottom of an abandoned locker in the Xavier University gym, and the size 15 feet that used to fill them are now swathed in military leather. Chris Harvey, a 6-foot 7-inch junior, had just become the basketball team's starting center last November when the mobilization put his athletic career on hold. Like many black students, this former reservist is in the Army now.
Similar stories of interrupted lives are being told across this modest campus, home to one of the nation's 41 historically black colleges. Many students here have left to fulfill military obligations, often incurred to help pay for college, and virtually everyone has friends or family in the Persian Gulf. 
 That personal contact is bringing bitterness; almost unanimously, Xavier students speak angrily about the war. They argue that the United States is being hypocritical by seeking to fight problems overseas while ignoring those at home, and that the nation is asking blacks to bear a disproportionate burden on both fronts.
Dr. Norman C. Francis, Xavier's president since 1968, used the word "pall" to describe the campus mood and said today's students felt more threatened by this war than the previous generation did by the one in Vietnam. The difference, he said, is that today's fighting comes as students are already fearful of what they see as their own waning economic prospects and an assault on civil rights.
The attitudes at Xavier are strikingly different from those at Tulane, a predominantly white university about mile away but a world apart in the backgrounds of its students. The proportion of Xavier students who have been forced from school because of military obligations is many times greater than that at Tulane. Perhaps as a result, it is almost as hard to find an Xavier student willing to defend the war as it is to find one at Tulane willing to criticize it.
The contrast suggests that in the absence of a draft, which helped form a generational division on the war in Vietnam, student views on this war are sculptered less by age than by forces like race and class.
"War Disrupts Campus," proclaimed the Xavier Herald, where one editor of the student newspaper wrote of "50,000 body bags per month" coming home and another described her husband's call to active duty as a form of slavery.
In a locker room discussion after basketball practice this week, Mr. Harvey's former teammates voiced similar disenchantment.
"I'd rather go to Canada," said Raymond Brothers, a 21-year-old senior guard from Lafayette, La. "The U.S. steps in in Iraq, but they've got apartheid in South Africa -- why doesn't the U.S. step in there?"
Merlin Peters, the team's co-captain, served four years as a marine before being spotted in a pickup game and offered a basketball scholarship to Xavier. He said his mother pressured him to join the service to get him away from the street corners of a New Orleans housing project.
"They're not over there by choice, by no stretch of the imagination," said Mr. Peters, whose brother is a marine in the gulf. "Blacks mainly join for economic reasons."
The registrar's office said about 33 of Xavier's 2,900 students have withdrawn to fulfill military obligations.
That rate is about 10 times as high as at Tulane, where about a dozen of 11,000 students have left for military reasons. There, the war brought few protesters and no student editorials.
On a campus where nearly a third of the students are Jewish, some support for the war is concentrated in organizations like Hillel, which has sponsored several demonstrations in favor of United States policy. "Any time there's a threat to Israel we see it as a threat to ourselves as well," said David Fox, the 19-year-old sophomore who is president the group.
Most fraternity members support the war as well. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house appeared a hotbed of social rest on the day after Mardi Gras, with the smell of stale beer wafting upstairs to the room where Spencer Ott sat watching a videotape movie. Mr. Ott won the agreement of his fraternity brothers when he said the United States was the only country capable of stopping President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. "It's our duty to the world," he said.
Mr. Ott, whose father is a Naples, Fla., investor, said he could already see domestic gains from the war, in a rising stock market and falling oil prices, and he was unpersuaded that it reflected social inequities.
"You could argue that there are more black people fighting because there are more black people who are poor," he said. "But it's better that they're doing something with their lives, not turning to crime and drugs like you see on T.V."
Like Mr. Ott, Mr. Harvey, the former Xavier center, did not envision himself being involved in a war. Though Xavier provided him with a full scholarship, friends said he joined the Army Reserves last spring
to earn some extra spending money: $112.48 a month for one weekend's duty as an administrative clerk.
The walls of his mother's home in the St. Thomas housing project here are papered with similar emblems of his strivings: commendations for his work in school, on the court and in summer jobs at the sheriff's office.
No one recalls hearing him complain when he learned he was being called up. He is now at Fort Polk, La., awaiting further orders.

HEADLINE: Dow Slips 7.18 for Third Consecutive Loss

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices turned mixed yesterday, with Soviet-Iraqi negotiations on all-out war or peace in the Middle East too close to call by the market's closing hour.
Suggesting that investors were not buying or selling much of anything to any great extent, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips fell 7.18, to 2,891.83, for the third loss in as many days. 
Well after the market had closed, the Soviet Union announced that Iraq had accepted a peace proposal, but the White House responded cautiously, saying it would study the proposal and prepare a response after discussions with its allies.
At Instinet, the after-hours trading service, Richard Schenkman, vice president, said last night after the announcement, "We're open for business, but haven't seen a whole lot of interest in response to what's going on."
 
Drop in Volume
 On the Big Board yesterday, trading, which has been steadily dropping, fell to 180.8 million shares from 185.7 million the day before. Birinyi Associates said program buying lifted the Dow only 2.5 points throughout the day.
Even so, 834 Big Board stocks advanced while 715 fell. Only 4 hit new lows, while 74 rose to new highs. One of the new highs was A. G. Edwards, the brokerage firm, which fell 3/8, to 28 1/4, after a reaching a new high of 29 1/8.
"We're in a holding pattern," Jack Solomon, market technician for Bear, Stearns & Company, said of the day's action.
"We're waiting to see what the messengers and minions have to say between Baghdad and Moscow and, ultimately, for Washington's response."
In a cautious upside forecast, he argued that "if we win the war and lose the peace, the market would go down in frustration." But, he added, "if we go into a land war and succeed -- and are not too bloodied in the process -- this market will crash through the 3,000 barrier in no time flat."
The Dow soared last July to a record 2,999.75, sank to a low of 2,365.10 in October and has been building almost steadily since then. As of yesterday, the Dow was only a little more than 100 points below the record.
 
Deeper Recession Forecast
 While the most recent Government figures tend to suggest that inflation could still be a problem, and, therefore, make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to bring down interest rates to stimulate business, the Commodity Research Bureau index sank yesterday to 211.21, a new low for the year.
Asked about the number, Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor for the index, said, "It means we're still on course for a deeper recession, and we're not coming out quick."
"If we were to come out of recession by the next quarter, as so many now assume," he said, "we would have seen a reversal in the bear trend in commodity prices that began with the 1988 peak in grain prices."
The decline, he said, is "across the board," except for cattle and cotton.
With the Dow blue chips down, only moderately, changes among the 30 industrials were small. But I.B.M., which dozens of traders check even before checking the Dow to see where the market is going, dropped 2 3/8, to 135 1/2, with 1.6 million shares changing hands.
Digital Equipment also fell, by 1 1/8, to 76 1/2; Apple Computer was down 2, to 59; Microsoft 2 3/4, to 100; System Software dropped 2 3/4, to 19 1/4, and General Motors E was off 1 3/8, to 41 1/4.
Among advancing issues, Conner Peripherals rose 1 3/8, to 26 1/8; Gerber Scientific 1 1/8, to 11, and Adobe Systems 2 1/4, to 45 1/2. Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht & Quist recommended Adobe because of several new products to be introduced in March.

Tokyo Stocks Off Slightly

HEADLINE: U.S. Rules Would Force Businesses To Make Alterations for the Disabled

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today proposed rules that would require businesses to make structural alterations to offices and stores to accommodate the disabled unless they can show that the expense would be too great or if they furnish an alternative way of providing service.
The regulations, spelling out how last year's Americans with Disablities Act will be enforced, would also require that businesses, including professional practitioners, insure that disabled consumers receive the same level of services as other customers as much as possible, even if that means altering the way business is conducted. 
 The rules, to be published Friday in the Federal Register, follow the publication of guidelines last month for enforcing the new law, which prohibits discrimination against people with physical and mental impairments in employment, transportation, telecommunications services and public accommodations.
The guidelines were written by a Federal advisory agency, the Architectural and Transportation Compliance Board, to help the Department of Justice set "accessibility standards" for commercial establishments being built or renovated.
 
Rules for Existing Businesses
 The Justice Department rules proposed today incorporate those guidelines and go further by covering what existing businesses must do. Last month's rules simply specified the structural provisions that must be made to accommodate the handicapped when a building is built or renovated.
The rules, which are subject to revision after a 60-day period of public comment, are to go into effect Jan. 26, 1992. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees will have an additional six months to comply, and businesses with 10 or fewer workers will not be covered until Jan. 26, 1993.
In addition to specifying the structural changes required by the disabilities act, the draft rules issued today address changes in services.
For example, restaurants would have to make sure that blind customers are aware of what dishes are available, either by providing menus in Braille or having a waiter read the selections. Banks would have to make automatic teller machines accessible to disabled individuals, largely by building or moving the machines low enough to be reached by people in wheelchairs.
 
Millions of Businesses
 "These regulations represent a fair and balanced enforcement tool for the Americans with Disabilities Act," Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that accompanied the release of the draft rules. "The Department of Justice has sought to strike a balance between the right of persons with disabilities to enter the mainstream of society and the workplace, and the financial and physical limits of the business community."
According to the Census Bureau, 1.7 million Americans are deaf in both ears, 7.7 million Americans have trouble hearing what is said in normal conversations and more than 13 million have impaired vision. At least 1.3 million people use wheelchairs or walkers, and 8 million have severe difficulty walking.
The regulations proposed today deal exclusively with the public accommodation provisions of the law. They will affect more than 3.8 million companies that operate an estimated five million commercial establishments, including hotels, motels, theaters, concert halls, restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums, doctors and lawyers offices, gyms, day care centers, parks and rental car companies. Private clubs, churches and establishments run by religious organizations are exempt from the regulations.
Violators are subject to a fine of up to $50,000 for the first offense and up to $100,000 for subsequent offenses. Disabled people or the Justice Department may seek a court order to enforce the law, and the Justice Department may also seek civil damages on behalf of disabled people who complain of biased treatment.
Pat Wright, director of government affairs for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, a advocacy group based in Berkeley, Calif., said that she was generally pleased with the draft regulations but that lobbyists for disabled groups would seek to toughen some of the proposals to allow more access for the disabled to various businesses and services.
 
'Fine Tuning' Sought
 "I think they reflect the spirit of the law," she said. "But I think they need some fine tuning." Ms. Wright added that about 70 disabled groups would be meeting here next week to analyze the regulations line by line.
Officials from the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has raised concerns about the potential cost to business, said they had not yet analyzed the regulations and therefore would not comment on them.
Under the disabilities law, enacted in July, all new commercial establishments must be accessible to people with physical disabilities, including those in wheelchairs. Existing businesses must alter their premises so disabled individuals can enter and easily conduct their business. Such alterations, the regulations say, might include placing ramps over stairways, widening aisles and lowering shelves.
Alterations do not need to be made if the company demonstrates that they would be too difficult or too xpensive to undertake. Companies can also opt not to renovate if they devise an alternative method of serving disabled customers, like curbside service or home delivery.
 
Changing Habits, Not Just Offices
 But beyond the issue of accessiblity, commercial outlets will have to modify some of their practices to accommodate individuals with physical or mental impairments.
Some of the modifications are relatively minor. Retail outlets could satisfy the needs of deaf or speech-impaired clients by providing pencils and pads. On the other hand, doctors discussing medical problems with a deaf patient could be required to hire a sign-language interpreter. Hotels and motels that have five or more rooms must be able to provide special telephones in the rooms upon request so that deaf and speech-impaired guests can make outside calls or contact the front desk or room service.
Businesses must also jettison policies that tend to exclude disabled individuals.
For example, businesses would no longer be able to use a drivers license as the only means of identification when cashing a check because such a policy excludes blind people. Companies would, however, be able to maintain policies that are necessary for the safe and effecient operation of the business. Thus, an amusement park operator could keep a height requirement for a ride if that criterion is considered a safety measure.
 
Integrating the Disabled
 The regulations call for integrating the disabled as much as possible. For example, unless it is prohibitively expensive, movie houses, theaters, concert halls, sports arenas and auditoriums must maintain seating arrangements that allow disabled and able-bodied individuals to sit together.
The regulations specify that if a company declares that altering its facility or practices creates an undue financial hardship, a Federal court would be allowed to look at the finances of both the business and its parent company in assessing that claim.
Wendy Lechner, manager of research and policy development for the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small businesses that has opposed certain provisions of the law, said that the regulations could force some companies to abandon operations in less economically viable locations.
"It will make business owners think twice about where they will locate a facility," Ms. Lechner said. "It may hurt business in inner city or rural areas."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Washington;
New Bill Mandates Sanctions On Makers of Chemical Arms

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Senate passed legislation on Wednesday night that requires the President to impose sanctions on countries and companies developing or using chemical or biological weapons.
President Bush rejected an almost identical measure last year. But Congress had adjourned by the time he announced his decision and there was no chance to try to override a veto. Mr. Bush said then that he could not accept the bill because it did not give him the authority to waive all sanctions if he thought the national interest required him to. 
 But on Wednesday night, the White House accepted the bill after Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the minority leader, and Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, pressed for only modest changes. The revisions would allow Mr. Bush to delay the imposition of sanctions against foreign companies while he sought to get their own governments to punish them. The Dole-Garn amendment did not allow any delays or waivers in sanctions against countries that use poison gas or germ warfare.
The amendment and the bill itself were passed without opposition on roll-call votes. It was clear all along that the bill had enough support to pass, and perhaps to overcome a veto. Last year the Senate voted 92 to 0 to adopt it.
Among the leading Republicans speaking for mandatory sanctions was Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican. He insisted that failure to impose sanctions against Iraq for using poison gas, and against German companies that had aided Baghdad, had encouraged those companies to help Libya, too.
The bill, the Omnibus Export Amendments Act, also included provisions that would ease controls on exports of high technology to Eastern European countries if they agreed to protect that technology; establish procedures for updating lists of prohibited exports; reauthorize and expand export-promotion activities of the Commerce Department, and extend the Export-Import Bank subsidy program to help support American exports.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
It Is a Victory

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The late-night agreement between Moscow and Baghdad poses hard questions for President Bush. But it entitles him to claim a great victory of principle. And that is the way he should frame his reply: as a statement of victory.
Saddam Hussein is ready to withdraw from Kuwait. That is the bottom line. 
 Moreover, he -- and President Gorbachev -- gave up any linkage to the Palestinian or other Middle East issues. He agreed to the immediate release of war prisoners, a point demanded by Mr. Bush. And he abandoned his insistence that American and other foreign forces withdraw from the gulf as his leave Kuwait.
Some of the terms will be hard to swallow for President Bush and even some Americans who have disagreed with him about the war.
One is the provision that all United Nations resolutions about the gulf crisis be canceled, apparently including the call for payment of reparations by Iraq. Why shouldn't Iraq pay for the horrors it has inflicted on Kuwait? On the other hand, is there any realistic expectation of payment in Iraq's stricken state? But the provision does grate.
Another difficult provision calls for the lifting of economic sanctions on Iraq when its withdrawal from Kuwait is two-thirds complete. Sanctions could be a useful tool to keep degrees of international control on what Saddam Hussein may do in the future.
But against the doubts over those clauses there is the overwhelming human fact of the peace agreement: It would spare the United States and its allies a ground war. That President Bush could insist on a massive ground attack in this circumstance seems politically impossible.
A ground war must be off at least until the new situation is clarified. But President Bush can keep the air attacks going on Iraqi forces in the Kuwait area while he goes into what amounts to an unacknowledged negotiating phase.
Mr. Bush can answer the proposal with modifications of his own. But the thought here is that he should frame his answer in affirmative terms, treating this as a victory on the fundamental question of Iraq's aggression in Kuwait.
There will be voices on the American Right urging Mr. Bush to say a flat no. Those conservative voices want the United States to expand the aims of the war from freeing Kuwait to removing Saddam Hussein.
A recent editorial in The Wall Street Journal was an example of such thinking. Saddam Hussein, it said, must be removed "by death, flight or, preferably, capture." The editorial did not shy from urging that American forces battle on as far as necessary to capture him.
It indeed would be a blessing to have a different president of Iraq at the end of this affair. Saddam Hussein is a vicious tyrant who would make as much trouble as he could if in office, even with his military power largely destroyed.
But to have American armies pursue him across Iraq and capture him would be the surest way to make him a martyr. All his propaganda about the imperialist conspiracy would be borne out in the minds of many Arabs and other third world peoples.
And if American forces fought their way to Baghdad, what would they do then? Install a U.S. proconsul to govern Iraq? Choose a new president? Either of those courses would arouse profound hostility among Arabs, who have long since made clear their feelings about the way Britain and France installed rulers over them after World War I.
The coalition wisely formed by President Bush to undo the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait would split over such an expansion of war aims at the very moment peace is a possibility. The United Nations Security Council would not authorize it. The international consensus that gave the allied cause legitimacy would be gone, and with it what hope remained of Mr. Bush's "new world order."
The idea of carrying this war on to Baghdad to capture Saddam Hussein rests, in the end, on a fundamental illusion. That is the belief that complicated political problems can be solved by military action -- unilateral American military action.
The Middle East is a stew-pot of conflicting religions, races, dreams. Secretary of State Baker was surely right when he said the United States must address the region's problems "with a due sense of modesty."
The one great recent success in easing Middle East conflicts was a substitution of politics for force. Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin made peace, and their work endures amid so much instability and fear.

HEADLINE: Latins Admire the Stability of the Dollar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Dependence and Sovereignty Pull at Panama's Equilibrium" (front page, Feb. 11) mentions, somewhat disdainfully, that Panama's currency remains the United States dollar. It is true that one balboa has always been worth exactly $1. But in a hemisphere where central banks usually become the Treasury's printing office, what a blessing it has been for Panamanians not to have a separate currency and a central bank easily manipulated by corrupt governments. Panama remains Latin America's only country without a history of appalling inflation; Latin governments often rob their citizens without raising taxes, just by printing money.
Shoeshine boys in Rio ask to be paid in greenbacks, and real estate is often advertised south of the border in United States dollars; or by the time the transaction is closed the house may be worth a tenth of the asking price. People also save in dollars because "democratic" governments have frozen their savings.
Democracy does not mean very much if not linked to property rights. It is beautiful to vote every four or five years for the politicians of our choice, but it is far more important to have the freedom to vote every day with our money in the marketplace. Brazilian shoeshine boys know that; American intellectuals tend to forget it. That's a luxury we Latins can't afford.

HEADLINE: Cuts to Health Centers Are Ill Conceived

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush's proposal to combat infant mortality in 10 cities by taking money from the community health center program and the block grant for maternal and child health is an ill-conceived plan with potentially disastrous consequences (front page, Feb. 7). Community health centers, in existence in the United States since the beginning of this century, have had a long and successful history, serving urban and rural areas.
In 1907, Wilbur Phillips, secretary of the New York City Milk Committee, established the "milk depot," a maternal and child health center to reduce high infant mortality rates in the city. Over the years, community health centers provided medical and social services in neighborhoods with concentrations of poor immigrants.
During the 1960's war on poverty, community health centers played a major role in reducing infant mortality rates, low birthweight, and infectious and communicable diseases. Recently, community health centers have provided vital services for prevention, education and treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Today community health centers, despite strong evidence of their effectiveness, struggle for existence, surviving on minimal state, Federal and private grants.
The maternal and child health block grant, initiated in 1982 by the Reagan Administration, has channeled Federal dollars to local community agencies for maternal, infant, child and adolescent services. Most states have plans for maternal and child health block grants that give priority to lowering infant mortality rates and closing the gap between white and nonwhite infant mortality rates and low birthweight.
To achieve a quick fix solution to the high infant mortality, the Bush Administration is ignoring the record of well-organized comprehensive programs. The long-term consequences may be increased costs to society, as community health centers and other local programs lose economic support and close their doors to the communities they are dedicated to serving.

HEADLINE: The Prince a Corporate Raider? No, Just Joking

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the 35-year-old Saudi who is investing $590 million in Citicorp, once declared in an effusive moment that he would "love to be a corporate raider."
Prince Waleed was said to be unavailable in Saudi Arabia yesterday, but his advisers were assuring Citicorp that the remark in 1988 to a reporter for Forbes magazine was made in jest. 
 The source of his money for the Citicorp move is not completely clear. Most of what is known about the Prince comes from his advisers and his own account, rendered during the few times he has spoken with the press.
 
Started With a $15,000 Loan
 By their version, he started in business in Riyadh in 1979 after receiving a degree in business administration from Menlo College in Atherton, Calif. His start-up capital was $15,000 he borrowed from his father, Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz. He quickly exhausted that money and, when his father refused to bankroll him further, went to the local branch of Citibank.
At first, Citibank was also reluctant, but agreed to a loan when the young Prince put up his home as collateral. His fledgling enterprise, Kingdom Establishment for Trading and Contracting, grew and expanded remarkably in a variety of fields including real estate, construction, travel and finance. In 1988, Forbes magazine estimated that Prince Waleed, at 33, had a net worth of "at least $1 billion," making him perhaps one of the dozen richest members of the royal family. Yet in its 1990 tabulation of the world's billionaires, Forbes did not mention Prince Waleed.
But some Saudi experts expressed doubts yesterday about the notion that Prince Waleed was a self-made billionaire whose money for the Citicorp move came entirely from his own coffers. One adviser to the Saudi royal family -- an extended tribe with roughly 20,000 members and 4,000 princes and princesses -- said it seemed unlikely Prince Waleed could have made so much money during the 1980's, when oil prices were depressed for several years, which slowed the Saudi economy.
Instead, the adviser and an Arab banker, both of whom asked not to be identified, said the American-educated Prince probably had some help from his father, Prince Talal, a Saudi businessman of established wealth.
Prince Talal was a Saudi Government official who, like some of his countrymen, became enamored of the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser's message of pan-Arab nationalism in the late 1950's -- an ideology opposed by the monarchy of Saudi Arabia. Prince Talal moved to Egypt in the early 1960's but later became disenchanted with Mr. Nasser. By the late 1960's, he had moved back to his homeland, but the Saudi rulers would not allow him to rejoin the Government. So he went into business.
 
Favorable Terms for the Saudis
 Middle Eastern finance experts said the big Saudi investment in Citicorp was probably not directly related to the gulf war or championed by the Riyadh Government. The fall in the price of the shares of big American banks since the war and the recession began, however, made it possible for the Saudis to make a large investment on more favorable terms.
Prince Waleed's investment, they said, mirrored the optimism of most Middle East investors about the long-range prospects for the United States economy. "He undoubtedly views this an an investment in a premier bank in a country that still has tremendous potential -- that's got to be the principal motivation," said Sharif Ghalib, a Middle East expert at the Institute of International Finance in Washington. "And there's no question that that is how gulf investors view the United States."

HEADLINE: New York Growth is Linked to Immigration

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
New York City took in 854,000 immigrants between 1980 and 1989, who fanned out into all five boroughs to feed great changes in racial and ethnic concentrations, according to data released yesterday by Federal immigration officials and the Census Bureau.
 The figures show that the city's rebound in population in the 1980's rode upon waves of immigrants from Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America, who more than made up for a continuing loss of whites. 
All this created a much different city, where one out of nine New Yorkers came from another country in the last decade and where whites of European ancestry now account for less than half of the city's population.
 Residents identifying themselves as Hispanic grew by 281,797 -- to 1,783,511. Asians more than doubled in number, growing by 281,218 -- to 512,719.
 
Decline in White Population
 Asians grew sharply across the country, according to the census, and that pattern held across New York State, where they grew to 693,760 residents from 310,526 in 1980. More than half live in Brooklyn and Queens, whose Asian populations now both outnumber Manhattan's Asian population.
 The city's overall population increased by 3.5 percent, to 7,322,564, despite a 10.9 percent decline in whites. The number of whites, which in the data released yesterday includes several hundred thousand Hispanic residents who identify themselves as white, fell to 3,827,088, from 4,294,075 in 1980.
 Similar patterns were seen in New York State, where the overall population increased by 2.5 percent, to 17,990,455, even though the white population fell by 4.1 percent. There were 13,385,255 whites in the state in 1990, down from 13,960,868 a decade earlier.
 In contrast with the growth in New York City, though, immigration in New York's next largest cities -- Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers and Syracuse -- was not enough to prevent overall population declines because of the loss of whites.
 The new census data confirm trends that have long been noted by demographers and others. "We've gotten used to the fact that New York City is a place where the whiteEuropean population is now less than 50 percent and falling," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 The data released yesterday elaborated on overall population figures released last month. New York and other cities have challenged the data in a lawsuit, on the ground that the Census Bureau failed to count thousands of residents, many of them minorities.
 The figures, according to New York officials, are likely to understate the actual minority population. Figures from the Immigration and Naturalization Service show that between 1980 and 1989 New York City took in 854,000 immigrants. This is seen as the principal reason why the city's population grew both in absolute numbers and diversity in the last decade.
 Among the various racial and ethnic groups, blacks showed the largest increase: 318,175. The census put the number of blacks at 2,102,512, up 17.8 percent over the 1,784,337 reported in 1980. Nearly half of the increase -- 149,493 -- was registered in Brooklyn, which has seen a large influx from the Caribbean.
 The most dramatic increases were registered by Asians, whose population was put at 512,719, more than double the 1980 total of 231,501. The largest influx was in Queens, which has become a favorite destination of Chinese immigrants. There were 238,336 Asians in that borough, or 154 percent morethan the 93,780 counted in 1980. The Asian population also grew by 159 percent in Brooklyn, 135 percent in the Bronx, 153 percent on Staten Island and 52 percent in Manhattan.
 The data released yesterday showed that whites still constitute 52 percent of New York City's population. But the figure of 3,827,088 whites includes a high percentage of the city's 1,783,511 Hispanic residents.
 Demographers thus agree that sometime during the mid-1980's non-Hispanic whites ceased to be a majority of the city's population. Confirmation of this must await the release of further data from the Census Bureau, possibly next week.
 
Many Whites Leave City
 The proportion of non-Hispanic whites in the city has been declining for several decades, and analysts generally agree that the net loss of 466,987 whites over the decade was caused almost entirely by continued migration of this group.
 Manhattan and Staten Island could be exceptions to this trend. The white population of Manhattan, including some Hispanic residents, grew by 26,023 during the decade, to 867,227, a gain of 3.1 percent. Staten Island added 8,509 whites for a total of 322,043, a gain of 2.7 percent.
 The number of Hispanic people in the city increased by 281,797, a gain of 18.8 percent. The largest gain, 126,758, was in the Bronx, which became the only borough in which Hispanic residents now outnumber whites. In 1980 there were 554,046 whites and 396,353 Hispanics in the Bronx. In 1990, the bureau reported, there were 430,077 whites and 523,111 Hispanics.
 Data for New York State showed that, among the various racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic people accounted for the biggest gains. There were 1,659,300 Hispanic residents in 1980, or 9.5 percent of the overall popultion. By last year this figure had increased by 554,726 to 2,214,026, or 12.3 percent of the total.
 
Strong Black Growth
 Blacks also showed strong growth in the state, increasing by 457,049. The black population went from 2,402,006, or 13.7 percent of the population, in 1980 to 2,859,055, or 15.9 percent of the total, in 1990.
 Asians showed the strongest percentage growth, registering an increase of 123.4 percent. The statewide Asian population grew from 310,526, or 1.8 percent of the total, in 1980 to 693,760, or 3.9 percent, in 1990.
 Suburban counties showed what is also becoming a pattern throughout the metropolitan area: stagnation of the white population and an increase in the number of residents from racial and ethnic minorities.
 Nassau and Westchester Counties, for example, both registered overall declines in population because of loss of whites. In Nassau the white population dropped by 7.4 percent, to 1,115,119, while in Westchester the number of whites declined by 4.9 percent, to 694,308.
 Ms. Scanlon of the Port Authority said that the decline in white population in such suburbs was largely a result of declining family size. "There's a lot of empty nesting in those areas," she said.
 Suffolk County, which has a somewhat younger overall population, was something of an exception to this trend.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
An Excess of Excess, But What A Party

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
Let's see: a Playskool Tiny Tim, three pens, four buttons, "The Big Apple Guide," one can of caffeine-free Diet Pepsi, a bottle of lemon-flavored Perrier, a small bottle of Glenfiddich Scotch whisky, a cassette sampler, a New York restaurant guide, not one but two copies of Entertainment Weekly magazine, a sample of Elizabeth Taylor's Passion for Men cologne, a Warner Brothers cap, a Life magazine 1991 calendar, a Trump Plaza key chain, a C.D./book package of "The Lives of Quincy Jones." Anything else? Oh, yes, the most important: earplugs.
 Those were the contents of a shopping bag full of plunder handed out to anyone who asked for one at the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences post-Grammy party at the Hilton Hotel. Of course, those famous people who were there were probably too cool to accept such trivia. And most of the really famous folk were at one of the record-company parties in other hotels, clubs and restaurants around town. But the Hilton bag still served as some sort of symbol of Grammy acquisitiveness. 
 This year, I found myself clutching an actual Grammy ticket, which cost $200, and thus was privileged to move among the actual demigods who make up today's record business. The experience was intermittently amusing, instructive, appalling, exciting and pulverizingly dull.
<> <>
 The Grammys on Wednesday, held in New York for the first time since 1988, make an easy target for the varied constituency that laments the commercialization of music, from Frankfurt School Marxists to neo-conservatives to rock critics to Sinead O'Connor to religious moralists who puritanically oppose all manifestations of Mammon.
 Mammonophobes would have had a field day on Wednesday evening. Wretched excess was everywhere; if we live in a recession or if pop music is under siege from tape pirates or if we are tastefully espousing austerity in wartime, the record business hasn't heard the news. From the lavish ice sculptures at the Hilton to Warner Brothers' recreation of tout New York at Roseland, the record companies flaunted everything they could flaunt.
 Which included female bodies: decolletage is definitely in, or out, as the case may be, although my companion noted somewhat acerbicly that such exposure has never gone out of showbiz style. The snazzy clothes were mostly on the stars of both sexes and the male executives' trophy wives and girlfriends. But since the record business caters to youth and young bodies are usually cuter and sexier than older ones, the cutest clothes were on the small army of young women in bouncy miniskirts and young men in neat little pony tails and earrings who were directed by field generals with walkie-talkies to fill up even momentarily empty seats in the first 20 rows at Radio City Music Hall.
 If you have any sort of taste for mainstream pop music, the production numbers were mostly pretty sophisticated, at least compared with Hollywood glitz of the past, with M.C. Hammer's flashy energy-burst an early highlight. Along with a touching John Lennon montage and Kitty Wells's achievement award, the oldsters' high point was Bob Dylan's craftily mumbled, slyly enigmatic acceptance speech. It was only later that most people (myself included) realized that his nearly unrecognizable song was one of his most trenchant pacifist denunciations, "Masters of War."
 There are seemingly hundreds of Grammys, far too many to make a meaningful viewing experience. While one can understand the two-tiered class system that banishes many awards to before the telecast, the treatment of some of the pre-telecast artists is pretty shabby. Too bad television viewers missed Alannah Myles's leather-and-tights outfit in her victory as best female rock singer, while Eric Clapton's award as best male rock singer was beamed out to a waiting world. And by the time the pre-telecast awards got around to classical music, all mention of the nominees had been dropped and winners were hustled on and off the stage like cattle, without time for acceptance speeches. All to make more time for Gary Shandling's jokes.
<> <> In the end, however, I found myself feeling less censorious about the whole brouhaha than I had thought I might. Of course it's excessive, with a cast of characters straight out of a Weimar Berlin gallery of capitalist sharks. But it's also an all-American party. Of course pop music is commercial. But while the nominations celebrate commercial success even more than the Oscars, the voting seems as often to reflect clubby feelings for paying your dues as sheer numbers of records sold. Thus the awards to veterans like Bonnie Raitt last year and the slighting this year of such hot-selling parvenus as Wilson Phillips and Vanilla Ice.
 Still, most aspiring popsters, even the critically respected ones, want to "make it," by which they most often mean not winning a critics' poll but selling records by the truckload. Unlike other art forms, music has been bifurcated into noncommerical art and commercial, youth-oriented entertainment. If you want art, you can get it at Carnegie Hall or the Knitting Factory. If you want flash and sexy style and exultation in success and, sometimes, pretty vibrant music, you got it at the Grammys.
 Vernon Reid, the guitarist of the critically beloved band Living Colour, dedicated the award for best hard rock performance to "all the bar bands, all the acts who are struggling to make it." He was wearing a Sinead O'Connor T-shirt, but his words suggested a willingness to participate in just the commercial process Ms. O'Connor professes to abhor.

HEADLINE: If a Shop Closes With Your Item Inside

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
When Hank Hachmann left a computer printer at a store to be repaired late last year, he thought he would have it back in a couple of weeks. But the store, Wolff Office Equipment at 23 West 18th Street in Manhattan, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 28 and closed its doors.
"I tried to call the business number and the service number every couple of days but nobody answered," Mr. Hachmann said. "I was frustrated because I thought the printer was gone and it was a very big inconvenience." 
 Still, Mr. Hachmann considers himself lucky. Last month Wolff reopened in the same location to liquidate its inventory. And Mr. Hachman got a call to come retrieve his goods.
Robert Wolff, president of the concern, said: "We called or wrote every person who had machines in the shop and they got them back." An offer to buy the business is now under consideration by the creditors and the United States Bankruptcy Court.
 
An Increase in Closings
 Mr. Hachmann was indeed lucky. In other circumstances, when a company goes bankrupt, is seized by the Internal Revenue Service or goes out of business suddenly for whatever reason, customers who leave clothes to be cleaned or appliances to be repaired never get their merchandise back. And such store closings have become frequent during the recession.
"I've seen a significant increase in these closings in recent weeks," said Barbara Berger Opotowsky, president of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. "If someone who has goods in a store sees the doors closed, it's a hysterical feeling."
"It's a painful fact of life that when businesses go out, in many instances consumers lose," said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, "but that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't try to get their things back."
 
Who's in Charge Here? (Where?)
 The first thing to do, experts say, is to try to find out who is responsible for the business: an individual, a corporation or partners. See if there is a sign on the door with the address of a new location or a phone number. Failing that, send a registered letter to the company at the address where the merchandise was left, requesting a return receipt showing to whom the letter was delivered, and at what address. In addition, ask in other stores in the neighborhood if anybody knows where those who ran the business have gone.
"Contact the landlord," said Barbara Gregg, director of the Office of Consumer Affairs of Montgomery County, Md. "The landlord doesn't have a lien on the goods and you may be able to get your stuff."
"If it's a franchise, go to the franchiser," said John A. Goodman, president of Technical Assistance Research Programs, a nonprofit consulting organization in Washington. "The franchiser has a very significant stake in his reputation and, in many cases, he can make you whole."
Also, check with the nearest post office for a forwarding address. And, of course, a call or letter to the city or county consumer affairs agency, your state Attorney General's office or local Better Business Bureau might prove fruitful.
If a business like a dry cleaner or a repair shop does not pay its taxes, it can be seized by the I.R.S. and closed. Even so, said Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the service, "We bend over backwards to see that consumers get their property."
The service, Mr. Fadely said, will post a notice on the store's front door telling of "A Seizure of Real Property" and giving the name and phone number of the revenue officer handling that seizure. The I.R.S. will often open the store for a while and notify those with repair tickets or identification so they can claim their property.
An I.R.S. manual states: "If the taxpayer's business hours extended beyond normal I.R.S. work hours, the establishment should be opened during some portions of the non-I.R.S. work hours. For example, if Saturday operation was customary, consideration should be given to providing at least some Saturday hours."
The situation is somewhat different when you pay all or part of the cost of new merchandise that is still in a closed store. Many consumers have learned that the chances of retrieving any money or the item are small.
"The best thing to do," said Mr. Goodman of Technical Research Assistance Programs, "is to put down a minimum deposit and pay on a credit card, rather than cash."

 
 
ACTIONS TO TAKE IN A BANKRUPTCY
 If you take merchandise to a store and leave it there -- for repairing, cleaning or any other reason -- what do you do if the business suddenly closes its doors? There are steps you can take to get your goods back and possibly some money, too.
To find out if the business has filed for bankruptcy, first make inquiries at the Federal bankruptcy court in the district where the business was located. You will need to provide the last known name and address of the business, and your own name, address and telephone number.
If a bankruptcy filing is found, the court clerk will give you the docket number and the name of the judge hearing the case.
You then have about six months from the date of filing to submit a written claim for merchandise left in the store. You use a legal form called Proof of Claim.
Attach to that form any proof of payment, receipt for deposit or other written evidence substantiating your claim and be prepared to wait for the merchandise.
You may also have some dollar claims against the business if, for example, the item is broken or ruined.
"There are special protections in the Bankruptcy Code for consumers with claims up to $900," said Robert Sable, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, a national support center for Legal Services offices. "The problem is that by the time most businesses that go into bankruptcy have paid off their creditors, the $900 protection is more theoretical than real."

HEADLINE: Health System In New York Faces Big Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Hospitals and nursing homes in New York State face the loss of $1.15 billion in Medicaid and Medicare funds -- 5.5 percent of their total revenues -- under state and Federal budget cuts planned for the coming year, health-care experts said yesterday.
To officials responsible for a system already weakened by recession, soaring costs and chronic deficits, it was a grim prognosis: like telling a group of seriously ill patients that the flu season was on the way and that, unless strong medicine could be found, some were not going to survive. 
 "We will try to stave off the death blows," Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said before meeting 300 hospital and nursing home executives at a conference at the Sheraton Centre in Manhattan. "But if we don't succeed, we are going to see a vast destruction of the health-care system in New York."
 
Warnings of Disaster
 Coming atop three years of operating deficits, the cuts could force the 250 hospitals and 625 nursing homes across the state to lay off thousands of workers and cut patient services at a time when an AIDS epidemic, drug abuse and violent crime have created record demands for medical care, Mr. Raske told the gathering.
Some clinics and pharmacies would be closed, delays for treatment in emergency rooms and for admission to hospitals would lengthen, patients would be urged to leave recovery beds earlier, plans for new equipment and expansion would have to be scaled back or abandoned, some hospitals might default on bonds and a few might go bankrupt, Mr. Raske warned.
In New York State, the cuts would affect 220 voluntary hospitals, which are private, nonprofit institutions, about 20 municipal hospitals and 10 private hospitals, as well as 625 nursing homes, about half of which are nonprofit. The hospitals get two-thirds of their $17 billion annual income from Medicaid and Medicare, while 80 to 90 percent of the nursing homes' revenues of $3.75 billion is from Medicaid.
The conference, sponsored by the association, which represents 71 voluntary hospitals and 55 nursing homes in the metropolitan area, and the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research and philanthropic group that analyzes hospital problems, was largely informational, outlining the size and probable impact of planned Medicaid and Medicare cuts.
While no plan for combating the cuts was formulated, many hospital and nursing home administrators, fiscal officers and trustees, and several political leaders who attended the conference, called the projections a call to arms for an endangered health-care system.
"This will damage the lives of tens of thousands of children," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's health committee. He urged the gathering: "Do not mourn -- organize!"
 
'Chaplains Have Even Been Fired'
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, denounced the proposed cuts. "People are getting sick because they don't have doctors to care for them," he said. "People don't go to doctors because they don't have the finances. It's getting so bad that the chaplains have even been fired."
Asked about the assertions of the health-care officials, Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, acknowledged that hospitals and nursing homes faced large cuts, but said they were necessary and not disproportionate.
"Because support for health care is such a large part of the budget, there's no way the state could exempt that area from cuts in trying to close a potential $6 billion deficit," he said. Mr. Conroy said that Medicaid eligibility standards had not been narrowed and that the state's share of Medicaid spending next year would be $3.7 billion, or $236 million less than this year.
Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund, said an analysis showed that hospitals in the New York region -- two-thirds of their income from Medicaid and Medicare -- were increasingly vulnerable to government budget cuts because an increasing proportion of their revenues were coming from Medicaid, the state-run program of health care for the poor, which is 50 percent federally financed, with state and local governments paying the rest.
 
Cost of $393 Million
 Moreover, Mr. Vladeck noted, Medicaid reimbursement rates are used to determine what private health insurers pay for hospital services. Thus, he said, cuts in Medicaid reimbursements would be compounded by a loss of revenue from private insurers as well.
Citing figures provided by the New York State Hospital Association, Mr. Raske said that proposed cuts in Medicaid would generate a combined revenue loss of $597.5 million for all hospitals in the state in the 1992 fiscal year.
At the same time, he said, proposed changes in Medicare, the Federal health-insurance program for the elderly, including cuts in payments to teaching hospitals mostly concentrated in New York City, would cost hospitals in the state $393 million, of which $279.1 million would be borne by hospitals in the New York metropolitan area.
The combined estimated loss of $990.5 million in reimbursements as a result of the state and Federal cutbacks would deprive the state's 250 hospitals of more than 5.8 percent of their $17 billion in aggregate revenues, Mr. Raske said. About 70 percent of those losses, he said, would hit hospitals in the metropolitan area because they have a larger share of patients and those patients eligible for Medicaid.
For the state's 625 nursing homes, cutbacks in Medicaid, which provides 80 percent of their income statewide and 90 percent in New York City, would cost an estimated $159.6 million, or 4.3 percent of the nursing homes' $3.75 billion annual revenues, Mr. Raske said, quoting state hospital association figures.
Some of the revenue losses would come from cuts in the annual rate adjustments the Federal and state programs make for inflation; others would be actual cuts in reimbursement rates; still others would arise from mandated delays in payments, cuts in care deemed less essential and cuts in education reimbursements to teaching hospitals.
"These are the worst combined cutbacks we've ever seen," Mr. Raske said in an interview. "The impact is staggering. In a recession, you normally find demand declining. But in health care, it often increases. We now have epidemics of AIDS and drugs. The needs of the elderly are growing.
Hospitals in the metropolitan area, which employ 153,000 people, might have to lay off more than 5,000 workers in the next fiscal year, Mr. Raske warned. He said layoffs in recent years had already cut hospital staffs to the bone.
Clinics, pharmacies and other hospital services that are regarded as uneconomical but socially and medically desirable also might have to be closed, and equipment modernization plans delayed or abandoned, he said.

Grumman Warns Of 4,100 Layoffs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Grumman Corporation warned that it might be forced to lay off 4,100 workers if the Government does not soon release nearly $1 billion appropriated for upgrading F-14 fighter planes. Grumman's chief executive, Renso L. Caporali, in a letter to the company's 26,100 employees, said the layoffs could begin shortly after March 1.
"Money authorized and appropriated for remanufactured F-14's last year has not yet been released, for reasons that have not yet been made clear to us," he said in the letter. The Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, is said to be considering rescinding the expenditure of 1991 funds for upgrading the F-14's in light of budget constraints. Grumman said advance Government funds would run out next Friday, making it impossible for Grumman to pay suppliers, purchase materials and keep in-house operations going.

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Sees Quick Recovery for Airlines

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration predicted today that the airline industry would quickly recover from its costly recession as fuel prices stabilize once the war ends in the Middle East.
But James B. Busey, the agency's head, said the weakest airlines might face lingering difficulties. 
 "Until we are totally out of the woods -- until the recession is over, until the price and availability of oil clearly stabilize, and until airlines bring under control their debt and high labor costs -- tough times may continue for portions of our industry," he said in a speech to a conference where the agency's long-term aviation forecast was presented.
Mr. Busey said, however, that the Government would not agree to recent requests by some industry officials for Government financial assistance. The only steps the agency would take, he said, would be to seek cost savings through more efficient air traffic control, which can cut fuel consumption.
The leading domestic airlines lost some $2 billion last year. Three of them are in bankruptcy.
In general, the agency's detailed forecasts for the industry were optimistic.
"It is very difficult to predict future air traffic with all the uncertainties about the national economy and world events," said William E. Jackman, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the major domestic airlines. "But we sure hope they are right," he said when asked to comment on the F.A.A. forecast.
In a separate forecast that is scheduled to be issued on Monday, the Boeing Corporation, the world's biggest producer of passenger jets, reached much the same conclusion: Fuel prices will decline and then stabilize, the economy will recover and air travel will rebound quickly after the end of the war.
Over the next 15 years, Boeing projected a 5.2 percent annual rate of growth in air travel worldwide -- enough to double the total passenger-miles, which would reach 89 billion by 2005.
Boeing said the world demand for new jets would be nearly 9,000 planes over 15 years, worth $617 billion in 1991 dollars.
The F.A.A. forecast, which assumes that the overall recession will last only six months and might well have already ended, did not include projections of industry profitability. It predicts only the growth in passenger traffic.
 
Worst Seen as Over

"In summary, we think the worst is probably over, even as I speak," said John M. Rodgers, director of the agency's office of policy and plans, who presented the annual forecast.
The forecast called for a decline in passenger flying miles of 1 percent this year because of the lingering recession, higher ticket prices and fears of terrorism. Next year, however, traffic is expected to rise 4 percent, and the increase is expected to average 5 percent a year for the next 10 years. (For the last 12 years traffic went up 8 percent annually.)
The key factor in the forecast is jet fuel prices, one of the biggest costs paid by airlines. Jet fuel has dropped from a November peak of $1.40 a gallon to 70 cents. In July, before the invasion of Kuwait, it was about 55 cents.
Fuel prices "should moderate even more in the second half of 1991 and decline further in 1992," Mr. Rodgers said. "For the balance of the forecast period, we expect plentiful and affordable fuel."
 
Long-Term Fuel Price

The forecast predicted that the average price of fuel from 1989 to 1995 would go up at an annual rate of 3.7 percent, slightly less than the anticipated rate of inflation throughout the economy.
But the long-term forecast was based on the assumption that the war would end "without any significant destruction of oilfields, refineries, and transportation facilities," the forecast said.
Today, the Pentagon said that about 15 percent of the oil wells in Kuwait had been set afire by the Iraqi Army, and President Bush said that other oil installations in occupied Kuwait were also being destroyed in what he termed a "scorched earth" policy.
As it has in recent years, the aviation agency predicted that international air traffic would grow faster than domestic traffic, and it identified as a primary trend in the industry the movement of large, strong carriers to expand internationally. International air traffic, measured in passenger-miles flown, would increase 6.4 percent annually between now and 1992.
Some airlines, seeking to solve their immediate financial problems, have publicly floated the idea of borrowing the 10 percent ticket tax imposed by the Government on all airline travelers, which would provide an infusion of billions of dollars this year. The tax is now used to pay most of the F.A.A.'s expenses.
"I don't think that's a starter," Mr. Busey said in a brief interview. "It equates to a Government bailout."

Komatsu Dresser To Cut 200 Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GALION, Ohio, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Komatsu Dresser Company said it would lay off half of its work force by the end of the year because of a slowdown in the construction and heavy equipment industries. The layoffs will furlough about 200 salaried and hourly workers, Michael Guilfoy, company human resources manager, said. One of two plants Komatsu Dresser operates here also will be closed, he said. The layoffs are expected to begin in March.
The company manufactures heavy equipment for the road construction industry, including graders and cranes. It is a joint venture between Komatsu Ltd. of Japan and Dallas-based Dresser Industries.

HEADLINE: Role of Taxes Debated in Adding to Income Gap

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Federal tax policy contributed to the widening gap between the wealth of rich and poor Americans in the 1980's, a group of experts told the Senate Budget Committee today, but they disagreed on how great a role other economic factors played in the inequity.
There was near unanimity that, as the committee chairman, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, put it, the 80's were "the decade when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer." 
 Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a coalition of labor, public interest and community groups, said "huge tax breaks" for wealthy Americans had stimulated "gross overconsumption" by that sector of society. At the same time, he said, lower-income families were facing increased tax burdens because Social Security taxes were raised and because states had to raise sales taxes and other taxes to make up for reduced Federal aid.
 
 A Conservative Viewpoint
 A contrary view was expressed by Marvin H. Kosters, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research and policy group here. Mr. Kosters said tax policy might have had some effect on the distribution of income, but it was a relatively minor element. The chief factor for the change, he said, was the widening gap between the wages paid to skilled, educated workers and their unskilled, uneducated counterparts.
An important way to close the gap, he said, would be to improve the education and training of unskilled workers. Tax policies that aim at redistributing income, he said, "are more likely to impair human-capital investment and income growth."
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, said economic and demographic developments, including the declining demand for unskilled labor and the growing number of single-parent families, "were far more important than direct Government policy in explaining the swelling incomes of the affluent and the shrinking wages of the less skilled."
 
 The Role of Government

But he added, "Even if the role of Government was smaller than sometimes suggested in the press or Congress, I regard it as scandalous that Government policy should have played any role at all in making the matter worse."
Mr. Burtless, too, urged that unskilled workers get more and better training and that schools provide more help to students who are not bound for college.
He also said he thought the issue of income distribution should be directly addressed by reducing Government transfers of income to the wealthy, like Social Security and Medicare payments. He proposed taxing such benefits once they exceeded the payroll contributions made by the recipient.
 
 Data on Average Family
 Senator Sasser said the net worth of the average American family, adjusted for inflation, declined by 3.4 percent between 1984 and 1988, while the richest 20 percent of households saw a 14 percent increase in wealth during the period.
He also cited data showing that the real hourly earnings of the average worker had declined 4 percent since 1982. He added, "That's 4 percent below the low point of the 1982 recession -- the deepest postwar recession we've seen."
Mr. Sasser said the income disparity was reflected in tax trends during the decade. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, he said, pay a tax rate that is 9 percent below the rate paid 10 years ago because of "the supply-side tax cuts of the 1980's."
"By contrast," he said, "tax rates for 60 percent of Americans have increased."
Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, expressed skepticism about the disparity of wealth in the United States, saying that the 1980's had been a time of general prosperity for the nation.
"If you torture numbers long enough they will tell you anything," he said, challenging the statistics.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Firmer Worldwide As Bush Gives Ultimatum

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened on world currency markets yesterday after President Bush gave President Saddam Hussein of Iraq an ultimatum to begin withdrawing his forces from Kuwait by noon today.
Gold was moderately lower, because of technical factors and the dimming of its safe-harbor appeal amid peace prospects. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $5.70 a troy ounce to settle at $357.00, the lowest spot gold price since early July. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $356.75, down $4.50 a troy ounce. 
Silver also declined, dropping in New York to a 17-year low. On the Comex, silver for February delivery fell 12.9 cents a troy ounce, to $3.508.
The dollar rose quickly in European and United States trading after President Bush told Mr. Hussein in a speech to "begin his immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait" or face a decisive ground assault.
The terms released by the White House were that Iraq's half-million troops must complete their withdrawal within one week, Baghdad must free all prisoners of war in the first 48 hours, and coalition forces will not attack withdrawing troops.
"The prospects for a long, drawn-out war and the negative impact it would have on the U.S. economy is diminished," said Tom Benfer, senior market representative in foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York.
Technical factors also lifted the dollar yesterday. President Bush's comments helped push the dollar to 1.5000 German marks inUnited States dealings around midday, a barrier it had struggled to surpass for the last month.
"Once we broke through, it moved up quite quickly," Mr. Benfer said.
The dollar settled in New York at 1.5055 German marks late yesterday, up from late Thursday's 1.4925 marks. In European dealings, the dollar bought 1.5045 marks, up from 1.4905.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9440, from $1.9580 late Thursday, while in New York it fetched $1.9445, less expensive than late Thursday's $1.9568.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.85 yen, down 0.58 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 132.20 yen, and in New York, the dollar settled at 132.15 yen, up from late Thursday's 131.27.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.2925 Swiss francs, up from 1.2745; 5.1225 French francs, up from 5.0755; 1,127.50 Italian lire, up from 1,117.25, and 1.1524 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1495.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.2900 Swiss francs, up from 1.2735; 5.1155 French francs, up from 5.0710; 1.6960 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6798; 1,126.00 Italian lire, up from 1,116.75, and 1.1520 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1513.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $359.00 a troy ounce, down from $363.50 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $358.80.

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities Hold Steady

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury securities market meandered in a narrow price range yesterday after a brief upward movement early in the session. Dealers said bond prices rose about a quarter-point after the opening on hopes of an end to the Persian Gulf war. But there was no follow-through buying and prices retreated to opening levels.
Late in the session, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were unchanged at 97 30/32, as was the yield of 8.06 percent, a bit below its three-week high of 8.07 percent. A week ago the long bond's yield was 7.97 percent. The long notes, the 7.75 percent issue due February 2001, were unchanged at 99, as was the yield of 7.89 percent.
 
 "The Street simply does not know what the consequences of peace or war will be," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "In the past few weeks, the Street seemed to favor bonds. Now no one knows."
 
 Inventories Reduced
 Given the market's lack of direction, Mr. Sullivan continued, the day's activity was confined largely to professional traders, like dealers and speculators, with both groups trying to reduce holdings. There was little retail investor interest in the bond market, he said.
Although dealer carrying, or financing, costs remained comfortable, the uncertainty overhanging the market encouraged dealers to reduce inventories of Treasury securities.
"Despite the easy carrying costs, dealers do have a heavy supply of Treasury paper on their hands," Mr. Sullivan said. "After all, they did absorb $55 billion of Treasury coupon issues, including the $34 billion of refunding issues, in just the past 10 days."
The easier dealer financing costs reflect the fact that the Federal funds rate has been less than the yields the dealers are getting on the Treasury issues on their shelves. Dealers usually finance their inventory at roughly the funds rate, which is also what banks charge each other for temporary loans.
 
Move on Funds Rate
 The Federal Reserve moved to reduce the funds rate yesterday by a systemwide infusion of reserves into the banking system. The funds were trading at 6 3/8 percent on an annual basis at the time, slightly above what is perceived to the the Fed's target of 6.25 percent. As is often the case on Friday, the lack of interest in borrowing Federal funds reduced the rate even below the target level and the rate eventuallly closed at 5 percent.
But the discount rates on Treasury bills, which are most sensitive to the funds rate, were narrowly mixed. The 90-day bills rose a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.96 percent; the six-month bills were unchanged at 5.95 percent, and the one-year bills also gained a basis point, at 5.97 percent.
Among some other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 6.75 percent notes of 1993 lost 3/32, at 99 19/32, and now yield 6.97 percent; the new 7.5 percent notes of 1998, which were also auctioned this week, slipped 1/32, to 99 24/32, and now have a yield of 7.56 percent.

HEADLINE: Hudson County a Harbinger of a New Hispanic Influence

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J., Feb. 21

 BODY:
"In the beginning, it used to be signs saying, 'We speak Spanish,' " Jose Michel Lopez said as he strolled down a stretch of Bergenline Avenue, looking at row after row of windows of Hispanic-owned shops.
"Now the signs say, 'We speak English,' " Mr. Lopez said. 
 For years the signs, sounds and smells of food along Bergenline Avenue have pointed to a trend that the 1990 census is now confirming: New Jersey's Hispanic population is increasing at a pace that outstrips every other major ethnic group.
What began in Union City as an enclave of Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's revolution three decades ago has matured into a community of Chileans, Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Guatemalans and other groups of Hispanic origin who have reshaped the culture of the area, taken control of much of its economy and begun consolidating political power.
In Union City, West New York, Passaic and Paterson, the Hispanic population has not only surpassed the black population, butnow outnumbers non-Hispanic whites.
Overall, 9.6 percent of New Jersey's population is now Hispanic, compared with 6.7 percent a decade ago. The trend also applies in Connecticut and New York, demographers say, adding that as whites and middle-class blacks leave the big cities for towns and suburbia, it will only accelerate.
 
Heart of the Community
 "Much of this started with the change in the immigration laws in 1964, which shifted the quota from northern European countries to the rest of the world," said James Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.
The heart of New Jersey's Hispanic population lies here in Union City and its neighbors, a cluster of Hudson County communities in the shadow of the Manhattan skyline that are home to 183,465 Hispanic people, according to the census. Bergenline Avenue is the main artery, a bustling, mostly commercial strip that begins in Union City and runs north for 90 blocks roughly parallel to the Hudson River.
Hispanic-owned businesses -- from small fruit stands and coffee shops to nightclubs and upscale clothing stores -- have multiplied and thrived along the avenue.
"When we came to this city it was like a ghost town," said Mr. Lopez, a truck driver who settled in Union City 32 years ago after leaving his native Cuba. "Now it's like a cosmopolitan small city.
"This is like being in Havana in the afternoon," said Mr. Lopez, who is a only a short walk away from the food, entertainment and culture he knew in Cuba. Just off the avenue, he can even get hand-rolled cigars "made by Cubans" in La Isla, a storefront factory run by Elsie Gonzalez and her husband Berto Ale.
Hispanic-owned businesses have squeezed out virtually all competition along Bergenline Avenue. One of the few vacant buildings used to house Fung Wong Kitchen, a Chinese restaurant.
McDonald's and Roy Rogers fast food restaurants appear to be holding their own, as does Marzigliano Live Poultry Market in West New York, which offers just about any kind of fowl that is domesticated, and rabbits too -- live.
 
Series of Changes
 "We're the oldest business on Bergenline Avenue," said Anthony Marzigliano, whose grandfather, an Italian immigrant, started the business 75 years ago.
Mr. Marzigliano has seen the neighborhood change from Italian, to Irish, to Cuban and now to mixed Hispanic influence. Business has never been better, he said, as he snatched a plump chicken from one of the dozens of cages stacked six high.
While Mr. Lopez can point to the businesses as a show of Hispanic economic power, he also can point to City Hall as an example of political prowess.
Five years ago, Robert Menendez, a lawyer and Democrat, beat the slate of candidates backed by the local Democratic Party organization to take control of the Board of Commissioners and become Mayor of Union City.
Mr. Menendez, the 37-year-old son of Cuban immigrants, became a member of the New Jersey Assembly in 1987, serving as Democratic majority whip, vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on taxation and state aid. This week, the state Democratic Party selected him to fill the unexpired state Senate term of the late Christopher J. Jackman.
 
A Hispanic Edge
 Mr. Menendez is New Jersey's highest-ranking Hispanic elected official and the only one ever to serve in the Legislature.
"What we're seeing now is the culmination of something that took a quarter of a century to build," said Professor Hughes.
He believes that culturally, Hispanic citizens may have a natural advantage in politics because of their strong tradition of extended families. That social bond could easily be transferred to a political union, he said.
Mr. Hughes identified New Jersey, New York and Connecticut as "population laggards," each of them showing overall growth well below the 10 percent to 11 percent national average during the last decade. The region's Hispanic population growth rate mirrored the national average, but was accentuated by the lower overall increase, he said.
Of New Jersey's 7,730,188 million people, according to the 1990 census, 739,861 are of Hispanic origin. The 5,718,966 non-Hispanic whites make up 74 percent of the population, and non-Hispanic blacks number 984,845, or 12.7 percent of the total.
 
Increase in Every County
 While New Jersey's non-Hispanic white population fell 1.8 percent from 1980 to 1990 and and the number of blacks increased 8.5 percent, the Hispanic population increased by 50.4 percent, and was the only group to show increases in each of New Jersey's 21 counties.
These numbers may actually understate the minority population. Many New Jersey cities have challenged the census count, saying it missed thousands of city residents, many of whom are black or Hispanic.
In Connecticut, the Hispanic population grew by nearly 89,000, or 71.2 percent, to 213,116. That represents 6.5 percent of the state's 3,287,116 residents.
In New York, the number of people identifying themselves as Hispanic grew 33.4 percent, to 2,214,026 of the state's 17,990,455 residents, or 12.3 percent of the total.
In New Jersey, the census also shows -- and Chilean nightclubs and Colombian fast-food diners along Bergenline Avenue back up the numbers -- that the solid block of Cuban control has started to crack under the weight of waves of new, non-Cuban Hispanic immigrants.
"What has happened is that you had a rise to the middle class to a large degree of the early migrants and you've had a continuous replenishment of the Spanish," Mr. Hughes said.
He said the new Hispanic residents "will fit the Democratic Party mold" but will not necessarily be allied with the old powerbrokers.
Mr. Menendez bears out that theory.
Beginning in 1981, he tried and failed several times to defeat a Democratic Party political organization that held sway over Union City for 20 years. On the eve of the 1982 election, Mayor William Musto was convicted in Federal court of stealing funds from the Union City Board of Education, but he and his entire team still swept the elections the next day. Mr. Musto was sent to jail, but still ran the city until Mr. Menendez's victory in 1986.
Besides Mr. Menendez, there is one other Hispanic member on Union City's five-member Board of Commissioners. The board is elected directly by the voters, and then choses one of its members as mayor.
But Mr. Hughes believes that Hispanic political clout does not stop at clubbing the traditional white powerbrokers. "It certainly would put a black, English-speaking candidate at some disadvantage," he said.
If Hudson County is viewed as a whole, Mr. Hughes said, he sees Miami as a model for the area's future. Miami's large Hispanic population elected a Hispanic mayor several years ago and then helped to elect the country's first Hispanic governor.
What happens in Hudson County may then be repeated in other areas of New Jersey and in New York and Connecticut, he said. "If people have the political clout now, they certainly should be apprehensive, if the democracy keeps evolving," he said.

HEADLINE: When Somewhere to Live Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
A decade ago, when advocates for the homeless first began to press their demands on New York City, they portrayed their constituents as ordinary people who, down on their luck in the nation's tightest housing market, just needed a place to stay.
Today, advocates acknowledge that this initial portrayal was, at best, incomplete. Many of the homeless are not just people without homes, but people suffering from drug addiction, AIDS and mental illness. Growing numbers of the homeless need psychological counseling and drug and alchohol treatment. Others, particularly the rising number of young,poorly educated women with children, need job training and day care. 
 And as a financially strapped city struggles just to provide shelter, it finds itself with a doubly difficult challenge: assessing the needs of the homeless and finding ways to pay for the expensive social services.
 
Hand in Hand With Services
 While private groups have developed model housing with special services, it is still a matter of debate which models work best and which can be replicated economically on a large scale.
Dr. Kim Hopper, a research scientist at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research who has studied the homeless, said housing must go hand in hand with social services.
"Advocates 10 years ago minimized what all of us recognized were basic service needs of the homeless adults and threw our weight behind the housing side of the argument," he said. "Before, homelessness had been thought of as an unemployment problem or one of personal disability."
The few studies that exist show that between a quarter and a half of all single homeless adults use illicit drugs, he said.
About a third exhibit signs of mental illness, and there is a signficant overlap between the two groups. "It's not clear that the diagnostic tags are reliable indicators of the housing that homeless people need," Dr. Hopper said. "Nor does it tell you how intense, prolonged or complicated that service package needs to be."
Not all homeless people who move from temporary housing into permanent apartments make the transition successfully. No one seems to know how many end up back in shelters.
One indication, however, comes from the experience of a nonprofit housing program called Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP, run by Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo said that about 10 percent of the families who stay in contact with his agency after moving to permanent apartments have difficulty maintaining them.
 
$1.2 Billion for Services
 "We should become disabused of the notion that therapeutic and survival needs are two separate domains," Dr. Hopper said. "Service people argue that unless someone can be stabilized they won't be able to take advantage of housing opportunities that you make. But the converse is also valid. Unless someone has a stable housing situation, their abilities to take advantage of the social services are compromised."
Since late 1985, New York City has spent more than $1.2 billion to give homeless families temporary quarters and social services in shelters, hotels and temporary apartments, according to the Mayor's Office on Homelessness and SRO Housing. By June, the Koch and Dinkins administrations will have created 26,806 permanent apartments. Just the construction costs of those apartments is more than $600 million.
None of this spending, nor the millions spent by nonprofit organizations, has come close to solving the problem. Advocates and city officials say that at least 100,000 apartments are needed to address homelessness and severe overcrowding. At $70,000 per apartment -- a low estimate of the cost of renovation or new construction -- it would cost a minimum of $7 billion for 100,000 homes. No one has an estimate of how much more the social services would cost.
 
Successful Models
 There are successful models of housing with social services, but expanding them to help everyone who needs them would be prohibitively expensive, city officials said.
Among the more promising models are two run by nonprofit organizations, the Settlement Housing Fund and Mr. Cuomo's HELP. Both mix homeless families into apartment buildings with low- to moderate-income families so that the formerly homeless are 30 to 50 percent of the buildings. The idea is to give the families stable environments with successful role models. The housing usually has some social services, either on-site or through referrals to agencies.
At one of the Settlement Housing Fund's projects in the Bronx, a staff of seven that includes caseworkers, community aides and youth workers help about 300 homeless families get job training, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, day care and homemaking or parenting classes. Carol Lamberg, of the Settlement Fund, said it costs about $350,000 a year just for the staff.
 
Families to Help Manage
 At HELP Homes, the 150 apartment project in Brooklyn, a staff of about 35 will give services to the 75 homeless families in the apartment complex at a cost of about $700,000 a year, Mr. Cuomo said. Services will include day care, job training, and counseling.
In addition, he said, the families will be required to help manage the complex, join tenant councils and develop leadership skills.
"The days of thinking that there is one solution to homelessness -- just providing housing -- are gone," Mr. Cuomo said.
Nancy Wackstein, director of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness and SRO Housing, said HELP is able to offer many services because Mr. Cuomo has received both Federal housing vouchers and state tax credits.
"Most of our projects either have one or the other," she said. "There is a limited pool of both."
Ms. Wackstein said that the city government has also integrated homeless people into apartment buildings with stable low-income families and that services are offered in some projects. But she said the city cannot afford to spend the amount of money that HELP does.
Barbara J. Sabol, the New York City Human Resources Administrator, said recently that the city plans to offer social services in schools, day care and Head Start centers and public health centers. If that works, there may be no need for on-site services in apartment buildings, city officials said.
Advocates for the homeless are skeptical. They say the city is housing too many homeless in isolated and devastated Bronx and Brooklyn neighborhoods that already lack adequate transportation and shopping, much less social services.
City officials answer that community groups fight them when they try to house the homeless in more established communities.
Of the estimated 100,000 homeless in the city, almost 4,000 families live in temporary housing, with about 600 of those in welfare hotels. In the winter, the city puts up about 10,000 single adults in overnight beds in armories, recreation centers and churches, and it assumes that there are thousands more who will sleep on the street rather than go to shelters.
"There is no longer a Federal role in housing, and the city is only able to provide for the most needy, which has been defined as people in the shelter system," Ms. Wackstein said. "I don't disagree with advocates who say we need 100,000 new apartments. That would enable us to begin addressing some of the overcrowding and people living in substandard apartments."
But advocates for the homeless say putting the homeless in hotels or shelters until apartments become available is misdirected.
 "The flaw in the city's approach has been to target the number of permanent housing units to the numbers of families in the shelter system, rather than developing a comprehensive plan to address the overall need," said Steve Banks, a supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project. "To some extent the Federal and state governments are not innocent parties either. The result is going to be greater long-term costs for all three levels of government."

An Island of Prosperity Since Toyota Moved In

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Ky.

 BODY:
Over a decade ago, pigeons and starlings were making a mess of the little downtown here. "So we had a pigeon shoot," said William N. Offutt 4th, an eye doctor and tobacco farmer.
With official sanction, 30 to 40 men leveled shotguns on the Main Street rooftops one Saturday. "Pigeons were falling on the windshields," said Dr. Offutt, a member of the posse. 
 Then the well-mannered men from Toyota came to town, built an enormous factory and generally sanded the rough edges off this town, about 20 minutes north of Lexington. These days, rooftop spikes keep the pigeons out, Mayor Tom Prather said, and the city dispatches the starlings more peaceably, by broadcasting recordings of starling distress cries to scare them off.
Thanks to Toyota, this town of 12,900 people -- about 3,000 more than a decade ago -- has become an island of prosperity two hours by car northwest of the depression in Appalachia and two hours south of some of the Midwest's industrial graveyards, among them American automobile factories.
The unemployment rate here is less than 4 percent. Toyota employs 68 Japanese and 3,500 Americans at a $1.3 billion factory, where it started making Camrys almost three years ago. Last year it turned out 218,500 of them.
As with most cars, sales of the Camry have been sliding in the recession, said Jim Wiseman, the plant's head of public affairs, noting that they had fallen by about 16 percent since January.
But unlike most American auto makers, Toyota has not laid off anyone and has said it has no plans to do so. Indeed, the company said in November that it would spend $800 million to double Camry production and would add 1,500 workers by 1993.
Not everyone has been enthusiastic about all this activity. The citizen who raised the biggest ruckus is Dr. Offutt, whose forebears were early settlers of the area and who owns a 475-acre tobacco farm downstream from the plant. A little creek, Lane's Run, cuts through the farm and carries storm runoff from the factory.
Toyota has built a $16 million plant to treat effluent from the plant and retention ponds to capture the rainwater from the factory. But Dr. Offutt fears that impurities still get into the runoff and wants the water sent elsewhere. Still, after going to some legal expense, he has given up the struggle, and Toyota and Mayor Prather consider the case closed.
To lure Toyota to Kentucky, the state provided $250 million to $400 million in tax breaks and other incentives, and this stirred some dust, too. To allay ruffled feelings about such a giveaway, Toyota has been paying a little of the money back.
It gave the community 10 Camrys. Mayor Prather and the top county official, Judge Executive George Lusby, each have one. Others have been distributed to nonprofit groups in town. These gifts proved a good investment for Toyota. Officer D. Reed Wilbers of the Georgetown Police Department said the Mayor was impressed enough with his car to invite the police chief to try it, and last year, the department bought nine.
Upon coming to Georgetown, Toyota also gave the city and county a total of $1 million, which they used to buy a failing convent and convert it for use as a senior citizens' center and other community purposes.
Toyota does not pay property taxes as such because the property for the plant was bought through a bond issue. Instead, it paid $900,000 for support of the school system last year, and Mr. Wiseman said that over 20 years the company expected to pay a total of $17 million to the schools.
The president of the plant, Fujio Cho, seems to be cutting an agreeable figure in town.
Unlike many of his executives, who have settled in the more cosmopolitan community of Lexington, Mr. Cho has bought a large brick house in the finest development in Georgetown. Each week he attends the Rotary Club meeting. He is often seen at work wearing the uniform of khaki trousers and a navy blue shirt.
Mayor Prather, an unabashed booster of Toyota, recalled that in 1985 great apprehension greeted the announcement that Toyota would settle here. "There would be 700 people at zoning meetings," he said.
This contrasted with the zoning meeting after the announcement of the plant's expansion. Just one person showed up, the Mayor said, "and he was just a curious neighbor."

HEADLINE: Where America Is Growing: The Suburban Cities

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PLANO, Tex.

 BODY:
A decade ago this suburb on the outskirts of Dallas was like other bedroom communities that sent their commuters down the freeways every morning. But in the 1980's Plano grew big and rich through a new form of urban development that is transforming the nation's economic geography.
Now, at every rush hour there is traffic in both directions as commuters drive to and from Plano for jobs in office buildings, factories and warehouses that sprang up in the 1980's alongside the housing subdivisions and shopping malls. 
 The 1990 census found that 29 communities had surpassed a population of 100,000, an unofficial but convenient threshold used by statisticians to mark when a town becomes a city. Twenty-two of them, Plano included, are situated in major metropolitan areas and are thus not free-standing cities in the classic sense because they still depend on and exist in the shadow of a metropolis. Yet these cities are no longer mere suburbs either, having become powerful economic centers themselves.
 
A New Type of Urbanization
 "We are in the midst of a new urbanization process that is very different from anything that we have known in post-war period." said Edward Soja, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It is hard even to use the old terms like cities and suburbs, center and periphery, and we haven't created a new vocabulary yet."
Plano may be what the future of urban America looks like. It and the suburban cities like it have succeeded so well as locales for economic growth that they have redefined the idea of a metropolitan area. Workplaces of all sorts, but especially the newest and most profitable, are now as likely to be found on the edges of a metropolis as in the old core cities.
People commute to Plano to work in a complex of telecommunications manufacturing plants that began in another suburb, Richardson, and pushed its way into the south side of Plano.
 
A Corporate 'Campus'
 Others drive to "Legacy Park," a huge office development that houses one of the world's largest data processing centers and the national headquarters of four major corporations, Frito-Lay Inc., Southland Life Insurance, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and Murata Business Systems. A fifth, the J. C. Penney Company Inc., formerly of New York City, is building its new headquarters "campus" in Legacy Park.
Two big fiber optic communications stations insure that the Legacy complex is firmly plugged into the global economy even as executives take lunch-hour jogs around woods, ponds and hillocks.
Outside the economic sphere, suburban cities like Plano have begun showing many attributes of big urban centers. This city, for instance, has its own small chamber music ensemble. It has Thai, Hunan Chinese and other ethnic restaurants, and even a quaint downtown. Antique and crafts shops now occupy storefronts where cotton farmers used to buy their supplies.
What is most obviously missing is the immigrant and minority population that provide the low-wage work force in most urban areas. More than 87 percent of the students in Plano's public schools are white. In Dallas, on the other hand, the 1990 census showed that for the first time a majority of the city's population was black or Hispanic.
Despite the economic success of the suburban cities, they have aggravated some longstanding social problems. Since the 1950's the movement of the middle class to the suburbs has helped generate economic and educational inequities and racial polarization. These divisions deepened in the 1980's as jobs left the core cities and emerged in the suburbs.
Many of the new suburban cities served as incubators for new enterprises in computing and telecommunications in the 1980's. The growth of cities like Lowell, Mass.; Irvine, Hayward and Oceanside, Calif.; Scottsdale, Ariz., and Irving, Tex., reflects the way the technology industry has sought fresh real estate away from traditional manufacturing areas, but then has created its own corridors of congestion.
 
Tightly Integrated Centers
 "This is no longer sprawl," said Donald A. Hicks, professor of political economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. "These suburban clusters are even more tightly integrated and specialized economically than the core cities used to be, and in the 1980's they became the new salt licks for population growth."
It is not only new Sun Belt cities that have emerged as suburban economic centers. A few older Eastern cities, like Lowell, outside Boston, or Stamford, Conn., outside New York, which were vigorous industrial centers in the 19th century then went into decline, have found new, thriving suburban identities. Indeed, Stamford was in many ways a forerunner of the suburban development in the South and West.
The 1990 census showed that for the first time most Americans live in metropolitan areas of a million residents or more. Nearly 125 million people, a little more than half the total of 249.6 million, now live in 39 areas of a million-plus people.
There are only eight cities with a million or more residents; the rest of the 39 areas include both the cities and their suburbs.
The growth has taken place in the areas beyond the core cities, and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which includes Plano, is something of a model of this trend. The "Metroplex," as the area is known to its boosters, was among the fastest growing of the nation's big metropolitan areas, the census found. Its population increased 32.6 percent to more than 3.8 million.
In the 1980's the region became a constellation comprising the two core namesake cities and five suburban cities with populations of more than 100,000: Arlington, Garland, Irving, Mesquite and Plano. Altogether the suburban cities grew almost twice as much as did Dallas and Fort Worth.
 
Suburbs of Suburbs
 The suburban cities even began spawning their own small suburbs, classic bedroom communities like "the Colony," a large development on the northern fringe of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area that is known for a high population of "pink collar" clerical workers.
The change in the urban landscape is evident to anyone who flies over a metropolitan area today, especially one in the Sunbelt. A decade or two ago these areas appeared as a clump of downtown buildings surrounded by a carpet of housing sprawling in every direction.
Now, the core dontown is no longer alone. Smaller clusters of office buildings and factories are scattered around at highway interchanges far out into the countryside.
These centers of economic activity generate other development around them. To local residents, each cluster has a name and a specialized identity. While the traditional American city was built around its central business district, the new cities are focused on a principal business or activity: a collection of computer companies, perhaps, or a large regional medical center, or a sports or recreation complex.
A similar specialization has even reshaped the downtowns of central cities. Professor Soja of the University of California said downtowns have become concentrations of two activities: government and banking, as well as the associated professions of the law and investment.
"There is a structural change which seems to be taking us towards something like city-states," said John V. Roach, chairman and chief executive officer of the Tandy Corporation, which has its headquarters in Fort Worth. "This metro area is already much more than what we are used to thinking of as a city. It is bigger, richer, more complex, more diverse."
 
A More Pessimistic View
 Not all views of new metropolitan development is so sanguine, however, especially in places like the City Hall of an old urban center.
"We've all worked together to promote economic development in the Metroplex because we all benefited," said Mayor Bob Bolen of Fort Worth. "But now these big suburban commercial and industrial projects are putting all the tax-base growth in places that don't share the central city's costs in terms of maintaining an older infrastructure or caring for the elderly, the poor and the sick."
In response, Fort Worth has conducted an aggressive campaign of annexation. "If you can't make the neighboring cities help pay your costs," Mr. Bolen said, "then you have to expand your boundaries to the point that you take in the growth areas."
This option is not available to Dallas, which is surrounded by suburban cities already powerful enough to resist annexation, and the success of the suburbs has become an issue in the Dallas mayoral campaign. The platform of one candidate, Forrest Smith, consists almost entirely of demands that the city defend itself against suburban economic encroachment.
 
In City's Center: Resentment
 The view is even darker from the perspective of minority citizens in one of the core cities. State Senator Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat, represents a constituency on the south side of Dallas that is predominantly black but cuts across economic strata from the poor to affluent professionals.
"No one seems to care that the jobs keep moving farther and farther away from the people that need them the most," she said. "We have plenty of cheap, unused property around here, and when people see everything going way out of town, they get angry and they start talking about racism, and you can't blame them."
 But the core cities were not alone in feeling hardship from the separation of job growth from the largest pool of workers.
 "It is the irony and the tragedy of urban growth in the 1980's that there were simultaneously labor shortages in the suburbs and unemployment in the cities," said John D. Kasarda, director of the Center for Competitiveness and Employment Growth at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
 Professor Kasarda sees a breakdown not just in the labor market but also in a fundamental social dynamic. For the first time in history, he said, "we have an underclass that is physically immobilized by the lack of either low cost housing in the areas that where jobs are available or the transportation to get there."
 He advocates programs that increase mobility, like van pool arrangements with suburban employers, job opportunity networks to bring news of suburban jobs to city dwellers and relocation assistance for the needy who find jobs and must move.
 Larry Fonts, president of the Central Dallas Association, a business executives' group, said: "Our government policies are just starting to adapt to our patterns of growth. In this area it's beginning with a regional public transportation system, and there is clear potential for regional approaches to issues like water, parks and waste disposal. Seeing how much further we want to go will be the challenge of the next decade."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The Overview
BUSH DEMANDS IRAQ START PULLOUT TODAY DESPITE ITS ASSENT TO 3-WEEK SOVIET PLAN;
OILFIELDS AND TRENCHES AFLAME IN KUWAIT
GROUND WAR VOWED

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
As the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its attempt to broker peace in the Persian Gulf, President Bush today gave President Saddam Hussein of Iraq what he said was the alliance's final demand: Start withdrawing from Kuwait by noon on Saturday or face a huge ground attack.
Administration officials said the ultimatum was based on an assessment that Mr. Bush should move swiftly to dictate terms of a withdrawal to Iraq now that five weeks of bombing have brought Baghdad to the point where it has agreed to a Soviet proposal for a pullout and is trying to negotiate the terms. 
 "The coalition will give Saddam Hussein until noon Saturday to do what he must do: begin his immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait," Mr. Bush said in a statement from the White House Rose Garden. He bolstered his message by accusing Iraq of conducting a "scorched earth" policy to destroy Kuwait's oilfields.
 
Ultimatum Called Shameful
 The White House said Iraq's response should be communicated to the United Nations before the deadline at noon Eastern time. By then, it will be night in Iraq, which would be the right time for an immediate attack should Mr. Bush decide to order one.
Speaking defiantly but showing signs of wavering, Iraq called Mr. Bush's ultimatum shameful and indicated that it was pinning its hopes on the continuing mediation attempt by the Soviet Union, which offered a modified peace proposal today but hinged its suggestions on conditions that were more favorable to Iraq than those demanded by the military alliance. [Transcripts of the American, Soviet and Iraqi statements are on pages 4 to 6.]
 
A Nudge for Gorbachev
 While Mr. Bush thanked President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in public for his efforts, behind the scenes the Administration sought to convey the impression that Mr. Bush was gently moving Mr. Gorbachev aside to prevent Moscow and Baghdad from reaching an agreement that fell short the unconditional victory sought by Washington.
In an indication that Iraq recognizes that time was running short and that it wants to forestall a ground war, the Iraqi statement spelled out clearly that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had the authority to make whatever concessions were necessary for the Soviet effort to succeed. That was an extraordinary break with custom for Mr. Hussein, who usually reserves important strategic decisions for himself.
 Iraq's response, read in English by an unidentified Iraqi official to reporters in Al Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, did not directly address Mr. Bush's demand that Iraq pull out of Kuwait City within 48 hours of the deadline and then pull back entirely into Iraq within a week.
 In a sense, the ultimatum delivered today was similar to the one presented in January, when Mr. Bush told Iraq it had until midnight on Jan. 15 to get out Kuwait or face war.
 But Mr. Bush's blunt new threat came in the context of the suspense over when the ground war might begin and also seemed to cut across the diplomatic efforts by Moscow.
 
Talks With Mitterrand
 In a day of satellite-speed diplomacy and public oratory that was played out on television broadcasts from three capitals and included an extraordinarily long conversation between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, it was impossible to know for certain how much the President has been coordinating his actions with the Soviet leader.
 But it was revealing that the President did not speak to Mr. Gorbachev today until after he had made public the coalition's position from the White House Rose Garden. The United States said the conversation lasted 72 minutes, longer than any other phone call of its kind. The Soviet Union said it lasted 90 minutes.
 Appearing outside the Oval Office, where his top aides had just been in urgent consultation, tearing up drafts of his statement and rewriting them as the President spoke by telephone with President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr. Bush said,: "I have decided that the time has come to make public with specificity just exactly what is required of Iraq if a ground war is to be avoided."
 Mr. Bush told Mr. Hussein that by noon on Saturday, Washington time, he must "publicly and authoritatively" convey his acceptance of the coalition's demands and then begin a "large scale" withdrawal from Kuwait.
 
'Instant and Sharp Response'
 Mr. Bush said he would refrain from moving the war into its long-anticipated ground phase until the noon deadline, but he and other officials refused to say how long beyond that they would wait.
 In return for Iraq's withdrawal, Mr. Bush promised only that the allied force would not attack retreating Iraqi soldiers. But he warned that any breach of the withdrawal, or an attack on another country like Israel, would bring "an instant and sharp response."
 In London, Prime Minister John Major said the allies' statement was "perfectly clear and it is not negotiable." He continued: "So Iraq now knows precisely what they have to do. I hope that they recognize that we are not prepared to bargain with them and we are certainly not prepared to be strung along by them."
 Other leading countries in the coalition swiftly backed Mr. Bush's hard line, and then Moscow announced a new peace plan that took a significant step toward the allied position but still contained major differences with the coalition demands.
 
Cushioning an Iraqi Defeat
 While Mr. Bush gave Iraq 48 hours to get out of Kuwait City, return the deposed Emir to power and free all its prisoners of war, Moscow proposed four days to leave Kuwait and three days to free the prisoners. There was no mention in Moscow's plan of the deposed Kuwaiti Government, and Mr. Gorbachev said Iraq should have 21 days, not one week, to withdraw entirely from Kuwait.
 The Soviet proposal also envisions a one-day cease-fire before Iraq would begin its withdrawal, while the allies insist on an immediate withdrawal and promise to stop attacking retreating Iraqi forces only after the pullout begins.
 In another vital difference, the Soviet plan provides for lifting all the United Nations resolutions, including trade sanctions and demands for reparations to Kuwait, as soon as the withdrawal ends. Mr. Bush's list of conditions not only offers no automatic lifting of the sanctions, but envisions that some of them, including a ban on arms trade with Baghdad, would remain in place after a withdrawal to prevent Iraq from rearming. A new vote by the Security Council would be needed to lift the sanctions.
 American officials said they believed that Moscow was trying to cushion defeat for Iraq, in part to find a solution that Baghdad will accept and in part to enhance Soviet status in the Arab world after the war ends.
 In contrast, the White House's list of "nonnegotiable conditions" seemed intended to give Mr. Bush the decisive victory he is seeking, even if Mr. Hussein decides to try to salvage as much of his military power as he can by pulling out.
 
Pressure for Military Victory
 With Mr. Bush under pressure from some advisers and allies to press ahead to an overwhelming military victory that would destroy the Iraqi war machine and perhaps Mr. Hussein, the demands seemed intended to force so swift a withdrawal that Iraq would have to leave behind much of its tanks and artillery.
 But the Pentagon acknowledged today that the Republican Guard, which includes Mr. Hussein's toughest troops and best tanks, would be largely unaffected because it is deployed along the Iraqi border and could be withdrawn quickly.
 A senior Administration official said the White House had also "taken into consideration" the possibility that the demands imposed by the coalition were so stringent that Mr. Hussein would defy them and keep fighting, permitting the alliance to strike for the military victory that it believes is within its grasp.
 It was a day of diplomacy reminiscent in some ways of earlier moments, like the Cuban missile crisis, but this one was played out live on television.
 The electric atmosphere drew an unusually large crowd to the White House gates, where lunch-time onlookers stood two and three deep, peering through the iron bars and hoping for a glimpse of the President and his advisers.
 
Coalition Negotiations
 Washington was a contrast to Moscow, where the attention of much of the public, including protesters in the streets today, was riveted on domestic problems like economic hardship and the Kremlin's battle with its secession-minded republics, and not on the war in the Middle East.
 Mr. Bush appeared in the Rose Garden after a night of intensive consultations with his war council, which concluded about midnight that it would reject the Soviet demands and set forth the allies' conditions for stopping the war.
 During the night, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, conferred with other members of the coalition to prepare the statement that the White House issued today.
 Mr. Bush's team worked until the last minute before he stepped out of the Oval Office into the Rose Garden. Through the office's windows, Mr. Bush could be seen behind his desk, a phone to his ear. Mr. Scowcroft and Robert M. Gates, his deputy, hurried in and out of the room, clutching papers under their arms, while Mr. Baker stood by the sofa on another phone.

 
Burning of Oil Fields
 Stepping up to a bank of microphones, Mr. Bush accused Iraq of duplicity in its dealings with Moscow and asserted that Baghdad was systematically destroying Kuwait's oil-production installations, the kind of action that Mr. Bush has warned would draw "the strongest possible response."
 "We learned this morning that Saddam has now launched a scorched-earth policy against Kuwait, anticipating perhaps that he will now be forced to leave," Mr. Bush said. "He is wantonly setting fires to and destroying the oil wells, the oil tanks, the export terminals and other installations of that small country.
 Indeed, they are destroying the entire oil production system of Kuwait. And at the same time that that Moscow press conference was going on and Iraq's Foreign Minister was talking peace, Saddam Hussein was launching Scud missiles."
 But at the Pentagon, officials said today that the burning of Kuwait's oil fields might have been a defensive action by Iraq, which appeared to be anticipating imminent attack by allied ground forces.
 A few hours later, Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman, announced that the Soviet Union had given Iraq a revised peace proposal that modified the one presented on Thursday so that it "seriously adjusted" what was required from Baghdad.
 "I would like to stress once again," he said, "that the language is being made more watertight."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Soviet Union;
Moscow Sends Revised Plan to Baghdad

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Soviet Union and Iraq's Foreign Minister sent proposals for several new Iraqi concessions by radio to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq today in a race against the deadline declared by President Bush.
The new proposals were still short of conditions set by Mr. Bush when he demanded that Iraq begin pulling its troops out of Kuwait by Saturday noon, Eastern time. 
 The Kremlin spokesman, Vitaly N. Ignatenko, said that although Mr. Bush's position was tougher than Moscow's, the latest proposal was the "maximum" Moscow could extract from the Iraqis. Mr. Ignatenko said he expected a reply "today or tomorrow" from Baghdad.
 
Long Telephone Conversation
 Mr. Ignatenko said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked by telephone to Mr. Bush for 90 minutes after the Soviet leader had met with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, but before Mr. Bush set his deadline.
Evidently to counter any impression that Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush were working at cross purposes, Mr. Ignatenko seemed to take pains to stress that Moscow remained committed to its policy of building a "real partnership" with the United States.
"Washington understands this, and we have been witness to the fact that since the beginning of the crisis in the Persian Gulf -- and this is important to stress -- the Soviet Union and the United States have always acted in harmony and with regard to each others' interests," he said.
Moscow's latest proposals were hammered out in negotiations this morning among Mr. Aziz, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, and Yevgeny M. Primakov, a foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Gorbachev who had initiated the latest Soviet negotiating effort with a trip to Baghdad earlier this month.
The new package was essentially a version of the Soviet plan to which Mr. Aziz announced Iraq's agreement when he arrived in Moscow early today, but with modifications apparently made to make the plan closer to what the United States had sought.
 
Central Point Remains
 The central point of the proposal remained an agreement by Iraq to withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait, as required by United Nations Security Council Resolution 660. The new version also reiterated that the pullout would begin 24 hours after a cease-fire, but it set specific limits for its completion -- Iraqi troops would be out of Kuwait City within four days and out of the country within 21 days.
The American ultimatum demanded that Iraq start the pullout by noon on Saturday and that all troops leave Kuwait City within two days and the country within a week.
The Moscow package further called on Iraq to comply with only one United Nations Security Council resolution, the one demanding a full and immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops. The United States has insisted that all United Nations measures be accepted.
The plan said all prisoners of war would be released within three days of a cease-fire, and the withdrawal would be monitored by observers or peace-keeping forces named by the Security Council. The new wording left open the possibility that these would be the United States-led allied force.
The sole demand dropped by Iraq was that economic sanctions be lifted once two-thirds of its forces were out.
Mr. Ignatenko said the new package was sent by radio to Baghdad over Soviet diplomatic channels about 6 P.M., Moscow time, or 10 A.M., Eastern time. Mr. Aziz remained in Moscow.
The proposals followed what another Soviet spokesman, Vitaly Churkin of the Foreign Ministry, called 24 hours of "unprecedented diplomatic activity."
 
 Aziz's Return to Moscow
 Mr. Aziz, who had taken the original Soviet proposals to Baghdad at the start of the week, returned to Moscow shortly after midnight on Thursday and went directly into two and a half hours of talks with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Ignatenko then said at a news briefing that Iraq had agreed to an "unconditional" withdrawal, with terms that Washington later said were conditions.
That night, Mr. Gorbachev called Mr. Bush, and in the morning he continued with calls to other members of the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Bessmertnykh, who had gone on a brief visit to Spain, flew home at 5:30 A.M. to pick up the talks with Mr. Aziz.
Just as the talks concluded and the message was being wired to Mr. Hussein, Mr. Bush issued his ultimatum. His deadline, noon in New York, is 8 P.M. in Moscow.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF;
Statement by Iraqi Revolutionary Council

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of a statement made in Baghdad yesterday by a spokesman for the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of CNN:
 In the name of God, Bush tried in his statement today, in a way expressing his moral deterioration, to portray or hint that what the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, agreed upon in Moscow is one thing and what President Saddam Hussein said in his speech yesterday is another. In his statement, Bush wanted to deceive nobody but himself, because Mr. Tariq Aziz, as authorized by President Saddam Hussein, to be committed to whatever is agreed upon with the Soviets with regard to their peace initiative. 
 Bush tried to issue Don Quixotic ultimatums for Iraq to withdraw until midday tomorrow, as he put it. We don't know whether Bush and his shameful ultimatum have sought to hint that the peace initiative is a result of his ultimatums, or that he wanted to imply to the world that he, together with his frustrated allies, have the allied victory over Iraq as if he imagines that the world is unaware of the fact that all that Bush and his allies have achieved since the 17th of January up to now is not more than sending his crows to implement a cowardly plan of destruction against the civilian property of the Iraqis, as well as against houses of worship, innocent civilians, as was the case in the attacks on Amariya shelter, Falluja, Mosul, Nasiriya, Basra, Karbala and all towns and villages, and even desert shepherds and Bedouins.
Bush and the allies who cooperated with him to commit that crime have sought to make the beginning of the battle not with our courageous ground forces, because they know very well that they lack the legitimacy that may enable them to face the army of jihad and faith. Bush might have been hasty to adopt a stance so that he may enjoy his weekend holiday, hence making hasty statements to bring closer the decision which is close to his evil intentions, namely the continuation of the aggression.
 
Soviet Initiative Backed
 We would like to affirm that Iraq is for peace and has been working seriously to support the Soviet initiative, and to facilitate its success. This is not out of fear of Bush's threats or a sign of respect for him, because we neither respect him nor are we afraid of his aggressive force. He has tried his bad luck all throughout the past time using whatever his bloodstained hands could catch up, criminal means and weapons.
By such a stance we express respect for what we believe in and for what we believe to be necessary for our people and humanity. We adopt such a position as an expression of respect for those whom we respect. And God's enemy and Devil's friend Bush is not among them.
As for Bush's job on destroying properties in Kuwait, such a job is [inaudible] an unfortuate one. Bush appears unaware of what has been destroyed in Kuwait, or in other fields in Iraq, be they petroleum installations or other properties. Bush even did not skip destroying what the most savage saboteurs and invaders avoided to destroy. Hence, Bush is not the right man to evaluate any aptitude or to make charges against others.
If Bush denies this as well as his destructive action to other oil and economic facilities, whether those are related to oil transport or production and extraction, in Kuwait or in Iraq as a whole, we call upon the Security Council to form a neutral committee, to the membership of which we propose China and the U.S.S.R., as well as any other members decided by the Council which are not parties to the fighting or have supported the warring parties. This committee is to get acquainted with the degree of civilian and economic destruction, whether in Kuwait or in Iraq at large.

HEADLINE: Recycling Doesn't Come Without Its Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "As Recycling Becomes a Growth Industry, Its Paradoxes Also Multiply" (The Week in Review, Jan. 20): Recycling has paradoxes because many assumptions underlying policies and legislation are not fully defined or scientifically examined. 
 Recycling has become a numbers game. Federal legislation proposed a 25 percent recycling level before one could incinerate municipal solid waste. The provision was deleted from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 at the last minute. The New York State solid-waste management plan requires communities to plan for 40 percent recycling by 1997; 50 percent if you include waste reduction, over which local communities have little control. New Jersey's Gov. Jim Florio has set a goal of 60 percent.
Nobody seems sure what counts toward achieving these goals or what constitutes the 100 percent base. How about communities that have established recycling programs or have operating waste-to-energy plants? Do they have to reduce their wastes as much as communities that start from scratch? How about yard waste, including leaves and grass clippings, that were never part of the waste stream? How about construction and demolition debris, also never part of the municipal waste stream. If these are now recycled, do they count toward mandated goals? How about the scrap-metal industry, particularly scrap automobiles? How about metals recovered from incinerator ash or incinerator ash put to other constructive uses?
These are complicated issues, and it does not help to have rigid, mandated percentages when nobody knows what counts and what does not.
Furthermore, not all forms of recycling are equally feasible, technically, environmentally or economically. Composting, which is being pushed by environmentalists, is fine for yard wastes but questionable for sewage sludge (because of metal contamination) or for mixed municipal solid waste (because of high ratios of noncompostable constituents). Markets for compost are a major issue.
The case for recycling is a mixed bag because of adverse economics. When is the community better off burning paper than recycling? Glass and plastics recycling are economically marginal, because of the high costs of separation and transportation. If recovered materials cost more, chances are it requires more energy to produce them.
If the environmental crisis is a part of the energy crisis, we must be very careful to include all energy costs in the costs of recycling. Plastics recycling also suffers because of the difficulty in producing recovered materials meeting certain specifications. We are attempting to label plastics to allow separation, mostly by manual means, into seven types. Only two of these types have reasonably wellestablished markets.
The most fundamental theoretical flaw of recycling is that it attempts to overcome the second law of thermodynamics, that is, to restore order from randomness. The second law tells us that it always requires energy to do this and that there must always be some waste that cannot be used. Otherwise, we would have alchemy and perpetual-motion machines. The more we try to close the cycle, the more energy it requires and the more energy is lost.

HEADLINE: Recycling Doesn't Come Without Its Costs;
Buyback Center

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York City Shouldn't Set Up a Center to Buy Recyclables" (letter, Jan. 22) by Harvey Jakob, president of the New York City chapter of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, criticizes a contract between the Department of Sanitation and my organization, the Manhattan Bowery Corporation, to operate a recycling-buyback center. 
 His attacks on the wisdom of the city's recycling effort, the impact of the contract on private dealers and Manhattan Bowery's capacity to perform are misplaced.
A buyback center would purchase recyclables at a posted price and bale or otherwise process these to sell to brokers or end users, some of them members of Mr. Jakob's industry. The center will employ about 25 unemployed homeless people, who will be trained and employed in the facility as it expands or be placed in private sector jobs.
The center will educate the public and encourage recycling; assist residents of lower-income communities by paying cash for recyclable materials; help extend the life of the city's landfills, and help open new markets for hard-to-recycle materials.
Mr. Jakob seems to object to the facility principally because it involves a city subsidy to a not-for-profit operator. The contract was awarded to us after a request for proposals open to all qualified bidders. The private operators Mr. Jakob represents declined to bid for the contract (and the subsidy).
They failed to bid because the contract requires the performance of functions that are not likely to be profitable. For example, it requires handling unprofitable recyclable materials such as newspapers: the market for recycled newsprint is limited, the supply overwhelming. The contract also mandates extensive community education and outreach.
The Department of Sanitation has wisely decided that it is more efficient to pay $92 a ton to dispose of waste materials by recycling than $150 to $400 a ton to collect and deposit waste in landfills.
The Manhattan Bowery Corporation will collect primarily from individuals and not-for-profit institutions that are not sources of material for the private sector, and not from commercial or industrial concerns, since costs associated with handling commercial waste are not eligible for a direct subsidy.
New laws governing recycling will mean a substantial quantity of material from other not-for-profits, particularly large institutions such as hospitals and universities. We can respond to this opportunity as well as serve the walk-in public, while preserving the job and business potential of recycling this material for New York City.

HEADLINE: A Likely Winner in Air Dispute

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
It is too early to predict the outcome of the fight between the United States and Britain over landing rights at Heathrow Airport near London. But at least one airline seems likely to emerge a winner: Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.
From the looks of it, Virgin, an upstart six-year-old carrier now confined in London to Gatwick Airport, would not only get to fly from Heathrow, a more popular airport, but would also be able to expand significantly the number of American cities where it could offer scheduled flights. Virgin now offers service to five United States destinations, including Newark and Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
 The opportunity for Virgin to offer scheduled flights to more American cities is a result of a sweetener the United States is offering Britain, in an attempt to win approval for American Airlines and United Airlines to buy Heathrow routes from Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines. Virgin's chance to offer Heathrow service would come about if Britain scraps a law barring additional carriers from the congested airport. Even before the dispute with the United States, the British Government was considering such a move to foster competition.
 On top of that, there is the prospect that Virgin, which has 8 percent of the Britain-United States market, could pick up two more daily round-trip flights between London and Tokyo; those rights now belong to British Airways P.L.C., the market leader.
All of this was helping Richard Branson, the airline's chairman and majority owner, to forget the pain from a neck injury the other day.
Did the 40-year-old entrepreneur, whose $2.4 billion entertainment and travel empire makes him one of Britain's biggest success stories, sustain the injury when he landed last month in Canada after a record-setting hot-air balloon trip across the Pacific? (He made the 6,761-mile crossing in 46 hours and 6 minutes from Miyakonojo, Japan, to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories of Canada.)
No, it came from a tennis match, when his partner hit him with a shot, Mr. Branson said, flashing one of his well-known toothy grins.
Mr. Branson is doing his best to be a pain in the neck of his archrival, British Airways, which has 40 percent of the United States-Britain market.
He has persuaded the British Civil Aviation Authority to recommend that the Government take away two valuable round-trip London-Tokyo routes from British Airways and give them to Virgin, so the airline can increase its round-trip flights to Tokyo to six a week. A Government decision is expected soon.
Mr. Branson is also hoping to hear any day whether he is going to win the biggest prize: the right to fly from Heathrow, the home base of British Airways.
Worried about congestion at Heathrow and eager to promote use of Gatwick, Britain has not allowed international airlines without a previous presence at Heathrow to use the airport since 1977. That means that Virgin, which began operations in 1984, has had to fly from Gatwick. But the Conservative Government is widely expected to lift those restrictions.
 
A Wish List of Cities

One inducement that the United States is dangling in front of Britain is something Mr. Branson would also love to have: permission for a second British carrier to fly to many American cities.
Virgin wants to offer scheduled service to and from Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and Orlando, Fla. Besides Virgin's scheduled flights to and from Newark and Kennedy, it flies to Miami and Los Angeles and has permission to begin service at Boston in May. It also offers chartered flights to Orlando.
To be sure, tiny Virgin, with its eight Boeing 747 jumbo jets, does not pose nearly so big a threat to British Airways in the North Atlantic market as mighty American and United.
But with those American carriers likely to be much stronger competitors than the struggling Pan Am and T.W.A., which have 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the British-American market, British Airways can hardly be thrilled at the prospect of having to contend with a stronger Virgin as well.
"Although they're small, they've got to be regarded as serious competition," said Andrew Chambers, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd. "People think quite highly of their service."<>
Virgin has built customer loyalty by offering a combination of highly praised Upper Class service to business travelers and bargain fares for economy passengers. Upper Class amenities include limousine service to and from airports, roomier seats than most competitors, a Sony Video Walkman for every passenger with a choice of about 35 films on tape, and a free economy ticket. Some flights also offer a masseuse or live entertainment like fashion shows, musicians and magicians.
"I would fly Virgin anytime over British Airways and the American carriers," said James McBurney, a London-based investment banker at Goldman Sachs International Ltd. "If you want to work, you've got more room to work. If you want to be entertained, there's more entertainment."
Plenty of travelers agree, explaining why Virgin has regularly filled 75 to 85 percent of its seats.
Since the Persian Gulf war broke out, its planes have been 71 percent full. While that is down from 74 percent a year ago, it is much higher than the rates for the big carriers, which unlike Virgin are now operating at a loss. Virgin executives say people worried about possible terrorist attacks against the big American and British airlines may be flying Virgin instead.
 
Learning From Failures

Mr. Branson said he had tried to learn from the failures of Laker Airways in Britain and People Express in the United States. Virgin executives include alumni of Laker and of some small British carriers as well as people with no previous airline experience.
Laker and People Express both offered no-frills service and competed on price alone, leaving them vulnerable to price cutting by bigger rivals. But the fat profits Virgin earns from its Upper Class -- the source of about two-thirds of its profits -- make it much less vulnerable to economy-class fare wars.
Virgin now charges $1,946 for a one-way Upper Class ticket from Newark or Kennedy to Gatwick. That is exactly what British Airways, T.W.A. and Continental Airlines charge for business class, but $1,259 less than their first-class fares.
Pan Am, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, has slashed fares in an attempt to raise cash. It is offering a round-trip business-class ticket between New York and London for $1,956, providing it is bought before March 15 and travel starts by May 31. A round-trip first-class ticket with the same restrictions costs $2,564.
 
Higher Profits Predicted
 Even though these are the toughest times the airline industry has faced in decades, "we're actually going to make more money this fiscal year than we made last year," Mr. Branson said. He predicted that pretax earnings would rise to $25 million on revenues of about $600 million in the year that ends on July 31. It earned $13.7 million on revenues of $336.6 million in the last fiscal year.
Mr. Branson said he had been careful not to expand too quickly and was avoiding the cutthroat short-haul business; routes to Ireland and the Netherlands were sold in 1989. Besides flying to the United States and Tokyo, Virgin also serves Moscow.
Virgin would eventually like to add service to Johannesburg, Singapore, Australia and maybe Mexico City. "But the rationale of the airline is not to be the biggest, it's to be the best," said Christopher Moss, Virgin's marketing director.
Mr. Branson, who dropped out of school at 17 to start a magazine for young people and went on to make a fortune in records, now owns or controls some 180 companies. Besides airlines and music recording, publishing and retailing, they include video and film distribution; hotels and real estate; electronic games, and a modeling agency.<>
He said he had been careful not to take on too much debt. He took his non-airline businesses public in 1986 but bought back the shares two years later when he became disillusioned with investors' short-term focus. To finance growth, he has sold minority stakes in some companies to the Japanese, whom he admires for their long-term outlook.<<<<
If Virgin lands at Heathrow, Mr. Branson is assuming that American and United will be there, too, but says he is unafraid. "They are better airlines than Pan Am and T.W.A., but there's nothing outstanding about them," he said.
Virgin executives say the tougher competition will merely goad them on in their quest to give customers more value for their money. As a small company in a land of giants, Mr. Branson said, "we've got to keep on being ahead of the game."

HEADLINE: John Sherman Cooper Dies at 89; Longtime Senator From Kentucky

BYLINE: By ALBIN KREBS

 BODY:
John Sherman Cooper, a liberal Republican from Kentucky who represented his state in the Senate for more than two decades, died in a Washington retirement home on Thursday. He was 89 years old.
His brother, Richard, said Mr. Cooper died of heart failure. 
 Throughout his long career in the Senate, Mr. Cooper, a patrician Kentuckian who served his country in diplomatic posts as well as in Congress, maintained a reputation for absolute independence.
His first roll-call vote, transferring investigatory powers to a special War Investigation Committee soon after World War II, went against the wishes of his party's leaders. So did his second vote, which prompted Senator Robert A. Taft, Republican of Ohio, to storm up the aisle and demand: "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?"
"If you'll pardon me," Senator Cooper replied, "I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best."
 
Led Opposition to McCarthy
 In the years that followed, Senator Cooper proved that he meant what he said. He was one of the first Republicans in the Senate to denounce Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin for the tactics of Mr. McCarthy's anti-Communist campaign. When it was unpopular to do so, Mr. Cooper also opposed legislation to remove from reluctant witnesses the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled self-incrimination.
In the Vietnam War, Mr. Cooper joined with a Democratic, Senator, Frank Church of Idaho, in drafting the Cooper-Church amendment, which was aimed at barring further United States military action in Cambodia.
Mr. Cooper worked quietly, avoiding histrionics. He left behind no ringing calls to action, perhaps because he was, by his own admission, "a truly terrible public speaker." On the rare occasions when he did take the Senate floor, he was often inaudible. He mumbled and swallowed his words, and apparently made no effort to avoid use of Kentucky dialect in which "great" sounded like "grett," "government" became "guv-ment," and "revenue" was pronounced "rev-noo."
Mr. Cooper was born on Aug. 11, 1901, in Somerset, the seat of Pulaski County in Kentucky. He was named for his father, the wealthiest man in town. The elder Mr. Cooper, like his own father and grandfather before him, was a county judge and a circuit judge, and it was always assumed that the next generation of Coopers would provide the county its leaders.
After a year at Centre College in Danville, Ky., Mr. Cooper went to Yale, where he was captain of the basketball team, and in 1923 was voted most likely to succeed.
 
Forced to Leave Harvard
 He went on to Harvard Law School but had to withdraw in 1925 after learning from his dying father that the recession of 1920 had virtually wiped out the family's resources.
Assuming his father's debts, Mr. Cooper sold the family mansion. Over the next 25 years he paid off the debts and sent six brothers and sisters to college. He passed the state bar examination and was admitted to law practice in 1928.
Mr. Cooper won his first elective office in 1927, a two-year term in the Kentucky Legislature. From 1930 to 1938 he served as county judge, a powerful local administrative post that controlled county patronage.
Mr. Cooper was elected three times to fill unexpired terms in the United States Senate. The first was in 1946, after A. B. (Happy) Chandler resigned to become commissioner of baseball. Mr. Cooper failed to win in the 1948 general election, but in 1952 he was elected to fill the unexpired term of Virgil Chapman.
In the next general election he was defeated by Alben W. Barkley, a Democrat who was Vice President under Harry S. Truman, but Mr. Barkley subsequently died and Mr. Cooper was elected to fill his unexpired term in 1956. Mr. Cooper's Senate service continued until his retirement in 1973.
 
Service in Military Government
 In 1942, after he had campaigned unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor, Mr. Cooper enlisted in the Army as a private. Earning a commission in Officer Candidate School, he was assigned to a military government unit. After Germany surrendered, he was put in charge of reorganizing the court system of Bavaria. While in the Army he married a registered nurse, Evelyn Pfaff. They were divorced in 1949.
Mr. Cooper's brief first stint in the Senate won him friends, among them Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican maverick, and President Truman. In 1949 Mr. Truman made Mr. Cooper a delegate to the United Nations; in subsequent years Mr. Cooper served in other missions to the United Nations and as a special assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson.
In 1955, shortly before he had become Ambassador to India and Nepal, Mr. Cooper married the former Lorraine Rowan Shevlin, a Washington social figure. But their stay in Asia lasted only a year because, after the death of Mr. Barkley, President Dwight D. Eisenhower summoned Mr. Cooper back to Kentucky to run for Mr. Barkley's unexpired term.
In the 17 years of Senate service that followed, Mr. Cooper, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, generally followed the liberal internationalist line on foreign policy. In so doing, he was often in conflict with Old Guard Republicans, notably Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois. In 1959 Mr. Cooper sought to become Republican leader of the Senate, but Mr. Dirksen defeated him by four votes.
 
Limits on Combat Troops
 Perhaps Mr. Cooper's greatest Senate victory was his move in 1969 to bar the use of United States combat troops from the fighting in Laos and Thailand.
At first it appeared that the Cooper drive had little chance of success, but after Mr. Cooper had enlisted the aid of Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, the leader of the Democratic majority, the measure was passed by the Senate and then the House, and President Richard M. Nixon signed it into law.
After leaving office early in 1973, Mr. Cooper joined the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling. Mr. Nixon chose him to be the first United States Ambassador to East Germany shortly after Washington formally recognized that Government. But Mr. Nixon was forced from office in 1974 before he could make the actual appointment, and it was his successor, President Gerald R. Ford, who did so. Mr. Cooper remained in the East German post for two years.
He is survived by his brother, who still lives in Somerset, and a niece, Rebecca Spencer, of Lexington, Ky.

THE WORLD OF THE TEN THOUSAND THINGS
Poems 1980-1990.
By Charles Wright.
232 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
$25. 
 If any living American writer deserves the description "man of letters," it is Donald Hall. "Old and New Poems" is his 10th collection of verse. His contributions to literary criticism have been perennial and salutary. He has written biography, short fiction and children's books. His "String Too Short to Be Saved" contains the best essays, for my money, to have been written on New England. His "Fathers Playing Catch With Sons" is a baseball classic. As a personalized introduction to the leading figures of literary modernism, no better book exists than his "Remembering Poets." Yet his poems are the center of his work. "Old and New Poems" -- a book enriched by the incomparable design given it by Anne Chalmers and Sara Eisenman -- gathers a generous selection of the work from 1947 to the present.
Mr. Hall, as this collection makes clear, has improved with the years. My copy falls open at page 125, where poems written from 1975 to the present begin. Before that time he wrote well, and there is much to admire. The chiseled lines of "My Son My Executioner," found in many anthologies, glisten here. "Christmas Eve in Whitneyville" holds emotion severely in check and is as much social satire as it is elegy:
 
They will not have unpleasant thoughts tonight.
They make their houses jails, and they will take
No risk of freedom for the appetite.
 
The early Donald Hall was a ready assimilator; the young poet who wrote these lines knew his Auden.
When in the 1960's, under the influence of Mr. Hall's friends Robert Bly, Galway Kinnell and James Wright, poetry (like everything else) loosened up, Mr. Hall's poetry eagerly embraced open form. In "Self-Portrait as a Bear" and in these lines from "The Alligator Bride" one hears the zany strains of American surrealism, which gives some of these poems a period tone:
 
The sky is a gun aimed at me.
I pull the trigger.
The skull of my promises
leans in a black closet, gapes
with its good mouth
for a teat to suck.
 
Here too is Mr. Hall's wonderfully hyperbolic humor, as in that poem about poetry readings, "To a Waterfowl" (the title alludes incongruously to William Cullen Bryant), which begins: "Women with hats like the rear ends of pink ducks / applauded you, my poems."
About 15 years ago Mr. Hall found his true place and his true subject. Readers of American poetry have reason to be grateful. Having inherited his grandparents' farm, he settled down in New Hampshire, determined to earn his living as a writer. To write of New England was to write New England's elegy, and Mr. Hall has become our great elegist. This is first made clear in "Kicking the Leaves" (1978), which, though set in Ann Arbor, Mich., already locates the poet spiritually in New England, discovering "the pleasure, the only long pleasure, of taking a place / in the story of leaves."
"Praise for Death," the long poem that closes this magnificent collection, is perhaps the finest sustained evocation of death in American poetry. In it Mr. Hall makes perfectly explicit the direction in which his poetry has tended for at least 40 years:
 
Let us praise death that raises itself to such power
that nothing but death exists: not breakfast nor the Long
Island Expressway, not cigarettes nor beaches at Maui,
not the Tigers nor sunrise except under the aspect of death.
 
This poem's precursors are old chestnuts like Bryant's "Thanatopsis," as well as the cloistered epiphanies of Emily Dickinson. But to find equals for the earthiness and relish of such poems as "Twelve Seasons," "Names of Horses" and "Granite and Grass," one must look to Walt Whitman. In the triumphant work of his maturity, in a burly line not strictly metrical but full-blown in its sonority, Mr. Hall celebrates with grieving joy the transmutation of matter into energy and the consumption of life by death, death seen as the unrefusable essence of life itself. Here is the closing section of "Granite and Grass":
 
Ragged Mountain was granite before Adam divided.
Grass lives because it dies. If weary of discord
we gaze heavenward through the same eye that looks at us,
vision makes light of contradiction:
Granite is grass in the holy meadow of the soul's repose.
 
This is poetry that marches in a stately order; classical in its dignity and perfectly readable, it argues the mystical union of dark and light, death and life.
 The subtle cadences of his verse, his famously "good ear," have won Charles Wright a select place among contemporary poets. "The World of the Ten Thousand Things" gathers his work from "The Southern Cross" (1981) to "Xionia" (last year). Since the early 80's, Mr. Wright has increasingly abandoned short lyrics for journal poems that weave diverse thematic threads into a single autobiographical fabric -- more than 200 pages, written over a 10-year period, that can be read as a single poetic sequence worthy of comparison with such extended works as "The Bridge" by Hart Crane, "The Far Field" by Theodore Roethke and "Dream Songs" by John Berryman. Freed from the stringencies of unity and closure demanded by the sort of poem most readers are used to, Mr. Wright is at liberty to spin out extended meditations that pick up, work with, lay aside and return again to landscapes, historical events and ideas.
The culture of Italy, where Mr. Wright was stationed in the Army and where he has returned over the years, runs like a bright thread through his meditations. Like Ezra Pound, he aspires toward Dante as a poetic master. The spirit of the Tuscan poet, in a form reminiscent of Giotto's painting of him -- "Laurel corona encircling his red transparent headcap," his "voice like a slow rip through silk cloth / In disapproval" -- makes an appearance in "A Journal of the Year of the Ox," the 40-page centerpiece of "Zone Journals" (1988).
One is occasionally reminded of Pound's "Cantos" in these pages. Mr. Wright meanders through cultures -- Chinese (as the book's title suggests), Italian, American (the poet explores his Virginia roots and describes the betrayal and destruction of the Cherokee nation in east Tennessee, his native state). But Mr. Wright's intelligence is supple, humane and inclusive; not for him Pound's crackpot economic and racial theories, his narrowness and crankiness.
"The World of the Ten Thousand Things" records with journal-like intimacy a spiritual quest -- an investigation of the relation between the visible and the invisible worlds. Viewing
 
the fire-knots of late roses
Still pumping their petals of flame
 up from the English loam
 
Mr. Wright exclaims:
 
And I suddenly recognize
The difference between the spirit and flesh
 is finite, and slowly transgressable.
 
These meditations often cross the border separating the living from the dead (family members as well as poetic precursors, including Poe and Petrarch in addition to Dante and Pound). The dead appear with great immediacy. Perhaps paradoxically, however, Mr. Wright takes a philosophical position closely akin to Buddhism -- ontological emptiness is the dimension in which all else is grounded: "this is the dirt their lives were made of, the dirt the world is, / Immeasurable emptiness of all things."
But this is, as it were, a positive emptiness, not an excuse for despair or a refusal to engage the world. The poetry grounds itself firmly in actuality, the "ten thousand things" that constitute the world in its totality -- what we cannot see in addition to what we can see:
 
I stand on the porch of Wickliffe Church,
My kinfolk out back in the bee-stitched vines and weeds,
The night coming on, my flat shirt drawing the light in,
Bright bud on the branch of nothing's tree.
The dialectic between a philosophy that negates phenomena and a sensory keenness for what Richard Wilbur has called "the world's hunks and colors" energizes Charles Wright's poetry, which is often presented as a dialogue between the poet and ideas taken from his reading: "Objects do not exist, / by convention sweet, by convention bitter. / Still, you could have fooled me." This down-to-earth voice makes itself heard from time to time in these meditations, and that's a good thing, because Mr. Wright's bad angel tempts him at times toward abstraction -- "Form tends toward its own dissolution" -- and sometimes toward a level of rhetoric that does not convince: "Inside the self is another self like a black hole / Constantly dying."
Yet Mr. Wright's gift for verbal music, his ability to evoke sensory experience and a boldness of metaphorical reference get the juices flowing whenever the language starts to seem a bit desiccated:
 
 salmon-smoke in the west
Back-vaulting the bats
 who plunged and swooped like wrong
 angels
Hooking their slipped souls in the twilight.
 
This poet is able to soar with Dante:
 
-- A bumblebee the size of my thumb
 rises like Geryon
From the hard Dantescan gloom . . .
Shoulders I've wanted to sit on, a ride I've wanted to take.
 
And he can still remain down-home enough to greet the denizens of the Inferno in high-five American style -- "Bico, my man, are you here?" He continues to reveal himself as a poet of great purity and originality.

SOMETHING TO DIE FOR
By James Webb.
333 pp. New York:
William Morrow & Company.
$19.95. 
As a Marine officer in the Vietnam War, James Webb won some of this country's most prestigious decorations -- including the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts. Later, he served in the Department of Defense and rose to become Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan Adminis tration.
His first novel, "Fields of Fire" (1978), was based on his combat experiences; it is part of the Marine Corps's official reading list for noncommissioned and commissioned officers. Mr. Webb's new novel is grounded in high-level Washington political scheming and combat in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. As topical as today's news, "Something to Die For" should push Mr. Webb onto anyone's list of first-class military-political writers.
In the novel, Ronald Holcomb, an ambitious and ruthless Secretary of Defense, teams with Adm. Mad Dog Mulcahy, a throwback who misses "all the rock and sock of sailing into harm's way" and who desperately wants a war so that he can cap his career. Holcomb and Mulcahy plot to maneuver feckless President Everett Lodge and the Congressional leadership into taking advantage of civil strife in the Soviet Union and expanding a fabricated international incident in the Red Sea to create what they hope will be a limited war.
Such a small war, in Holcomb's scheme, would accomplish two goals: it would deflect attention from a potentially embarrassing conflict with Japan over the transmittal by a Japanese conglomerate of United States military secrets to the Soviet Union, and it would justify an inflated defense budget that has been stalled in Congress. He envisages a military crisis that would win the backing of the American people, "unite their anger and get their blood going, without causing them any economic or personal discomfort." He wants to provide Americans with "a conflict they could follow as if it were a football game." The plan will carry the code name "Operation Justifiable Anger."
The troops who go on to fight this war are epitomized by Col. Bill Fogarty, a battle-hardened, muddy-boots Marine officer. The dedicated Fogarty believes in Napoleon's tenet that "there are no bad regiments, only bad colonels." He also views the war-loving Mad Dog Mulcahy as "a man of brilliance, whose career had come down to idiocy." There are well-drawn allies and adversaries, including French Foreign Legionnaires and a Cuban colonel who will command the enemy ground troops in the splendid little war.
In Washington, the players include a Senate Majority Leader and a veteran House committee chairman who, eager to manipulate others, find themselves manipulated by Holcomb and Mulcahy. As for Holcomb, when his plans threaten to go completely awry, he is ready for a classic Washington attempt at spin control: "He wouldn't lie. He almost never lied. He would merely package the facts, box them up and wrap them with a bright, optimistic ribbon. And anyway, his version could never be challenged."
Many topical political novels fail because they mirror outlandish events so accurately that they appear to be burlesques, which is probably why there have been few successful novels based on Watergate. When politics is combined with military affairs, particularly in the post-Vietnam era, the author must make comprehensible the modern military's array of Nintendo-game weaponry and at the same time provide a political framework that is credible. David Poyer's novel "The Gulf" succeeded in doing that last year.
But Mr. Webb is even more ambitious in attempting to combine war and politics, since his is a global theme. In this he succeeds masterfully. He understands and describes well the high-tech quality of modern war as well as the blood, sweat and fears of its soldiers. He is also skillful and credible in depicting the world of Washington, and his characters are both universal and believable. "Something to Die For" is a remarkable and angry counterpoint to the dispatches from the Persian Gulf, which, by contrast, often seem pastel versions of Mr. Webb's fictional account.

 BODY:

FOLLOWING THE BLOOM
Across America With the Migratory Beekeepers.
By Douglas Whynott.
214 pp. Harrisburg, Pa.: Stackpole Books. $19.95. 
 In 1985, Douglas Whynott traveled and lived with migratory beekeepers, men and women who truck thousands of hives thousands of miles each year in search of nectar and pollen. Because something is always in bloom somewhere -- mallaluca in Florida, blueberry in Maine -- bees on wheels can make honey, and their keepers money, all year. Besides selling honey, these beekeepers also sell sex, receiving payments from the farmers whose crops the bees pollinate. It is exhausting work, an economic gamble and a true romance.
The author, a beekeeper who teaches writing and English at Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts, chose an ill-starred year to follow the bloom. A dread parasite, the honeybee tracheal mite, reared its microscopic head, causing some states to quarantine beekeepers. In the same year, Africanized "killer" bees first appeared in the United States. This sub-Saharan strain began its march through the Americas in 1957, when a few queens were accidentally released in Brazil. Outbreeding and displacing more profitable varieties, Africanized bees may shrink our honey industry dramatically.
This book offers quick licks -- 44 chapters in just over 200 pages -- of biography and autobiography, popular science and travel writing, the history of beekeeping and the natural history of bees. Though its stated purpose is to profile the beekeepers, Homo sapiens is less interesting here than Apis mellifera.
Mr. Whynott introduces people through their resumes -- the jobs they've worked, the places they've lived -- a method more systematic than lively. Next, he tells us the stories the beekeepers told him. His ear for speech is sharp, but he repeats anecdotes with small regard to their intrinsic interest. Most beekeepers recite the rigors of beekeeping, especially bee transportation: we learn everything that can possibly happen to an old truck and a shifting load. Though harrowing at first, these stories soon become repetitious: to learn that mechanics won't repair a truck laden with bees is interesting, but only once.
When Mr. Whynott offers his own perceptions instead of retailing other people's stories, the images are fresher. Because his mind is more interesting than his subjects', so is his experience. He sees a forklift operator "raise a pallet [of beehives] on the run, like a shortstop scooping a grounder." He watches another man grab a bee, strip the pollen from its legs, pop the pollen into his mouth and pronounce the pollen to be pine. The hum of an apiary is like that of a highway, "a light and generalized overtone mingled with close fast-driver sounds. One bee caught in my hair, zizzed like a car slipped out of gear, got free, and flew on." Here is all the vividness that the hearsay stories lack.
Though bees have been the best publicized of insects, their intricate careers still astonish us. Mr. Whynott writes finely, often lyrically, of the mating flight, the winter cluster, the swarm. He excites our wonder for the dance with which scout bees report the location of a flower -- orienting their signals to the sun even in the darkness of the hive and even, somehow, after the sun has set.
Mr. Whynott warns that harder times are coming to bees and their masters, to farmers and consumers, as the Africanized strain of bees streams north. Professional beekeepers, though, are mounting a stubborn defense, fighting the Africanization of their colonies through careful breeding. By the end of his book, Mr. Whynott finds in their romance a potential for heroism.

SLEEPWALKING THROUGH HISTORY
America in the Reagan Years.
By Haynes Johnson.
Illustrated. 524 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company.
$24.95. 
 This feisty chronicle of the 1980's pays tribute up front to journalists and historians who have put their stamp on other decades -- for example, Frederick Lewis Allen, whose "Only Yesterday" is a classic account of the Roaring Twenties, and Theodore H. White, whose "Making of the President" series took stock of the nation as well as its leaders in the 1960's. In Allen in particular Haynes Johnson has picked a sound model, for comparisons between the Harding-Coolidge years and the Reagan era have become too pointed to ignore.
"Now you hear a lot of jokes about Silent Cal Coolidge," President Ronald Reagan remarked in 1981, "but I think that the joke is on the people that make jokes because if you look at his record, he cut the taxes four times. We had probably the greatest growth and prosperity that we've ever known. And I have taken heed of that because if he did nothing, maybe that's the answer [for] the Federal Government."
No guile there; rather, an invitation to take the man at his word. It is the considerable virtue of "Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years" to step back from the 1980's and frame them, if not with a formal theoretical perspective, then with comprehensiveness, bite and skill. Mr. Johnson takes Mr. Reagan and other key dramatis personae of the 80's at their words and deeds. The result is a mosaic of wretched excess, puerile fantasy, mass inattention and bills outstanding.
A respected columnist for The Washington Post, Mr. Johnson years ago developed a gift for getting outside the Beltway. His specialty has been the trend piece from around the country (he also won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the civil rights confrontation in Selma, Ala., in 1965). That strength serves him well here, for "Sleepwalking Through History" includes stark sketches of the Sun Belt and Rust Belt, of Wall Street and farm country, at the start and close of the decade.
In the Rust Belt, Mr. Johnson found job applicants with college and postgraduate degrees "who falsified their academic credentials -- downward. . . . They did not want to be considered overqualified for scarce factory work." For counterpoint, the Sun Belt: "In Midland, Texas, entrepreneurs in the nation's oil production capital gathered at the Holiday Inn to celebrate Reagan's inaugural. On a buffet table, surrounded by nachos and barbecued smoky links, they placed a cutout of the Capitol dome in Washington. On it was one word: 'Ours.' "
In documentary fashion, Mr. Johnson reviews the decade's parade of folly and waste: the rise and self-immolation of the Moral Majority, the Reagan Administration's environmental delinquency and the sleaze factor, board games called Trump and Greed, savings and loan recklessness and Star Wars sci-fi, the mega-deficits and the 1987 stock market crash, the conspicuous consumption of the yuppies and the invisibility of the ghetto.
The author is frank in citing his reliance on such sources as the University of California's oral history project for insights into Mr. Reagan by his "kitchen cabinet"; on the journalists William Greider and John Brooks, among others, for their versions of the supply-side economics saga. To the efficient marshaling of such evidence and accounts Mr. Johnson adds his own telling reportage. The centerpiece of his book is his recounting of the Iran-contra scheme. He presents it as the Reagan crew's decision to "privatize their intelligence operations," which he characterizes as "a method singularly in keeping with the spirit of the eighties."
The members and staff of the joint Congressional committee that investigated the mess reveal here how deftly the perpetrators turned the day of reckoning into an anticlimax. Thus, the committee's counsel, Arthur Liman, persuaded the committee chairman, Senator Daniel Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, that Adm. John Poindexter of the National Security Council was a by-the-numbers staff officer who "would not make a decision without telling the president," and they sought to induce truthful testimony from him by moral suasion. Summoning Admiral Poindexter to his office, Senator Inouye commenced an oration about duty, saying "it hurt him . . . to see a man in uniform taking the Fifth Amendment."
"Poindexter's face was hard to read," Mr. Johnson writes. "When it was his turn to speak, he simply said, 'I'm not going to wear my uniform.' He had been looking steadily at Inouye the entire time."
Mr. Liman's moment of truth came during a break in his questioning of Lieut. Col. Oliver North. Returning to the locked Senate Caucus Room, Mr. Liman found Colonel North "posing like a president" while committee functionaries and members of the Senate police force stood in line to have the Senate photographer take their pictures with the winsome colonel.
Mr. Johnson's sketch of the Commander in Chief is devastating, but not without measure. He cites Mr. Reagan's "genuine courage and humor" and "grace" at the time of his near assassination and the overall strength of his Presidency, "especially notable among young Americans, who saw in him their only successful presidential model and the one who repeatedly prevailed over his critics." But here too is Clark Clifford's unforgettable characterization of him as an "amiable dunce," and Representative Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, recalls a top-level White House briefing on MX missiles that the President interrupted at one point to recount "the plot from 'WarGames,' the movie. That was his only contribution."
Two quibbles: the author's reportorial travels are notable for their omission of inner cities; and one wishes so distinguished a journalist had rid himself of overuse of the passive voice.
Of Mr. Johnson's peers at work today, Garry Wills and Sidney Blumenthal have both written more probingly and thoughtfully about Mr. Reagan and the 1980's, but what makes their work so valuable is the distinctive critical apparatus with which each of them works. Haynes Johnson is more modest in his aspirations. He is a reporter and a chronicler (if an angry one), intent on getting it all down for the record. Those prudent enough to wish, after Santayana, to remember the past are in his debt for doing that so determinedly and readably.
 
CASHING IN ON PUBLIC SERVICE
 Reagan was leaving politics the way he entered it. The same wealthy Californians (among them Holmes Tuttle and Earle Jorgensen) who had purchased a private home for him to use as California's governor, later sold for a profit, had again pooled their money to purchase the Bel Air mansion and leased it to the Reagans. . . . Eighteen of these Californians contributed a reported $156,000 apiece to buy the seventy-two-hundred-square-foot property, set on one and a quarter acres and overlooking Beverly Hills and all of the Los Angeles Basin. The price was $2.5 million. By inaugural day the land value alone had appreciated to more than $3 million, and the property itself was estimated to be worth more than $5 million. Reagan had also recently completed a multimillion-dollar book deal to write his memoirs and publish a collection of his speeches and was preparing to sign an exclusive agreement with a Washington lecture bureau. (At the same time Nancy Reagan signed a $2 million book contract and was retained by the same lecture bureau.) Reagan was to be paid an estimated $50,000 for each speech inside the United States (and double that overseas), making him the highest-paid speaker in the country. For only two speeches a month he could make more than $1 million a year. This, of course, was in addition to his presidential pension of $99,500 a year for life and his annual pension as a former governor of California of $30,800. In addition, he received Secret Service protection from forty full-time agents and other security at a cost to the government estimated at $10 million annually, more than double that of other living presidents. A suite of offices atop a new thirty-four-story office building twenty minutes from his home . . . cost the government $173,000 a year to lease. From the government he also got use of a $1.25 million presidential transition fund for six months and $150,000 a year to pay staff.
All this provided more grist for his critics, who pointed out, not inaccurately, that when it came to cashing in on public service, Reagan, who more than any president in history railed against government benefits and spending, set the standard for all members of his administration. From Reaganomics to Reagabucks, one writer noted wryly. -- From "Sleepwalking Through History."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
When an Airline Takes Flight, What Then?

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
ELISE GROSSMAN, a New York student, remembers all too well the inglorious demise of Eastern Airlines last month. She found herself stranded in West Palm Beach, Fla., her Eastern ticket worthless. "I ended up spending an extra $350 to get home," she said. "I was furious."
In the not-too-distant past, passengers chose an airline based on its schedule or its service. Today, an airline's balance sheet factors into the reservation equation. "You have to take into consideration not only flight schedules and amenities but whether the airline will be around three months from now," said David Perelman, president of D.M.S. Travel Group in New York. 
 A combination of higher fuel costs, the recession and wartime jitters means empty seats and record losses for the industry. Two airlines, Pan Am and Continental, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. One other, Trans World Airlines, has failed to make a timely payment to their creditors. And, of course, Eastern Airlines stopped flying altogether last month after 63 years in business, the last two spent under the cloud of a crippling strike.
Once an airline files for Chapter 11 protection, ticket holders become creditors, along with fuel suppliers and aircraft leasing companies. Should the airline cancel all flights, your refund depends on how you paid for the ticket, what safeguards have been arranged by the bankruptcy court and what's left of the airline.
Granted, just because an airline files for bankruptcy protection doesn't necessarily mean it's about to stop flying. Continental, for one, has actually added flights since it filed. But a wise traveler will take precautions before making a reservation on a financially precarious airline.
The surest way to protect yourself is to pay for a ticket with a credit card or charge card. Although a refund is not guaranteed, most card companies will suspend the charges on your card while they go after the bankrupt airline themselves. At the very least, using a credit card buys you some time, since credit companies are legally required to suspend a questionable charge while they investigate it. Credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard, have policies similar to charge cards like American Express, but the precise rules may vary with the bank that issued the card. And while American Express will suspend a charge with only a phone call, many bank cards require written notification.
If you do pay cash for a ticket, you have to file for a refund with the bankruptcy court: a potentially time-consuming task.
Another form of protection is trip-cancellation insurance. Such policies, available from a number of insurance companies, cover all kinds of reasons for a canceled trip, such as sudden illness. If an airline or charter company should go out of business after you've purchased a ticket, the policies will make up the difference between the amount of your original ticket and a more expensive substitute one. A typical policy costs $5.50 for each $100 of coverage.
But travel insurance has some major drawbacks. Some policies must be purchased several weeks before the departure date and, of course, they won't compensate for the inconvenience of being stranded in Jakarta while you frantically search for another flight home. And just as medical insurance rarely covers a "pre-existing condition" most travel policies aren't valid if an airline had already filed for bankruptcy protection when you bought the ticket.
In hopes of winning a loyal customer, other carriers may honor tickets of a recently defunct competitor. After Eastern shut down last month, confusion was the rule at many airports. Some passengers simply handed their Eastern tickets to another airline's gate agent and boarded the plane, while others had to buy a higher priced ticket and then file for a refund from Eastern. "It was pot luck," said Nathan Devore, vice president of Rich Worldwide Travel in New York. "It depended on the ticket agents' mood, their attitude, their knowledge of the situation."
Still, most Eastern passengers were simply inconvenienced. Hoping to reassure travel agents and consumers, Eastern had set up a $50 million escrow account that guaranteed tickets. "The net result is that very few people lost money with Eastern," said Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
While a traveler's money may be protected, his frequent-flier miles probably aren't. The airlines have gone to great lengths to insure that the miles are viewed in court as their property, not the passenger's. "The miles go down with the airline," said Jeff Miller, a travel lawyer. He recommends people with bonus miles on a shaky airline either use them or, if possible, transfer them to a participating foreign airline.
Shaky Bookings
Some industry experts recommend that passengers avoid booking far in advance on financially shaky airlines. For instance, America West, a struggling midsize carrier, recently announced a two-for-one special for travel as far in advance as next year. But other, stronger airlines have already matched America West's offer with similar promotions. (Of course, such a strategy may ultimately prove counterproductive, since shunning a weak airline may help lead to its demise, leaving the bigger carriers even more freedom to charge whatever fare they like.)
In today's imploding airline business, the stronger carriers sometimes have a vested interest in prolonging the lives of their weaker competitors. Sometimes, the consumer can benefit. For instance, when United Airlines bought Pan Am's routes to Heathrow Airport in London it agreed to guarantee up to $100 million worth of Pan Am's tickets should the airline stop flying. In addition, Pan Am frequent-flier miles could be redeemed on United. But the entire deal hinges on British Government approval, and negotiations between the two countries hit a snag that had not been resolved at press time.
Seeking the counsel of a reliable travel agent is always a good idea. But agents are caught in a bind between their desire to support a troubled airline -- and thus promote healthy competition -- and their obligation to steer consumers away from an airline that may evaporate at any moment. Some agents were still recommending that consumers fly Eastern right up to the day it shut down.
The American Society of Travel Agents, which represents about half the nation's agents, doesn't discourage its members from booking passengers on troubled airlines because doing so "would become a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Phil Davidoff, president of the group. "We're strong believers in the importance of competition."
Still, many travel agents are now advising passengers if an airline is flying under bankruptcy protection, and some are even requiring clients to sign a waiver, absolving the agent of any financial responsibility should the airline stop flying. At the same time, other agencies, including American Express, the nation's largest, offer no such warnings. (The company will provide information about a carrier's financial status if a client asks.) "We're seeing that consumers are more Chapter-11 indifferent" these days, said Norma Arnold, senior vice president of establishment services marketing at American Express.
It Ain't Necessarily So
Indeed, with airline bankruptcies becoming as common as delayed flights and lost bags, the words "Chapter 11" don't have the stigma they once did. Since Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection (the second time in eight years), it has added three dozen flights from Newark International Airport, and the carrier recently revamped its service. "It's business as usual," said Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman, adding that the airline has not seen a drop in passengers due to its bankruptcy filing.
Still, some on Capitol Hill aren't convinced that consumers are adequately protected. Bills by Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, Republican of New York, and Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, would force the airlines to devise a plan to protect the traveling public's money. Details have yet to be worked out, but one proposal is that a surcharge of a few cents be added to each ticket, establishing a pool of money to be dispensed to passengers stranded by a bankrupt airline. "It's good for business," said Hank Price, a spokesman for Representative Boehlert. "It strengthens the whole industry."
While the bills are supported by travel agents, they are strongly opposed by the leading airlines, who feel that such legislation is, in effect, asking them to subsidize their weaker competitors. So far, the bills have made little progress.

HEADLINE: Sun Valley, an American Original

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN; TIMOTHY EGAN is chief of the Seattle bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
CERTAINLY, there are places in the Northern Hemisphere with more flash, better snow, easier access and steeper slopes than Sun Valley, Idaho -- the granddaddy of American winter resorts. But where else can a skier find a blend of big bowls and scrubbed sky by day, and at night curl up in front of a marble fireplace a few feet away from a frame of Ernest Hemingway's last letter and a picture of Judy Garland catching a 16-inch trout? Not Colorado's Aspen or Vail. Not Park City, Utah, or Stowe, Vt. The nation's leading snow playgrounds all have their respective virtues. Most of what Sun Valley has came from nature, the rest came from Hollywood. Together, they make for an American original.
There are skiers in chartreuse outfits who think Hemingway is some sort of cologne, or an intermediate run off the No. 1 chair -- which it is. But it is those who understand what the novelist was looking for when he came to southern Idaho -- the isolation, the way the light pivots at dusk, the cottonwoods along the Big Wood River -- who return to Sun Valley no matter where the new magnets of winter may be. 
 The blessings of Sun Valley -- long, cloudless days amid the sharp walls of the Sawtooth Mountains -- can also be its curse. The area sits in the middle of a sort of weather doughnut: storms dump heavy snow on all the surrounding peaks, but tend to pass over Sun Valley. As a result, the area suffers from frequent droughts, and the last two years have been among the worst. During a visit in early February, barely more than a foot of snow covered the slopes. Typically, a good bit of snow will arrive in early December, followed by a dry spell, and then another load late in February. In between natural snowfalls, the resort relies heavily on manmade snow. But the snowmaking equipment can only cover so much terrain, so that in dry years, much of the big, south-facing bowls are unskiable.
To get around the temperamental fits of nature, Sun Valley has become, with considerable success, a four-season resort. Last summer the area seemed more crowded -- with golfers, bikers, fly-fishermen and hikers -- than it did during a visit this winter.
Created in a great burst of construction and imagination in 1936, the resort is not very old by European standards. But it has been around more than half as long as Idaho has been a state. The Shoshone and Bannock Indians wintered in the valley, which, despite its altitude of nearly 6,000 feet above sea level, boasts a mild climate, with hot springs bubbling up around the breach cut by the Big Wood River. Miners chased the Indians off their land, scrounged silver and galena ore from the mountains, and then left when the strikes went dry and the economy went bust. They were followed by sheepherders, many of them from the Basque provinces of Spain, who grazed their herds in the high meadows of the Sawtooths, then shipped them by rail.
Without the railroad, there would have been no resort. W. Averell Harriman, the diplomat, former New York governor and an American aristocrat if ever there was one, was born in 1891 into a Union Pacific Railroad fortune. By age 18, he was on the railroad's board of directors, and looking around for something more to do with the company's tracks into the West. Harriman was greatly influenced by the Swiss resorts at St. Moritz, site of the 1928 Olympics, and at Gstaad. His idea was to build something of similiar grandeur in America. In 1932, he hired Felix Schaffgotsch, an Austrian count, and sent him off on a journey to find a place for the perfect American ski resort. The setting had to be pristine, with high mountains, ample snow and good weather. And, of course, it had to be close to a Union Pacific rail line.
The count visited Mount Rainier near Seattle and Mount Hood near Portland, Ore. -- dismissing them both for their excessive snow and glaciation, and proximity to big population centers. Then he trudged through Utah, Colorado and Wyoming. Aspen he liked, but he thought its base altitude of more than 8,000 feet would be too hard on the sea-level-dwelling Easterners who would be the resort's primary customers. At last, an Idaho highway employee lured him into Ketchum, the old mining town and sheep center in Sun Valley. During the count's visit, it snowed heavily at night, and was bright and blue by day. The slopes were steep and open.
After three days, the count wired Harriman from Sun Valley: "This combines more delightful features than any place I have seen in the United States, Switzerland or Austria for a winter resort." Harriman, after a visit, shared the count's enthusiasm. He purchased a large section of the valley for $10 an acre. In the field rose a $1.5 million lodge; it looks like wood, but it was cast in concrete, from cedar beams that left a grain imprint, then painted dark brown. On nearby Dollar Mountain, the smaller of two skiable areas in Sun Valley, Harriman built the world's first chairlift, a single-seat lift patterned after a hoist used to haul bananas into ships' holds.
He had his resort, at the end of a Union Pacific Rail line, but he needed people. Idaho is among the least populous states. Hollywood was the key. In 1936, Sun Valley's first year in operation, pictures of Errol Flynn, Clark Cable, Claudette Colbert and others frolicking at the new resort flooded newspapers -- a campaign created by Steve Hannagan, a public relations whiz who launched Miami Beach. Sun Valley was an instant success and was kept that way by movies like "Sun Valley Serenade" with Sonja Henie in 1941.
Harriman died in 1986, at the age of 95. The family sold the resort in 1964, yet they continued to visit, staying in their cottages next to the Lodge. Harriman spent part of his last winter in the valley. Pictures of him, a tall and attractive man, are everywhere, posing with glamorous women or looking over the edge of his skis from a cliff.
Although the valley has changed dramatically over the years, with excessive condominium development and sprawling housing tracts, the resort exudes a timeless quality. Harriman's original hotel, the Sun Valley Lodge, has more than 500 rooms, a large, outdoor pool, and lobby space rich with antiques and windows overlooking the outdoor skating rink. One organization, the Sun Valley Company, runs the Lodge, a smaller hotel called the Sun Valley Inn, condominiums, a retail mall, and operates the lift concession on Bald Mountain.

WITH the exception of small, beginner runs on Dollar Mountain, all of the skiing is done on Baldy, as it's known, a 9,150-foot mountain with more than 1,300 acres of groomed runs and trails. The skiing area is about a mile from the resort village, reachable by a free shuttle bus that operates during daylight hours. There is no night skiing on Baldy. With 13 chairlifts, including 3 high-speed quad lifts, long lines are a rarity. One chair, the Challenger lift, has a vertical rise of 3,144 feet.
When the mountain has ample snow, it seems to live up to the early booster slogan: "God's own choice for a ski resort." The view from the top, at the endless fangs of the Sawtooth Range, is wonderful, free of the urban smog that sometimes creeps up to the skies of such places as Snowbird, Utah, and Mammoth Mountain, California. There are no great cliffs, or sudden drops, no long flat stretches. Instead, runs spill off in gradual descents, the south-facing ones more open and challenging, the other sides evenly groomed and with swaths cut through the trees. Most are intermediate.
Without adequate snow cover, the bowls are closed and skiers are restricted to the runs facing north and east. When the snow-making machines are running, they are noisy, breaking the still of an otherwise fine winter day. Four restaurants are open on the mountain. The coziest, with a huge stone fireplace, ancient wood skis crossed above the mantle, and good hot chili, is the Roundhouse, at the base of the Christmas Chairlift. Dining tables on an outdoor deck look down at the valley, nearly 2,000 feet below.
Twenty-five miles of cross-country ski trails, manicured and marked by degree of difficulty, begin just a few steps from the Sun Valley Lodge. Some of the trails are tame and predictable; others lead into the woods, offering a sense of adventure and isolation. For more open skiing, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, north of Ketchum, is full of trails and meadows.
Apres-ski, even in early afternoon, the choices are considerable. Horse-pulled sleigh rides glide over the snow-topped golf course or through hayfields. The ice-skating rink behind the Lodge is large and fast. The big circular pool next to the building, heated to 105 degrees, is a cocktail-hour favorite.
The Lodge Dining Room, designed more than 50 years ago as the elegant centerpiece of the resort, is of the Big Night Out dining school: low lights, chandeliers, crisp and bow-tied waiters, music for dancing between courses or cocktails. Idaho wildlife -- venison in wine sauce, broiled duck, stuffed quail -- are favorites.
Depending on the visitor's view of hunting, the numerous pictures of Gary Cooper and Hemingway bagging game either enhance or deter appetite. (A simple memorial to Hemingway is next to Trail Creek not far from the golf course. He is buried next to his wife, Mary, in Ketchum's only cemetery.)
Where once this resort would have been considered a singles playground, pioneered by Harriman himself, who married three times, it has followed the demographic trends in recent years and is now trying to attract families. At most of the hotels and condominiums in the valley, up to two children, no older than 17, stay free and get free lift tickets if registered with their parents. The offer is not good for peak periods, such as Christmas and spring break.
Ketchum, the town that preceded Sun Valley, at the base of Bald Mountain, has undergone considerable growing pains in the last 10 years. Such places as the Casino Club, a bar where local people used to play poker and drink whisky from shot glasses, are surrounded by more than a dozen art galleries and boutiques. Still, unlike Aspen, where fur coats are ubiquitous and hamburgers can cost $10 or more, Ketchum is not pretentious.
Celebrities still abound. Clint Eastwood has a house in the valley, and Bruce Willis is completing his home, south of Ketchum near Hailey. Nobody seems to make much of a fuss over them, with an occasional exception. Residents are still abuzz over a recent appearance in a local bar by three of the movie world's biggest musclemen -- Eastwood, Charles Bronson and Arnold Schwartzenegger -- who walked in together, cutting a swath through the crowded lounge. If Harriman were still alive, he might have been accused of staging the event himself.
 
STOPS ON A VISIT TO THE VALLEY
 
Getting There
Train service to Ketchum has long since ended. Two airlines, Horizon Air and SkyWest, a commuter carrier of Delta, fly directly to Hailey, 11 miles south of Sun Valley, from Salt Lake City, Boise, Idaho, or Seattle. Driving from Boise to Ketchum, on good roads, takes about two and a half hours. There is free bus service throughout the Sun Valley area, from 7:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M.
 
Hotels
Standard rooms at the Sun Valley Lodge begin at $125 a night and go up to $275 for parlor suites. Children stay free during selected parts of the year. Rooms at the nearby Sun Valley Inn begin at $100, rising to $190 for a family suite. Condominiums are from $115 a night for a studio to $390 for four bedrooms. Reservations and information: 800-786-8259.
The other big resort in the valley is Elkhorn, (800) 635-9356, near the base of Dollar Mountain. Open the year round, Elkhorn is built around a golf course and tennis courts spread over 3,000 acres. Standard room rates begin at $78, a deluxe goes for $138. Condominiums begin at $118 and go up to $258 for four bedrooms.
The Tyrolean Lodge, (800) 333-7912, run by the Best Western Company, is close to the ski runs, at the outskirts of Ketchum. Rooms with a view of Bald Mountain cost around $70.
 
Dining
The Lodge Dining Room, (208) 622-2150, overlooking the outdoor skating rink from the second floor of the Sun Valley Lodge, has not tinkered with its half-century-old formula much. Fish and game, heavy on French sauces, are the menu highlights, with a good wine list. Dinner is $80 to $100 for two, with wine. There's music for dancing.
The Sawtooth Mountains are the last place one would expect to find fresh seafood, but the Saltwater Grill, in Ketchum, (208) 726-5083, has defied logistics and presents a wide-ranging fresh list every night, weather permitting. Oysters, clams and mussels are available. Dinners of salmon, scallops, yellow fin tuna or shellfish run $50 to $70 for two, with wine.
Usually packed, and a bit loud is the Sawtooth Club, (208) 726-5233, on Main Street in Ketchum. The first floor is cozy, jammed with people milling around the big fireplace. The second floor is quieter. Specialties here are lamb, steaks and prime rib, cooked over mesquite grills. Dinner for two with wine is about $45.
 
Night and Day
 Two nightspots are always popular. Whiskey Jacques, on Main Street in Ketchum, has live music, and attracts a generally younger crowd. The Fabulous Vuarnettes, an all-female cabaret-type show, plays Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at the Elkhorn Resort's Showplace Saloon.
As for the slopes, the price of a day's all-lifts ticket has been dropped to $34 this season because of reduced snow cover. -- T. E.

HEADLINE: Miami's Caribbean Enclaves

BYLINE: By JOANN BIONDI; JOANN BIONDI is editor of the "Insight Guide to Miami," scheduled to be published in March.

 BODY:
LIKE most ethnic enclaves of big cities elsewhere, Miami's Little Havana and Little Haiti are classic juxta positions of immigrant optimism and inner-city decay. Simmering with promise for a paradise found, they are America's modern melting pot, the new Ellis Island. In both the food is saturated with spices, the music hip-grinding good and the people resourceful and proud. For the tourist, a foray into these neighborhoods offers an intimate and eye-opening encounter with cultures determined to maintain the traditions of their homelands.
But unlike the pastel-pretty Art Deco district of south Miami Beach, Little Havana and Little Haiti are not tourist destinations of carefree abandon. They are real city neighborhoods with real city problems, and crime is a reality. During the day both areas are safe because the streets are filled with people. At night the main artery of Little Havana warrants no worry but meandering down the side streets should be avoided. The same holds true for Little Haiti: evening escapades should be limited to a particular restaurant or nightclub excursion. 
 Little Havana has for decades been the initial resting spot for Cuban refugees. In the 1960's several hundred thousand Cubans fleeing the Communist takeover settled in the city. These early immigrants, who were the bulk of Cuba's entrepreneurial and professional sectors, used their skills to transform the dying areas that were once known as Riverside and Shenandoah into a bustling exile center. Of the approximately two million people that now make up what is called Greater Miami, over 500,000 of them are of Cuban descent.
Today Little Havana remains an immigrant's dream -- Spanish is the language of choice, home-cooked food is abundant and the network for finding work is easily accessible. Catholic shrines decorate the front lawns of neatly painted houses as roosters scurry about in backyards. Salsa music, which permeates the evening air, seems an integral part of the collective unconscious. The neighborhood is 27 blocks long and 24 blocks wide. The main street that cuts through the heart of the area is Calle Ocho, or, as Anglos call it, Eighth Street. Between 27th and First Avenues on Eighth Street you can find just about every aspect of Cuban culture common to Havana in the 1950's.
Tiny cafeterias that sell cafe Cubano, thimble-sized cups of coffee that are served sweet and swampy and absolutely fresh, can be found on each block. At the McDonald's restaurant you can even order a cup of cafe Cubano to go with your Huevo McMuffin. Shops that specialize in lace and taffeta dresses for quinces, parties for girls' 15th birthdays, buzz with mothers shopping for the best. Magic shops sell comical tricks for adults and pinatas, paper animals stuffed with toys, for children.
Botanicas, pharmacies that cater to practitioners of the Afro-Caribbean religions of santeria and voodoo, are busy with serious shoppers. Although they are now found throughout the city, botanicas are most common in Little Havana and Little Haiti. Their shelves are stocked with serenity salves, black candles, fake monkey heads, herb extracts, virility pills and voodoo dolls. Visitors are welcome but making fun of the merchandise should be avoided.
For a nostalgic experience of Havana circa 1955, stop in at the Credito cigar factory on Eighth Street near 11th Avenue. The largest factory producing hand-made cigars in Miami, El Credito was founded in Cuba in 1907 and still has dozens of workers who hand wrap, roll and press those potent-smelling stogies.
Surprisingly, Cuban food has a cold-weather heartiness about it and usually comes with a good dousing of garlic juice. Meals often feature pork and beef, with plenty of rice and beans and fried bananas or yucca on the side. Along with the many restaurants and sandwich shops that draw outsiders to the neighborhood, there are several ice-cream parlors, like King's Cream near 18th Avenue, that specialize in exotic flavors of coconut, mango and mamey -- a rich, sweet tropical fruit. Bakeries sell flaky guava pastries and cream-soaked sweet cakes for a treat. Gurapo, pure sugar cane juice, is sold fresh.
For some campy live theater with a political slant, try one of the weekend shows at Teatro Marti or Bellas Artes. Both offer performances in Spanish starring local Cuban actors in shows that range from Shakespearean dramas to a humorous farce about the most hated man in the neighborhood -- Fidel Castro.
 CALLE OCHO is where Little Havana holds an annual Sunday street party that has become an outrageous afternoon bacchanalia. It is billed as the largest Hispanic street party in the United States. The party is the culmination of a 10-day event known as Carnaval Miami, which will run this year from March 1 to 10. The March 10 party, called simply Calle Ocho, winds its way down 23 blocks of Eighth Street. Other events in the festival, which celebrates the city's Hispanic heritage, include a masquerade ball, a Latin and jazz concert at the Orange Bowl, a parade and an eight-kilometer run.
At the corner of Eighth Street and Cuban Memorial Boulevard (13th Avenue) stands the Bay of Pigs Monument, which pays tribute to the men who lost their lives in the foiled invasion of Cuba in 1961. Here, young schoolchildren come to place flowers and say a prayer for a homeland they never knew. Nearby is Maximo Gomez Park, locally known as Domino Park. Every day the fenced-in courtyard fills up by about 10 A.M. with domino players who take part in games that often erupt into arm-flailing arguments. A park official enforces a custom that restricts admittance to men over 55, but tourists are welcomed in for a look.
The lively conversations in the park, as in most of Little Havana, are often highly political and passionate. Anti-Castroism, anti-Communism and anti-anything-non-Republican is the popular feeling. Recently, Miami commissioners listened to developers who proposed a name change from Little Havana to the Latin Quarter. The meeting erupted in pandemonium when Little Havana Cubans declared the proposal an action instigated "by Communist pigs."
This territorial outlook of Cubans for Little Havana is warranted. At Woodlawn Park Cemetery on Eighth Street and 32d Avenue, three former presidents of Cuba are buried as is the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
Toward the east end of Little Havana, on the banks of the Miami River, is Jose Marti Park.
NAMED for the revered Cuban writer and patriot, the 10-acre park has an elaborate maze of red-brick walkways that lead down to the river, where rusty old freighters piled high with bicycles await their journeys to Haiti. Many of them are believed stolen from the streets of Miami, where bicyle thievery is rampant. A dramatic view of the Miami skyline serves as a backdrop. The park is full of schoolchildren in the daytime and poses no threat to tourists. At night its character becomes slightly menacing, and the park should be avoided.
Across the street from the park, surrounded by a high wrought-iron fence, is a cluster of historic wooden buildings that stand as a harbinger of hope of good things to come to the neighborhood. The Miami River Inn, which opened last April, is the personal mission of a Miami preservationist, Sallye Jude, who believes the rundown area of east Little Havana will soon see a gentrification of sorts and serve as a center for cultural and heritage-based tourism in Miami.
The yellow and green two-story buildings, which were built in 1904, have 41 rooms full fluffy pastel fabrics and authentic antiques. Frosted-glass street lamps line the property, which is under constant surveillance by private guards. Although surrounded by apartments that are in less than good condition, the inn can serve as a comfortable home base for exploring Little Havana while offering an historic environment not common in Miami.
North of Little Havana is Miami's other ethnic enclave. While the charms of Little Haiti may be a bit more subtle than those of Little Havana, the neighborhood is well worth a visit. Like the vivid scenes in a primitive Haitian painting, brilliant hues brighten up these inner city streets. Buildings are painted the primary colors of blue, red and yellow. Women wearing colorful cotton dresses saunter to the market balancing straw baskets atop their heads. Children jump rope while counting in Creole as the energetic rhythms of Haitian music blares from boom-box stereos.
Many having fled their poverty-stricken homeland in leaky wooden boats, Miami's Haitians, estimated to total about 50,000, have none of the economic clout that the Cuban community has, but is just as hard-working and hopeful about the possibilities of a better life. When Marjorie Vincent, the daughter of Haitian-born parents, was crowned Miss America last September, Little Haiti bubbled with a joyous commotion -- the American dream was now theirs to behold.
The main commercial artery of Little Haiti's approximately 200 square blocks lies along N.E. Second Avenue. At the intersection of N.E. 54th Street is the Haiti-Miami Market where you'll find the Haitian delicacy of fresh goat heads along with the essential rice and beans sold from huge wooden bins. At the Botanica d'Haiti across the street, the sweet tang of incense hangs in the air and leaves from the Jericho plant are soaked in a bowl for good luck. Special elixirs are stored in the back behind a beaded curtain that clatters in the breeze.
The colorful focal point of Little Haiti these days is the Caribbean Marketplace at 59th Street.The structure, which this month was awarded the 1991 National Honor Award by the American Institute of Architects, was designed by a Haitian-born Miami architect, Charles Harrison Pawley, to resemble the Iron Market of Port-au-Prince and spur tourism in the area. With its gabled tin roof that glistens in the sun and its colors of yellow, blue, green and orange, it stands as a spectacle of grandeur among shabby neighboring storefronts. Although maintained in tiptop condition, most of its airy stalls have not yet been rented. A few vendors are selling handcrafts, produce, records and clothing. A United Nations development group is trying to set up an organization that would import goods from Haiti to be sold at the market.
A few blocks away is the Toussaint Louverture Elementary School, named after the Haitian hero who led a peasant uprising against the French. Pierre Toussaint's descendants live in a home nearby. Les Cousins Book and Record Store, near 79th Street, has the largest assortment of Haitian compas, Guadeloupean zouk and calypso in Miami, along with a fair selection of Haitian paintings and wood carvings. Although many accomplished artists live in the area, there are few places in Little Haiti that sell good quality Haitian art because most local Haitians would not buy it and few tourists ever visit the neighborhood.
On Saturday street-corner vendors set up impromptu markets in various places and the action resembles the theatrical haggling of an outdoor Caribbean market. On Sunday much of the Haitian community goes to the Church of Notre Dame for an early morning mass. Women sing in the choir as little boys wearing high-collar Haitian bow ties sit still through it all. A local band provides African rhythms that merge with French melodies and the entire congregation joins in.

 THE restaurants of Little Haiti are small and rustic and offer inexpensive meals of traditional Haitian cuisine. Griot (fried pork), lambi (stewed conch) and rum-tainted oxtail stew are classics. At most area restaurants you can almost always find Haitians gathering for a dinner and a discussion on the politics of their country. And Little Haiti nightclubs that pulsate with live music have become trendy dance spots for young in-the-know Miamians.
One of the most delightful aspects of a visit to Little Haiti or Little Havana is the sensation of being totally enveloped by the Caribbean cultures of these two island nations. You are bemused by the menus, you fumble with the languages and instantly feel as if you are the foreigner.
 
AROUND LITTLE HAVANA
The neighborhood lies within the area of N.W. Seventh Street to the north, S.W. 17th Street to the south, S.W. First Avenue to the east and S.W. 27th Avenue to the west. The annual Calle Ocho street festival is scheduled for March 10. More information: 644-8888; the area code for Miami is 305.
 
Getting Around
The Historical Museum of Southern Florida (375-1625) will offer two walking tours of Little Havana this year, on March 9 (covering the area's western part) and April 20 (covering the eastern part). Other tours may be added. The tours, conducted by a local historian, Dr. Paul George, cost $13 a person and begin at 10 A.M.
 
Places to Stay
Miami River Inn, 118 S.W. South River Drive (325-0045), is an historic bed and breakfast inn with a Jacuzzi and pool. Rooms are decorated with antiques and local memorabilia. Most have private bathrooms. Rates for a double room with breakfast are $60 to $80 a night.
 
Places to Eat
Calle Ocho has dozens of dining establishments that range from mom-and-pop cafeterias to elegant lace-tablecloth restaurants. Many tend to be loud and colorful, especially on weekends, when entire families gather for a meal. All serve very large portions.
Versailles, 3555 S.W. Eighth Street (444-0240), is the quintessential Cuban experience. Crystal chandeliers, wall-to-wall mirrors and a wonderfully gaudy atmosphere. Try some fried plantain chips, pork chunks in garlic-laden mojo sauce and a pitcher of sangria. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Dinner for two with wine about $25.
La Esquina de Tejas, 101 S.W. 12th Avenue (545-5341), still boasts about the day Ronald Reagan stopped in for a bite to eat while on the campaign trail. Meals are home-cooked hearty with a menu that changes daily. Delicious black bean soup and traditional picadillo, a ground beef dish with green olives served on a bed of rice. Lunch and dinner $20 for two with wine. Centro Vasco, 2235 S.W. Eighth Street (643-9606), is a local gathering spot for successful Cuban immigrants.

HEADLINE: CORRESPONDENT'S CHOICE;
In Chile, a Rural Hacienda, Family Style

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN; SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, former chief of The Times's Buenos Aires bureau, is now based in San Salvador as chief of the Central America bureau.

 BODY:
ON awakening in an antique bed and gazing up at what must be 20-foot-high ceilings in Hacienda los Lingues, I told myself that the vast adobe house and its surrounding 10,000 acres proved that there had been a time when foreign correspondents were properly appreciated. The hacienda, now a guesthouse and working farm 75 miles south of Santiago, was the gift of Carlos V of Spain to a man who chronicled the advance of the conquistadors through the southern reaches of the New World in the first half of the 16th century.
German Claro Lira and his wife, Maria Elena Lyon de Claro, who emerged into the garden to greet their arriving guests, are the modern-day lord and lady of the manor, which has been passed down through Mr. Claro's family since the land was granted to Juan Jufre y Montero del Aguila in 1545. 
 "This is a family that has never had a lot of money but has always had beautiful homes," Mrs. Claro told me, giving a clue as to why Los Lingues began inviting paying guests into its well-worn splendor 10 years ago.
Set in a rich agricultural valley a two-hour drive from Santiago along the four-lane Pan American Highway, Los Lingues -- named for a Chilean tree -- is what she describes as "a place to learn to relax, to read, listen to music, look at the birds, take walks. Most guests tell us the hardest thing to get used to here is the quiet."
This is a place where peacocks roam free in the patio between the long wings of the main house, where you may eat on a table set under the trees or in the cellar near the wine or in the ornate main dining room with antique French crystal and porcelain.
It is also a working farm, where visitors are free to visit the large fruit and vegetable operation or take in one of the auctions of the Aculeo horses that Mr. Claro breeds. Some families hold reunions or observe anniversaries here, and corporations send their top executives to the hacienda for a few days of deep thought and planning.
The most serious exertion, and worth doing, is a horse ride. On a sunny morning in early summer -- summer is December into March in the southern hemisphere -- I rode up into the Andes foothills that begin just behind the farm buildings with Juan Alvarez, one of the handlers who work with Mr. Claro.
Although nearly 3,000 miles long, Chile is never more than about 200 miles wide and at this point the land mass covers only about 80 miles between the Pacific Ocean and the Argentine border, defined by the Andes Mountains. Although farther to the north the Andes form towering peaks that reach above 20,000 feet, in the area of Los Lingues and farther south they are wider but not so high.
Juan Alvarez assured me that for those with stamina it was possible to go up and over the hills and mountains all the way to the border, a distance of about 30 miles from the farm. But I was content with the view across the valley filled with fruit trees and grain fields and with a taste of the crisp, dry mountain air.
Mr. Claro claims his Aculeos, which now number about 150, are the best horses in South America and traces their bloodlines back to the Moors, who took the ancestors of the Aculeos to Spain in the eighth century. Used for sporting competitions throughout South America, they bring $10,000 to $20,000 at auction.
The slightly stocky Aculeos are described by Mr. Claro as first cousins of the Lippizaners of Vienna's Spanish Riding School. The blood link seems obvious in the light gray coloring that is common among the Aculeos. Many also have a black stripe down the center of their backs. However, Aculeos also come in almost any other color.
On weekends, cowboys -- known as huasos in Chile -- lead the Aculeos through displays of fancy footwork in a corral beside the stables.
In addition, on special occasions or for groups that have made reservations, there are shows by Chilean folk dancers and wine tastings. The Claros have drawn up plans for tennis courts and a swimming pool, which they hope to have functioning by the next South American summer.
The senior Claros live at the hacienda year round. Mr. Claro runs the farm with its nearly 300 workers, and Mrs. Claro oversees a staff of 30 at the guesthouse. German, their older son, runs the office in Santiago, often coming to the farm on weekends.
The main house of Los Lingues, with its two-foot-thick adobe walls, is basically as it was remodeled 200 years ago, with later alterations for plumbing and electricity, plus restoration after the 1985 earthquake. A small part of the house dates from about 100 years earlier, and the family chapel, available for weddings, was built in 1650 and is the oldest part of the hacienda.
Mr. Claro recalled that during his childhood and youth, the family lived primarily in Santiago and used the hacienda as a summer and weekend house. But it was falling into disrepair because of its size and the cost of maintenance. When the property passed to his generation, his siblings were not interested in sharing the upkeep, so he took it over. In 1966, he began restoration, and in 1981, after going through a battle over agrarian reform and a national economic depression, opened it to the public.

EACH of the 16 rooms and suites -- 12 in the main house, 4 in an adjacent house -- is an individual experience. Heated by wood-burning stoves during the winter -- sweet smelling eucalyptus logs are stacked outside the door -- rooms in the main house are furnished with antiques that have come to rest in Los Lingues over a century or more. There is likely to be Champagne or a bowl of fruit waiting on a wide window ledge or atop an antique dresser. Rooms in the guesthouse are furnished more rustically but have modern bathrooms.
Much of the furniture, like a china cabinet in the main dining room, came from Paris. Some favorite dinner plates were made in 1867 in France, but the label is too faded to reveal the maker. The silverware shows years of family use. Much of the crystal is Baccarat.
The silver roosters in the center of the dining table are said to have been stolen by Chileans when they marched on Lima, the capital of neighboring Peru, during the War of the Pacific in 1879.
Lunch at Los Lingues, normally served on wooden tables in the wine cellar, is informal and features typical Chilean rural dishes, like Mrs. Claro's recipe for pastel de choclo, a casserole combining corn, chopped beef and chicken.
At dinner -- at 9 o'clock -- the Claros join their guests around the formal dining table for a meal that is usually Continental with Chilean touches. The main course the night I stayed there was corvina, a fish common in the South Pacific waters along the Chilean coast, done in a fine herb sauce, accompanied by white and red Chilean wines, which are ranked among the world's finest. Dessert, fruit from the surrounding fields, was served on the remaining plates of a set of French porcelain that was largely destroyed when a cabinet fell in the last earthquake.
 
BEING A GUEST AT A HACIENDA
 
Getting There
Los Lingues is 75 miles south of Santiago on the Pan American Highway in the vicinity of Pelequen, then 3 miles east on a gravel road. It can be reached by car, rented at the Santiago airport, or with Executive Limousine Service, 2937 Avenida Vitacura, Santiago, which takes passengers from the airport to Los Lingues in sedans for about $100 each way, plus tax, or in a bar-equipped Lincoln Town Car for about $200 each way. The phone number, dialed from the United States, is (011-56-2) 232-8908.
 
Rates and Information
An overnight stay at Los Lingues ranges from $90 to $360 a person, depending on the type of accommodation -- suite or room -- and number of meals. The rate is the same for single or double occupancy. Breakfast is American style. An hour's horseback ride with a guide is included in the daily rate. An 18 percent tax is added to all bills.
Visitors not staying overnight pay $44 a person for a tour of the house and stables, a horse show and lunch with wine. Tax and transportation are extra. A wine-tasting session is offered for an additional $18.
The office of Los Lingues in Santiago can be reached from the United States by dialing(011-56-2) 223-3518 or (011-56-2) 225-0838. It can arrange transportation by auto, limousine or minibus. -- S. C.

Cracking the Straitjacket on Expansions

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THIS year will be a good one for turtles, says Marc Beige. His family-owned business, Rubie's Costume Company, makes costumes of all sorts, not to mention masks, wigs, carnival heads and other holiday paraphernalia. The popularity of teen-age Ninja mutant turtles suggests that turtle outfits will be a big item for Halloween.
That could also be good news for the Richmond Hill section of Queens, where the main Rubie's plant is a beehive of cutting and sewing activity under the Jamaica Avenue el station at 120th Street. Mannequins attired as witches and Draculas and clowns glare down at visitors to the first-floor retail shop. But the real action is backstage. About 200 production people toil on four floors of a 50,000-square-foot building. 
 Not enough space, Rubie's decided in 1986. It took three years, but last December the company's site and other land in the vicinity was rezoned to allow a far higher density -- a floor area ratio (F.A.R.) of five, meaning five square feet of space for every square foot of land, instead of the one F.A.R. of the existing zone. By that time Rubie's had leased a building in Jamaica to fulfill part of its need for expansion space.
Nevertheless, the Rubie's experience directs attention to one of New York City's perennially knotty zoning issues -- the need of small manufacturing companies, often in Queens, Brooklyn or the Bronx, to provide themselves with expansion space.
Even when their buildings are in manufacturing zones, residential neighbors are fearful of traffic build-up and other problems. Their objections tend to restict the modest rezonings that would permit as-of-right expansions.
There is no doubt of the eagerness of most city and borough officials to support these expansions when neighborhoods don't object. In the Rubie's Costume case, the Department of City Planning considered higher density so appropriate that it took advantage of the initial application to propose a wider-scale rezoning.
The planners proposed that about 218,000 square feet of manufacturing land in a triangular area off Jamaica Avenue, including the 33,000-square-foot Rubie's lot, be included in the rezoning.
The rezoning was eventually cut back to 118,000 square feet. Representatives of Community Board 9 in Queens were unwilling to open the door too widely to as-of-right development.
But in the end the community and Borough President Claire Shulman were supportive. The cost to the applicant in fees and studies was about $100,000.
In 1986, the city provided specifically for an industrial-use special permit, intended to allow a shortcut to small expansions of industrial uses. Applications are made to the Board of Standards and Appeals. But these permits are available only for expansions of up to 2,500 square feet, or 45 percent of additional floor area up to 10,000 square feet, whichever is greater. Many companies need more new space than that.
The underlying zoning problem is that floor-area ratios are so restrictive in light-manufacturing zones that even modest expansions or additions are usually problematic in older buildings. In New York City there are plenty of those.
The most common light-manufacturing zone is M-1-1. It permits only a 1 F.A.R. as of right. Many older buildings already exceed that density. The M-1-1 zones are usually found near residential districts.
AS much as 80 percent of the land zoned for manufacturing in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx is believed to be in the M-1-1 category -- much of it near mass transportation. Economic development officials say, for example, that there are many small knitwear enterprises in the Ridgewood section of Queens that cannot expand even modestly because of this zoning.
"We have never solved the problem of on-site expansion," said Kenneth Wallach, land-use director of the city's Office of Business Development. On-site expansions are usually what serve small manufacturing businesses most. And most manufacturing in New York City is done by small businesses.
Communities like to see applications approved on a case-by-case basis. That introduces issues of time, cost and uncertainty that are often sufficient to untrack manufacturing expansions before they start. The more successful the company, the more likely that success will force it to move.
In the Department of City Planning a broad study of manufacturing zones across the city has been launched under the direction of Eric Kober, director of housing and economic development. It is intended to provide a policy direction for matters that move through the land-use review process and is to be completed by the end of the year.
Important as such studies may be, they will not address the immediate problems of the small companies. Their usual approach is to seek a variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals. This typically costs about $30,000 in fees and comes more readily than an areawide rezoning, if it comes at all. But the applicant must be able to meet several findings, including economic hardship and the absence of adverse neighborhood impact.
Tax incentives for these industrial expansions are not lacking. Under the Industrial and Commercial Incentives Program, renewed for a year by the City Council in January, companies outside central Manhattan get a significant exemption from property taxes attributable to the assessed value of the improvement -- 100 percent for 13 years, phasing out over the subsequent nine years at a rate of 10 percent a year.
As for Rubie's, economic conditions in the costume market make it uncertain now when the expansion will go forward, or how large it will be. Its current facilities on the 33,000 square-foot Richmond Hill site add up to 52,000 square feet, including 45,000 square feet in an existing five-story building.
The original plan was to construct a six-story addition at the rear, demolishing a small portion of the existing building and winding up with a total of 130,000 square feet. Current plans are more modest: a six-story addition that involves demolition of a section of the current building. It will give the company a net addition of 40,000 square feet, doubling the present capacity.
This will mean about a one-third gain in jobs in Richmond Hill, said Mr. Beige. The company also has facilities in Jamaica and in Nassau County. It began as a novelty store on Woodhaven Boulevard in Queens in 1950.
ACCORDING to Sheldon Lobel, the lawyer who represented Rubie's in the rezoning action, a traffic study done to support the application showed that more than 80 percent of the workers at the Richmond Hill plant use mass transportation to get to work. The presence of older manufacturing buildings close to mass transit strengthens the case for areawide rezoning to raise floor-area ratios in manufacturing districts. The M-1-4 districts, for example, allows a 2 FAR, but it is infrequently mapped.
Mr. Lobel said that the Planning Department's positive reception to the Rubie's application encouraged the company to seek a rezoning rather than a variance.
Another company weighing these issues at present is Quality Braid, 50 years in New York City and described by its lawyer, Scott Mollen, partner in the firm of Graubard Mollen Horowitz Pomeranz & Shapiro, as the largest sequin manufacturer in the country. Quality Braid is in a one-story building at 34-20 45th Street in Long Island City. It employs 350 people there.
The company needs to expand. One possibility is to add a floor, about doubling its space. That would require a rezoning. Mr. Mollen has been talking to officials in the Office of Business Development.
"I anticipate a rezoning attempt would get support," Mr. Mollen said. But it would also take a year to 18 months, with no guarantee of success.

HEADLINE: Weicker's Budget Demands Austerity

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
IN the instant statewide debate that erupted following Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s budget address on Feb. 13, all eyes were on his proposal for an income tax and the other measures to overhaul Connecticut's tax system. But some of the Governor's suggestions for changes in spending could have an even greater impact on state residents.
The $7.48 billion spending plan would close a projected $2.4 billion revenue gap for the year that begins on July 1 by splitting it -- $1.2 billion in higher taxes and $1.2 billion in reduced spending. 
 The tax changes seem easier to grasp. The sales tax would be cut from 8 percent to 4.25 percent; the corporate-profits tax would be reduced from 13.8 percent to 11.5 percent, and the current income tax on dividends, interest and capital gains would be eliminated. The reveune would be made up by a 6 percent tax on all personal income of more than $25,000 for a couple filing jointly and $12,500 for an individual. The income tax would become the state's biggest revenue source, generating about $2.1 billion a year.
The proposed spending cuts, by contrast, are spread across every state agency -- a dizzying list of reductions and reapportionments that add up to a picture of a state in deep retrenchment. Few programs are left entirely unscathed. Many would be eliminated entirely.
Riders of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, for example, would see fares go up by an average of 15 percent on July 1 to compensate for the $8.5 million reduction in the state's subsidy.
Poor families would see their welfare allowances frozen with no adjustment for the cost of living, and students at the University of Connecticut would pay a 3 percent tuition surcharge.
Some small state parks would reduce public access, and one -- the American Shakespeare Park in Stratford -- would close entirely, along with seven local offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles.
State aid to many communities would be slashed, with effects that promise to ripple through local governments in the form of reduced services, layoffs, and higher property taxes. Some 1,885 state jobs would also be eliminated, including a projected 1,100 layoffs. Nearly every page in the 846-page budget document, which legislators received last week, reveals some line item that speaks of making do with less. The Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, for instance, usually receives about $20,000 a year for printing pamphlets and other documents. The proposal for next year: $10,200.
Under the Governor's plan, investigators from the Department of Consumer Protection will not be traveling out of state much next year to uncover consumer fraud. The department's travel budget would be cut by nearly 80 percent, to $4,115 from $20,431 this year.
"As far as I can tell, everybody is going to feel some impact from this budget," said Matthew E. Melmed, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Human Services, a nonprofit research group. "My principal concern is that the people who can least afford to absorb that impact need to be protected."
But as members of the General Assembly began poring over the budget document, the balancing act implicit in Mr. Weicker's budget also began to emerge: with unpopular tax changes measured against unpopular spending cuts, does it make sense to restore money for programs that would then require even greater tax increases?
 
'I Support the Bottom Line'
 Leaders of the legislature's Appropriations Committee, which oversees state spending, have already decided that the total amount of cuts will not change. The committee's co-chairman, Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr., a Democrat from New Britain, said that he had informed members of the committee that they should feel free to suggest putting back money into any program, but that every suggestion must be accompanied by a proposal for an equal cut somewhere else.
"I support the bottom line," Mr. Harper said. "It's tough enough on the revenue side to sell what Weicker has in the works. And if you restore the cuts, then you've got to raise that much more in taxes."
Some lawmakers have accused the Weicker administration of boasting about cuts that are not yet nailed down. State employees have been asked to accept $400 million in pay and benefit reductions, including a one-year pay freeze. The $1.2 billion in cuts presented to the state and the legislature includes that $400 million. But the unions representing state employees have not agreed to any of it. They have instead proposed their own plan that would reduce state contributions and pay by $150 million.
Other people argue that some of the Governor's spending cuts would simply shift the burden elsewhere within the public sector. Many communities, for example, would experience deep cuts in state aid, 35 percent or more in some cases. And local officials around the state have already said that some of those cuts would have to be made up by higher local property taxes if municipal services and education are to be kept intact.
Officials in Danbury, for example, said their city would see state grants decline by $4.4 million, or nearly 20 percent, under Mr. Weicker's budget. Most of the cuts would come from a rewriting of the formula for distributing education grants. Poorer cities, like Hartford and New Haven, would get more money than in the past, while many communities like Danbury would get less.
 
Cuts Called Unfair
 The state would also cut by $321,000 a program that reimburses Danbury for paying the salaries of nurses in public and private schools and eliminate the $200,000-a-year grant that pays for transporting private and parochial school students in the city.
"There will be significant reductions in all city departments and an impact on our ability to fund the schools," said the city's Mayor, Gene F. Eriquez.
Mr. Eriquez said that while he understands the dire condition of the state finances, he thinks the cuts are not fair in every instance. New Britain, for example, with a population only slightly larger than Danbury's, would get more money next year, he said, and Bristol, just slightly smaller, would also get more.
Social welfare groups like Mr. Melmed's said that some of the budget cuts in programs designed to keep people off welfare could prove counterproductive in the long run, if the state welfare caseload increases as a result. Money for Operation Head Start, an educational program for young children administrated by the Human Resources Department, would be cut to $400,000 next year from $551,260 this year. The department's grant for teen-age pregnancy prevention would be slashed to $700,000 from about $1 million this year.
Mr. Weicker said in an interview that such cuts were the hardest aspect of the budget. But he defended the final package as the best that could be achieved within the goals of solving the budget crisis and stimulating the economy by cutting taxes paid by businesses.
"You can thrash around to your heart's content," Mr. Weicker said. "You can curse the world and all the ill winds that blow. But after you get through, you'd better address the problem."

A TYCOON'S TASTE
 Legrand Lockwood, an investment banker and railroad tycoon, built a mansion for his family at 297 West Avenue in Norwalk between 1864 and 1868. It has been in the process of restoration as a museum for the past decade, and it is used periodically for fund-raising exhibitions, special events, and outdoor fetes in summer.
 Opening Friday, and running through April 15, an exhibit called "Legrand Lockwood and the Taste for American Art," is focusing on 20 of Lockwood's favorite artists. Several of the paintings and sculptures were part of his private collection, auctioned off by his widow after he died in 1872, having lost most of his fortune in the 1869 crash.
 The works are on loan from museums and individuals. Some were not owned by Lockwood but were created by artists whom he favored. Among them are Frederic Church, Albert Bierstadt, William Bradford, and Asher B. Durand.
 Lockwood amassed a collection of more than 100 pieces, typical of many wealthy Americans during the post-Civil War period who began buying the work of American artists, rather than following the fashionable trend of purchasing only European artists. The patronage of their own countrymen gave American painters and sculptors an opportunity to develop their talents at home rather than emigrating to Europe in order to earn a living.
 Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M., and Sunday from 1 to 4. Admission is $5, students and the elderly $3, children free. Call 838-2434 for more information.
 
SHARED HOUSING
 Maggie Kuhn, founder of the Gray Panthers, will speak at a symposium on cooperative intergenerational housing on Saturday from 9 A.M. to noon in the Davies Auditorium at Yale in New Haven. The title of her talk is "Shared Dwellings, Shared Lives."
 The program was organized by Sage Services of Connecticut, an agency supported by the State Department on Aging to establish a home sharing network. "We try to match up people who want to share living arrangements in the 20 towns of greater New Haven," said Virgina Einhorn, the program coordinator. One person in the home must be over 60.
 A panel of Yale faculty members will address particular aspects of the program in three workshops. Dr. Paula Milone-Nuzzo, from the School of Nursing, will talk about the economics of aging. Elizabeth Swenson, from the School of Architecture, will discuss design requirements in housing for the elderly, and the Rev. Gaylord Noyce of the Divinity School will talk about the relationships in shared housing.
 For more information on the free program, call 777-7401.
 
'REALLY ROSIE'
 The poems and drawings of Maurice Sendak's "Really Rosie," set to music by Carole King, will be performed by the Hartford Children's Theater on Thursday through Saturday at 8 P.M., and Saturday and Sunday at 2 P.M. in the Roberts Theater, Kingswood Road, West Hartford. Cortney Charnas of Glastonbury has the title role of the little girl from Brooklyn who wants to be a movie star.
 Tickets are $8, $6 for students and the elderly. Call 523-4479 for reservations, directions or more information.
 
MILESTONES AT YALE
 Musical milestones are to be celebrated this week at Yale. The Yale Symphony Orchestra will be 25 years old on Saturday, marking the occasion with a concert at 8 P.M. conducted by James Ross. Melvin Chen, violinist, and Warren Wu, cellist, are the solists in Brahms's Double Concerto; works by Schubert and Shostakovich are also on the program. The concert will be held at Woolsey Hall, Grove and College Streets; admission will be 25 cents.
 The Yale Music School, founded in 1890, is in the second year of a four-year centennial celebration, commemorating the passage of its first students from freshmen to seniors. This year's observance begins at 8 P.M. on Friday, when the Yale Philharmonia Orchestra will present an all-Beethoven program under the direction of Gunther Herbig, director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Arthur Post, a student in the Yale-Affiliate Artists Conducting Program. Claude Frank, piano soloist, is on the faculty at Yale and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
 Ticket sales will benefit the music school scholarship fund. Prices range from $10 to$250. Call 432-4158 for reservations.
 
WALLPAPER IN HISTORY
 Catherine Lynn, director of education and development at the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, is a former curator of the wallpaper collection at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in Manhattan and the author of "Wallpaper in America: The 17th Century to World War I," published in 1980 by W. W. Norton.
 She will give a talk, "Wallpaper in the 18th and 19th Centuries: A Connecticut Perspective," today at 3 P.M. in the Connecticut Historical Society auditorium, 1 Elizabeth Street, Hartford. Included in her survey of fashionable homes is the Hatheway House in Suffield, built in 1761, and containing superb late 18th-century French neoclassic wallpapers. The building is one of several maintained by the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, sponsors of today's program.
 Her talk will also cover the substantial number of ordinary people who could not afford French imports but decorated their homes with simple single-color domestic papers. Admission to the talk is free. Call 247-8996 for more information.
 
'UNCLE TOM'S CABIN'
 Ronald Powell and Anthony Watts have drawn elements from a drama by George Aiken and from Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and reworked them into a play called "Uncle Tom: Dead or Alive." It will be presented by the Crescent Players of Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, Friday through Sunday, and March 6 through 9, at the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts at the university. Sunday performances are at 3 P.M., all the rest are at 8 P.M. in the Jorgensen Auditorium at UConn in Storrs.
 The 19th-century melodrama in two acts and several scenes is introduced by commentators in modern dress who interject issues of historic and contemporary racism from the viewpoints of blacks and whites.
 Written into the script are the characters of Uncle Tom, Eliza and Topsy, along with Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass and other people who were important to the civil rights movement. Tickets are $6, with discounts available for students and the elderly. The box office number is 397-4435.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
Stamford's Stake in Morgan Stanley Plan

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
OVER the next several months the Morgan Stanley Group, the country's fifth largest securities firm, will decide whether to move from Manhattan to Stamford.
The 11-acre, neglected tract it is considering abuts the north side of the railroad station and Exit 7 of I-95. The company already has taken a two-year renewable option on three acres. 
 "Stamford is our first choice out of New York," said Geoffrey Donoghue, director of asset management for the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, "but there are also a few possibilities in New York, which I cannot disclose, that we are concentrating on."
 The primary concern, he said, is economics. "We see Stamford as an economic advantage for the firm and for its employes in real estate and personal income taxes, and there are significant savings in building costs," he said. "But we are also impressed with the substantial contribution made by New York City toward keeping the Securities and Exchange Commission from moving out."
 Under current zoning, 1.3 million square feet of offices and ground-floor retail space could be built on the 11-acre site. Morgan Stanley is looking for up to 1.2 million square feet.
 A move by Morgan Stanley would mean a large influx of new residents from among the firm's 4,200 employees now working in Manhattan. "'People here will be able to sell their homes and condos," said Thom Serrani, Stamford's mayor. "Half-empty restaurants will fill up, construction people who can't pay their taxes will get jobs. And the city will get around $3.5 million in taxes. This is an economic development super bowl in which we are competing with New York."
 In his efforts to help the securities company get the land it needs, the mayor was instrumental in drawing up a memorandum of understanding signed last month by the City of Stamford, its Urban Redevelopment Commission, Morgan Stanley and the Connecticut Department of Economic Development. It sets in motion a study, to be financed largely by Morgan Stanley, to determine if the land is eligible for urban redevelopment district status. This would enable the city to use its powers of eminent domain in negotiating for the 17 individually owned parcels on the 11-acre tract.
 "If the site qualifies, Morgan Stanley will make the decision to say yes," said the Mayor.
 Eligibility for the designation will be granted by the state if its analysis shows the property is substandard or deteriorating.
"I see no reason why it would not qualify," said Charles Lee, a local lawyer who is chairman of the city's Urban Redevelopment Commission. "It's a shabby doorstep to the city."
The tract includes a condemned former municipal office building and a demolished public school site owned by the city, empty lots used for parking, and a closed gas station. There are also a few businesses, and some residential tenants whom the city would be obliged to relocate.
 "I don't think any of this will firm up for five months or so," said Mr. Lee. He explained that following the expected affirmative result of the study, there will be a vote on the new district by his agency, public hearings, Planning Board review, and, finally, a vote on the proposal by the Board of Representatives, Stamford's 40- member legislative body.
 Since 1985, when the Stamford Planning Board did a study of the train station area, the 11-acre tract has been ripe for change. At that time, the board recommended that it be included in the urban renewal district, which it abuts on its northern and eastern borders.
 Bounded by Washington Boulevard on the west, Atlantic Street on the east, Federal Street on the north and North State Street on the south, the proposed Gateway Area, as the commission has dubbed it, would, under redevelopment, provide an attractive pedestrian-oriented linkage between the train station and downtown Stamford.
 While realty companies in Stamford have no involvement in Morgan Stanley's direct negotiations with municipal officials, they are understandably anxious for a positive outcome.
"A COMPANY of that size and stature would require substantial peripheral support that would fill up a lot of vacant space downtown," said Alfred Remsen, a senior vice-president at William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford.
William Pitt's report for the fourth quarter of 1990 found new construction at a standstill and the vacancy rate for commercial space at 23.6 percent. About 500,000 square feet was leased during the year, leaving 3.5 million square feet still available at rentals ranging from the mid-teens to the low $20's.
 A vice president in the Stamford office of a national real estate concern, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he believed Stamford is merely providing leverage for Morgan Stanley to get a better deal in New York. But Holger Arning, a senior broker at William Pitt, is convinced the move will be made.
Both men say that executives from Morgan Stanley are seeking homes in the area. Moreover, its president, Robert F. Greenhill, lives nearby in Greenwich.
 "Responsible executives making long-term decisions have to consider that the kind of work force they want is shrinking in New York, for all the obvious reasons," said Mr. Remsen. "It's as expensive as blazes, not to mention crime, taxes and a deteriorating infrastructure."
 "I think there will be some portion of Morgan Stanley moving here," he said. "The question is how much."
 For his part, Mr. Donoghue, the Morgan Stanley official, said that "the urban redevelopment plan doesn't mean we're going to use all 11 acres."
"We would buy what we need, and we haven't analyzed that yet," he said. "We have a million square feet in four Manhattan buildings and 400,000 square feet in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn location will stay." Leases on the Manhattan properties expire between 1993 and 1998.
 In the meantime, Morgan Stanley is putting together vehicular and pedestrian circulation plans, and working with its architects on space requirements in Stamford. "If we do not move, at the very least we will have left behind an urban redevelopment study for Stamford's benefit," Mr. Donoghue said.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: TORRINGTON;
Students Attend Classes There, So How Come It's Not a Campus?

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
THE sign at the entrance says, "The University of Connecticut at Torrington." A UConn banner is taped to the information desk, and the campus bookstore is well stocked with university T-shirts, notebooks and stuffed likenesses of the Husky, UConn's mascot. The single brick building on the 200-acre rural campus has 10 classrooms, 2 seminar rooms, a library and a 260-seat auditorium. Eight full-time faculty members and 28-part-time instructors teach courses there.
But, officially, this regional campus of UConn does not exist. The Torrington branch was started in 1957, when its classes met in the local high school. Its own campus was opened in 1965, but in 1985, it lost its UConn desingation and became the Litchfield County Center for Higher Education. Instead of dwindling, however, Uconn's presence at the center has grown, leading to a bid now to regain its status as a regional campus of the university. 
 "It's the simple question that Shakespeare asked many centuries ago, which is, 'What's in a name?' " said the center's coordinator, Adriane R. Lyon. "Well, it is a matter of our self-respect and our self-image."
In 1985, state education officials decided to close the Torrington campus, because of declining enrollment there. The campus offered UConn's freshmen and sophomore courses; students who completed them went on to further study at the university's main campus is Storrs.
Residents of the Torrington area, who had gathered 15,000 signatures on a petition that sought to save the campus, agreed to a compromise. The newly named center would offer the two-year UConn undergraduate program as well as courses from several other institutions, including Northwestern Connecticut Community College in Winsted and Waterbury State Technical College.
 But the UConn designation should now return to Torrington, Mrs. Lyon said, adding, "Prestige has a tremendous amount to do with it."
 Enrollment has grown, she noted, and only courses from the University of Connecticut are now being offered at Torrington. The other programs offered at the center were gradually discontinued, after their sponsoring institutions found there was no need for them, she said.
Mrs. Lyon, who became the center's first director in 1986, has watched its student body grow from a low of 132 to 500 in September, the highest in the campus's history. That number dropped to 485 for the current spring semester, but a slight decrease is normal for the second semester, she said, noting that the tally includes both degree and non-degree students.
 
'Only Viable Alternative'
 With the poor economy, she said, fewer students are able to pay $20,000 to attend a private college, or even the room-and-board costs at UConn's main campus. Full-time students at Torrington, like their counterparts in Storrs and at UConn's regional campuses in Groton, Hartford, Stamford and Waterbury, pay $2,330 a year for tuition and fees. "So many students are seeing this as their only viable alternative," she said.
Without diversions like sports and fraternal organizations, the center offers a better academic atmosphere than the main campus, Mrs. Lyons said. The students from the Torrington center are well represenated on the university's dean's list, in part because "we don't have to worry about how the basketball team is doing," she said.
 Supporters of a return to the center's former status need to win the the cooperation of the General Assembly. The change could be accomplished in two ways, said State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat who is co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. Senator Sullivan, who said he favors the change, said that the lawmakers could repeal the 1985 law that created the Litchfield center, or they could simply do away with that law in an administrative session, a simpler move that does not require a public hearing.
 State Representative George Avitable, a Republican from Torrington, has proposed a repeal bill. "The school has proven its point," he said. "It's a viable school, so why shouldn't it have the name?"
 Marvin Maskovsky, chairman of the Litchfield County Committee on Higher Education, which led the fight to save the center, said he agrees.
"The major issue is access to education," he said. "The people in this area should be able to take courses on a regional campus without the expense and time to travel to distant places like Waterbury and Hartford. The university's mission is to extend its service to every part of the state."
 The university's president, Dr. Harry J. Hartley, said restoring the campus's formal status "as a concept sounds fine." But since he had not seen the legislative proposal, he said, he did not know whether he would support it.
The state's Higher Education Commissioner, Norma Foreman Glasgow, said that while the center is working well, she was worried that a change could jeopardize its success.The Commissioner said she was concerned that if the center became a regional campus of UConn, other institutions might not be able to offer classes there in the future. But the supporters of the repeal bill disagreed, saying they would welcome programs from other colleges.
Booker T. DeVaughn Jr., president of Northwestern Connecticut Community College, said he would like to resume offering some classes in Torrington. "I'm sure when the opportunity presents itself, we would have classes there," he said. "I would hope they would have room for us."
 Having a dual identity -- taking UConn courses but at the Litchfield center -- can be confusing, said Kate Denehy of Harwinton, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, especially when she meets students at activities elsewhere. "We're doing all of the requirements," she said. "The faculty here is superb. There really is no reason at all why we shouldn't be considered part of the university."
Vincent LaFontan of Kent a sophomore who is president of the Associated Student Government on campus, said he chose to attend the Torrington center, even though he had been accepted to several other colleges in Connecticut as well as the University of Vermont. He has enjoyed his classes at Torrington, he said, but supported the name change.
"We've always been known as the University of Connecticut at Torrington, so we should be given that respect." he said. "It does mean a lot to be called the University of Connecticut."

HEADLINE: The Campaign to Save A Dusty but Historic Hall

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
IT was once the essence of English gentility, an elegant manor house on a high bluff overlooking both the Hudson and Saw Mill Rivers, the center of the most prosperous estate in the Colonies. With its formal gardens and picket-fenced deer park, it represented what one historian called "all that was best in the life of the province."
Today, the deer park is home to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, the formal gardens long ago gave way to the Otis Elevator Company, and the Saw Mill River and its docks have disappeared altogether, covered over by Dock Street, the Yonkers Railroad Station and a public parking lot. 
 Philipse Manor Hall, as the high-style Georgian mansion is known, remains perched on the bluff, a historic anachronism overlooking factory buildings, discount stores and boarded-up tenement buildings, its narrow strip of grass perhaps less familiar than the kind sold on surrounding streets. Now the future of the manor may be as bleak as its present neighborhood.
 
The Site May Close in March
 Unless the State Legislature intervenes, the manor, Yonkers's only national historic landmark, will close at the end of March, a victim of the state's fiscal crisis. The site, operated by the state's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, will bear the brunt of a $100,000 cut in services at the agency's Taconic regional office: a $55,000 reduction that will eliminate the salaries of the manager and two security guards, the manor hall's entire staff.
State officials have been startled by the growing public reaction to the closing of a site few have visited and whose dusty and nearly empty rooms have been open only sporadically. Many people confuse the manor hall with its more popular neighbor, Philipsburg Manor, Upper Mills, in North Tarrytown, part of the complex of historic sites operated by Historic Hudson Valley.
A coalition of political leaders, historians and community groups have begun a campaign to save the manor hall, which some historians consider the most important building in Westchester, which political leaders call the most important symbol of the development of Yonkers and which community groups say is a critical landmark in an inner-city neighborhood that has few other resources.
 
A Task Force Is Organized
 A task force has been organized by State Senator Nicholas A. Spano to develop a strategy to restore the budget cuts and keep the site open. "It's very important not to lose this building," Mr. Spano said of the landmark, which was declared a National Historic Site in 1962. "The manor was the hub of the Philipse estate, and there are very few buildings in Westchester with that historical significance."
But the manor played an important role in the history of Yonkers long after the departure of Frederick Philipse 3d, a devout British loyalist who fled to England during the Revolution. Nearly a century later, part of the property and the Manor Hall became the Yonkers Village Hall and, in 1872, the first City Hall, a role it served for 36 years. As the "birthplace of the City of Yonkers, the building has immense symbolic significance," Neil J. DeLuca, Yonkers City Manager, wrote to the State Parks Commissioner, Orin Lehman, this month.
The manor has equally important value today, said Michael Rebic, who oversees historic preservation for the city's Planning Bureau. "You cannot calculate the impact of closing a site like this in an inner-city neighborhood," Mr. Rebic said.
"Downtown Yonkers in the last 20 years has slowly been losing all its major cultural institutions," he said, "and this is one of the few unifying municipal symbols left in a city fragmented by various geopolitical and socio-economic divisions."
 
'Look Out Our Windows'
 Sibley J. Smith Jr., manager of the historic site, agreed. "Look out our windows and look at our neighborhood," Mr. Smith said recently on a tour. "There's graffiti, broken windows and abandoned buildings everywhere, but not here. We have had very little vandalism and no graffiti. It's a measure of the respect people have for this place."
Should Philipse Manor Hall close, however, "you can draw your own assumptions about the future," Mr. Smith said.
Shortly before Mr. Smith became the site manager in 1988, a program titled "African Roots in New York Soil" attracted 2,000 visitors and prompted the state office to reassess the Manor Hall's focus. It proposed a new community-based museum emphasizing the city's history as a melting pot, with exhibitions devoted to varied religious, racial and ethnic groups.
The building was closed in October 1988 to complete extensive renovations and new exhibition space to accommodate this interpretation, which Mr. DeLuca called "the first such approach by a state-owned site to address groups that have traditionally been overlooked."
The work is not completed, but includes a "People of Yonkers" exhibition space for use by the community, Mr. Smith said. This is an effort, he added, to express "not simply the 18th-century splendor of the Philipse family, but to talk about the physical development of Yonkers."
Philipse Manor Hall has some important collections that would be incorporated in the new exhibitions, including a series of portraits of American presidents through the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Donated in 1929 by Alexander Smith Cochran, a Yonkers industrialist, the portraits include works by Gilbert Stuart and Charles Wilson Peale.
 
History and Architecture
 "There is no other building in Westchester with more architectural and historical significance combined," said Karolyn Wrightson, chairwoman of the Historical Preservation Advisory Committee, a citizen's advisory committee to the county, in a letter last week to Commissioner Lehman. "We are appalled at the decision to make one site bear the entire brunt of budget limitations."
Philipse Manor Hall "has never been properly opened and never staffed reliably so you could drive there and find it open," she said in an interview. "The Taconic region doesn't think the public cares."
The decision was made, said John H. Kennedy, director of the regional office, to preserve money to pay guides at the other sites. Eighty-five percent of his budget for the historic sites is "an untouchable amount" used for security, Mr. Kennedy said, adding that the guides had a dual role, helping insure the safety of the collections. The Manor Hall does not have guides.
"If we spread $55,000 across the other four properties, I really don't believe they could operate safely." he said.
 
Another Possibility
 The state would like to find "another user for the property," Mr. Kennedy said, adding that he had been approached by the Yonkers Historical Society. But no negotiations are possible, he said, until after the Legislature has made its decision about Governor Cuomo's budget proposals.
Jack Prill, president of the society, confirmed last week that his organization was interested in the site, but he added that funds were not yet available.
The Taconic Region operates historic sites at Olana, the home of Frederick Church in Hudson; the Claremont Mansion in Germantown; the Mills Mansion in Staatsburg, N.Y. and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah. Philipse Manor Hall is the only one of five historic sites and 11 parks in the region that will be closed, although services in two parks, James Baird State Park in Pleasant Valley and Taconic State Park in Copake will also be reduced.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
4-Cylinder Luxury in a Sporty Peugeot

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
Things go along and it's easy not to notice. But it is not so long ago that imported cars were peculiarly alien to the American hand.
There was a time, for instance, that Saab could fairly be called particularly Swedish, and I remember a review in a magazine of the early 70's that accused the company of building not cars but Saabs. Likewise, Alfa-Romeo was oddly Italian. The rake of the steering wheel was all wrong. The pedals were misplaced. Switches were backward. 
 Early Hondas looked a bit like football helmets. And if any of those imports qualified as really strange, it was the Peugeot, a vehicle that was especially . . . . well, French. Today, though, homogeneity is everywhere, and Peugeot is among the foreign makers whose products now are as American as an order of fries.
The company, which is a short step behind Mercedes-Benz as the world's second-oldest auto manufacturer, lays claim to being Europe's third-largest producer, and it must be doing something right. Its exports jumped 15 percent last year, and it is one of the few car companies whose profits have been rising in a sluggish market.
Peugeot brought its first cars to the United States in 1958, and it now offers its sedans and wagons through a network of 200 dealers. The lineup comes in two flavors, 405 and 505, and it must be said that the French folk have a nice alpha-numeric souffle in 1991's 405 Mi 16.
The Mi-etc. is a sport sedan motivated by a four-cylinder engine that uses 16 valves and the magic of electronics to pull 150 horsepower out of its tiny 1.9-liter displacement. The car has standard antilock brakes, front-wheel drive, a five- speed stick, and almost all of the goodies.
The one that's missing, unfortunately, is an air bag, and a buyer will have to contend with those infuriating mechanized seat belts, but that is a small price to pay when you consider what a wholly competent automobile this is.
Styling is by Pininfarina, and there is nothing new there, which is to say that the car looks the way Peugeots have looked for years. That is hardly a bad thing, of course, and the tester was a smooth white four-door with maroon-and-black interior, a wing across the trunk, and 15-inch alloy wheels. All of it aerodynamic, all of it very fast.
Inside, the Mi 16 has all the luxury equipment one could ask, including heated front seats, a power sunroof that flips as a vent or slides open, and there is a hidden pass-through from the trunk to accommodate skis. In the back, too, the windows go all the way down, a feature found in few of today's automobiles.
Up front, there is a large glovebox with twin cupholders, and the car has a good big ashtray for those who persist. Ahead of the black, leather- wrapped wheel, there is a 140-m.p.h. speedometer, and full gauges, including an 8,000-r.p.m. tachometer.
The Mi 16 also has the hardest clutch this side of a Corvette, and traffic makes you well aware that you are piloting some sporty machinery.
The suspension is taut but very smooth, and the unit body combines with the smooth shape to create a pleasant hush on the road.
Peugeot also is making much of safety these days, and the company has established its own "accidentology" laboratory to reprise and analyze actual crashes. Using police reports, hospital records and other documents, 8,000 accidents have been studied to evaluate structural damage and passenger injuries.
Outward vision has been improved, and the 405 has halogen lighting and a dash that is bathed in soft orange light at night. Glass is bonded to the body to increase structural rigidity, and the polypropylene fuel tank is placed ahead of the rear wheels for safety.
The tank holds 17.2 gallons of gas, and mileage is rated at 20 miles per gallon, city, and 28, highway. That makes the Mi 16 something of an economy car, although the sticker weighs in at $21,990.
These days, there's nothing very foreign about that, either.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
In Hong Kong, the Surge Goes On

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The money managers who have bet on Hong Kong this year -- and there are many -- have been right. And some analysts argue that the market will continue to go their way as long as the war in the Persian Gulf ends soon, the United States economy snaps out of its recession fairly quickly and China continues to press for economic growth and springs no surprises.
Right now, those ifs look like pretty good bets. The Soviet peace plan endorsed by Iraq and the ultimatum for immediate withdrawal proposed by President Bush on Friday seem to indicate the end is near even if there is a ground war. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress last week that "this downturn could well prove shorter and shallower than most prior postwar recessions." And the Chinese and Hong Kong governments are working out their differences over a new airport in Hong Kong, which will provide a lift to the local economy. The estimates are that the Chinese economy could grow at a 5 percent rate this year, a big plus for Hong Kong, which is still China's gateway to the West. 
 The Hong Kong market, as measured by the blue chip Hang Seng index, has risen 14.9 percent this year to 3,475.34, with all of the increase coming after the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf. It was also one of the best performers last year, in what was a very bad year for equities. This year's surge has been enough to wipe out the loss that occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwiat on Aug. 2.
Market predictions that some analysts made at the end of 1990 for this year have almost been fulfilled. Enzio von Pfeil of Smith New Court in Hong Kong predicted in December that the Hang Seng would rise to 3,500 or 3,700 by the end of the year. He has now raised that to 4,000.
This performance is making money managers all over the world happy. For many, the percentage of their funds invested in the Hong Kong market far outweighs Hong Kong's share of the world equity business. Murray Johnstone International Ltd., which manages international stock funds, has its biggest investment in Hong Kong, with 13 percent of its portfolios in a market that accounts for 1.3 percent of the world equity market.
This support has been one of the driving forces behind the market. The rally has also been fueled by the war, which has carried equity markets higher worldwide; by the decline in interest rates in the United States, which has a direct impact on the Hong Kong economy because of the linkage of the two currencies; and by the attractive values of many of the stocks in the market, which are trading below their historical averages. Utility stocks, which have all but guaranteed earnings, have been attractive defensive buys in a slowing world economy.
The fall of the American dollar has also increased the competitive edge of Hong Kong exports against some of its major competitors, like the Italians in clothing, the Taiwanese on toys and games and the Swiss on watches.
Altogether, these factors make the outlook for the Hong Kong stock market, unlike that for many other equity markets, seem positive after the war. In many other markets, like those in Europe, the so-called fundamentals, like slowing economies and weak earnings, could stymie any rallies. (When analysts offer forecasts about market outlooks after the war, just remember that most predictions for the market reaction at the outbreak of the war were wrong. Markets did not fall; they rallied sharply.)
Investors seem to think the balance is still in favor of staying in Hong Kong despite potential problems. Inflation in Hong Kong is 10 percent and not declining fast. A long-term breakdown in the international trade negotiations after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade collapsed at the end of last year could hurt exports.
And China's approaching takeover of Hong Kong in 1997 is still a cloud over the market. Political changes there will continue to disrupt the market.
Murray Johnstone is not reducing its investments in Hong Kong, but new money is not going into the market now.
"I think the market has come a long way," said Victoria Lewis, the Hong Kong analyst at James Capel Inc. in New York. "But it is at the level where you are going to run into the constraints of the China risk factor."
Elizabeth Tran, a managing director at Prudential Asia in Hong Kong, echoes this view, saying that the China risk factor could benefit other Asian markets. "At this level, other markets in Asia, like Singapore, are more attractive because Hong Kong will continue to carry the China discount," she said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Prince Of a Deal For Citicorp

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
People used to denounce banks for charging usurious interest rates. Now Citicorp, desperate for capital, is paying such rates.
The $590 million capital infusion that Citicorp obtained last week from a Saudi prince came at a heavy cost. It may have proved that it can raise capital, but the 11 percent rate on preferred stock it issued for the money is equivalent to a pretax rate of 15 percent for a corporate investor. And Citicorp may go on paying that rate long after the current crisis of confidence has passed. Not before 1996 can the company force Prince al-Waleed bin Talal to convert the preferred to common, at $16 per share. Any profits on conversion will come on top of the assured 11 percent return. 
 But before one gets too jealous of the prince who will be raking in $65 million a year from Citicorp, it may be worth pausing to note that Citicorp's chairman, John Reed, can hardly be accused of not beating the bushes to find investors. And Mr. Reed, who owns 581,842 shares, including 100,000 bought for $25 each with borrowed money, has as much reason as any shareholder to regret the cost to the company. Last week, Citicorp shares fell $1.375, to $15.50.
 Citicorp is still looking for investors to put in at least $400 million more, although it will try to get less onerous terms. Even without fears of a bank crisis, there are few institutions that could invest that much, which leads to the idea, backed by the Bush Administration, to let industrial companies get involved. I.B.M. certainly could come up with the money, and on terms like that, it might be willing to take a chance.
The scary part of that proposal is that there could be opportunities for self-dealing in such an arrangement, leading to a situation where the industrial company only claims to be putting capital into the bank, while really using insured deposits to finance its own operations.
Proponents of letting the industrial companies own banks claim that adequate safeguards can be devised, so that such fears will be proved groundless. Given the history of the savings and loan industry, such reassurances have a hollow ring. But if banks otherwise must pay this much, the country may have no choice but to take the chance.
In the meantime, there is little doubt that other large banks, having blanched at the price Citicorp is paying, will redouble their efforts to comply with capital rules by shrinking loans, and thus their need for capital, rather than by raising new capital. That is a prescription for the credit crunch to continue.
In the end, the banks may get bailed out by inflation, although no one wants to admit it. Devaluing the currency is one way of driving up prices, and making bad loans into good ones by raising nominal asset values. Last week's report of surprisingly high consumer prices probably is not a precursor of that, but it could reflect the Fed's aggressive easing and it did unsettle the stock market, which also gyrated with each indication of war or peace. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 45.29 points, to 2,889.36, for its first weekly decline since the air war began.

THE ECONOMY
 
Gasoline Prices on the Downswing, but for How Long?
 
Gasoline and crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels since shortly before Iraq marched into Kuwait. An American Automobile Association survey released last week said that gasoline had declined to $1.135 a gallon, about the same price as before the war but for a 5-cent-a-gallon Federal tax increase. Oil, driven down by peace proposals, closed on Friday at $17.91 a barrel, less than half its October peak. But don't start celebrating just yet. Even some of those analysts who expect crude oil to stay low expect gasoline costs to rise. Iraqi and Kuwaiti refineries have been ruined in the war; the Iraqis were apparently torching Kuwaiti facilities at the end of the week. Even the Saudis have to import fuel to supply the military, and gasoline demand will rise more rapidly once the American economy revives. "There will be ample crude for refiners, but not adequate refining capacity for consumers," said Alfred O. Munk, a consultant and the former foreign affairs manager for the Amoco Corporation. "Crude," he pointed out, "is not what you consume."

The Inflation Numbers Game
 
A recession that was supposed to extinguish inflation has still left the pilot light burning. Consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, eight-tenths without food and energy. Economists, who can no more take a figure at face value than Ella Fitzgerald can leave a melody unadorned, went to work explaining away the news. Look at higher liquor taxes, increased auto costs, rising apparel prices, other one-time events, they said. But a few saw underlying pressures, especially the 6 percent annual-rate increase in service costs, which account for about half of the inflation index. In dousing inflation, said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, "a short, shallow recession isn't going to give you much benefit."
 
Greenspan Confused?
 
Let nobody out-worry Alan Greenspan about the Persian Gulf war and the credit crunch. In addressing two Congressional committees last week, he rehearsed his forecast of a mild recession, but then added more fine print than your typical car-rental agreement. Some of those clauses concerned the war, but most troubling, he said, was the Fed's inability to prompt banks to resume lending to their creditworthy customers. If Mr. Greenspan usually appears as a determined general unwilling to reveal his battle plans, last week he all but confessed to confusion. He seemed uncertain about whether to maintain or lower interest rates, adding that others at the Fed are divided. Some of his colleagues counsel patience, anticipating a rebound; others have a darker outlook than his.
 
Here Comes Unicode
 
The United Nations' near-unanimity on Kuwait was unusual, but the computer industry's agreement to use a common digital code is truly extraordinary. The usually fractious companies, including International Business Machines, Apple, Sun and Microsoft, hope for Unicode to become a global standard representing letters and characters in every language. Companies could then more readily write software to work in a variety of languages, and international computer communications would flow more smoothly. "It's a lot more meaningful than Esperanto, because we're dealing with computers, not people" said Esther Dyson, publisher of the newsletter Release 1.0. She added that the third world would benefit the most. "It's like affirmative action for smaller nations," she said.
 
Where a Bank Finds Cash
 
Banks may be where they keep the money, but when Citicorp itself needs money, it looks to the Middle East. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal agreed last week to invest $590 million in Citicorp. He had accumulated 4.9 percent of the company's stock last year, so his latest purchase could give him 14.9 percent if he converts his new preferred stock to common.
 
He said in 1988 that he "would love to be a corporate raider"; just a joke, his aides now explain. Exactly where all the money is coming from is unclear. Prince Waleed is indeed a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, but he had to put up his house as collateral to get a loan from Citicorp just a decade ago. Where Citicorp will find even more badly needed capital might soon become clear. Other possible sources include the displaced royal rulers of Kuwait. "You go wherever there is a lot of spare cash," said James E. Akins, a consultant and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Even though the Saudi rulers are temporarily pinched, he said, "There is a lot of spare cash in the Arabian peninsula."
 
 
 
COMPANIES


Tisch Takes the Giants
 
Yes, it's tough to get season tickets for the New York Giants. But $60 million, or more? Fortunately for Preston Robert Tisch, 50 percent of the Super Bowl winner came with the deal. Mr. Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, bought half of the team from Tim Mara and two other relatives, leaving the other half in the hands of Tim Mara's uncle, Wellington. Loews owns 22.9 percent of CBS, where Mr. Tisch is a director and his brother, Laurence, is chairman. Mr. Tisch has promised to keep his football investment entirely separate from the network. And it's just as well. If the Giants adopted the same financial machinations as CBS, they might start buying back thousands of season tickets to boost the price of the rest, spin off a quarterback or two and sell Lawrence Taylor to the Japanese.11
 
Jail for Milken, Hope for Drexel
 
Michael Milken, the financier who studied at Berkeley in the 1960's, is returning to that area on March 4, this time to prison. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who sentenced him to 10 years on securities charges in November, recommended last week that he serve 36 to 40 months before he is eligible for parole. Cooperation with investigators, said to be asking him about failed savings and loans that bought "junk bonds," might get him out earlier. Even without Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert might rise again. Drexel convinced its creditors and litigants last week to tentatively accept a fraction of what they claim -- in this case, $2 billion out of $20 billion. A Federal Judge said enough money should be left to allow Drexel to emerge from bankruptcy.
 
Outlook for Airlines
 
The Federal Aviation Administration predicted on Friday that the nation's airlines will recover their financial health once the recession and the gulf war end. The agency predicted stable or lower fuel prices, although some analysts disagree. James B. Busey, the F.A.A.'s administrator, rejected the airlines' calls for Government aid.
 
Quincy Jones, Inc.
 
Bertlesmann and Time Warner may think of themselves as thriving media conglomerates, but the best example might be Quincy Jones. On Wednesday his "Back on the Block" album won six Grammy Awards, as many gold-plated horns as he could carry, bringing his total to 25. After last year's Milli Vanilli embarrassment, the award-givers can be assured that Mr. Jones himself originated, arranged, conducted and produced the album. He is best known as a record producer and arranger for musicians from Duke Ellington through Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson. He has also written the scores for 37 movies and produced several television shows and films -- convincing Steven Spielberg to direct and Oprah Winfrey to act in "The Color Purple." He has his own record label, and a major stake in a New Orleans television station that he oversees. His television and movie company, Quincy Jones Productions, has received so many uninvited visitors that he had to take its address off its business cards.
 
Amgen's New Drug
 
The Food and Drug Adminstration gave Amgen Inc. approval for a genetically engineered medicine to help cancer chemotherapy patients fight off infections. Analysts expect the drug to become one of the biotechnology industry's best sellers.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL


Another Step Toward Capitalism
 
If socialism, as many in Russia like to say, is the long, hard path from capitalism to capitalism, the Soviets took another halting step in that direction last week. The Government announced that prices would increase at least 60 percent on every basic need except fuel, medicine and vodka. The Soviets are trying to use central commands instead of free markets to reduce shortages, prune subsidies and set prices to more closely reflect production costs. Herbert Levine of the University of Pennsylvania, a specialist in the Soviet economy, questioned how much difference new state prices would make. "In many of these markets, the official channels are no longer the major suppply channels," he said. In his view, barter, private markets, the shadow economy and even commodity exchanges are acclimatizing many Soviets to more capitalist ways.
 
Slovenia's Secession
 
The Slovenian Parliament's declaration last week of autonomy from the rest of Yugoslavia only ratifies a status that Slovenia's economy has already achieved. Closer to Munich and Milan than to Belgrade, Slovenia has 8.5 percent of the nation's people but about 20 percent of its hard-currency earnings from exports. The Slovenes regard Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, as a flabby cousin wedded to the Cyrillic alphabet and Soviet ways. The Serbs regard the Slovenes as Mercedes-driving snobs. Joseph Tragert, an economist at the Planecon consulting firm in Washington, says that Croatia's eagerness to follow Slovenia out the door might well ignite a civil war because Croatia has a large Serbian minority. "It's probably the end of Yugoslavia," Mr. Tragert said of the Slovenian stand. But like the restive Baltic nations, he added, Slovenia and Croatia are probably too small to thrive as independent states. They might choose a loose confederation instead.

HEADLINE: The Packaging Industry's New Fancy - Composting Garbage

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Led by the Procter & Gamble Company, a group of major consumer products manufacturers is promoting the use of composting to reduce the mountains of trash being sent to increasingly scarce and expensive landfills.
But the effort is running into stiff opposition from environmental groups and even from some disposal companies, like Waste Management Inc., that use more modest forms of composting, a process in which organic materials are broken down through biological means. 
 With questions being raised about the value of trash composting and the motives of those backing the program, the clash illustrates the nettlesome nature of the country's growing waste-disposal problem.
Some critics of the industry effort caution that a rush to use composting to dispose of diapers, paper packaging and other types of trash could lead to serious problems of land contamination. They fear that heavy metals and toxic wastes that are present in household trash could enter the food chain if the compost is used on farm land. "If you try to compost an undifferentiated waste stream you will mix batteries with old spaghetti and you will wind up with contamination," said John Ruston, a waste-disposal specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in New York City.
Indeed, the critics say composting is being used by program backers as an unrealistic panacea to keep consumers complacent about wasteful packaging practices -- and to keep lawmakers at bay. P.& G., with annual sales of $3.5 billion from disposable diapers, is facing proposals in several states to ban disposables because of the demands they place on landfills. Other restrictions are being weighed for consumer packaging in general.
Nevertheless, P.& G. stands by its program. "We think composting is now where aluminum recycling was 20 years ago," said Stephen W. Collier, a company spokesman. "We are trying to jump-start the process of building the infrastructure."
Toward that end, the company said it is putting up $20 million to fund demonstration projects. And it has helped to form a trade association, the Solid Waste Composting Council, along with Du Pont, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Kraft General Foods, Warner-Lambert and a variety of equipment vendors and consultants from the composting industry.
In its simplest application, composting can reduce the volume of trash going to a landfill by 50 percent. Food waste, leaves, grass and almost anything made of paper can be composted, as gardeners have long known. With tight controls on which materials are composted, the end product can be used to enrich farmlands, replace lost topsoil and reduce the amount of chemical fertilizers needed to produce crops.
A trend toward using composting as a means of dealing with solid-waste disposal is likely to accelerate as states increasingly ban yard wastes -- grass clipping and leaves -- from landfills as a way of extending the useful life of the dumps. Yard wastes constitute 18 percent of all trash.
According to Waste Management, the nation's largest solid-waste company, 10 states already have bans on dumping yard waste, with another five scheduled to implement bans within two years. Since yard waste is difficult to burn because of its high moisture content, composting is the preferred means of disposal.
P.& G. and other members of the composting council are suggesting that all household trash be sent to composting sites, like one already operating in St. Cloud, Minn., where mechanical separation systems screen out large plastic bottles and certain other items that cannot be composted.
Composting has been used extensively in this country over the last decade to dispose of sewage sludge, with an estimated 150 plants now in operation. Fewer than a dozen trash composting plants are in operation, industry executives say, but 80 are under study.
P.& G. argues that its Pampers and Luvs diapers are 80 percent compostable now and that it is developing a substitute for the diapers' plastic outer cover, which would make the diapers almost completely compostable.
Other consumer products companies say they make good candidates for composting as well.
"Carton board can be used as a bulking agent in composting projects," said Melinda Sweet, director of environmental affairs for Lever Brothers. She was referring to the material used in the company's soap boxes and other packaging. A major competitor of P.& G., Lever is not a member of the composting council but is planning to promote its own composting projects.
Overall, composting technology "has the potential to convert as much as 30 to 60 percent of all municipal solid waste into nutrient-rich, soil-like materials," P.& G. said in a recent statement.
Diverting that much trash would be highly attractive to municipalities scrambling to find substitutes for landfills. In addition, although odors can be a problem if composting is not properly managed, composting does not have the air emissions problems that can plague incinerators.
What's more, composting is a potentially cheaper way of treating solid waste than land filling or incineration, particularly when the costs of preparing landfill sites and disposing of incinerator ash are considered, experts say.
The problem, environmentalists say, is that the screening process is inadequate and contaminated compost could wind up in an agricultural setting, giving a bad name to composting in general. Critics fear that the compost could contain large concentrations of heavy toxic metals from batteries, like cadmium and mercury, as well as many shards of plastic, glass and grit.
"They have had problems in Europe with metals and physical contaminants," said Bruce Fulford of the Tellus Institute, a nonprofit consulting firm in Boston.
Added Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste specialist with the Environmental Action Foundation in Washington, "There is good composting and bad composting. Some in industry are pushing for one-stop shopping. But why not do it right by separating leaves, yard waste and food waste to produce a high-quality compost?"
Waste Management, which has extensive landfill operations around the country in addition to composting, also questions P.& G.'s broad approach.
"We are not convinced it makes sense to compost the whole mixed-waste stream," said Dan Kemna, Waste Management's composting manager. "The cleaner the material that goes in, the better it is when it comes out."
Council members counter that even with an imperfect separation system, composting can produce material, albeit of a lesser quality, that would have many nonagricultural applications. These might include serving as a substitute for dirt in covering landfills and in the repair of damaged roadsides. Environmentalists are still concerned, however, that some of this inferior compost will wind up in the wrong place.
As things now stand, most states have no regulations for composting. Environmentalists and agricultural interests are urging that very strict standards be put in place to insure more careful, and costly, separation of materials. Vendors of composting equipment and producers of packaged goods want loose standards, so that the maximum amount of trash can be diverted from landfills. A two-tier system of regulation may be the answer, some experts say. Such a system has been in place in Massachusetts for about 10 years.
Under those rules, which were prompted by composting of sludge, Class I compost may have no more than 2 parts per million of cadmium and 10 parts per million of mercury. This compost can be used on land where crops intended for human consumption are grown.
Class II compost, which can have up to 25 parts per million of cadmium, cannot be used on agricultural land, but might be used by landscapers or golf course managers.
Ultimately, the battle over trash composting will be determined by economics, said Eliot Epstein, a composting consultant based in Stoughton, Mass. Enough applications may be found far enough from the food chain to push the P.& G. project along.
"Compost has traditionally been used for sod farms, nurseries and greenhouses," Mr. Epstein said. "Now it may replace peat moss and other things already on the market because it will be cheaper."
 
 
 
THE DIAPER DISCUSSION
 The two-page magazine advertisement depicts a hand holding what appears to be rich, dark brown earth. The headline says, "Ninety days ago this was a disposable diaper."
The Procter & Gamble advertisement, which is appearing in about a dozen magazines aimed at women, is designed to counter growing environmental concerns.
About 18 billion disposables are sold in this country each year, creating 6.5 million tons of solid waste, or about 2 percent of everything Americans throw out. P.& G.'s Pampers and Luvs account for about half the market.
Because re-usable diapers produce vastly less solid waste, legislation has been proposed in several states that would ban or tax disposables to reduce the burden on landfills.
In its ad, P.& G. stresses the compostability of the cellulose material that makes up most of a disposable diaper. Composting, the ad coos, is "safe, completely natural and, as you can see, incredibly fast."
Any human waste remaining in the diaper is rendered innocent by the composting process. But what is not dealt with is the 20 percent of the diaper material -- including the plastic outer sheet and the elastic around the leg openings -- made of noncompostable materials. Unless that can be removed, the compost will have little value other than as dirt cover for landfills, experts say.
P.& G. executives say the ad is not intended to mislead readers into thinking the entire diaper can be turned quickly and easily into a benign soil enhancer.
"The object of the ad is to use the diaper as a vehicle to send the message that there are some real solutions to the solid-waste problem," said Scott Stewart, a company spokesman.

HEADLINE: Medical Second-Guessing -- in Advance

BYLINE: By GLENN KRAMON

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif.

 BODY:
Helen Blumen, medical director of Value Health Sciences Inc., scans a patient record and shakes her head in amazement. A gynecologist in Colorado has proposed a hysterectomy for a 25-year-old woman with pelvic pain. The doctor presumes endometriosis, in which endometrial tissue grows abnormally outside the uterus, but did not confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy. And there is no mention of treatment alternatives, like medication or a procedure that would save the uterus.
Dr. Blumen functions as a sometimes unwelcome Big Brother to other doctors, assessing the appropriateness of the treatments they plan. As medical costs continue to rise significantly faster than inflation, insurers and employers are turning to companies like Value Health Sciences to review physicians' treatment plans to help insurers determine whether they should pay. 
 Medical review is not new. In the past it focused mainly on whether a procedure should take place in a hospital or a doctor's office and how many days a patient should spend in the hospital. Now, aggressive employers and health insurance companies, determined to cut costs, are cautiously beginning to use companies like Value Health to judge whether the procedure is needed at all. Such evaluations, known as medical necessity reviews, are a much more dramatic challenge of a doctor's judgment, and their use is being watched closely.
Many doctors do not like them, but insurers report early success. In the case of Value Health's system, which covers eight million people and is one of the more sophisticated on the market, about 10 percent of all proposed tests or operations reviewed prove clearly unnecessary when subjected to careful scrutiny.
 Value Health's proprietary computer software weighs facts about a case and warns when a doctor's plans go against a collective wisdom based on medical research and a consensus of leading physicians.
In the case of the Colorado hysterectomy, the physician was telephoned for a discussion but failed to convince Value Health that the surgery was necessary. The doctor was free to go ahead, of course, but the patient's insurer might not pay.
"People must understand that this system is preferable to excluding individuals from coverage because of pre-existing conditions, pushing them toward doctors who will give discounts, or raising out-of-pocket costs," said Mark Chassin, an internist who is the company's senior vice president.
 Value Health Sciences, a $5 million subsidiary of the closely held Value Health Inc. of Avon, Conn., is one of many businesses offering medical review services. Its clients include Prudential and Travelers. Other significant players include insurers themselves -- Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life and John Hancock among them -- and independent companies Intracorp, Healthcare Compare, Health Risk Management, U.S. Healthcare and Medical Intelligence Inc.
The latest study of the efficacy of Value Health's system comes from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, the nation's largest private insurer, involving 9,125 cases reviewed by the company. The year-long study found that 34 percent of the cases failed the first screen. After further investigation, a total of 11 percent of the cases reviewed were deemed inappropriate. Other studies have found similar results.
The system, whose software guides nurse reviewers through a rigidly structured series of questions asked of doctor and patient, has been particularly successful at identifying inappropriate plans for hysterectomies and tonsillectomies.
Dr. Blumen said the Colorado hysterectomy is typical of the treatments likely to be deemed inappropriate. The procedure typically costs $7,500, assuming no major complications, and is a risky operation that will mean the patient can never bear a child. Dr. Blumen said the review in this case protected not only the insurer but also the patient.
She cited other frequently challenged treatment plans: a tonsillectomy for a child who hasn't had many sore throats and would probably not benefit; an arthroscopy for a teen-ager with aching knees who has not yet tried an alternative treatment, like exercises; and a coronary angiography ordered by a physician who was talked into it by a worried patient with no symptoms.
In some cases, doctors agree not to perform the procedures after talking with reviewers. In others, they go ahead anyway. For now, some insurers will still pay for the procedure as if it had been approved. But others will pay nothing. Insurers say the day is coming when denial of payment will be far more common.
In many cases flagged by Value Health, the reviewers have reservations but give the doctor the benefit of the doubt. This happened frequently in the Blue Cross-Blue Shield study, which involved five Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans and a health maintenance organization, covering 1.5 million people in all.
The study, which took place in California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Tennessee, involved 18 procedures. It found the rate of inappropriateness varied sharply by procedure.
 Insurers say the reviews are more than paying for themselves. The Value Health system is licensed to insurers for 10 cents a month per person covered. Blue Cross-Blue Shield calculated that the system saved $2.56 for every dollar spent on the service in the one Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan where cost effectiveness was studied.
Richard Maturi, vice president for managed-care programs at Blue Cross-Blue Shield, said the pilot projects have shown that "in terms of cost effectiveness and practicality, it works, and we would anticipate more use of it by the Blues in the future."
Private Healthcare Systems Ltd., a partnership of 17 insurers based in Lexington, Mass., has used Value Health for 4.6 million people it covers. It found that the savings-to-cost ratio ranges from about $13 to less than $1 saved for every dollar spent, depending on the procedure.
Donna Goldin, Private Healthcare's executive vice president, said the partnership has obtained very good results in preventing unnecessary hysterectomies and is satisfied with the Value Health review system. She said her group's savings figures do not include additional medical procedures that may not be ordered by doctors who know they're being monitored.
Though in the last decade physicians have become used to second-guessing by insurance companies and the Government, confrontations between Value Health staff members and doctors do occur. For example, one day recently an exasperated reviewer stepped into Dr. Blumen's office to report that a doctor had just slammed down the phone on her.
Worried about Value Health's system, the American Medical Association studied its use by a Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan in Minnesota and identified several areas of concern, said Dr. John T. Kelly, director of the A.M.A.'s office of quality assurance.
He said Value Health had failed to share with physicians the criteria on which it was basing its judgments, preventing doctors from assessing the system's criteria. "Any review criteria not publicly available are suspect, and there is no basis for confidence in them," he said. "We strongly believe that good medical care should not be a secret."
Value Health contends that it does make its criteria available.
The A.M.A. also objected to imposing financial penalties on doctors -- like not paying for a procedure -- rather than simply using the review to educate the physician. The group also said it regards the system as an inappropriate intervention in doctors' decision-making and objected to the use of reviewers not licensed to practice medicine in the state where a patient was being treated.
Doctors have also complained that calls from reviewers eat up their time and that of their staff members.
For all the resistance from physicians citing concern for patients' well-being, spokesmen for a leading patient-advocacy group, the People's Medical Society, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. say they know of no complaints or lawsuits regarding necessity reviews. Indeed, they say, they endorse such systems, when applied carefully, because they help assure that a patient receives proper treatment.
 While the emphasis on Value Health's system has been on saving money, the reviews can actually increase the cost to insurers in some cases. In the case of a hysterectomy, for example, alternative therapies might fail and the operation might ultimately be needed.
Indeed, advocates like Dr. Chassin emphasize not so much the cost savings as the value of protecting patients by raising the quality of medical care. Doctors are only human, Dr. Chassin said, and often miss important diagnostic indicators. They cannot absorb every new medical finding that would be relevant. And they are sometimes not as open as they might be to less invasive alternatives to surgery.
Dr. Chassin said the motive behind some inappropriate procedures might simply be a doctor's desire to increase his or her income, but "more often, it probably is incomplete knowledge."
To be sure, though, the major selling point of Value Health's system is its effectiveness in limiting medical costs. Indeed, while the Value Health system flags inappropriate procedures, it so far does not spot cases in which a doctor did not order a procedure but should have.
 
 
ARE STANDARDS TOO LENIENT?
 Why is there such variation in the rate of inappropriateness among medical procedures reviewed by the Value Health Sciences system -- from more than 20 percent for hysterectomies and tonsillectomies to 1.5 percent for colonoscopies? The answers illustrate the difficulties of assessing doctors' decisions.
In the case of a hysterectomy not involving cancer, the medical consensus is that other treatments can often be tried before surgery. But "there are some procedures about which the physicians who do them are very enthusiastic, and each becomes a solution to problems with inadequate consideration of alternatives," said Value Health's senior vice president, Dr. Mark Chassin. "If you think about a woman who has minimal bleeding outside her menstrual period, the hysterectomy will clearly solve that problem. But the physicians' enthusiasm for it often prevents them from thoughtfully considering more conservative, less risky alternatives."
On the other hand, it is still generally acceptable in the American medical community to remove a gall bladder from a patient with gallstones even if discomfort is minimal and is not clearly caused by the stones, said Mary Ellen O'Donnell, director of utilization management at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
However, standards are not so lenient in other countries, and the operation might not be performed under similar circumstances, said Richard Maturi, Blue Cross-Blue Shield's vice president for managed-care programs. That raises an important issue, he said: "Should we be using medical standards from elsewhere in the world that are more cost-effective?"

HEADLINE: All About/Convention Halls;
The Latest Municipal Malady: Convention Center Fever

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
They're the places where the Society of Foresters come to don straw boaters and fit in some free-spirited carousing. Where the members of the Kansas State Square Dance Association turn out to network while they find out the latest twists in dance calls. Those structures that resemble vast, beached, extremely homely whales: convention centers.
It often seems as if there are already a few million or so too many conventioneers, with those stick-on badges, hogging downtown sidewalks, but more are coming and there isn't enough space. Thus convention center fever is raging. Buoyed by the growth of trade shows and the hope of revitalizing crumbling downtowns, 42 cities across the country are scrambling to build new convention centers or expand the ones they already have.
Mobile, Ala., is constructing a new $60 million waterfront convention center. St. Louis is doubling the size of its center. Providence, R.I., is building a new center as part of a $300 million downtown redevelopment project. Los Angeles is engaged in a $500 million convention center expansion. Manag ers are agitating to expand New York's mammoth Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, even though it is less than five years old, and to make Chicago's cavernous McCormick Place still bigger.
"Almost every major convention center is expanding or thinking about it," said Darlene Gudea, the editor of Tradeshow Week magazine.
Prompting this race for more convention space is the steady rise in the number of trade shows and conventions. According to the Trade Show Bureau, their number has doubled in the last 10 years to more than 10,000 annually. At the same time, the amount of space used by conventions has been swelling by 7 percent a year for the past decade.
Some cities, though, may find themselves regretting their parts in the convention space race. Chris Yoshii, a senior associate at Economics Research Associates who follows public and recreational projects, feels that too much building is going on. "The smaller, second-tier destinations have higher expectations than can be fulfilled," he says.
 
'Verticalization'
Giant Trade Shows, Smaller Offshoots
 How many convention centers can one country hold? More than 330 of them alreadyblanket the landscape, 50 percent more than in 1980. As convention centers have multiplied, they have markedly changed how they operate.
"As recently as 15 years ago, it used to be that in many places cities owned local halls called auditoriums," said Tom Liegler, the general manager of the San Diego Convention Center. "A tenant would go over and see the superintendent, who would be sitting in an office with a big wad of keys having doughnuts and coffee. The super would hand over the keys and pull one switch that flicked on the lights and the fans. And he'd say, 'I'll be back at 5 o'clock, please have your check ready.' And the tenant would go hold whatever he was holding. Now there are these huge and sophisticated centers with big staffs. And every day things seem to get bigger."
Why are there more conventions? When Jane Lorimer, the president of the Trade Show Bureau, gets onto this topic, she trots out the concepts of "regionalization" and "verticalization."
"Regionalization" means that mammoth trade shows are increasingly supplemented by smaller renditions staged in various parts of the country. Thus there is the big National Restaurant Association Show as well as the Colorado Restaurant Association Show and the California Restaurant Association Show.
"Verticalization" means that conventions are becoming much more specialized. The National Sporting Goods Association puts on a huge annual (horizontal) fair, and then there are the vertical offspring: the Shot Show (for hunting types), the Sport Boat Travel and Vacation Show, the Ice Skating Institute of America Trade Exposition and the National Strength and Conditioning Association Show.
As industries continue to think vertically, they will put on still more trade shows and the need for additional convention space will continue. Who knows? Soon there may be a National Strength Show as well as a National Conditioning Show.
 
Bottom Line Pressure
Being a Loss Leader Is Not Enough Now
Until recently, when a city examined its convention center's bottom line, it usually saw splotches of red ink. And it just shrugged.
About as long as it has existed, the convention center has been widely viewed as no different from the box of Devil Dogs that a grocery store sells for 22 cents to get shoppers in so they can spend $140 on lots of other things to eat. The convention center became the world's biggest loss leader.
Municipalities knew conventioneers have an addictive tendency to roam through cities leaving scads of money in their wake. They fill hotel beds, devour restaurant food and buy terrific things like miniature St. Louis arches.
But as municipalities have come under furious budget strains in recent years, convention center managers have been pressured to break even at least.
"This pressure has been building for several years and has been pronounced in the last three to five years," said John Swinburn, executive director of the International Association of Auditorium Managers. "Facility managers have been told by their boards to cut expenses and generate more income."
One way to earn income is to provide more services, like wiring and installation, directly. "What managers have done is realize they have to get into new businesses rather than use outside contractors," said Tom Liegler of the year-old San Diego Convention Center. "They had been in food and beverage and parking. They said, 'Hey, let's get into the electricity business. Hey, let's get into the telecommunications business. Hey, let's get into the booth cleaning business.' " Mr. Liegler's center installs phone lines and hopes to provide power and cleaning as well.
At the same time, convention center managers are pursuing a wider assortment of events. They'll welcome almost anything short of a cattle drive. Mr. Liegler has attracted stockholder meetings, high school proms, banquets, dozens of office Christmas parties. Counting the $4 million worth of room taxes that go to the San Diego center, Mr. Liegler said, his facility has managed to break approximately evenon annual revenues of some $13 million.
Christmas bashes are nice, but nothing brings in the dollars like a giant convention. Mr. Liegler can hardly wait until 1995 rolls around. That's when 65,000 members of Alcoholics Anonymous will descend on San Diegofor their convention, primed to make virtually every part of the local economy a little richer.
Only San Diego's bartenders will weep.
 
Hello, Columbus?
Competing to Build The Spiffiest Center
 Columbus is sad.
There's not enough tourism. There's not enough spending. Places like Cleveland and Cincinnati are getting the Baptists and it isn't fair.
The palliative, city boosters hope, may be the 216,000-square-foot structure rising on the northern edge of downtown. That is where a $94 million convention center has been under construction since last June. Completion is anticipated during the summer of 1992.
The fervent belief of Columbus denizens is the hope of so many cities that build convention centers -- to spark the economy and cause armies of people to check into town. Claire Fawaya Hazucha, the executive director of the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority, which is overseeing the center's construction, cites a study it commissioned indicating that Columbus may realize some $2 billion over 10 years as it entices bigger meetings. After all, a survey by the International Convention and Visitors Bureaus concluded that the average trade show delegate spends more than $900 before he staggers out of town.
Ms. Hazucha mentioned that a Baptists convention, expected to draw 25,000 people, has already been signed for the summer of 1993. "Quite a few other larger religious groups have been booked," she said.
A funny thing happens, however, when one city enlarges its center: Other nearby cities grow jealous. The likes of Cincinnati, Detroit and Minneapolis are now apt to want bigger and spiffier centers. It's a lot like the arms race.
San Diego has already seen the ugly side of convention center envy. When its facility opened a year ago, it was the largest on the West Coast. Then Anaheim expanded. A new addition opens in San Francisco this summer. Los Angeles is enlarging its center. Suddenly, San Diego is about to tumble to fourth place.
But not to worry. A couple of weeks ago, San Diego gave the go-ahead for a study of doubling the size of its new center. Take that, Los Angeles.
 
 
NEW MANAGERS FOR AN AILING SALT PALACE
 In some ways, the Salt Palace, Salt Lake City's creaky 21-year-old convention center, has been nothing but trouble. It has lost too much money -- between $300,000 and $1.2 million a year. A couple of years ago, the manager and several other employees were ousted after being accused of financial misdeeds. During a heavy-metal concert in January, three fans were trampled to death.
"I've had the responsibility of overseeing the place for five years, and it's always been something," moaned John Rosenthal, the director of the Salt Palace for Salt Lake County.
County officials felt they could put a stop to the Salt Palace's ills by bringing in professional managers; "privatization" has become one of the buzzwords of the convention center business. Thus the Spectacor Management Group of Philadelphia was recently hired to run the center. One of its first tasks will be to help oversee a $60 million overhaul and expansion, which is designed to make the Salt Palace less of an arena and more of a true convention center.
Though there is not enough history to judge the privatization movement, Chris Yoshii of Economics Research Associates said that cities and counties are likely to benefit. "I think it works well for most centers," he said.
Spectacor manages 12 convention centers, competing with companies like Leisure Management and Center Management. "More and more cities are concluding that they should not be in the business of running their centers," said Michel Sauers, Spectacor's senior vice president of sales. "They should be running fire departments and police departments, but not convention centers."
Spectacor charges a basic fee of $150,000 to $500,000, depending on the facility, as well as a performance incentive generally tied to revenue increases.
"We think we can bring more shows into a center than public officials can," said Mr. Sauers. "Because if there aren't events in a convention center, then it becomes nothing more than a mausoleum. And who needs that?"

HEADLINE: Technology;
Toward the Voice-Literate Computer

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN; Glenn Rifkin writes frequently about technology. He is based in Sudbury, Mass.

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass.

 BODY:
Kazuhiko Sumiya spoke softly but clearly into a telephone handset. "Teikiatugaari," he said, looking at the Sun Microsystems workstation perched on a nearby desk. In seconds, the Japanese phrase appeared on the screen in phonetic English, followed by several rows of Japanese kanji characters. "Taikio," Mr. Sumiya added. Again, the Japanese characters appeared on the screen. The two phrases taken together mean, "There is a low pressure system that makes the atmosphere unstable." The voice recognition system had correctly identified the spoken Japanese on the first try, but also offered several choices in case it had misunderstood some words.
Mr. Sumiya is the head of a Fuji Xerox research team working with Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, based here, to create a Japanese voice recognition system. Along with Harley Rosnow, a Kurzweil software engineer and the manager of the project, Mr. Sumiya hopes to take the system from prototype to commercial product within two years. If it succeeds, many believe such a system could lead to greater acceptance among the Japanese of personal computers. 
 The Japanese language has more than 7,000 characters, making a Japanese-kanji keyboard resemble a bulky church organ rather than the compact "qwerty" keyboard Western users have come to rely on.
For this reason, acceptance of PC's in Japan has trailed far behind PC acceptance in the United States. According to Japan Entry, a Boxford, Mass., consulting firm, only 4 percent of Japan's population currently uses PC's, compared with more than 12 percent in the United States. Pencil and paper remain the favored word processor in this technology-rich society.
Ray Kurzweil, a prolific inventor of high-tech products, had an idea. Instead of simplifying the keyboard, why not just eliminate it?
Mr. Kurzweil had begun researching speech recognition technology more than a decade ago. In 1982, he started Kurzweil Applied Intelligence to build the first commercial large-vocabulary speech recognition system. He targeted his first systems for medical reporting. Today, Kurzweil's is the dominant system used in hospitals, with sales of about $10 million and nearly 300 installations. More than 1,000 doctors use the systems to enter patient information into hospital and office computers, according to Mr. Kurzweil. Adapting this technology to the Japanese language could be the long-awaited breakthrough for PC's in Japan.
 "The ultimate PC will probably use a microphone and a mouse with no keyboard," said John Oberteuffer, president of Voice Information Associates in Lexington, Mass. "The Japanese may end up getting to that point first."
However, even the most optimistic proponents of the project, like Bernard Bradstreet, president of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, caution against too much optimism at the outset. "The market will evolve," Mr. Bradstreet said. "To think that a huge market will develop overnight is not realistic."
Nonetheless, Mr. Kurzweil believes that his company's joint venture with Fuji Xerox -- the Japanese affiliate of the Xerox Corporation -- will provide the first commercially successful speech recognition system for use in that country.
The Japanese prototype is based on current Kurzweil voice technology, incorporating sophisticated acoustic hardware. An expert system software package, which duplicates the judgment of linguists, allows the computer to translate sounds into words on the screen. The prototype works like the human ear, which has regions sensitive to different frequencies and pitches. In the voice recognition system, a digital signal processor breaks speech into frequency bands that can be portrayed visually.
When a word is spoken into the microphone, the computer analyzes these frequency bands to identify different sound segments called phonemes. The phonemes, to be understood and translated into characters, must be put into a context. To do this, a software program called the Japanese Language Phrase Module, was written. It parses a phrase and labels each of its words -- verb, noun and so forth -- and places the phrase in a sentence. This creates the context from which the words themselves can be deduced.
This process is difficult enough in English, which has distinct words and sentences. In Japanese, kanji characters are often ambiguous and can mean more than a simple word.
Mr. Kurzweil claims that the Japanese Language Phrase Module can already work in what computer programmers call "real time," as the words are being spoken. But the other parts of the system still must be made to run faster.
Mr. Kurzweil's English speech recognition system requires that a speaker pause briefly after each word. But in Japanese, where distinctions between phrases are subtle, continuous speech is a requirement. That means faster, more powerful microprocessors will be needed before such a system is economically feasible.
At Dragon Systems Inc., of Newton, Mass., Kurzweil's main competitor in speech recognition, engineers are at work on versions of the DragonDictate system in five languages: German, Spanish, French, Italian and Dutch. Janet Baker, Dragon's founder and president, said her company is considering a Japanese system but has not yet begun work on it.
Building acceptance of speech recognition has been slow in the United States. Only a few companies compete in a market that is so far valued at about $10 million. But while the market today is small, major companies like the International Business Machines Corporation are undertaking research of their own. According to Mr. Kurzweil, when the technology reaches its potential, a huge market will open up.
Critics of voice recognition technology contend that it will not be the panacea some expect. They say the Japanese response to it will be no warmer than the American. Jack Plimpton, president of Japan Entry, says the Fuji Xerox-Kurzweil product won't have much impact if it does not run on Japan's most popular PC's and sell at a low price.
In Japan, "major companies such as NEC and Fujitsu are working on voice recognition," Mr. Plimpton said. "But there are other barriers to PC use that are just as great as the language problem."
For example, according to Mr. Plimpton, cramped offices with tiny desktops preclude PC's, which is why more than half of the six million PC's in Japan are laptops. Even if voice recognition systems were available, the cacophony resulting from dozens of users simultaneously talking to their computers would be intolerable. "In Japan, handwriting technology using pen-based systems will be more successful," Mr. Plimpton said.
But pen-based systems that read kanji characters are still in their infancy. In addition, according to Mr. Kurzweil, the pen-based systems are slower than his speech recognition prototype.
With Fuji Xerox using its marketing and manufacturing clout, voice recognition systems would enter the market in Japan just as they have in the United States: in a high-end environment like medical reporting. The first commercial version will sell for about $10,000 and run on a workstation. Later versions, for high-powered PC's, will cost between $2,000 and $3,000.
"You don't have to start with a $500 piece of software that runs on every PC," Mr. Bradstreet said. "And as for the noise, Japanese office workers talk on the phone. Talking to a computer won't be any more disruptive than that."

HEADLINE: FORUM;
An Alliance Turning Into a Free-for-All

BYLINE: By JEFFREY E. GARTEN; Jeffrey E. Garten, a managing director of the Blackstone Group, is writing a book for the Twentieth Century Fund on America, Japan and Germany in the 1990's.

 BODY:
Beyond the Persian Gulf war and the deepening recession, there looms another make-or-break issue for America: How to deal with Japan and Germany in the new world order?
It was last June when deep cracks in the current German-Japanese-American alliance first surfaced. At the summit meeting in Houston, the first gathering of heads of state since the collapse of the Berlin wall, President Bush tried to orchestrate a policy reminiscent of the cold war. He urged Japan to hold back on additional foreign aid to China, citing continued abuse of human rights. He asked Germany to go slow in pouring money into the Soviet Union, saying that political and economic reforms there were still inadequate. But Tokyo and Bonn were in no mood to take directions. They told President Bush they would go their own way. 
 Another sad milestone in the relationship among the "Big Three" economic powers took place in December in Geneva. The event was the intended wrap-up of four hard years of trade negotiations in the so-called Uruguay Round. America's primary condition for a deal was a major reduction in foreign subsidies to trade in agriculture. But several nations were not agreeable. And who were two of the major culprits? Germany, which joined the protectionist ranks, and Japan, which did not make a peep about opening up its closed markets for rice imports. The negotiations collapsed.
Financial cooperation among the Big Three has also taken a nasty turn. In late January, the top economic officials of the three nations met in New York and promised to "maintain the stability of the international markets." However, just a few days later, without warning, the German central bank raised its interest rates in response to fears of inflation. Shortly after that, the Federal Reserve lowered its rates to combat recession. Meanwhile, Japan played a waiting game, keeping its cost of money high but giving off mixed signals about its future intentions. There could have been no clearer demonstration that each country was marching to its own national drummer, laying the basis for disarray in the world's capital and foreign exchange markets.
Now comes the biggest source of divisiveness of all -- the gulf war. As America risks everything, Tokyo and Bonn are on the sidelines. Their financial contributions are delivered begrudgingly; their noncombatant military involvement is virtually nonexistent. And this may only be the beginning. If the war drags on, Japan and Germany will be asked to ante up billions more dollars. In the later rebuilding of the gulf, they are likely to chafe under American direction and may become commercial rivals.
This new world order is a far cry from President Bush's vision of collective security and burden sharing. Can anything be done?
First, the three nations should recognize that it is time to find a way to discuss these problems at the highest political levels. The trade negotiations must be revived quickly, possibly with America compromising.
Second, the three need to review the global situation more realistically. There is no use pretending that their economic problems will disappear with the war. In fact, the global economy was heading for big trouble well before Saddam Hussein changed the world. America's companies were mired in calamitous debt; its banks suffocating from bad loans. Japan's stock market bubble was already bursting. Germany's finances were already straining because of reunification. It is imperative, then, that the Big Three's banking officials reach some understanding about averting a global credit squeeze.
Third, some way needs to be found to more equitably share the burdens of the gulf war and its aftermath. A disproportionate American contribution will sour Americans on global involvement, in particular with Japan and Germany. Tokyo and Bonn will have some chance to shoulder more responsibility with participation in postwar restructuring. But burden-sharing will have to go beyond money. There is no reason why Japan and Germany cannot provide their share of the peace-keeping forces that will be required once the shooting stops.
These are Herculean challenges. But holding the economic alliance together may be the most important task facing the Big Three.

HEADLINE: Rice Plays a Mysterious Role in the Inscrutable West

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The story of rice, a water-loving, small-cash crop, has byzantine ramifications that go well beyond the drought in California you discuss in The Week in Review for Feb. 10. 
 Most of the rice grown in the United States is exported to non-Western countries, where it is consumed as a staple food. Because many of these countries are poor, the United States exports must be subsidized, usually under the food-for-peace program, the only way the American crop would be competitive on global markets where buyers and other exporters operate well below our price-cost business levels. Former beneficiaries of our grain shipments have turned out to be Cuba and Iraq.
After rice shipments to Iraq were recently embargoed, it was suggested that Japan import the crop, thus further subsidizing it, while California was going dry growing it. Why the fuss in a country that couldn't stomach sushi even if it were starving? Rice is small potatoes in United States agriculture, but it is grown in two very powerful states: California and Texas.
In the last Presidential election, no less a person than candidate George Bush campaigned to open the closed Japanese rice market. The political rhetoric fell on deaf ears in Tokyo, and the rice market there remains closed to imports.
Rice, of course, remains ingrained in the Japanese psyche: Upon ascending the chrysanthemum throne, Emperor Akihito is reputed to have offered some to the sun goddess herself. No American-grown stuff would be suitable here. At any rate, even if the Japanese market was breached, the main beneficiaries would be other Asian growers, who could easily underprice the heavily subsidized United States growers.
The California drought and the economics notwithstanding, rice would be difficult to knock off the United States agricultural dole. Its growth has metastasized to Mississippi River states, aggrandizing the self-serving support the South is notorious for mustering (tobacco, peanuts, cotton, sugar). Renewed shipments to Cuba are thus being promoted.
As for thirsty Californians, why can't they just drink rice wine (sake) instead?

HEADLINE: Teacher Is the Key In Quality of Education

 BODY:
Re: "Panel Begins Overhaul of Education" (Jan. 27): The quality of a nation's economic, political and social systems is a direct function of the quality of its educational system. Although we are now faced with lean budget years, the schooling of our children is the way we plan for better times to come.
Even as James G. Cullen and P. Michael Timpane, co-chairmen of the Quality Education Commission, conduct their search for the "world class" education dreamed of by Gov. Jim Florio and Education Commissioner, John Ellis, the teacher remains the key factor to the quality of learning that occurs in the classroom.
Technology has given us the tools to revitalize education and will doubtlessly play a major role in the findings of the commission. Preparing today's teachers to facilitate technology-assisted, cooperative, decision-making learning across the grades and subjects must be an immediate priority.
I urge Mr. Florio and Dr. Ellis to support teacher education programs, in-service and preservice, that provide New Jersey teachers with the skills and concepts needed to implement the "models of success" when so defined by the commission.

HEADLINE: More Gloom on the Recession Front

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the Market Watch column, "Reverberations From a Forgotten Recession," Feb. 3, the author reminds us of the potential similarity of the present economic and stock market situation to that of 1980. It was a most timely and valuable warning that I am surprised has been overlooked by nearly all other observers.
I believe that 1990-93 is destined to resemble 1980-82. This implies an anemic recovery from the present recession to be followed by another recession of much more severe duration and depth.

HEADLINE: Exchanging Technology, in Miniature

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Three men old enough to have fought in World War II clustered around a Soviet-built model of an airplane of even earlier vintage at the opening of a two-day model airplane show here today, leaning in occasionally to inspect its engine the way surgeons might assess a heart transplant.
For many of the 20,000 people expected to visit the show at the Westchester County Center today and on Sunday, the Soviet exhibition was the first stop. 
 It was the first time that the Soviet Union had sent a delegation to an exhibition of radio-controlled aircraft in the United States. Henning Nielsen, a director and past president of Westchester Radio Aero Modelers club, host of what has become the largest such show on the East Coast, said, "We were really interested to see what they would show us."
The curiosity was particularly sharp because in recent years miniaturization, microchips and space-age construction materials have expanded the range and maneuverability of radio-controlled model planes.
Model planes and rockets are more than a sport. Progress with them has contributed to the development of rocket-powered craft and to the early studies for reusable spaceships like the space shuttle. The prototype of the first shuttle was carried aloft as a model on the back of a model Boeing 747.
Similarly, so-called drone aircraft evolved from model airplanes. Those tiny, unmanned, gasoline-powered planes with television cameras in their nose, which are guided from the ground, helped the Israelis fool anti-aircraft batteries and defeat the Syrians in the Bekaa region in Lebanon in 1982.
The battleship Wisconsin, on duty in the Persian Gulf, has a drone mounted on board that scouts out targets for the 2,000-pound shells of the ship's guns, then returns to be caught in a net. The drone's rear-mounted "push" propeller leaves the nose free for television equipment, while also accommodating the net catch.
 
Soviets Show Off Engines
 There were no miniature MIG fighters accompanying the 12-member Soviet delegation to the model show, but there was a full array of United States jet fighters on display.
The Soviets displayed a variety of models, the largest including gliders, a Soviet aerobatic plane, a World War I-era biplane built to scale, and a helicopter that has set records for altitude, distance and duration.
All the models were built from scratch, including the engines, and that was what fascinated the hobbyists who lingered to examine and discuss them. The Soviet exhibit featured an even wider array of engines displayed separately.
The Soviets also displayed the most up-to-date fiberglass, Kevlar and other modern building compounds, both strong and lightweight.
But there were no Soviet radios on display, except those in the model planes and built for them. Albert Nazarov, who is heading the Soviet delegation and the official responsible for "all Soviet hobbyists," as one of his colleagues put it, said the Soviets would like to find a way to exchange the miniature Soviet engines for the American radios.
The Soviet group traveled with Howard R. Kuhn, a retired United States Army colonel and a space and rocket modeler, who met his counterparts at an exhibit in Bulgaria. He said most of the model-plane work was done at the "aero-club level," referring to Government-subsidized cooperatives.
But the changes in the Soviet economy are forcing the model-plane hobbyists to find their own backing, prompting their acceptance of a long-standing invitation to participate in this show and to produce a catalogue of miniature engines that they hope to market here.
 
Models and the Real Thing
 Mr. Nazarov said there were about 300,000 airplane- and rocket-model hobbyists in the Soviet Union. Mr. Nielsen said that eight million Americans were involved in modeling of all types, and that the number of people working with radio-controlled models had increased significantly as the equipment improved and costs dropped.
Some model planes are built at scales as large as 1 to 4 or 1 to 3, and modelers tend to refer to real planes as "full scale."
An anecdote making the rounds among the enthusiasts today told of one such modeler coming across a man building a full-sized World War I aircraft in his barn. The hobbyist returned frequently, taking pictures and asking questions.
Finally, the man building the plane asked his visitor if he would like a set of plans. The delighted modeler assumed that the builder would give him original plans for a real plane, which he could then reduce to make a model. But no -- the man's plans, taken from a model-airplane magazine, were for a miniature plane. He had increased the scale to end up with the real thing.

HEADLINE: Colombian Seeks Anti-Drug Pacts on U.S. Trip

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 23

 BODY:
During his visit to the United States next week, President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo is expected to sign several agreements to advance both anti-drug and economic cooperation between his Government and the United States, Colombian officials say.
The officials, while emphasizing the agreements' significance, are ascribing just as much importance to Mr. Gaviria's scheduled meetings with the editorial boards of several major American newspapers. 
 Mr. Gaviria, they say, feels obliged to defend his anti-drug policy before whathe views as hostile American news organizations.
"The only major opponent of our policy in the United States is the press," a senior official in Bogota said. "This isn't just their fault, but also ours, for not having explained our policy properly. We hope to correct the bad interpretation through direct dialogue with the media."
The decision to meet with editorial boards -- including those of The New York Times, The Miami Herald and The Washington Post -- was prompted partly by an editorial on Feb. 14 in The Miami Herald. Describing Mr. Gaviria as "vacillating and confused," the editorial suggested that he take a firmer stance against cocaine traffickers and other enemies of the state.
At issue abroad and at home is the Government's program of lenient treatment for cocaine bosses who surrender and confess to at least one crime. Officials say the program is aimed at dismantling the drug cartels.
But many people, including many Colombians, say the program was thrown together hastily to try to placate the Medellin cartel, which is responsible for a recent wave of kidnappings.
Mr. Gaviria changed the policy several times to address objections raised by the cartel's lawyers, adding tocharges that he lacked the firmness to deal properly with traffickers.
Principal among the guarantees offered to surrendering suspects is the promise that they will not be extradited to face trial abroad, where justice systems are better prepared to resist their bribes and threats.
Mr. Gaviria can claim some recent successes against drug barons. The authorities announced record-breaking cocaine seizures totaling more than 11.5 tons so far this year. The figure equals a quarter of the entire amount confiscated in 1990.
In addition, eight suspects, including three of the four top leaders of the Medellin cartel, have turned themselves in under the leniency offer. But a judge now under investigation released one mid-level trafficker after he served only 44 days in jail.Mr. Gaviria has tried to strengthen the Colombian judicial system to avoid such incidents. His officials say the success of the court reform effort depends on the signing Tuesday of a judicial cooperation agreement with the United States. The agreement is aimed at easing the exchange of evidence and charges against drug suspects.
"We consider this agreement the most important of all those to be signed on this trip," the senior Colombian official said.
Mr. Gaviria, the official said, will inform President Bush that an Assembly now meeting to rewrite the Colombian Constitution is likely to prohibit the Government's use of extradition.
Colombia expects more from the United States than just judicial cooperation. The two Presidents are expected to discuss ways in which Mr. Bush's"Andean initiative," which offers lower import tariffs on certain Andean products, can be moved rapidly through Congress.
Colombians have long pushed for easier entry of their products into the United States market, as a way of offsetting the country's economic losses that have resulted from the drug war.
Mr. Gaviria will be away at a time of intense personal and national pain. The President's cousin was found slain on Feb. 16. On the same day, a car bomb, attributed tocartel assassins, exploded on a Medellin street, killing 23 people, including 9 policemen.
Mr. Gaviria has recently invoked emergency measures, including levying a war tax, to combat a leftist guerrilla offensive that has cost more than 300 lives and nearly a $1 billion in economic damage since Jan. 1.

Attendance Drops At the Meadowlands

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD

 BODY:
Attendance at the Meadowlands sports and entertainment complex dropped sharply in January because of the Persian Gulf War and the recession, officials said Friday.
Harness races drew 20 percent fewer bettors than in January 1990, and the amount of money wagered was also down by a fifth. 
 The numbers improved somewhat in the first two weeks of February, with the amount bet down 10 percent and attendance just 5 percent lower than last year's, the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority reported on Friday.
An ice show drew 35 percent fewer people this year, as many large groups canceled. "It was almost as if the day the war began, people decided they weren't going to come out," said Rbert Mulcahy 3d, the authority's president. (AP)

HEADLINE: Slump Catches Up With Once-Booming California

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 23

 BODY:
The mighty California economy is stumbling, marking the delayed arrival of the national recession on the West Coast and prompting concern that the state's downturn could outlast the slump in the rest of the country.
The nation's most populous state is being battered on many fronts. The unemployment rate has jumped in the last six months, to 7 percent, from 5.1 percent in June. That is well above the national average of 6.2 percent and leaves California with the third-highest rate of joblessness among the big industrial states. Economists expect additional layoffs in important industries like construction and aerospace, both of which are slumping badly. 
 Housing starts fell 31 percent last year (figures for January are not yet available), and home prices continue to drop in many areas. Agriculture, the largest single component of the state's economy, is reeling from a freeze earlier this winter that killed many of crops and from a five-year drought that has necessitated stringent plans for water rationing.
All told, gross state product, or total output of goods and services, is expected to decline by five-tenths of a percent this year after years of steady growth, according to the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles. And with tax receipts leveling off and outlays continuing to rise, the state government faces a deficit of nearly $2 billion out of a budget of $54 billion for the fiscal year that will end on June 30. The deficit will be at least $5 billion for the next fiscal year.
Many Californians had come to believe that their state, by virtue of its economic diversity, would be recession-resistant if not recession-proof. Indeed, California still has many powerful factors in its favor, including its position as the hub of trade with Asia and its leading positions in technology, manufacturing and agriculture. Nevertheless, the recession that the state has slipped into in recent months is by some measures, including unemployment and housing starts, worse than the one being suffered by the rest of the nation. Some economists think the slump here will be hard to shake.
 
'Fairly Spectacular' Slide
 "California's economy held up longer than the U.S. as a whole, but we had a fairly spectacular downward slide here in 1990, led by housing and aerospace," said David G. Hensley, an economist who heads the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Mr. Hensley said that in addition to suffering all of the broad economic problems of the national economy, California would be hurt by factors peculiar to the state. Most notable of these, he said, are the drought and the declining Pentagon budget, which is already being felt by the state's aerospace and military contracting industry. Neither the drought nor the loss of military contracting jobs is likely to ease soon, he said.
"You could make a fairly convincing case that we're going to have more trouble than the U.S. as a whole," Mr. Hensley said. "The optimistic scenario is that the country could come out of recession in the second or third quarter, but I can't conceive of how California could come out of the woods that quickly."
 
Jobless Rate Soars
 These are among the troubling economic statistics for California:
*The unemployment rate of 7 percent was the highest in four and a half years and left California with the third-highest level of joblessness among the 11 large states for which the Labor Department has January figures. Only the rates for Massachusetts, 8.6 percent, and Michigan, 7.2 percent, were higher. While the California economy has continued to create jobs, the rate of job growth has shrunk substantially.
*The 31 percent decline in housing starts in 1990, to 164,394 units, left construction at the lowest level since 1982. Nationally, housing starts fell 13.3 percent in 1990. Sales of existing homes in California fell 17.1 percent last year, to 446,370. The median single-family home price fell eight-tenths of 1 percent last year, to $194,010, and the price decline in many areas since the peak in mid-1989 has been considerably steeper. Commercial and industrial construction also dropped precipitously.
*After five years of growth, total agricultural output in California is expected to decline this year from its 1990 level of $17.8 billion. The drought and plans for water rationing could have a disastrous effect on some farmers and some portions of the state this year, although others could escape relatively unscathed, depending on their access to alternate water supplies.
 
Unemployed Since July
 For Steven Williams, a 41-year-old computer programmer, the recession in California began in July, when he was laid off from his $31,500-a-year job at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's Douglas Aircraft division in Long Beach. Mr. Williams was one of nearly 10,000 workers who have lost their jobs at Douglas in the last several years as the company has struggled to cope with declining Pentagon spending and intense competition in the commercial aircraft business.
Mr. Williams has sought employment leads at job fairs and through a placement service, and has landed three interviews but no job.
Mr. Williams has been able to get by on his unemployment benefits because he is single and lives with his brother. But his unemployment insurance will run out in six weeks, and although he would like to remain in California he is also looking for work in Oregon.
"I am constantly looking forward to something good happening because I do have faith in the Lord that I won't be destitute," Mr. Williams said.
 
A Shrinking Industry
 Military spending accounts for about 8 percent of California's economy, down from 14 percent 20 years ago. But the effect of the declining aerospace industry has still been remarkable. Virtually every big military contractor has laid off hundreds or thousands of production workers, engineers, scientists and corporate personnel. And nowhere has the pain been felt more deeply than in Long Beach, home of the sprawling Douglas Aircraft plant.
Bridgette Fletcher of Long Beach, who had worked on the C-17 at Douglas, lost her job in August. In past years, her degree in electrical engineering would have assured her a new job quickly. She has yet to get an offer.
A single parent, she has been able to support herself and her 16-month-old son, Carlton, on her $800-a-month unemployment insurance payments, and has managed to keep up the mortgage payments on her condominium. But she is behind on her electricity and telephone bills. As the months have passed she has considered moving from the state or changing professions.
 
The Housing Slump
 The state's banks and savings institutions report only a small upturn in mortgage delinquencies and defaults, although some analysts think delinquencies will rise as unemployed homeowners run through their jobless benefits and their savings.
Rising unemployment has clearly aggravated the housing slump, which in turn has led to more layoffs in the construction industry, previously a primary source of new jobs.
The great question mark hanging over the California economy now is the drought, which has reduced water reserves to record lows. With the state planning to slash or eliminate certain water allocations to farmers, and alternative supplies limited in many regions, many farmers are scaling back their planting and hunkering down for what could be a difficult year.
In Kern County, 60 miles northwest of Bakersfield in the Central Valley, the Blackwell Land Company, one of the area's largest agricultural concerns, has already abandoned 250 acres of lettuce and 160 acres of onions, which would have brought in $1.5 million.
But that loss pales beside the one faced by Blackwell if it cannot buy enough extra water to keep its 7,000 acres of almond trees and grape vines alive. If those permanent crops are lost, the company will lose the income from this year's harvest as well as from succeeding years'. The company's permanent crops produce $12 million a year in sales.
The effect of the drought would be felt beyond the loss suffered by the company. Blackwell Land has already laid off 65 permanent workers, or more than half of its permanent staff.
And the effect of the drought is not limited to agriculture. Industries that need large quantities of water, like the lumber industry, will have to pay higher prices or cut production.
But perhaps more important in the long run, the drought, in combination with the recession, is forcing California to confront more directly than ever before whether it can support the high levels of population growth and economic expansion it had come to regard as normal over the last few decades.
An example is the fast-growing community of Lake Elsinore, in Riverside County. In a state where water districts have only sought to facilitate growth, the Elsinore Valley Water District shocked developers this month by voting to freeze construction and effectively bar the sale of completed but unoccupied homes by refusing to install water meters. The freeze is in effect until April and could be extended if the drought does not ease.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: U.N. Resolutions;
Iraq's Shift in Position: Not Enough for the U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Since Feb. 16, Iraq has shifted from a repudiation of all Security Council resolutions calling for its withdrawal from Kuwait to acceptance of Resolution 660, demanding its unconditional withdrawal.
But the Iraqis have consistently demanded that all other United Nations resolutions, including those dealing with sanctions and other penalties, be voided as a condition of its withdrawal. The United States views this condition as a major sticking point for an accord. 
 On Feb. 16, an Iraqi statement spoke for the first time of Baghdad's "readiness to deal with Security Council Resolution No. 660 of 1990, with the aim of reaching an honorable and acceptable political solution, including withdrawal."
But the statement did not mention Kuwait, and it carried a long list of conditions, including demands that the allies halt the war and withdraw all forces from the region; that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories; that the Security Council repeal all sanctions; that the future Government of Kuwait be based on the "people's will," and that Iraq receive war reparations and be forgiven its debts.
 
A Moscow-Baghdad Shuttle

In the next few days, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq shuttled between Baghdad and Moscow, and on Thursday, the Soviets announced that the Iraqis had agreed to a seven-point plan that included accepting the terms of Resolution 660 unconditionally.
Under that Soviet proposal, Iraq asked for an end to United Nations economic sanctions after it had withdrawn two-thirds of its forces from Kuwait. Iraq further asked that all United Nations resolutions, including Resolution 674, which demands war reparations, and Resolution 661, calling for the restoration of the Kuwaiti Government, be rescinded after the pullout. It was the first Iraqi offer that omitted mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The next day, the Soviets announced a plan under which Iraq shifted slightly in its call for an end to sanctions, saying they should cease after Iraq's full withdrawal from Kuwait.
As the noon deadline for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait passed today, President Saddam Hussein and the Soviet Union have shifted their views on how the crisis should be resolved, but not enough to satisfy the United States and its allies.
 
The Main Sticking Points
 In the allied view, there are two main difficulties with the Soviet Union's latest plan, the six-point blueprint for an Iraqi pullout that Mr. Aziz accepted in Moscow on Friday.
The first is that it provides 21 days for Iraq to complete its pullout. When President Bush set the deadline of noon today for the pullout to begin, he gave Iraq one week to complete it.
The second difficulty was the call for the lapsing of the resolutions.
"The Soviet proposals fall short of what we need because of the time deadline and the conditionality, which includes nullification of all Security Council resolutions," the American representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said today.
More important, the Soviet plan effectively proposed that all international punishment of Iraq cease after the withdrawal. That would prevent the allies from pursuing their aim of maintaining the United nations military embargo against Iraq to wear down its army and perhaps eventually force it to accept some form of regional security pact that would place permanent limits on its armaments.
 
Trying to Destroy an Army

Although the allies' primary goal is the restoration of Kuwait's Government, the Security Council has adopted a broader and vaguer aim defined as "the restoration of international peace and security in the region." The allies cite that goal to justify destroying Iraq's army.
Lifting all Security Council resolutions would also prevent the allies from holding Iraq responsible for the damage its invasion caused.
Finally, Iraq would not have explicitly agreed to recognize the Kuwaiti monarchy as a legitimate Government, allowing it to maintain its claim to Kuwait as its 19th province. Diplomats fear this might allow Iraq to give up southern Kuwait while holding onto a northern section including the disputed Rumaila oilfields, now administered as part of Basra province, as well as Warba and Bubiyan islands.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Which Boskin Is Right?

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein

 BODY:
Economist Boskin versus Economist Boskin. Which one is more persuasive in the the debate about the impact of President Bush's proposal to cut the tax on long-term capital gains? The idea is to reduce from 28 percent to about 20 percent the tax on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and other investments.
The first Boskin is Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He says the President's proposal would spur a huge increase in savings and investment, driving up economic output by about $12 billion a year for five years. 
 The second Boskin is Prof. Michael Boskin of Stanford University, who, before he went to Washington, published estimates, backed by intricate mathematics, that lower taxes have a limited impact on savers. To judge by that work, Mr. Bush's tax proposal couldn't possibly spur much economic growth.
Professor Boskin is right, Chairman Boskin is wrong, and to see why, follow a simple calculation that Alan Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania provided Congress. If the economy were to churn out an extra $12 billion of output each year, as Chairman Boskin claims, it would need a lot more plant and equipment, at least $60 billion more each year. But extra investment requires extra saving. That raises the crucial question: Who will save more?
Not pension funds and other nonprofit organizations, because they aren't affected by a tax cut. Not foreign investors; neither are they, mostly. That leaves only domestic taxpayers, who now save about $220 billion. For them to come up with an extra $60 billion would require a 30 percent increase in their saving behavior.
Preposterous, according to the research of Professor Boskin; that large a saving response is outside professionally respected estimates, even his own. No problem, says Chairman Boskin.
Choosing which Boskin to believe is now up to the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. The President recently made him head of a commission to resolve technical discrepancies between White House and Congressional studies of a capital gains tax cut. Yet Mr. Greenspan will be able to resolve very little, if anything.
For starters, the technical discrepancy foremost in Mr. Bush's mind concerns estimates of the impact of the tax cut on the deficit. The White House estimates the tax cut will raise tax revenues by about $10 billion over five years; the Congressional Joint Tax Committee estimates it will lose that much.
The difference -- about $20 billion over five years -- is small, bordering on the trivial, in an economy that will generate approximately $5 trillion in tax revenues over the period. That discrepancy warrants no further study. And other discrepancies have already been scrutinized by scores of first-rate economists; one more study would resolve nothing.
By dragooning Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bush has transformed a useless commission into a dangerous commission. Mr. Greenspan helps control the most powerful economic lever in the world, the U.S. money supply. It's imperative that he be, and appear to be, above politics. Yet by heading a commission meant to do Mr. Bush's bidding, Mr. Greenspan becomes a pawn of White House politics.
Apart from the technicalities and appearances, the President has permitted this capital gains issue to choke budget negotiations for two years, culminating in last year's crazy quilt of amendments to the tax code.
All this political havoc arises over an idea that, even if Chairman Boskin's estimates are right, would increase economic output by maybe $12 billion -- in a $6 trillion economy. The upshot is that if Chairman Boskin's hypothetical calculations are 100 percent right, they are only 0.02 percent right in the real world.

HEADLINE: A Big Win-Win on Trade

 BODY:
Finally, a crucial breakthrough on trade. The European Community last week agreed to demands from the U.S. and third world food exporters to negotiate specific reductions in each of three areas of farm subsidies. That breaks the impasse that paralyzed the Uruguay Round of international trade talks in December and opens the way for a bold trade agreement that could add trillions to the world's economies in the 90's.
An agreement to negotiate is not yet an agreement. Hard bargaining will commence this week. Having won the principle, however, negotiators need not be so concerned with the actual amount by which farm subsidies will now be cut. Once agricultural trade is included in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, subsidies will eventually fall to insignificance. 
 The European Community has made a brave decision; Congress owes its trading partners no less. President Bush will ask it to extend "fast-track" negotiating authority, which permits Congress to reject, but not amend, the final agreement. Without such authority, the trade accord will be amended to death by special interests and the European decision will have been in vain.
The Uruguay Round hopes to incorporate, for the first time, rules governing trade in agriculture, intellectual property, services and investment. Farm subsidies are key because third world food-exporting nations will not accept rules protecting trade in property and services unless Europe and the U.S. open their borders to food and textile imports.
Until now the Europeans have refused to budge. They have a longstanding commitment to protect a few million family farmers. Prices are kept artificially high, stimulating production. The surplus stocks are then dumped onto foreign markets at subsidized prices, devastating farmers in developing countries. The policy costs European taxpayers $100 billion a year, which may explain the Community's willingness to change.
Previously, the Europeans have agreed only to reduce a vaguely defined measure of overall protection, but not each identifiable component of its policy: production subsidies, export subsidies and import barriers. And the reductions they offered were tiny compared with what the U.S. and third world food exporters were demanding.
Now everything has changed. The principles are settled; only the details must be negotiated. Everyone will have to give, but that kind of give-and-take is the ordinary stuff of international trade bargaining.
The U.S. is in a unique position. It loses billions each year to pirates of copyrighted and patented materials. And even efficient U.S. farmers can't compete against subsidized exports from the E.C. So an agreement that protects intellectual property and services and also reins in European farm protection provides a big win-win.
Not every American wins. The sugar, textile and shipping industries are some of the sectors that will lose protection if Congress approves the trade accord. That's why fast-track negotiating authority is critical. Without it, these interests will load the legislation with killer amendments, spoiling important gains for everyone else.

Reservations Not Accepted

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
The group of veterans marched down the street, and as they came into sight the crowd at the curb seemed to move forward to greet them, to hold them like a hug. They were youngish men, and their camouflage clothes were as different from the neat uniforms of the other groups as their war had been from other wars. Beside me an old man waved a flag. "We're with you," he shouted, as though he were putting all our cheers into words, and then he added, "We should have let you finish what you started." And the smile froze on my face, and fell.
It was five years ago that those Vietnam veterans marched by on Memorial Day, but I've thought about that scene more than once in the last 40 days. From the beginning, it has been difficult to publicly oppose this war, to express reservations or even to forgo the exuberant displays of national accord. 
 A basketball player at Seton Hall University who did not wear a flag patch on his uniform was heckled so relentlessly by fans that he quit the team and the school. The editor of The Kutztown (Pa.) Patriot was fired, and while the owners said there were other reasons, the ax fell just after he ran an antiwar editorial with the headline "How about a little PEACE!" -- the last word in letters as big as your finger. What amazed him afterward, he said, were the people who called him eager to talk geopolitics, as though they were all members of a sub rosa self-help group: Hi. My name is Joe, and I have reservations about the war in the gulf.
Reservations are not accepted. There were antiwar demonstrations. But mostly there was the majority rallying around the President, and a silent minority, constrained by the atmosphere of high-octane Amerimania, a prettified second cousin of her "Love It Or Leave It" forebears. Some of us were ambivalent, but we don't do ambivalence well in America. We do courage of our convictions. We do might makes right. Ambivalence is French. Certainty is American.
Some people say dissent is a matter of time, that opposition to Vietnam took years to build. But I believe it's a sign of the times instead. America had become the Muhammed Ali of nations, battered by foreign competition, by a faltering economy, by domestic problems as big as our national ambition. In the last six months Americans saw themselves as the leaders of the world again, assured of their inherent greatness and the essential evil of the enemy.
But the line between such convictions and jingoism can be very thin. Everyone talked about standing behind the soldiers even while deploring the policy. "Support the troops -- bring them home alive," one protest sign read. But like my neighbor at the parade, Letters to the Editor columns in dozens of newspapers made clear that people believed the way to show support was to agree that the troops were engaged in a necessary and a noble enterprise. If not, keep quiet. The idea that our true greatness lies in our diversity and freedom of speech was, if anything, a P.S.
This war has taken on a momentum of its own. The troops of August led to the buildup of autumn, and that to the combat of Jan. 16. The cumulative effect was epitomized at a rally in California several weeks ago: as though they were in the bleachers, a bunch of boys were chanting, "We're Number One!"
When the Soviet Union stepped in as a dealmaker, our former dark star, our one-time evil twin, it was hard to bear, especially when the negotiations included Saddam Hussein's survival. His face has been plastered on dartboards and ping-pong paddles, and his mustache has become an instant metaphor for evil. The U.N. resolutions called for making him leave Kuwait. The grass-roots agenda, forged over heady days of the United States leading the world to war, is to destroy him. It is an agenda that lends itself to ultimatums, not negotiations.
"We should have let you finish what you started," I keep hearing that man yelling. Some of us believed that our national agenda in the gulf war was murky from the start. But it has grown ever clearer: we must win, and Saddam Hussein must lose. Trouble is, it's not that kind of world, and this isn't that kind of war. Saddam Hussein could lose big and still be a hero in some parts of the region. We could run a devastating military campaign and still wind up hated and reviled. But for some short time, the war in the Persian Gulf has made the world a simpler place. Black and white. Good and bad. Win and lose. But not for long.

Sense of Pride Outweighs Fears of War

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
IT remains unclear what the Persian Gulf war will do to the political geography of the Middle East, but so far it has transformed the psyche of the United States.
The sour, deeply divided nation of a few months ago, worried about economic decay and political paralysis, has received a remarkable lift from the war. Despite the presence of a sizable minority opposed to the fighting, there has been a surge of patriotic rallies, flag-waving and professions of unity unmatched by anything in this generation. 
 Americans have always been prone to turn wars into crusades and metaphors -- from the sense of mission and manifest destiny of the Spanish-American War to the sense of virtue of World War II. In this war that tendency is, if anything, being heightened by the lingering frustrations of Vietnam.
"What makes war interesting for Americans is that we don't fight war on our soil, we don't have direct experience of it, so there's an openness about the meanings we give to it," said Robert Dallek, a professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles. "War for us is like a tabula rasa, a blank slate which we can use to turn into a moral crusade, and that's what's happening now, particularly as a healing experience in relation to Vietnam."
A bloody ground war could radically change the nation's mood, of course, and some say the pro-war feeling is more broad than deep -- more support for the troops than the policies they are carrying out. In any case, support is not uniform throughout society. Blacks, for example, support the war less than whites.
"We talk about this as a war, but it's not even the length of a good World War I battle yet," said Peter Maslowsky, a military historian at the University of Nebraska. "The battle of Verdun went on for 10 months. I wouldn't make any judgments just yet."
But polls, troop-support rallies and the degree to which the war has been turned into a pop culture phenomenon all indicate broad support, which many Americans see as a heartwarming resurgence of patriotism and others see as perverse.
There's an Operation Desert Shield magazine on the newsstands, with its cover crowing, "America's Awesome Firepower, the Most Devastating War Machine Ever!" A spokesman says the initial 500,000-copy press run, put out just as the war was beginning, is selling briskly. Along with the Saddam Hussein golf balls, video games and shooting-range targets, the yellow ribbons and the Scudbuster T-shirts, it is emblematic of a change in the nation's mood. Life, a magazine which as much as any other sees itself evoking the essence of America, has not one but two issues on the stands, both labeled Life: In Time of War. In addition to the monthly, with a cover closeup of a grizzled Army captain, is a new weekly Life, with a cover photo of a blond-haired youngster in saddle shoes holding a flag.
It is as if all the confusion and pain of recent decades have melted, leaving the nation with its reassuring images from World War II intact.
"People want something to believe in," said Donna Lane, a 40-year-old Atlanta woman who has begun making pins with patriotic images that she sells to nonprofit organizations like the American Legion. "They want some part of their life to have a meaning," she said. "The guys in the service are putting their lives on the line for what the U.S. is supposed to mean -- freedom, liberty. That's what we're over there defending."
Wars draw people together in other countries as well, but some say they do so to a particular degree in the United States.
As an extraordinarily heterogeneous society, the United States is not unified along lines of race, religion or culture. War is one thing with the power to bond the nation into a unified whole. Also, throughout its history, America has found ways to convince itself that it is fusing its deepest moral impulses with its military ones.
Many analysts say the popular acceptance of this war reflects the Administration's relentless portrayal of it as a moral struggle -- with Saddam Hussein personifying evil -- instead of in terms of its geopolitical realities.
"We don't think of war as politics by other means," said David Tarr, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. "It has to be a moral crusade with good guys and bad guys."
To skeptics, that moral sense often is tragically misplaced. Many say the degree of violence the nation tolerates at home, exemplified by soaring murder rates and the world's highest incarceration rates, makes the United States more likely than other countries to employ violence to achieve what it sees as moral aims.
Prof. Gerald Linderman of the University of Michigan, who studies the nation's wars as they reflect society, said the American view of war is skewed by the degree to which it fights wars elsewhere and then returns to an unscathed homeland to construct a selective mythology about the conflict. Thus, for instance, World War II is remembered in images of Normandy, Dwight Eisenhower, prosperity and unity at home instead of Dresden or Auschwitz, Nagasaki or Hiroshima.
"We have lost some sense of the true reality of war," said Professor Linderman. "We make our calculations without ever having factored in the possibility that our streets will be destroyed, our houses ruined, our children obliterated. It allows us to talk very blithely about war. I've been astonished with the sort of insouciance with which callers on radio talk shows talk about intensifying the war. I think in this age of increasingly deadly long-range technology, sooner or later that is going to place us in great peril." Just as Vietnam has clouded the nation's image of itself at war, so have allusions to it dominated the reaction to the Gulf War. After the ambiguity and humiliation of Vietnam, the gulf war seems a model of clarity and success, a war portrayed as being fought with the most efficient weapons and greatest resolve against the vilest of villains. "It's Vietnam revisted as it should have been -- Vietnam: The Movie, Part II, and this time it comes out right," said Professor Dallek.
Many believe that if the war ends in a low-cost triumph, it could affect the American mood for years.
"We have national mood swings, and wars contribute enormously to them," said Professor Tarr. "After World War II we could do anything. After Vietnam we could do nothing. It's hard to say how this one will go down, but right now it looks like the optimists are being fed what they want and the pessimists are eating crow."
But many others do not expect the euphoria to last even if the war does speed to a successful conclusion. Often alluded to is a book by the Yale University historian Paul Kennedy, "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," which contends that global behemoths throughout history have seen their energy sapped and their decline accelerated when they concentrated too much of their resources on military activity and spending and too little on the creation of wealth.
Others note that the end of this war will find the United States in a much weaker economic position relative to the rest of the world than it was after World War II, for example, when America had half the world's manufacturing capacity. Certainly the problems of crime and drugs, decaying cities and intractable deficits will not be solved by victory in the Persian Gulf.
History has shown that the moral fervor with which the United States enters wars can ebb quickly. But for now, America has been getting some satisfactions from the war that it was not getting in a time of peace.
"I think it's taken the monkey off our back that's been there since Korea and Vietnam and Beirut and a few places in between," said Harry Kane, a Vietnam veteran who is editor of Operation Desert Shield magazine, which is published by a company that also puts out magazines for police officers and gun enthusiasts.
"There's been talk of us losing our economic leadership but this has reasserted our preeminence of a
sort," he said. "VCR's may be made in Japan and Mercedes have their stamp of origin, but what's going on in the Middle East is undeniably made in the U.S.A. I think that's a source of pride we have not had since World War II."

'The Rulers Will Have to Face the Music'

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AS they gaze beyond the clouds of the gulf war toward the future, many Arab officials and commentators see more questions than answers and a great deal of bad news ahead.
From Casablanca to Riyadh, supporters and opponents of Saddam Hussein believe beyond doubt now that he has lost the war, the fighting power of his army and any aspirations of leading the Arab world, even if he comes out of the war clinging to his office in Baghdad. While this may be great news now for staunch opponents of the Iraqi President like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, there is nothing in it to guarantee them a secure future. 
 In articles and commentaries throughout the Arab world the common themes range from pessimistic to cataclysmic. The prognosis goes like this:
The Iraqi nation is likely to be a bankrupt, bitter, leaderless country loaded with some $100 billion in debt and deprived of its infrastructure by the weeks of intensive bombing. Allegiance has been assured for two decades by a ruthless militaristic police state headed by the Baath Party with Mr. Hussein at its top. As this machinery crumbles, the country could well revert to tribal, sectarian and familial alliances -- and bloodshed as old accounts are settled. Another point of agreement is that claiming the mantle of leadership in the Middle East -- a step taken over the last 40 years by leaders from Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Algeria and even by Saudi Arabians -- is no longer an option.
"There is no such thing as a leading Arab or Mideast state any more," says Adeed Dawisha, who teaches politics at George Mason University in Maryland and is spending a year in Egypt. "No one is able to play a role similar to that of America in this crisis. When the Americans go, rulers will have to get up on stage and face the music, at a time when all Arabs know their leaders were either boastful liars when they vowed to stand up to America or that they were helpless weaklings who hid behind the United States to fight Saddam."
"As for Saddam," Mr. Dawisha went on to say, "he will be widely seen as a loser even if sentiments are running high for him now among some Arabs. It will be like the Egyptian defeat of 1967 by Israel, which ended the myth of Egypt and its leadership of the Arab world long before Nasser died." Arab leaders already know their biggest problem will be to justify the legitimacy of their rule. Ever since Kuwait was invaded, the single theme on which Arab writers and commentators in the Arab media have almost unanimously agreed on has been the need for democracy and freedom.
Egypt, a key Arab ally of the United States that has always aspired to chart the way for Arab future, is hobbled by its crumbling economy and what is seen as the uninspired leadership of President Mubarak. And Syria is the least likely of the major Arab countries to play any big role because it is the country most distrusted by the Arab members of the anti-Iraqi coalition.
In North Africa, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are widely seen to have given Iraq what support they did largely because they felt their Islamic and secular opponents at home were using the gulf crisis to challenge their rule. After the war, these North African Arabs will be far too busy shoring up their sinking economies to play any role in shaping the new Arab world. And in the Arab east, Jordan and Yemen stand to emerge as losers whose leaders will get little sympathy from the Arab members of the anti-Iraqi coalition -- a position driven to a very large degree by the personal animosities that have so deeply taken hold among Arab leaders.
Indeed, the cutting insults traded over open airwaves in the last six months between Saddam Hussein, King Hussein of Jordan, President Ali Abdallah Saleh of Yemen and Yasir Arafat, on one side, and President Mubarak, King Fahd and Kuwaiti officials on the other, are enough to poison Arab politics for years to come.
Even beyond this disarray, perhaps the hardest blow already registered for the Arabs is that their oil has served them very little. The price has actually fallen, to under $20 a barrel, and the world made up virtually all of the missing oil exports from Kuwait and Iraq.
In a commentary on the interminable Arab feuds of the last 70 years in the weekend magazine of the French newspaper Le Figaro, one expert on the Mideast, Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, simply concluded that for the Arabs the only sure thing is that "the future is impossible."

HEADLINE: Desert Fog;
The Uncertain Time Beyond High Noon

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR one brief moment, as the clock struck noon yesterday, a certain clarity enveloped the Persian Gulf crisis. The choices for Saddam Hussein were crystal clear: humiliating surrender or military defeat. America and its allies were convinced their moral case was clear: good versus evil. And the final outcome, the coalition was promised, would also be clear: the total liberation of Kuwait, one way or another.
America and its allies would have done well to savor that moment, because once the fighting ends, high noon yesterday may be remembered as the last time anything about this conflict was clear. 
 Why? Because the clarity of this defining moment was produced by two very unusual, and fleeting, elements.
First, so much of the attention until now has been focused on achieving definable military objectives with high-tech weapons. In that sense, the clarity has been mesmerizing. Americans have been taken, through their televisions, into the nose cameras of smart bombs as they follow laser beams onto targets in Iraq. The enduring image is of perfect bull's-eyes, time after time.
Second, as the story evolved from one about defending rich Kuwaiti sheiks to one about defeating an evil dictator in Iraq, it assumed a moral clarity for many Americans unlike anything since the war against Hitler. Saddam Hussein was a mail-order despot right out of the Sears catalogue. He not only looked a bit sinister, but at every turn acted the pure villain and finally managed to alienate virtually the entire world.
Since the demise of the Soviet "Evil Empire" there has been a hunger among Americans for a moral clarity to justify and shape their foreign policy, and Mr. Hussein provided it in spades. The physical clarity inherent in military action, with its clearly defined means and ends, and the moral clarity provided by Mr. Hussein have made this a surprisingly popular war. But they have also been distracting in a way.
"They have obscured the fact that there is no comparable political clarity about what exactly we want out of this war and what we can expect to achieve," said Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard University. "What kind of Kuwait do we want? What kind of Iraq do we want? Will the region establish its own stability or will a permanent American military presence have to supply it? There is still an enormous confusion about our political aims and there is no laser-guided policy to help us. There is no night-vision equipment that can pierce the veils of Middle East politics and define the American role after this war is over." Indeed, just over the clear-cut horizon of this war lies a forest of ambiguities and paradoxes bathed in a half light.
Take the question of the "new world order" and the Middle East. For America's allies Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, this war is not being fought to build a new order, but to rebuild the status quo. What these societies want out of this war is not to give birth to Jeffersonian democracy but to go back to their insular worlds where women cannot drive and no Western reporters roam the streets, where Iraq will no longer be a threat and where everyone will abide by the unwritten rules and limits of the neighborhood known as the Middle East, without foreign policemen. There were certainly many worse governments and societies on the face of the earth than those being protected in the Persian Gulf, so the fact that they will be strengthened or preserved by this war is no crime. But will it be very satisfying?
Another paradox that lies ahead arises from the tremendous resentment between the haves and have-nots in the Arab world, a resentment Iraq's invasion of Kuwait exposed. The United States is expecting that after the war there will be some sort of redistribution of wealth to help prevent a repetition. But the war itself is costing Saudi Arabia so much that it has had to borrow money on the world capital markets to finance it, and the Kuwaitis will need every penny they have saved -- and more -- just to rebuild their country.
In other words, after this war is over the haves are not likely to have anything left for the have-nots. And even if they did, the fact that the have-nots -- Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, and the Palestinians -- all supported Iraq in this war already has the Arab oil states saying privately that they deserve nothing. When Mr. Baker proposed to Congress two weeks ago that a new Arab-funded bank for reconstruction and development be set up after the war, he was quietly told by both the White House and the Arabs to forget about it.
What about the possibilities for a wider Arab-Israeli peace? To be sure, if Saddam Hussein is decisively defeated and then ousted, there will be a much better chance than if he had been allowed a hero's exit, with his army intact. He offered the Arab world only false hopes for a military victory over Israel, and as long as his shadow dominated the Arab world nothing was possible. But how much is possible without him?
Ask the Israelis, for instance. At one level the destruction of Iraq's armed forces, as well as nuclear, chemical and biological potential, should leave them more relaxed than ever. The greatest strategic threat to their existence has been eliminated. Yet the Scud attacks, while they have done no military damage to Israel, have terrified the country in a way that is almost worse. No matter what the strategic reality is, Israelis' perception of their vulnerability has actually increased as a result of the war and the repeated trauma of having to rush into sealed rooms and affix gas masks each time the sirens wail. What security lesson will the Israelis draw? Perhaps that they should never give up an inch of territory because strategic depth is critical; after all, that is one reason tiny Kuwait perished. Or perhaps they will feel that all they gained from the West Bank's vaunted strategic depth was one second more of warning against the missiles.
Some in Washington already argue that the Saudis, Kuwaitis and others, who have demonstrated a previously unseen quality of pragmatism and forthrightness in openly siding with the United States against another Arab country, might finally openly deal with Israel. But this ignores the fact that it was only for reasons of survival that the Saudis joined forces with the United States, and that same survival instinct is likely to impel them to continue to shun Israel after this war. Israel's army is no threat to Saudi Arabia, but an Israeli embassy in Riyadh would make the Saudis a gigantic target. In contrast to smart bombs, which navigate themselves right to the core of a problem, smart Arab politicians step around problems -- especially one as sensitive as Israel.
Another paradox is that Saddam Hussein's cynical, but repeated, declarations that he raped Kuwait in order to liberate Palestine have probably pushed the Palestine question to the top of the agenda to be taken up after the war. But that has happened at a time when the question of who should represent the Palestinians will be more wide open than at any moment since the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in 1964. Yasir Arafat, by supporting the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, may have reinforced his popularity with his own people, but he lost all moral credibility with the Israeli peace movement, totally alienated his financial backers among the Arab gulf states and his political backers in Egypt, and generally disgusted every leader in America and Europe who overtly or tacitly was ready to work with him. So just when there will be the most pressure to address the Palestinian issue, there will be the least inclination to deal with the Palestinians' chosen representative.
Yet another paradox to emerge from this war is what it has revealed about United States-Soviet relations. The gulf crisis began with an unprecedented degree of American-Soviet cooperation to settle a regional conflict, but it is ending with the two superpowers seemingly elbowing each other, while professing what great friends they remain. That elbowing has taken the form of a Soviet peace proposal that seemed to give their former client Saddam Hussein something of a face-saving exit, and an American ultimatum that he had two choices: military humiliation or political humilation.
The lesson of this episode is that while the cold war is over, geopolitics is not. The crisis has reminded us that simply because the Soviet Union's foreign policy may no longer be driven by a desire to spread the Communist gospel, Americans should not expect competition between Moscow and Washington to cease. As with natural adversaries in the jungle, economic, territorial and security imperatives drive Moscow and Washington to compete for resources and influence, irrespective of whether Lenin is in the Kremlin or Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
So at this moment of clarity, it is worth stepping back for a moment and recalling a lesson of Middle Eastern history. Up to now the only modern Middle East war that ended with a clear-cut victory was Israel's defeat of the Arabs in 1967. But that clear-cut victory proved to be untranslatable into political gains. It produced as many political-security problems for Israel as it did benefits. Ironically, it was the 1973 war -- which ended in something of a stalemate -- that laid the basis for the only agreements between Egypt and Israel and Israel and Syria.
President Bush's ability to bring the gulf crisis to the clear-cut moment of decision that it reached yesterday seems now to be a diplomatic and military masterstroke. But wars are fought for political ends and one cannot help but wonder how this current clarity will translate at the end of the day.
"Americans are thinking in highly self-enclosed terms about this conflict," said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi. "Clarity is a cultural value of democracies, where governments are judged by performance and are accountable only to the living. Politics in the Middle Easte is governed more by the accumulated weight of history, traditions and tribal animosities -- and certainly not performance alone. That is why this region has never been hospitable to straight lines or clear endings."
That is also why the Middle East has been so resistant to political engineering all these years and why it is probably the worst corner in the world to try to begin constructing a new world order. Then again, maybe this time will be different. In any event, soon the smoke will clear and a new day will dawn in the Middle East. The only question is: Will it be tomorrow or yesterday?

Fujimori In the Time Of Cholera

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: LIMA , Peru

 BODY:
WHEN Alberto Fujimori took control of the Peruvian Government last July, many remarked that seldom had a new President inherited a nation in such disarray. Peru was suffering from 24 consecutive months of hyperinflation. Eighty percent of its work force was either underemployed or unemployed. Economic output had fallen 20 percent over the course of two years. One-third of the country was malnourished. The Shining Path guerrilla organization was causing havoc in the highlands. And more than 40 leaders of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, the second largest terrorist group, had just escaped from Lima's top security prison.
Today, economists, terrorist experts and social workers talk sympathetically of Mr. Fujimori's attempts to fix what some say can't be fixed. They say that any progress in the seven months since he took over from Alan Garcia has been marginal. 
 "Garcia left a country in ruins, destroyed," said Raul Salazar, an economist with Macroconsult, an economic firm in Lima. "Considering that Fujimori started with nothing, he has done better than we had hoped. Still, at this moment that is far from sufficient."
A cholera epidemic, which has left more than 110 dead, 5,000 hospitalized and more than 23,000 affected, is the latest assault on a society already stretched to the limit. Drug trafficking continues almost unabated. Terrorism has caused the United States Embassy to caution against traveling in Peru. In Lima, three million people are without running water and sewer systems. The city's harbor is badly polluted, as is its main river. Just making sure the garbage is collected is a major struggle every day.
And just as the Government was able to claim some progress in the fight against cholera -- in particular a reduction in the mortality rate -- health officials began warning last week that malaria, rabies and dengue fever were also beginning to become problems in the country's jungle interior.
Are there any bright spots? Economists point to only one: the fight against inflation.
After he assumed office, Mr. Fujimori instituted what he called an economic shock, removing long-standing Government subsidies and raising prices between 1,000 and 3,000 percent on some products, such as gasoline, electricity and food. It was a one-time attempt to wring inflation out of the system and begin to open the economy to foreign investment.
While that caused an immediate 400 percent inflation in August, inflation fell below 10 percent from September through November, jumped to 23 percent in December and fell back to 16 percent in January.
That still indicates an annual rate in excess of 100 percent, but economists say it is a sign that the Government has established a serious anti-inflation policy, now considered key for any Latin American economy to begin on the road back to economic health.
But the process Mr. Fujimori has mapped out is going to take time, and analysts wonder if the Peruvian people -- primarily the lower middle class and the poor, who are hardest hit by the removal of the subsidies and are sinking deeper into poverty -- will wait that long.
Peru, strapped for cash, cannot borrow on the international markets, and thus might have to wait years before it can begin critical new projects to deliver water, electricity and health care.
In the meantime, Mr. Fujimori is being criticized because of almost negligible progress on other fronts. Western officials complain that in the drug arena, the three branches of the Peruvian police are archrivals, that they do not often share intelligence information and that investigative skills are very weak.
 
Fighting Drugs, Sort Of

The Army rotates its commanders in the biggest drug areas every 6 to 12 months, so that about the time a commander is skilled in drug interdiction he is removed. Moreover, the army appears unwilling to control even municipal airports in areas such as the upper Huallaga Valley, where cocaine base is shipped out of Peru to Colombia. American officials say as many as seven flights with up to 300 kilos of cocaine base leave some of these airports every day.
The battle between the army and the Shining Path, considered one of the greatest threats to the national security of the country, also poses great complexities for Mr. Fujimori. The clandestine Maoist group is increasing the number of killings among villagers in the Peruvian highlands. And a frustrated Peruvian army is coming under more and more criticism from human rights groups that say it is engaging in indiscriminate killings and torture.
Perhaps the most pointed personal criticism of Mr. Fujimori concerns his combative style and his apparent unwillingness to work with members of Congress on legislation. Almost 98 percent of all new laws and regulations instituted in Peru during the Fujimori administration have been by executive order, without the approval of the Congress, a pattern set by earlier presidents.
"He is very autocratic, ruling almost like a king," said Mr. Salazar.
Hernando de Soto, an economist and perhaps President Fujimori's chief policy adviser, says he welcomes the free fall in the Peruvian economy, because Mr. Fujimori is gambling that an atmosphere of political and social crisis will pave the way for the major changes that Mr. Fujimori thinks the country needs.
"This society is collapsing, without a doubt," Mr. de Soto said last week. "There is no respect for the state, the parliament, the laws, the judicial system, not even the traffic lights. Nothing works here. But the problems here are so entrenched that you have to have a collapse before you can implement fundamental changes in the political system."

Inner-City Youths And Students Working Together

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
Students at Syra cuse University are teaming up with inner-city youths to help out around the community.
The collaboration, called "S.U. Students and Company," is the basis of a policy studies class called "Community Problem Solving." 
 Five groups of three or four undergraduates and five youths each meet weekly to work with public agencies.
Craig Owens, a 15-year-old freshman at Nottingham High School, volunteers at the Syracuse Developmental Center. He said he was scared the first time his group went to the center, and was shocked by some of the people there. Now, he said, he looks forward to going with his group, which calls itself Brothers Helping Others.
 
'It Keeps Me Off the Street'
 "They like to see us come and help them out," he said. "It makes me feel happy. I'm helping them by being a gentleman and singing and reading with them and bowling with them."
The program also gives youths like Craig a glimpse of college life. Groups go for pizza or play basketball together.
"It keeps me off the street, where I don't need to be," Craig said.
The undergraduate course is taught by William Coplin, director of the Syracuse public affairs program, who has had his students working in the community for 12 years. This semester was the first time they joined forces with disadvantaged youths.
"The idea is to have people on the receiving end to actually be giving," Professor Coplin said. "We always say, 'Well, you are disadvantaged, so let me help you.' Now we are saying to them, 'You can help, too.' It helps build self-esteem to realize others have terrible situations, and they can help."
Shontay Brooks, a 17-year-old senior at Henninger High School, said he has already received more from the program than he expected.
"Teens are most likely not going to want to do volunteer work," he said. "We just want fun, fun, fun. This is mixed fun and work."
 
'A Chance to Be in Control'
 Samuel Imbolli, a senior policy studies, music and economics major from Granby, N.Y., said it is rewarding to see how much the patients apppreciate the group's efforts. "We're not changing their lives in the three weeks we volunteer," he said, "but last week one of the patients said to me, 'This is the most fun I've had in a long time.' "
Sharon Ladin, a 1985 policy studies graduate who suggested the program to Professor Coplin and who now works as child-watch coordinator for the Children's Defense Fund, said such programs expose the participants to conditions they never knew existed.
"It is giving youths a chance to be in control of something," she said. "No matter where you are in a station of life, you always have something to give. It helps people to see they are not at the bottom of the barrel."
After three weeks of community service, each group will produce a public-service announcement to be filmed and broadcast by University Union Television, the on-campus station. Each advertisement will identify a social problem that the youths believe needs to be addressed. The announcements will be shown at a graduation ceremony in April, where the youths will receive certificates and T-shirts for their participation.

To cope with the problem of global warming, the University of Iowa has formed an interdisciplinary Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research, encompassing 15 of its academic departments.
The center's co-director, Jerald Schnorr, a professor in environmental engineering, says he believes it is the first such consortium in the nation to focus on regional climate, the level at which public policy can be enacted. 
 Professor Schnorr, who recently edited a series of reports on the Exxon Valdez oil spill for a publication of the American Chemical Society, said an interdisciplinary approach makes sense because climate change in the Upper Midwest does not fit neatly into a single discipline.
"If we don't form interdisciplinary centers like this one, we will fail to address the critical and emerging needs of society," he said.
The center consists of 34 faculty members, but its flow chart does not show departmental affiliations. "Problems such as global change are hindered by our disciplinary barriers," Professor Schnorr said. "If the various disciplines aren't talking, I think they miss part of the story."
 
Geology and Geography
 For some, the exchange has already paid off in new ideas and methodologies.
George Baker, a geology professor, researches climate history by studying the remains of vegetation. Through the center he learned of a professor in geography who constructed computer models of climate and vegetation.
By combining their work, the two scholars were able to work backward and determine what the climate was like 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. That, in turn, will help determine whether current climatic changes are part of a normal cycle or were a result of human activity.
"Probably neither one of us would have thought of that on our own," Professor Baker said.
A professor and hydrology engineer, Witold Krajewski, said his involvement with the center "has given me new ammunition to appeal to students to broaden their horizons beyond engineering."
"It is appealing to students to see the strong connection between science and engineering," Professor Krajewski said.
 
'The Big Picture'
 The opportunity to expand beyond a single field of study has attracted some graduate students to the university. Kurt Paterson, a doctoral candidate in environmental engineering from Davenport, Iowa, who is studying regional climate change, turned down an offer from a larger institution because it asked him to narrow his research interests.
"I had trouble finding one narrow topic that I felt I could really be interested in for the rest of my life," Mr. Paterson said. The chance to study outside the environmental engineering department, in fields as diverse as biology, chemistry and law, he said, gives him "a feel for the big picture."
Another doctoral candidate in environmental engineering, Todd Reese of Des Moines, said he believed that interdisciplinary centers like Iowa's would become increasingly popular, in part because of the opportunities that they offer researchers.
 
Can Attract Funds
 "Money's tight," Mr. Reese said. "Centers are big. They're good for young investigators who need a start and have good ideas that are difficult to fund, and they're good for the Federal Government that wants to streamline some of its operations."
But Teri Camery, a general studies junior from Atlantic, Iowa, who is studying the environment, worries that the center diverts too many resources from educating students.
"The center is another example of their having all this for research," she said. "Why can't they give some of it back to the students?"
As vice president of the University of Iowa's Environmental Coalition, Ms. Camery undertook a campaign to establish an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in environmental studies but she said she had found that environmental classes had been cut from the curriculum, partly because of a lack of faculty time. "The more time the teachers have to do research, the less time they have to teach," she said.
Iowa offers degrees in environmental studies through its geology and geography departments, but Ms. Camery seeks an interdisciplinary degree that incorporates political science and economics.
 
Arose From Conference
 "There's no way you can implement scientific solutions to environmental problems without a broad understanding of the problems that caused them," she said.
The center recognizes this and so have faculty members who study public policy, like David J. Forkenbrook, director of Iowa's Public Policy Center who was a co-founder of the interdisciplinary group.
The center grew out of a 1989 conference on climate change sponsored by Professors Forkenbrook and Schnorr and by Gregory R. Carmichael, a chemical-biochemical engineering professor.
The same year, Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, as head of the National Governors' Association, proposed an initiative to study the issue and its possible effect on the region's economy. A tax on utilities that was enacted last June is expected to bring the center its first financing this July, about $325,000.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: N.Y.U.;
Sleep-to-the-Beat Flops in a Dorm Over a Nightclub

 BODY:
A newly opened no-alcohol night club, the Ultra Violet Dance Club, has already become a mixed blessing for New York University. Students who were looking for such a club on campus say they are delighted, while students living in Goddard Residence Hall, which houses the Ultra Violet, say they are deafened.
Now, N.Y.U. administrators are trying to keep the club open and the dorm residents happy. 
 A dozen Goddard Hall students have complained about Ultra Violet's din, Chancellor Lawrence J. Oliva told a Feb. 14 University Senate meeting. He reminded the Senate that the club's "spectacular opening" three weeks ago was made amid "assurances that the noise would not disturb students."
Mr. Oliva said that the university has "taken steps to handle that issue," forming a committee of Goddard residents, N.Y.U. administrators and members of the university committee on student life, and headed by the president of the Student Senate, John Calvo, a senior economics major from Passaic, N.J.
 
 'The D.J.'s Are Out'
 In the meantime, Mr. Oliva said, "the D.J.'s are out" for the rest of the semester at the club, and quieter entertainment -- perhaps unamplified musicians and comedians -- will be tried.
Students living in Goddard, which is on the university's main quad, have complained about the noise from the club since it opened Jan. 31 in the first-floor space that by day is the Violet Cafe. Goddard residents said, too, that university administrators had promised to close it down if there were any problems -- a promise that N.Y.U. officials deny making. The nightclub is open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 P.M. to 1 A.M.
Susan Schwartz, a freshman from Somerville, N.J. majoring in dance education, said noise from the club had disrupted her schedule.
"I have a 9 o'clock class on Fridays, so I wanted to go to sleep," said Ms. Schwartz, whose room is on Goddard's second floor, "but the bed would shake and the noise was so loud."
 
A Failure 5 Blocks Away
 Sally Arthur, the university's assistant vice president for student life, said the impetus for a nonalcoholic university club came from a resident assistant who two years ago suggested opening one. The drinking age in New York was raised to 21 from 18 several years ago. In 1989, students opened the Gallery in the Barney Building, about five blocks from the main quad, but Ms. Arthur said it failed because it was "too far off the beaten path."
With a $100,000 grant from the Hayden Foundation, the university tried again, installing video screens and lighting to transform the Violet Cafe into the Ultra Violet at night. Ms. Arthur said that part of the start-up money went to insulating the ceiling to deaden sound.
Last fall, before work on the club began, Goddard students and university administrators met to discuss the project. Views now diverge on what was said then.
 
Soundproofing Weak
 Austin Hodgens, a senior film major from Brooklyn and the Goddard dormitory government president, said that Naomi Levine, the university's vice president for external affairs, assured him that if the noise became a problem the club would be closed.
Although both Ms. Levine and Ms. Arthur agree that the soundproofing does not work as they hoped, they insist that they made no such promise.
"I assured them we will take care of the problem," Ms. Levine said. "We thought that this would be an asset to the student body."
Right now, she said, she wants to change the form of entertainment at the Ultra Violet and the use of the rooms above the club.
Ms. Levine said last week that the four rooms directly over the club will not be used by dorm residents next year and may be converted into recreation space or a place for commuter students to lodge.

HEADLINE: CRAFTS;
A History Told in Patches and Patterns

BYLINE: By PATRICIA MALARCHER

 BODY:
THE fragmented patterns of American quilts can serve as lenses, revealing multifaceted views of historic and domestic events. Through the colors, textures and associative value of fabrics the quilts also convey the "feeling tone" of their periods. Both effects can be found in a cluster of exhibitions now in the county that, collectively, chart a continuum of quilt-making from the 18th through the 20th centuries.
Forty quilts spanning two centuries were assembled for "Quilts: The Patterns of History" in the Castle Gallery at New Rochelle College. "Piece by Piece," a presentation of a dozen quilts at the Rye Arts Center, at 51 Milton Road, focuses on the early 20th century, especially the lesser-known quilts of the 1920's and 30's. And a block away, the Rye Historical Society, at 1 Purchase Street, has a "mini exhibition" of 19th-century quilts from New York State. 
"We wanted to give an overview of quilts that would reflect historical events," explained Barbara Davis of New Rochelle, a historian who organized the show at the college with Helaine Fendelman of Scarsdale, an antiques authority. The show will run through April 21. Ms. Fendelman will present a lecture, open to the public, at the college's Romita Auditorium on Wednesday at 10:30 A.M. The admission fee is $5.
 
Panoramas of the Past
 The panoramic sweep of time and subject ranges from the days of clipper ships (a 1790 tufted seaman's quilt) to the present (a 1990 quilt by a black feminist). The proliferation of the American flag as a bold motif lends a note of timeliness to the show.
The past seems intimately present in a wool flannel quilt from Pennsylvania made from Civil War uniforms -- both blue and gray. The urgency of the 19th-century suffragette movement permeates the fund-raising quilt in red, white and blue with stitched-on names of donors, among them Susan B. Anthony.
Although esthetic value was not a factor for selection, a number of the quilts are visually stunning. In an Alabama log cabin quilt, from up close one sees humble fabrics used for everyday apparel, while a distant vantage point transforms them into fields of glowing colors. "Lone Star," an eye-dazzler with triangles and vibrating yellows, reds and blues, shows another popular pattern.
"In Honor Shall Wave," is a pictorial "whole cloth" quilt made of uncut fabric rather than patches. From edge to edge this is covered with images outlined in thread. Whether the pictures were commercially available, their random juxtapositions -- for instance, a zebra stands a few inches from a spinning wheel -- suggest a quirky personal vision.
A 1920's "Patch Poster" by Cora Scovil, who invented the department store mannequin, seems to anticipate contemporary art quilts not otherwise represented here. Having been a guest in a prominent home, Ms. Scovil made her hosts a quilt that depicted their daughters at camp -- lifesize, in real khaki for the uniforms.
"Being in Total Control of Herself," curiously titled for a quilt that depicts a somewhat tipsy Statue of Liberty, was created by Yvonne Wells, a contemporary artist updating the folk tradition of black American quilts.
A common theme connecting the shows are the precisely geometric Amish quilts, in which the dominant black elements keep rich, clear colors apart. Both shows also contain crazy quilts, with energetic surfaces created by wildly irregular pieces of satin and velvet as well as commemorative ribbons and memorabilia. Although the style is quintessentially Victorian, the Rye crazy quilt on exhibit was dated 1915.
Also in both are pieces borrowed from Robert and Ardis James of Chappaqua, whose extensive quilt collection has been discussed in newspapers and magazines.
 
Flowered Feed Sacks
 Curated by Virginia Avery of Port Chester, a master quilter and author, the show at the Rye Center spotlights the largely unrecognized quilt movement during the Depression.
According to information that accompanies the exhibition, quilting then was encouraged as a means of being frugal and industrious. In 1933, the label text states, 2,500 entries were submitted to a quilt contest sponsored by Sears. The winning quilt, which received a $1,200 award, was presented to Eleanor Roosevelt.
Except for an Art Deco shooting star design and an interpretation of "Sunbonnet Sue" -- inspired by a 1902 children's book, this motif was a fad in the 20's and 30's -- most of the quilts at the center are similar in pattern to their antecedents in the 19th century.
Still, their fabrics lend them a period flavor. For instance, the economic stringency of the 1930's was reflected in a quilt made from feed sacks with floral patterns. As a product of giveaway materials, this contrasts with a turn-of-the-century quilt in New Rochelle sewn from patches of silk that were promotional incentives in cigarette packages.
A quilt made from 4,000 small hexagons in a variation on the pattern called Grandmother's flower garden was the tour de force among the center's quilts.
Enlivening this gallery iare the crafts people working on a communal quilt. Each of its 42 patches was designed and executed by a local organization. Each patch symbolizes the work of the organization. After a tour to the churches, schools and other institutions represented in it, it will be given to the Rye Historical Society.
The quilts here at the art center, and at the historical society, will be on view through March 3.
As do the other two shows, the display at the Rye Historical Society includes an appliqued album quilt. Made by one woman for her granddaughter, this one departs from the tradition of the album quilt as a collective effort of friends.
The other two quilts, described as "important to Rye" by the curator, Kathlene Scheuer, were made by Amanda Haywood Halstead, the wife of a prominent Rye citizen, for her trousseau. Another quilt from the society's collection is in the New Rochelle show.
Hours at the Castle Gallery in New Rochelle are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays and noon to 4 P.M. on weekends.
The Rye Art Center is open Mondays through Saturdays from 10 to 4 and Sundays from noon to 4.
The Rye Historical Society is open Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from 2:30 to 4:30 P.M.; Tuesdays and Saturdays from 12:30 to 4:30 P.M.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Key West

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SKIPP; CATHERINE SKIPP, who works in the Miami bureau of The Times, has visited Key West many times.

 BODY:
Key West has found a new voice of late. It's German, French, Dutch, Spanish and Japanese. Foreign tourists from Europe, the Far East and South America are packing Mallory Square at sunset, filling up the Conch Train on tours and snapping up sponges, cigars and shells that are native to the southernmost United States city.
This new Key West is more gentrified and prosperous. Gone is the overwhelming presence of tacky T-shirt shops and noisy dive bars, although enough remain to let the visitor know that Key West is proud of its checkered past. In their place along Duval Street, the Old Town's main drag, are increasing numbers of upscale shops and cafes selling tropical clothing, art, perfumes and food from around the globe. 
 Key West enjoys a rich history from the days when its residents made a good living salvaging shipwrecks tossed upon its shores. In 1912 the Overseas Railway was completed to Key West, making the city an overnight stop between Miami and Havana.
Key West dances to a different beat from the mainland, a mixture of Old Havana built in New England and painted in the crazy colors of the Caribbean. The town is very lively for its size but the pace is 16 r.p.m.
 
Culture
 Several small theaters provide diversions. The Red Barn Theater (319 Duval Street; 296-9911) presents "Smoke on the Mountain," a gospel musical, until March 17, followed by "Sunshine," a new play by William Mastrosimone, the author of "Extremities," March 27 to April 14. Curtain is at 8 P.M. Wednesday through Sunday. Tickets $15; no credit cards.
The Waterfront Playhouse (Mallory Square; 294-5015) will present "Driving Miss Daisy" through today, "Eastern Standard," a comedy drama about yuppies living in New York, March 20 to 24 and 27 to 31. Tickets $12; no credit cards.
The Tennessee Williams Fine Arts Center (5901 West Junior College Road, Stock Island; 296-9081) will present the Jose Limon Dance Company next Tuesday and Wednesday, dancers from the New York City Ballet March 5 and 6, "Mask, Myth and Magic" with the magician Jeff McBride on March 14 and "Death Trap" from March 21 to 23 and 29 and 30. Tickets from $10 to $20 except for the New York City Ballet, when prices will range from $20 to $30.
 Chamber music is performed at the Casa Gato, a building that dates to 1885 (1209 Virginia Street; 296-5713ok). The pianist Mack McCrae will perform on March 17. Tickets $12.50.
 
Sightseeing
 The Conch Tour Train (Mallory Square or Roosevelt Boulevard; 294-5161) is a series of open-air cars that run on the town's streets, making a 14-mile, 90-minute narrated trip. Tours leave from Roosevelt Boulevard every hour on the half hour between 9:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. and from Mallory Square every half hour between 9 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. Trips are $11.
Another 90-minute tour is offered by Old Town Trolley (1910 North Roosevelt Boulevard at Garrison Bight; 296-6688), which has pickups at most of the major hotels and four stops downtown. It allows passengers to get off one trolley and board another one later. Tickets are $12. Trolleys run daily every 30 minutes from 8:55 A.M. to 4:55 P.M. from North Roosevelt Boulevard.
Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and Museum (200 Greene Street; 294-2633) displays jewels, coins and gold and silver bars brought up from the wrecks of the Atocha and Margarita, two Spanish galleons sunk in a hurricane in 1622 40 miles southwest of Key West. Open daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission $5.
Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum (907 Whitehead Street; 294-1575) is a two-story Spanish Colonial house built in 1851, which the author bought in 1931. A 30-minute guided tour begins every 10 minutes from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission $6, $1.50 for children.
Key West Aquarium (1 Whitehead Street; 296-2051) features hundreds of fish that inhabit the waters around Key West and a touch tank with starfish, horseshoe crabs and, of course, conchs. Open daily 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Admission $5.
 
Night Life
 Every evening begins at Mallory Dock, where Key West gathers to watch the sun go down. Street performers stage everything from juggling, escape acts to card tricks.
The best by far is "Dominique and His Circus Cats." The cats, Spot, Piggy, Mars and Sharkey, look like ordinary house pets, but this Frenchman has transformed them into stars in a miniature lion-taming act, flaming hoops and all. Street vendors sell jewelry, basketwork and painted T-shirts.
At Flagler's, a restaurant at the Casa Marina Resort (1500 Reynolds Street; 296-3535), the Toni Bishop combo performs Wednesday through Saturday. Other entertainers appear the rest of the week. Henry Flagler's 1921 hotel provides an elegant backdrop for Miss Bishop's contemporary jazz and blues from 9 P.M. to 1 A..M. No cover.
 Havana Docks, at the Pier House Resort (1 Duval Street; 296-4600) hops on Friday and Saturday nights with sailors from the nearby Navy base. Live entertainment nightly with a $2 cover. Open Sunday to Thursday from 4 P.M. to 2 A.M., Friday and Saturday until 4 A.M.
Sloppy Joe's (201 Duval Street; 294-5717) was one of Hemingway's hangouts. It is a popular spot, though loud and sometimes rowdy, and is open 9 A.M. to 4 A.M. from Monday to Saturday and noon to 4 A.M. on Sunday, with live entertainment in the afternoon and evening. After 8 P.M. there is usually a cover charge, either $1 or $2.
Capt. Tony's Saloon (428 Greene Street; 294-1838) is a block away and smaller. It was built in 1852 and was used as a morgue and ice house. It was also the site of Sloppy Joe's until 1938, when Sloppy Joe's moved to Duval Street. Open 10 A.M. to 4 A.M.
 
Getting Around
 Some of the best ways to see the Old Town section of Key West are by foot, bike, moped or scooter.
Bubba's Fun Rentals (705 Duval Street; 294-2618) rents 10-speed mountain bikes for $10 a day ($5 for four hours, $8 for eight hours) or $40 by the week.
Tropical Bicycles & Scooter Rentals (1300 Duval Street; 294-8136) rents bikes for $5 a day or $25 by the week and Honda Elite scooters for $23 a day ($12 for four hours, $18 for eight hours) or $89.95 by the week. Cars also available for $22.95 a day.
 
The Outdoors
 Fort Zachary Taylor State Historic Site and Smathers Beach are the only public beaches on the island. They are pleasant but not exceptional.
At Smathers Beach, Sunset Watersports (296-2554) rents windsurfers ($15 an hour), jet skis ($35 a half hour), 16-foot Hobie cats ($30 an hour) and offers parasailing at $50 for a ride of eight to 10 minutes.
 Deep-sea fishing is readily available; there are about 60 charter boats in Key West. Bill Kieldsen at Fishbuster (Garrison Bight Marina, Eaton Street and Roosevelt Boulevard; 296-9969) runs a 56-foot Lamay and charges $100 a seat for a half day and $150 a seat for a full day. Full boat is $600, maximum of six people; $400 for the half day. For fishing for tarpon and bonefish, Capt. Marshall Cutchin (296-1020) leaves from Garrison Bight Marina and charges $200 a half day or $300 a full day for the boat, with a maximum of two people.
 
Places to Stay
 The Reach (Simonton Street, at the ocean; 296-5000) and the Hyatt Key West (601 Front Street; 296-9900) are the two newer luxury hotels in town, on opposite ends of Old Town. Both offer a variety of water sports, bike and scooter rental and dining. Rates at both start at $215 for a double.
Marriott's Casa Marina (Reynolds Street on the ocean; 296-3535) is a beautiful old hotel that has been expanded and renovated many times since it opened in 1921. The public rooms are spectacular and the hotel has the best beach in Key West. It offers a lavish brunch for $24.95 per person on Sunday. Rates from $210 to $695 for a two-bedroom suite.
The Pier House (1 Duval Street; 296-4600) is close to all downtown activities. It has a small beach. Rates from $235 to $725.
 The Marquesa (600 Fleming Street; 292-1919) is a beautifully restored Victorian home that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Fifteen rooms around a pool cost from $175 to $275 a night.
The Curry Mansion Inn (511 Caroline Street; 294-5349) is a wonderful Victorian home that is open to the public as a museum during the day. The rooms are small and nicely appointed with vintage furnishings. There is a swimming pool where breakfast and cocktails are served. Prices from $140 to $200 a night, including breakfast, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres at happy hour.
Budget choice: Most of the economy chains have hotels on Route 1 coming into Old Town but Holiday Inn La Concha (430 Duval Street; 296-2991) is right in the heart of Old Town. It was built in 1925 and was renovated and reopened in 1987. Rates from $87 to $400 a night. The rooms on the second floor overlooking Duval Street can be noisy.
 
Dining
 Seafood is the mainstay of the island's fare and much of the fish served in restaurants is caught locally.
Cafe des Artistes (1007 Simonton Street; 294-7100) serves local seafood prepared with French techniques in a pleasant setting; some tables are outdoors on a balcony. Lamb, veal and duck are also on the menu. Open for dinner from 6 to 11 P.M. Dinner for two, about $100 with wine.
 A nice choice for an elegant evening on the town is Cafe Marquesa (600 Fleming Street; 292-1244 or 292-1919),
a beautifully decorated, well-run small restaurant serving new American cuisine. Dinner for two with wine $54 to $60.
Dim Sum (613 1/2 Duval Street; 294-6230) serves a wonderful mix of Asian food. Open daily for dinner; reservations suggested. Dinner for two about $45 with wine.
 La Creperie (124 Duval Street; 294-7677) is a small restaurant owned by Rene Cagnat, a third-generation French chef. The most expensive thing on the dinner menu is langouste au beurre blanc at $19.50. Open Monday to Friday from 11:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. for lunch; dinner weekdays from 5 to 10 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 6 to 10 P.M. Dinner for two with wine averages $40, lunch about $17.

HEADLINE: Lumbering in the Age of the Baby Tree

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
Harry A. Merlo, chief executive of the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, has always been willing to move in one direction when the rest of the forest products industry was moving in another. He bought forest land when others were selling and fought the labor unions when others were negotiating. He largely shuns Wall Street, paper-pushing and industry trade groups, preferring instead to cut the figure of a swashbuckler, overseeing his empire by flying from sawmill to sawmill, decked out in cowboy boots and a leather jacket.
"Harry Merlo is considered kind of a rogue in the industry," said John Maack, an analyst with the Crabbe-Huson Company, a Portland money management firm. 
 Now, however, Mr. Merlo is pursuing an audacious plan that the rest of the industry is having to follow. He is trying to create a forest products company that doesn't need trees.
Well, not exactly all trees, but at least the big trees upon which the industry has relied until now.
The supply of those big trees, which can be made into prime lumber, is rapidly disappearing in the United States. Forest products companies say it is because environmentalists, worried about such things as the spotted owl, are unnecessarily restricting logging. Environmentalists say it is because rapacious lumber companies have cut down the big trees faster than they can be replenished.
For whatever reason, the industry is undergoing a major shift from an era in which it took big pieces of wood and cut them into smaller products to one in which it takes small pieces and builds them into bigger products. And Mr. Merlo, a driven man who rose from rags to riches, has been at the forefront.
"He probably has had more vision in understanding the dynamics of the wood products industry than any other manager in the business," said Evadna Lynn, forest products analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds.
Instead of waiting for big trees to grow, Mr. Merlo envisions an era in which trees are grown quickly and cut by machines at a young age. From there, the trees are chipped into little pieces, then glued together to make boards. Such engineered wood products, as they are sometimes called, can be made with less manpower and less money than waiting for trees to ripen to old age and using lumberjacks to cut them down.
Indeed, Mr. Merlo says, in some cases forests won't even be needed. Instead, trees will be grown on agricultural "fiber farms," just as farmers now grow corn.
But environmentalists say Louisiana-Pacific is far from environmentally benign and has always tried to get away with as much as it can. While some say that harvesting young trees on farmland is acceptable, they are irked by the prospect that trees in the forest will also be cut down at a young age.
 
More Efficient at Abuse?
"They are just more efficient at abusing resources than any other forest products company I know of," said Gail Lucas, head of the forest products task force for the Sierra Club in California. "Growing baby trees and grinding them up to make products is not laudable."
Added Eric Swanson, an environmentalist in Branscomb, Calif., "We're ending up with a totally redesigned forest that's just a parody."
Indeed, if California is any indication, environmentalists might shift some of their efforts from preserving old trees to preventing the premature cutting of young trees. Last year, the California Department of Forestry prohibited Louisiana-Pacific from logging in an area that had last been harvested 15 years ago, the first time the regulators had stopped trees from being cut because they were too young.
Mr. Merlo has been implementing his vision for 10 years. Portland-based Louisiana-Pacific has become the industry leader in marketing a product known as oriented strand board, which is made by gluing and pressing together wood flakes from trees like aspen that formerly had little commercial value and could be acquired cheaply.
Oriented strand board now accounts for 20 percent of the market once held by plywood, which is made by peeling layers from large trees and gluing them together. The strand board is more uniform than plywood, costs less and could continue to gain share. "It takes a lot of people and a good log to make plywood," Mr. Merlo said in an interview here.
Engineered wood products account for 26 percent of Louisiana-Pacific's revenues, which totaled $1.79 billion in 1990. Meanwhile, the company has reduced its dependence on lumber from big trees to 32 percent of revenues, from 53 percent 10 years ago.
Now the 65-year-old Mr. Merlo has embarked upon another new way of making products without using big trees. His company has started making gypsum wallboard using recycled newspaper. Wastepaper, he said, "is the largest remaining forest that has no owls and woodpeckers, and you don't even need a chain saw."
 
Some Good Numbers
 So far, the moves have largely met with success. Louisiana-Pacific's revenues have gone up about 50 percent in the last five years and its profit margins in wood products have generally been above average.
Mr. Merlo's record is not universally praised, however. Some analysts say that Louisiana-Pacific, unlike most other lumber companies, chose not to get heavily into the paper business, which is more capital intensive but less volatile than wood products. The result is that Louisiana-Pacific is hurt more than many others by the current steep slump in housing starts.
In the fourth quarter of 1990, the company reported its first loss since 1982 and it has been closing its mills for days at a time to cut expenses. Nonetheless, a strong balance sheet should allow it to ride out the slump.
Mr. Merlo is not pursuing his small-tree strategy because he likes environmentalists. But he realizes that environmental pressures will make big trees increasingly expensive and less available. "I don't think there is any way short of shutting down all the toilet tissue mills for six months to convince Americans that growing trees and harvesting them is good for the country," he said.
The strategy also fits in with Mr. Merlo's emphasis on cutting costs to the bone. "No one gets more out of a log for less than Louisiana-Pacific," he once wrote in an annual report. By using wood chips, the company can use small pieces of the tree that once had to be left on the ground.
Pressures to cut young trees are intensifying, industry executives and analysts say. Companies have harvested the easy pickings -- the trees that accumulated in the centuries before logging began. While trees have been replanted, some companies are facing a gap of 30 to 40 years before those trees reach full size.
Moreover, a tree grows fastest in its earliest years, while older trees might grow only a small percentage each year. A tree's growth is in some sense a measure of a company's return in it and companies say it makes no economic sense to earn a return of a few percent a year when interest rates are higher than that.
Mr. Merlo has always had his eye on the bottom line. The son of Italian immigrants, he grew up in Stirling City, a lumber town in northern California owned by the Diamond Match Company. His father piled boards in the lumber yard and made wine at home. His mother ran the town boarding house.
Mr. Merlo now talks about his mother, Clotilde, who died more than 20 years ago, in reverential terms. "I've seen him cry when he talks about her," said one executive.
Mr. Merlo said his mother taught him "common sense and courage," as well as a keen sense of frugality. According to one often-told story, young Harry salvaged bones and tripe from the town butcher for his mother to use in soup, thereby learning early in life how to make a living off what others considered waste.
 
Taking Over
 Mr. Merlo, who earned a degree from the University of California at Berkeley, was an executive at a small lumber company when it was purchased by Georgia-Pacific, an industry giant, in 1967.
Mr. Merlo helped improve profitability in Georgia-Pacific's California operations, and was one of the company's top executives in the early 1970's, when the Federal Trade Commission ruled that Georgia-Pacific was monopolizing the Southern plywood business. In an antitrust settlement, a new company, which took the name Louisiana-Pacific, was spun off in 1973 with Mr. Merlo as second in command. He took over in 1974.
Much of the strategy Mr. Merlo has followed at Louisiana-Pacific was born of necessity. The company began life without much timberland. Whatever unspoiled redwood forests it did have were taken from it in 1978 and incorporated into the Redwood National Park in California.
The company supplies only about 25 percent of its own wood, while other large competitors provide themselves with anywhere from 40 percent to nearly 100 percent. The rest of Louisiana-Pacific's wood comes from private landowners and from national forests. It is a major purchaser from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
Louisiana-Pacific does not invent its new products, but it is adept at implementing ideas from elsewhere, mainly from Europe, where the big forests have long been gone.
Mr. Merlo first came upon oriented strand board at an exhibit of a Canadian company at a Las Vegas trade show in the late 70's. He immediately left for Canada to tour oriented strand board plants. Other American companies also began getting into waferwood, as the product once was called, in the early 80's, but Louisiana-Pacific was the most aggressive.
 
Still Using Trees
 Mr. Merlo is not completely abandoning trees and lumber, however. Louisiana-Pacific is still the nation's largest producer of redwood lumber. In 1986, Mr. Merlo took advantage of the last industry downturn to double the company's ownership of timberlands. And last year, Louisiana-Pacific was among the first companies to explore the use of logs from Siberia, a huge potential source.
The company has also been more aggressive than others in cutting labor costs. In 1983, it was one of a group of large timber companies that bargained jointly with the unions in the Northwest. But Mr. Merlo broke with the other companies and demanded wage cutbacks. A long, bitter and sometimes violent strike ensued, but in the end, Mr. Merlo was the victor as the unions were decertified at the company's sawmills.
Last summer, Mr. Merlo raised the wrath of organized labor once more when Louisiana-Pacific became the first timber company to open a plant in Mexico. Raw lumber from California is shipped there to be dried and processed by laborers who get only a fraction of what California workers are paid.
Mr. Merlo is known for running a tight ship. Although the company has 13,000 employees, there are only about 100 people in its headquarters here. And it has only two vice presidents -- Lee Simpson for operations and John Hart for finance. After them come division managers, who have responsibility for a geographic area or a particular type of business.
Mr. Merlo practices what might be called management by flying around. He puts in more than 300,000 miles each year on the company's fleet of 15 aircraft, visiting Louisiana-Pacific's 120 plants and mills in 24 states and two Canadian provinces.
Mr. Merlo can be charismatic. He works hard for charities like the Salvation Army. And associates say he has been known to make gestures like anonymously buying a car for a needy nun.
But he is also extremely aggressive, can chew up those with whom he disagrees and has fired or driven away many top managers. Associates say he is obsessed with assuring himself a place in industry history.
Mr. Merlo has certain rules of behavior that everyone in the company must follow. Factories and mills, for instance, must be spotless. The rules even extend to personal fitness. Mr. Merlo detests overweight people, to the extent that weight plays a role in determining bonuses and promotions. "He doesn't like anyone with a big gut," said Tom Mock, sales manager at the company's plant in Red Bluff, Calif. "To him, that's a weakness."
 
Rented Mansion
 Mr. Merlo is also known for wearing fur coats and other touches of flamboyance. He lives in a mansion in Portland, valued on the company's books at more than $800,000, that he rents from Louisiana-Pacific for $2,200 a month. He also has a ranch in California's wine country.
And despite Mr. Merlo's emphasis on rules of behavior, Louisiana-Pacific has a reputation for pushing the rules to the limit. It was found guilty of fraud in its purchase of Fibreboard in 1978. (It spun off Fibreboard in 1988 to escape the mounting asbestos-related liability claims facing that company, which made asbestos before Louisiana-Pacific bought it.) And it was sued in 1989 by the Government for pollution at a pulp mill in California, a case that is pending. The company said those incidents sound more serious than they really are.
A key question facing Louisiana-Pacific is what happens when Mr. Merlo retires.
The heir apparent is James Eisses, manager of Louisiana-Pacific's northern division, who will take over the No. 2 spot when Mr. Simpson retires in June. An engineer by training who is said to be cut from the same aggressive cloth as Mr. Merlo, the 54-year-old Mr. Eisses has been instrumental in the company's move into engineered wood products.
But Mr. Merlo has no plans to retire. "My grandfather died in an accident when he was 98 and my father lived to 99," he said.
That thought might keep his competitors awake at night for many years to come.
 
 
 
TREATING TREES LIKE A CROP
 ELK CREEK, Calif. -- In hilly oak country, eucalyptus and poplar trees are growing in neat rows lined by black rubber irrigation hoses. "This is really more like agriculture, not forestry," said Greg Kostick, the project leader at the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's experimental "fiber farm."
The fiber farm could represent the future of the forest products industry -- at least in the vision of Harry A. Merlo.
With the shift from lumber products to engineered wood products that can be made with chips, Louisiana-Pacific and other companies no longer need big trees. In the future, they might not even need the forest.
Louisiana-Pacific is growing trees here on agricultural land, using agricultural techniques like irrigation and fertilization.
The 250-acre plot, on the edge of California's Central Valley, is the site of an old company sawmill that was shut in 1980 when the supply of trees from the nearby hills ran out.
The trees on the fiber farm will reach 60 feet in height and 8 to 10 inches in diameter in about seven years, large enough to be used for pulp or made into chips for use in waferwood. By contrast, pine, fir and other forest trees have to grow for 30 to 60 years.
By packing the trees close together and cutting quickly, the yield might be about twice as great as that of a typical forest, Mr. Kostick said.
The fiber farm has other advantages as well. Because the trees are planted in rows, they can be easily harvested by machines. And since this is farmland, not forest, environmentalists have fewer objections to cutting the trees.
The drawback is that while a forest tends to grow without much human help, tree farming needs as much tending as other types of agriculture. As a result, the economic viability of such fiber farms "is still up in the air," said Keith Gilless, a forest economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
Mr. Merlo, however, thinks he has an answer for that. He is looking at putting the fiber farms in Mexico or other Central American countries, where the warm climate would make the trees grow even faster and irrigation would not be necessary.

 
 
A MORE PROFITABLE PLYWOOD
 RED BLUFF, Calif. -- The Louisiana-Pacific Corporation is the leading supplier of oriented strand board, a plywood-substitute made from wafers of wood. Now it is trying to use those boards to make products with higher profit margins.
At a new plant here, the company is making I-beams that use regular lumber for the flanges but oriented strand board for the center member. The I-beams are being sold in place of big pieces of lumber for use in floor joists and roof trusses.
Elsewhere, the company is using oriented strand board to make products like siding. Different patterns can be pressed onto the strand board, giving it the appearance of fine wood.
"The world is really a substrate," Mr. Merlo said. "What you see is not what you really get."
He pointed to his own office in Portland as an example. The walls look to be made of white oak, but the oak is only one thirty-second of an inch thick. Underneath it is oriented strand board.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Southern Textile Mills;
Old Plants Don't Die -- They Just Go on the Market

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: WHITMIRE, S.C.

 BODY:
ON the outskirts of this town of 2,100 people is the Mount Vernon Mills textile mill, whose owners would greatly like to sell it. They did once, in 1987, after deciding to get out of the kitchen-towel business. But the buyer went bankrupt in 1989 and Mount Vernon foreclosed on the 190,000-square-foot building and its 25 acres.
Now, with any luck, a second sale is about to be completed, but Mount Vernon had to cut its asking price of $1.4 million considerably, said Ned Cochrane, secretary and counsel for the textile company, which is based in Greenville, S.C. He declined to disclose the current price (in 1989 it was $1.8 million). 
 "There are a lot of mills for sale, especially since the economy slowed a year or two ago," Mr. Cochrane said. "We had a few nibbles, but the real estate situation is getting worse. It could take three years or more to sell a mill." Which is why, he said, Mount Vernon cut its price.
In the last five years, the number of Southern textile mills on the market rose sharply as textile companies closed unprofitable plants or replaced aged ones. And brokers say price is the key factor in getting a sale.
"It's like going to the store when mini-skirts are in fashion and finding only antebellum hoop skirts," said Gorham Boyington, a broker with the Keenan Company commercial brokerage in Columbia, S.C. "They won't sell for much. With these mills you can't consider replacement cost. They are no longer functional in their original use."
No firm figures are available on how many mills are for sale in the Southeast, but in South Carolina alone there are 40. North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama probably each have twice as many, said Mr. Boyington.
The American Textile Manufactuers Institute, based in Washington, says there are 6,000 mills in the country, 75 percent of them in the Southeast. They range from huge, multi-storied and decades-old brick structures to newer one-story plants spread out across the rural piedmont and designed with central air-conditioning. All have large, open rooms and low ceilings, usually no more than 14 feet.
Prices range from just over a dollar a square foot to nearly $15, though one cotton mill in Greenville sold in 1983 for 67 cents a square foot.
Some companies, unable to sell their abandoned mills, have even given the buildings away, usually to local governments, as Mount Vernon did in Fries, Va. The town, hoping the mill will make money, is trying to lease the building.
Mills have been sold to textile companies, but most have gone to other types of manufacturers, like a picture-framing operation that bought a Chester, S.C., mill for $480,850 ($1.63 a square foot) in 1988 or an electronics company that bought a 266,000-square-foot Great Falls, S.C., mill for $1.13 a square foot in 1983.
"It is not necessarily harder to sell a textile mill than other industrial buildings," said Mr. Boyington. "You've got to be creative and come up with alternate uses because most of the buyers are outside the textile industry."
Some buyers even have nonmanufacturing uses in mind, as in Greensboro, N.C., where a 200,000-square-foot cotton mill was renovated for an outlet mall. Jerry Olson, the leasing agent for the mall, known as Cotton Mill Square, said: "It is immaterial whether it's a strip shopping center, an office tower or a textile mill, they're all real estate, and if you don't have the right location, you're not going to make it."
After nine years in operation, Cotton Mill Square is 85 percent leased.
 IN COLUMBIA, S.C., the capital and geographic center of the state, a group of investors bought a mill near the University of South Carolina in 1983 and converted it into 170 rental apartments. Most are occupied by students. And in Allendale, near the Georgia border, an 85,000-square-foot warehouse was sold to Allendale County, which used state and Federal grants to renovate it. Last August, the building was leased to a yarn-processing company.
Two of the three mills formerly owned by J.P. Stevens & Company in the small town of Great Falls, S.C., have been sold in the last few years. Flextronics Southeast of Fremont, Calif., an electronics company, bought a 266,000-square-foot mill for $300,580 in 1983. A second mill, with 159,000 square feet, has been sold three times, first in 1983 for $203,520, then in 1987 for $244,860 and finally in 1990 to an art distributor for $306,870.
Great Falls's largest mill, with 319,000 square feet, has been vacant since 1984 and is being reserved for future expansion by West Point Pepperell of West Point, Ga.
Mayor James Baker of Great Falls said he has worked aggressively to find someone to lease, if not buy, the three mills in town.
"We have had some degree of interest," he said. "But because of the size of these buildings and because they were built as textile mills, they are somewhat limited in their use."
Recently, with an 11.3 percent unemployment rate, the fourth-highest in the state, townspeople stopped pinning their hopes on textile mills and, with a Federal grant, broke ground on a 100-acre industrial park.
Mr. Boyington said he started to see textile mills on the market in the 1970's when the multi-storied mills of the early 1900's could not adequately handle the new, larger machines. The pace of sales picked up in the 1980's as textile companies divested themselves of unprofitable divisions, especially those hardest hit by imports, said Mr. Cochrane.
MOST mills on the market are in rural areas or small towns, although some are at the edges of some of the Southeast's largest cities.
One plant that did not sell is in Greenville, South Carolina's largest city, in the northwestern section of the state about 145 miles northeast of Atlanta. The 1.6 million-square-foot plant had been offered for sale by Hoechst Celenese for four years before the company, based in Bridgewater, N.J., took it off the market with plans to develop a business park at the site.
Among the largest mills now on the market is a 930,000-square-foot building in Chester, S.C., near Great Falls. The asking price is $10.5 million for the 26-year-old, one-story building. The owner, Megastar, based in St. Louis, is also trying to sell a 101,000-square-foot sweater manufacturing plant in Union County, S.C.
Mr. Cochrane, whose company has sold six mills in the last few years, said the hardest ones to sell are those that are multi-storied, usually three or four floors. These are the oldest mills, and usually the windows are bricked up.
Mr. Cochrane said the most successful conversions have been by those who divided the buildings, leasing sections to various businesses, rather than trying to find one tenant for a huge amount of space.
This is the second wave of real estate sales in the South for textile companies. The first began in the 1950's and continued into the 60's when companies sold the houses in what were known as the mill villages.
The one- and two-bedroom clapboard houses, jampacked on straight, narrow streets close to a mill, were built as homes for the workers in the days when the paternalistic companies, needing to get workers to their rural facilities, offered not only housing but also services ranging from birth assistance to funerals.
Employees bought many of the houses in the mill villages in the 1940's and 50's, and although some of the mills have closed and are for sale, most of villages remain, with the houses individually owned.

HEADLINE: Indians in Aspic

BYLINE: By Michael Dorris; Michael Dorris is the author of "The Broken Cord," and, with his wife, Louise Erdrich, the forthcoming "The Crown of Columbus."

DATELINE: CORNISH, N.H.

 BODY:
The Sioux and Lieut. John Dunbar, the character enthusiastically played by Kevin Costner in "Dances With Wolves," meet auspiciously: He's naked, and that so disconcerts a group of mounted warriors that the naive young soldier lives to tell the tale, a sort of Boy Scout Order of the Arrow ritual carried to the nth power.
Dunbar, renamed Dances With Wolves, quickly earns merit badges in Pawnee-bashing and animal telepathy, and marries Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell), a passionate young widow who just happens to be a white captive cum Campfire Girl of impressive cross-cultural accomplishments. Eventually the "With" family strikes out on their own -- the nucleus of a handsome new Anglo tribe -- sadder, wiser and certainly more sensitive as a result of their native American immersion. 
 Mr. Costner follows in a long tradition of literary and cinematic heroes who have discovered Indians. Robinson Crusoe did it off the coast of Brazil, Natty Bumppo did it in New York State and everyone from Debra Paget ("Broken Arrow," 1950) and Natalie Wood ("The Searchers," 1956) to Dustin Hoffman ("Little Big Man," 1970) and Richard Harris ("A Man Called Horse," 1970) has done it in Hollywood.
Usually these visits do not bode well for the aboriginal hosts -- just ask the Mohicans. Appreciative white folks always seem to show up shortly before the cavalry (who are often looking for them) or Manifest Destiny, and record the final days of peace before the tribe is annihilated. Readers and viewers of such sagas are left with a predominant emotion of regret for a golden age now but a faint memory. In the imaginary mass media world of neat beginnings, middles and ends, American Indian society, whatever its virtues and fascinations as an arena for Euro-American consciousness-raising, is definitely past tense.
Thematically virtually all of these works share a subtle or not so subtle message: Indians may be poor, they may at first seem strange or forbidding or primitive, but by golly once you get to know them they have a thing or two to teach us about The Meaning of Life.
The tradition goes back a long way. Europeans like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl May (the turn-of-this-century novelist whose books, a mixture of Louis L'Amour and the Hardy Boys, have been a rite of passage for generations of German youth) laid out a single range for Indians to inhabit: savage-savage to noble-savage. Indians embody the concept of "the other" -- a foreign, exotic, even cartoonish panorama against which "modern" (that is, white) men can measure and test themselves, and eventually, having proved their mettle in battle, be dubbed as natural leaders by their hosts.
Placed within the genre, "Dances With Wolves" shows some signs of evolution. Kevin Costner obviously spared no expense to achieve a sense of authenticity in his production. He filmed on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota and defied conventional Hollywood wisdom to assemble a large and talented native American supporting cast. Great attention was paid to ethnographically correct costumes, and if the streets in the native camp seem a tad too spotless to be believed, at least the tepees are museum quality.
Impressively, large segments of the film are spoken in Lakota, the language of the western Sioux, and though the subtitles are stilted -- Indians in the movies seem incapable of using contractions -- they at least convey the impression that native Americans had an intellectual life.
When I saw "Dances With Wolves" at an advance screening, I predicted that it would be less than a box-office smash. Though spectacular to look it, it struck me as too long, too predictable, too didactic to attract a large audience. Twelve Academy Award nominations and $100 million in revenue later, was I ever wrong. In fact, the movie probably sells tickets precisely because it delivers the old-fashioned Indians that the ticket-buying audience expects to find. Dunbar is our national myth's everyman -- handsome, sensitive, flexible, right-thinking. He passes the test of the frontier, out-Indians the Indians, achieves a pure soul by encountering and surmounting the wilderness.
Yet, if "Dances With Wolves" had been about people who happen to be Indians, rather than about Indians (uniformly stoic, brave, nasty to their enemies, nice to their friends), it might have stood a better chance of acting as a bridge between societies that have for too long woodenly characterized each other.
With such tremendous popularity, the film is sure to generate a bubble of sympathy for the Sioux, but hard questions remain: Will this sentiment be practical, translating into public support for native American religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court, for restoration of Lakota sacred lands (the Black Hills) or water rights, for tribal sovereignty, for providing the money desperately needed by reservation health clinics? Pine Ridge is the most economically impoverished corner of America today, the Census Bureau says, but will its modern Indian advocates in business suits, men and women with laptop computers and perfect English, be the recipients of a tidal wave of good will?
Or will it turn out, once again, that the only good Indians -- the only Indians whose causes and needs we can embrace -- are lodged safely in the past, wrapped neatly in the blankets of history, magnets for our sympathy because they require nothing of us but tears in a dark theater?

HEADLINE: Let's Do Something About Deposit Insurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Safer Banks" (editorial, Feb. 7), on the Treasury Department's proposed overhaul of the banking system, you object to the suggested limit of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance to two $100,000 accounts to a person.
 A reasonable alternative is to have two types of accounts. Type A would have an insurance limit of $100,000 or less, and be limited to one or two to a person. Type B accounts would have no ceiling on the amount insured, but would be 100 percent collateralized with short-term government securities (or other extremely safe assets) marked to market daily. 
 Since banks would earn less on these assets than on others, they would pay a lower rate to those depositors. Large depositors who would be willing to accept such a lower rate are mainly financially unsophisticated people, who are not able to exercise meaningful "depositor surveillance" over banks. Hence, such a system would not interfere with the Treasury's idea of putting sophisticated depositors at risk, so that they discipline banks.
With type B accounts being fully collateralized, their unlimited insurance coverage would not increase the F.D.I.C.'s risk, unless banks pledge as collateral short-term Treasury securities they would have held in any case, thus reducing the average degree of safety of the assets that back Type A accounts. But banks are not likely to do so to any significant extent.

HEADLINE: Welfare Cuts Will Haunt New York State in Later Social Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In announcing their proposals to cut $1 billion from New York State's welfare system, State Senate Republican leaders characterized the system including Medicaid as a Cadillac when all we really need is a Ford or Chevy (news article, Jan. 31). Is public assistance a Cadillac program
* When grant levels are only 64.1 percent of the poverty level? 
 * When eligible people are repeatedly dropped from the rolls for administrative or reporting problems?
* When eligible people are required to participate in unavailable employment and training programs?
* When rent consumes 50 percent to 60 percent of the monthly grant for many recipients, leaving little for food, clothing and other essentials?
Is Medicaid a "Cadillac" program
* When only half the poor in the state are Medicaid-eligible?
* When few Medicaid recipients can find a physician to treat them?
* When hospitals turn Medicaid clients away despite receiving Bad Debt and Charity Care funds?
* When the only accessible care is a "Medicaid mill"?
Senate leaders probably arrived at the Cadillac analogy by comparing New York with other states. But no state has an adequate welfare system. All are products of a Federal system that has lacked the will to make meaningful changes. New York has attempted to overcome some basic design flaws and is thus ahead of most other states in trying to blunt the harsh effects of economic dislocation, failures in the education system, unequal opportunity, racism and social obstacles that keep the poor poor.
For New York to reduce its public assistance and medical care for the poor in order to relieve the state's fiscal crisis will only add to the state's problems, not reduce them. Retrenchment in welfare benefits and health care for the poor will, as in the past, lead to more homelessness, hunger, illness, more family breakups, more abused and neglected children, more crime and innumerable other social problems. To contain these problems, not solve them, will require more public dollars. These dollars will show up in the added costs for shelters, hospitals, food pantries, foster care, protective services, prisons, police and other public services.

HEADLINE: Nordstrom Net Up 47.5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Nordstrom Inc. said on Friday that its earnings leaped 47.5 percent in its fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 31.
The fashion retailer's profits for the three months totaled $46.3 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with $31.4 million, or 39 cents a share, for the corresponding period a year earlier.
The company's revenues increased 5.2 percent, to $902.2 million, compared with $857.5 million a year ago.
Profits for the year were $115.8 million, or $1.42 a share, up slightly from $114.9 million, or $1.41 a share, the previous year. For the year, Nordstrom's revenues increased by 8.2 percent, from $2.67 billion to $2.89 billion.
The company is one of the most successful retailers in a business that has suffered acutely because of a nationwide recession. Nordstrom said in a statement that the earnings performance put the company in a good position as it prepared to open four new stores in 1991, one in Chicago in April, with later openings in Riverside, Calif., Edison, N.J., and Montgomery County, Md.
"The results for the fourth quarter indicate that the company has responded in a positive manner to the difficult retailing environment that exists today," Bruce Nordstrom, co-chairman, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Fell 32.4% in January

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
New orders for American-made machine tools plunged 32.4 percent in January from an unusually high level in December, according to a report to be released today by the industry's trade association.
Industry analysts said that in addition to being skewed by the year-end surge in orders, the sharp decline stemmed from the weak demand that is typical in the winter months. 
 The level of orders for new machine tools fell to $199.9 million in January, from the December level of $295.8 million, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology. The December figure was the highest monthly level of 1990.
The level of orders in January was virtually unchanged from that of January 1990.
 
'Orders Remained Firm'
 "At first glance, January orders look low when compared to the robust December figure," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va. "But take a look at January a year ago, and you see a nearly identical first-of-the-year total. In spite of the uncertainty created by the current economy and the war in the Persian Gulf, machine tool orders remained firm."
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and cars to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
Machine tool orders had risen 43.7 percent in December. Analysts attributed that big jump to increased demand from auto makers as they began to produce redesigned engines and other auto parts.
 
A Very Strong December
 "The January decline does not mean too much because December was inordinately strong as a result of new designs being released in Detroit," said William G. Copeland, president of Copeland Economic Group, an economic consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. "Also, there was so much uncertainty in the marketplace due to expectations about the war in the Persian Gulf, which caused people to hold off on their purchase of new machine tools. People wanted to wait to see how the economy would shape up."
Orders from foreign customers were particularly strong last year, as the depressed value of the United States dollar made the prices of American machine tools very attractive in overseas markets.
In recent months, machine tool industry executives have said that demand has increased from an array of industries. And they have predicted that American companies will spend more this year to improve their manufacturing operations.
 
Orders for Metal-Cutting Tools
 Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, dropped 27 percent in January from the December level. Compared with January of last year, new orders for metal-cutting tools were down 7.9 percent. That segment of the industry typically accounts for three-fourths of new orders.
Orders for metal-forming tools plunged 40.6 percent in January from the December level. Compared with January of last year, metal-forming orders were up 12.2 percent.
The backlog of orders for machine tools stood at $1.48 billion in January, up from $1.46 billion in December. The backlog in January 1990 was $1.77 billion.

HEADLINE: First Chicago Revokes Credit Cards

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The First Chicago Corporation said it had revoked thousands of credit cards held by residents of nine Northeastern states as part of a credit review of the economically weakened region.
The acknowledgement by First Chicago, the nation's third-largest issuer of credit cards, prompted a Massachusetts Congressman to demand that the Bush Administration investigate whether the region was the victim of economic discrimination. 
 "If this practice of geographic review is widespread, the major credit card companies may be engaging in a practice that is not only unfair but also threatens to undermine further the vitality of the Northeast economy," Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat, stated in a letter to Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Markey is chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
First Chicago said Friday in a letter to Mr. Markey that it had closed 7,800 "high risk" credit card accounts held by residents of the six New England states and New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The credit lines of another 1,100 cardholders in those states were reduced, the company said.
The company maintains a total of 6.5 million Mastercard and Visa accounts nationwide. Of those, 1.7 million are in the nine-state region subjected to the special credit review.
In his letter to Mr. Markey, the head of First Chicago's credit card subsidiary, Scott P. Marks Jr., described the review as a one-time "test" that took place in August. Under the review, the bank examined the accounts of cardholders in the Northeast more frequently than those in other regions.
First Chicago said it had examined accounts of Northeasterners whose cards were just renewed or were about to expire.
 "During 1990 we observed a significant deterioration in the credit performance of our card members in the New England and Mid-Atlantic States," Mr. Marks said in the letter. "Specifically, during the first nine months of 1990, we experienced a 65 percent increase in bankruptcies among our New England card members in comparison to the same period during 1989.
"As a responsible member of the financial community, we believe we have the responsibility to confront and constructively deal with rising credit losses within our portfolio wherever they may occur."
Mr. Marks said First Chicago had instituted similar reviews in other regions and was not treating the Northeast unfairly. He said the standards for closing an account or reducing credit lines remained the same for Northeasterners as for other cardholders.
But Mr. Markey said that conducting more frequent credit reviews "intrinsically constitutes a stricter standard."

The Big Dimout To Save Millions: Will It Really?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
How many light bulbs does it take to change a city?
Many New Yorkers may not have noticed yet. But, block by block, the city is getting darker at night. 
 The dimming of New York, in this case, is deliberate. The ostensible goal of the city government's "wattage reduction program" for 60,000 street lights is to save millions of dollars in energy and maintenance costs, thereby avoiding cuts in more vital municipal services. Along with companion economies, the hope is to save about $2 million in the fiscal year ending June 30 alone.
Whatever the ramifications, though, city officials have invoked Orwellian logic to justify the changes. They've stopped just short of suggesting that one bonus of the switch is that dirtier streets will be harder to see in the dark.
Reducing the wattage of street lights, said Michael Primeggia, the deputy transportation commissioner, will "result in less glare and a more even illumination on the pavement."
Failing to repair broken lights for six months, Mayor David N. Dinkins's budget proclaimed in January, will result in "greater operational efficiencies."
 The light brigade has already converted 15,400 lamps since 1985 and, to the untrained eye, the difference may be barely noticeable. Moreover the newer lights meet national engineering standards; their reduced intensity is supposed to improve visibility in shadows. Few critics have actually compared the bulbs side by side, but they take a dim view of the reductions.
City Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields said her Harlem constituents complain increasingly that street lights have become dimmer.
Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge of the West Side, said brighter lights reflect off buildings already dimmed by the protective gates that shutter many store windows. She questioned how City Hall could reconcile the dimming and non-repair plans with the Mayor's "Safe Streets, Safe City" anti-crime proposal.
Community Board 5 in midtown Manhattan voted earlier this month to oppose the wattage reduction program. Community Board 6, on the East Side, is investigating its impact.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said reducing wattage failed to consider the consequences for crime: Would additional police patrols and other law-enforcement expenses cost more than dimmer streets would save?
In Manhattan the latest lower-wattage lights are to be installed in largely noncommercial areas, including all of Riverside Drive and on Lexington and Madison Avenues above 60th Street. All or part of dozens of other streets in every borough, including Queens Boulevard in Queens, Fordham Road in the Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn will be affected.
No changes are anticipated near schools, hospitals and houses of worship or in Times Square, where, because street lights are closer together, concerns about glare do not apply.
The city expanded its conversion from mercury to high-pressure sodium lights in the early 1970's. "No other single step which we can take," Mayor John V. Lindsay declared then, "will give the public as great a sense of security in the street."
But bright didn't necessarily make right. Officials found that the sodium lights accelerated growth of foliage -- thereby blocking out light. And some people cursed the brightness. A lighting designer, Howard Brandston, complained recently that pedestrians were "being homogenized in yellow light smog" by monochromatic sodium lamps. (The city says one alternative, metal halide, is too expensive).
A 250-watt mercury lamp produced 12,000 lumens; a 400-watt one produced 20,000. The output of 250-watt sodium lamps is 30,000 lumens, which, Mr. Primeggia wrote Ms. Messinger, "is 50 percent higher than the 400-watt mercury lamp." He neglected to complete the equation: the existing 400-watt sodium lamps produce 50,000 lumens.
Reducing wattage is supposed to save $724,000 a year for every 10,000 lamps used. Converting 10,000 lamps costs $1.3 million.
New York City has 325,000 street lights. On any given night, about 8,000 don't work. Maintenance is to be deferred, which means 5,000 more broken lights will not be fixed immediately, to save $1.4 million. Nor will any lights in city parks be repaired, to save $200,000.
As World War I began, Edward Viscount Grey watched the lamplighters in London and lamented: "The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime." Street lighting pales in comparison with a war and perhaps even a fiscal crisis. But some lights are going out all over New York, and while they may go on again, they are changing how people see the city meanwhile.

HEADLINE: Revival of Trade Talks Stirs Political Fight in U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The agreement in Geneva last week that cleared the way for a resumption of global trade talks sets the stage here for what is likely to be one of the fiercest scraps in years between protectionists and free traders.
Organized labor and the textile industry, often bitter opponents at the work place but allies on trade issues, are leading forces that hope to torpedo a prospective world trade agreement, as well as one between the United States and Mexico. 
 Opponents of the agreements assert that they will cost jobs and lower wages in the United States; supporters argue precisely the opposite, that the agreements will increase prosperity.
The first round of the battle will be over a procedural tactic meant to facilitate Congressional approval of trade pacts.
 
Preserving the Balance
 The procedure, known as fast-track authority, permits President Bush to negotiate trade agreements that Congress cannot amend, to avoid any unraveling of delicately balanced international compromises. Congress had granted the Administration until May 31 to submit a global trade agreement, with a March 1 deadline for seeking an extension. President Bush is expected to ask Congress this week for a two-year extension.
Fearing job losses and a flood of cheap imports, organized labor and textile groups, as well as footwear, environmental and some family farm groups, are lobbying to block the extension.
"Although it will be molded by the desire to satisfy local constituents, this debate will define for the long term whether we go down a path of protectionism or multilateralism," said Ronald A. Brand, a University of Pittsburgh law professor.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, estimated there were 35 to 40 votes against the President in the 100-member Senate, 40 votes, including his own, in favor and about 20 to 25 Senators uncommitted. "Labor is really activated on this one," he said.
 A House Democratic aide, who insisted on anonymity, said the President would lose if the vote were to come within the next week.
"Maybe it won't be the mother of all trade battles, but we've got a real struggle on our hands," the aide observed.
A majority of either body can block extension through a simple disapproval resolution. Trading partners have indicated they will refuse to negotiate agreements with the United States without some assurance that the Administration can strike a final deal. Canada's Trade Minister, John Crosbie, warned, "It would be extremely harmful for the world economic outlook and bad tactics for the United States because everyone would point a finger at the United States as the cause of the collapse of the liberalized world trading system."
 The global talks collapsed in December when the European Community refused to negotiate sharply lower farm subsidies, which were sought by the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and other food-exporting nations.
But last week, the community agreed to a formula for "specific binding commitments" to reduce farm supports, and the four-year-old talks were revived.
The talks are being held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade, and involves 108 nations. The agenda includes not just farm trade, but attempts to cut tariffs by one-third, strengthen patent and copyright protection, lower barriers to trade in services and improve procedures for settling trade disputes.
 "It's a question of political will," said the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, about the GATT talks, in an interview on Thursday. "But I think we ought to work carefully to maximize what we can accomplish as quickly as we can."
The Bush Administration had been counting on wrapping up the GATT talks before the expiration of the fast-track authority. The delay now gives Congress the chance to halt the enterprise in its tracks.
The fast-track device is necessary because Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate commerce, whereas the President has the constitutional authority to negotiate with foreign governments.
 The fast-track rule specifies that Congress must approve or reject an agreement without amendments.
Fast track -- which provided the framework for Congressional approval of a 1979 GATT agreement, as well as the Israeli and Canadian free-trade agreements of the last decade -- was authorized for the newest GATT talks under 1988 legislation.
Although a Mexican free-trade agreement had not been envisioned in 1988, it, too, would be covered under the request that is expected from the President, possibly as early as Tuesday.
In addition to the GATT talks and the agreement with Mexico, President Bush is expected to seek fast-track authority for another major trade initiative, the Enterprise for the Americas, which looks forward to free-trade agreements with most countries of Latin America.
The groups in the labor-textile coalition are all opposed to either the Mexico or the GATT agreement, and some to both.
 Fearing job losses and pay cuts from a trade pact with Mexico, where workers make roughly about 5 percent of what workers earn in the United States, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has made blocking a Mexican agreement its No. 1 legislative priority.
In recent Congressional testimony, Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the labor federation, called the prospective accord "an economic and social disaster" for American workers and argued that use of fast track "seriously limits both public and Congressional involvement in discussions with Mexico and dilutes the lawmaking authority of Congress."
Similarly, the textile industry, fearing a GATT agreement will open the floodgates to cheap textile imports, hopes to use the fast-track approval process to sink any prospective accord.
Donald R. Hughes, the president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, used unusually direct language recently to denounce the prospective accord as "a fraud that is being perpetrated on U.S. industry and agriculture."
 
The Looming Battle
 On the other side is a broad-based coalition of major business and farm organizations, including retailers and multinational companies with a major stake in increasing trade.
"We're not saying these agreements will be marvelous," said Mary A. Dyess, assistant executive director of the National Association of Stevedores and co-chairman of the so-called Pro Trade Group. "All we want is for the procedure to be in place in case the agreements work out."
For the anticipated battle in Congress, Mrs. Hills is preparing arguments on the importance of trade to economic growth, especially in the current cycle of economic weakness.
She said she was optimstic about reaching both the GATT and Mexico agreements later this year. Congress would be making a "grave mistake" if it blocks the attempts, she said, adding, "If we can't negotiate to create more opportunities for our enterpreneurs in foreign markets, then we may as well just close down the store."

HEADLINE: No War Gain For Military Contractors

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Although the ground war in the Persian Gulf is the first test in combat of several frontline weapons systems, a relatively short ground campaign would have little effect on the financial prospects of military contractors, analysts and industry executives said today.
The Pentagon made clear in the last two months that the war would not significantly alter its plans to reduce the size of the United States military and to scale back its weapons purchases. 
 Pentagon officials said that the war could be fought almost entirely from existing stocks of weapons and ammunition, barring an unexpectedly long and fierce engagement with Iraq and that there would be no need to replace most of the hardware expended.
 
First Battle Trials
 The ground war is the first sustained battle test of the M-1 tank, built by the General Dynamics Corporation; the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, manufactured by the FMC Corporation, and the Apache attack helicopter, made by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
If these weapons prove reliable and effective, the reputation of the contractors will benefit. The performance of the systems could also influence the design of future weapons, industry executives said.
But the companies are not likely to receive a direct financial benefit in the form of new orders from the Pentagon, because the Bush Administration has said it is sticking with its plan to phase out purchases of many current weapons.
The budget proposal for the next fiscal year sent to Congress earlier this month by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called for canceling the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which is used to transport infantry troops. The proposal also reaffirmed decisions made in earlier years to end production of the M-1 and the Apache.
 
Higher Foreign Sales
 Any benefit to the arms industry from the war is most likely to come from increased sales to foreign countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are already buying large quantities of weapons, some from the stocks of the United Stats military and some from military contractors in this country.
An impressive performance by some or all of the ground weapons deployed in the gulf could well increase demand from the Saudis and other potential foreign purchasers. The aircraft, missiles and other advanced systems deployed in the gulf by the United States already appear to have proven highly effective.
"There should be some additional foreign military sales," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "The U.S. now carries with it a calling card it hasn't had in some time, which is success on the battlefield."
 
Big Saudi Orders
 The Saudis have already ordered 465 of the most advanced version of the M-1, known as the M-1A2, and would like to order another 235, General Dynamics executives have said. Those orders and others will enable General Dynamics to keep open one of its two production lines for the M-1 despite the lack of orders from the Pentagon.
McDonnell Douglas could also receive additional foreign orders for the Apache, which until the last few months had suffered from a reputation of being unreliable and difficult to maintain. In addition to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations, potential customers are Britain and the Netherlands.
"The Apache is shaking off a lot of the criticism," Mr. Rubel said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Los Angeles Times to Drop Some Readers

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Times, which became the nation's largest metropolitan daily last year through its aggressive expansion efforts, plans to stop selling papers in a large part of central California and in neighboring states.
Executives of The Los Angeles Times, which has a weekday circulation of 1.2 million, said they decided to eliminate home-delivery and newsstand sales in the mostly rural area between Bakersfield and Fresno because of the weakened California economy. 
 "We're making some difficult but judicious changes that will reduce our expenses," said Carolyn Hom, a spokeswoman for The Times. "The cost of circulation was very high in relation to the value to our readers and advertisers there."
 
A Strategic Shift
 The Los Angeles Times will also no longer distribute papers in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.; Reno and Carson City, Nev., and Salt Lake City, but analysts say the newspaper was likely to remain the largest-selling daily in the nation. Distribution will continue in the San Francisco area and in Sacramento, the state capital.
The decision represents a strategic shift for the Los Angeles Times, which in recent years has spent millions of dollars to expand its circulation in California and the West. Toward this end, the newspaper had maintained distribution in such distant and often unprofitable areas as central California, said John Morton, a newspaper analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a securities firm.
"They are now comfortably above a million and I'm sure they feel they can trim back without coming down close to that number," Mr. Morton said. "But for a long time they were not very far above it and would have been loathe to fall below. It has a lot to do with image."
About a million people live in central California between Bakersfield and Fresno. But more than half of California's 29.8 million residents, and most of The Los Angeles Times's circulation, are south of there.
Ms. Hom declined to say how much circulation The Los Angeles Times would be eliminating by the cutbacks, which take effect around the end of March. But a newspaper distributor in Fresno, Paul Nickel, said a supervisor at The Times told him that the newspaper's circulation would drop by about 35,000 in central California.
"I have a lot of customers who are complaining because they feel discriminated against," said Mr. Nickel, who has distributed The Times for 22 years and is urging subscribers to write to the paper's publisher, David A. Laventhol.
The Los Angeles Times is owned by the Times Mirror Company, the nation's third-largest media company. Times Mirror, which also owns Newsday on Long Island and other newspapers, book publishers, magazines and television properties, announced in January that its fourth-quarter profits had fallen by 38.5 percent.
 
Angry Subscribers
 A secretary in Mr. Laventhol's office said the publisher had received hundreds of letters and phone calls from angry subscribers in central California. One reader, Laura B. Carey, has written letters to executives, editors and columnists of The Times and even to her Congressman to try to reverse the paper's decision.
"I'm furious," said the retired medical secretary, who has subscribed to The Times since 1974, when she moved to Fresno from Westport, Conn. "I think that during a time when we're at war and are going into an election season, to cut off a large chunk of the state is just ridiculous."
Mrs. Carey said she planned to subscribe to The San Jose Mercury News or The San Francisco Chronicle, but added: "It's like changing husbands. It's just not quite the same."

HEADLINE: Personal Trials Grow in Rhode Island Bank Crisis

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST PROVI DENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
On New Year's Day, when Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun closed 45 of the state's banks and credit unions, Ann Quinn thought she would be able to get her money in a day or two.
But the 67-year-old Ms. Quinn, angry and frantic, spends part of every morning driving her Buick in circles around a credit union here and another in North Providence, where her life savings are still frozen. 
 "I'm at a point of desperation," said Ms. Quinn, who is borrowing rent and grocery money from her sister. "I can't sleep. I can't do anything. I drive around and sometimes I go knock on the door, hoping they will let me take my money back out. But the doors are always locked."
Governor Sundlun, a Democrat, closed the banks and credit unions after the failure of their private insurer, the Rhode Island Security and Deposit Indemnity Corporation. Most of the institutions have since obtained Federal deposit insurance and reopened, but 14 were rejected for Federal insurance and have remained closed, leaving 300,000 accounts frozen. Deposits in those accounts total $1.3 billion; state officials say it is not clear how much cash the closed institutions actually have on hand.
For many of the tens of thousands of depositors with money in those accounts, that means payrolls, bills and rent payments are being paid with borrowed money or not at all. Rhode Islanders who praised Mr. Sundlun at first for his handling of the bank crisis are beginning to panic and ask why he does not do more to help them regain their money.
"People are desperate," said Jack Kayrouz, who said his life savings of $50,000 are frozen in the Chariho Exeter Credit Union in the village of Wyoming. "Businesses are failing. There are elderly who live on the interest from their C.D.'s and are now on the verge of homelessness. This is a terrible, terrible problem."
In February, Mr. Sundlun and the Legislature enacted a bailout bill for the closed institutions. The state will guarantee to refund deposits of $100,000 or less, the level protected by Federal insurance, but not all at once; the process will take three years.
In the meantime, the state is encouraging solvent banks to acquire and reopen the insolvent ones. The new law requires those that are not acquired to merge into a Depositors' Economic Protection Corporation, Depco for short.
But depositors say the bailout measure has brought little comfort. Depco will refund only a percentage of deposits of more than $100,000. Accounts of $500,000 or more, for example, will be refunded at 50 cents on the dollar. Interest is not being paid, and payments do not begin until up to 45 days after the banks enter the corporation, which has not yet been set up.
"Certainly we would prefer that each depositor had access to their money and all of it today," said Barbara Cottam, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sundlun. "Unfortunately that's not the case. Depco is just a last-resort alternative." The plan is expected to cost the state as much as $300 million.
Many depositors thought Risdic, the private insurer, was backed by the state, and they say the Governor's plan is inadequate.
"Anything less than full access to our money takes this state into further economic and civil chaos," said Mr. Kayrouz, who founded Citizens for Depositors' Rights, a lobbying group.
Arlene Violet, a former State Attorney General who is host of a radio talk show in East Providence, said her callers have become increasingly frantic about their frozen accounts.
"People used to call in with technical questions about getting their money back," said Ms. Violet, who is also representing depositors in several lawsuits against the institutions. "Now it's like open-mike therapy. One woman called bawling, saying the funeral home that had buried her husband was threatening to sue if she didn't pay the bill."
Nowhere is the problem more apparent than in Woonsocket, an old mill town north of Providence that is home to the closed Marquette Credit Union. More than half of Woonsocket's 48,000 residents had money in accounts in Marquette, the state's largest credit institution. With a city unemployment rate already above 11 percent, the consequences have been disastrous, city officials said.
"This has absolutely decimated business here," said John P. Kuzmiski, the city's finance director. He said more than 30 small businesses had closed since January. Those still open have seen receipts cut in half. Tax collectors have had to grant extensions. And the local center for the elderly has begun group therapy sessions to help those who depended on Marquette's interest payments cope without them.
 
Depositors Named in Paper
 State officials have repeatedly reminded angry depositors that the state was not responsible for the banks' private insurer. Still, the Governor is facing mounting criticism.
"The state has an obligation to make sure people get all of their money back, plus interest and on time," Mr. Kuzmiski said. "Depco falls far, far short of that."
But disillusionment with Mr. Sundlun centers not only around Depco. Earlier this month, the Governor enraged depositors by releasing the names of those holding more than $100,000 in frozen accounts. More than 900 names and account balances, which the Governor said he released as a matter of public interest to taxpayers, were printed in a local paper, The Pawtucket Times.
"Since that list came out, I've had to put up with phone calls from people making ethnic remarks like, 'All you wealthy Jews put your money away, so you got what you deserved,' " said Steve Levinson, a Woonsocket landlord listed as having $200,000 frozen in Marquette.
"Am I angry? You bet I am. Am I looking into taking legal steps? You bet I am," said Mr. Levinson, who said he had been a longtime supporter of Mr. Sundlun.
"As for Depco, I'm mad about that, too," he said, noting that two-thirds of his tenants had been unable to pay their bills since January. "All I can do is hold the hands of my elderly tenants and say, 'Hey, we're all in this together.' "

HEADLINE: The Ground War and the American Economy;
Further Drop Seen In the Price of Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The ground war against Iraq is likely to result in lower oil prices, at least in the short term, experts said yesterday. Most of these experts said a short ground war was more likely to bring lower prices than a longer conflict.
The new phase of the war reduced still further what the market had seen as a minuscule chance of Iraq's interfering with Saudi Arabia's oil production, the experts said. 
 "It was never going to happen, but everyone was worried about it," said Peter C. Beutel, an oil analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. Mr. Beutel said that uncertainty had kept prices higher than they otherwise would have been.
 
Adding to Exports
 Mr. Beutel added that pushing Iraq out of Kuwait would hasten the resumption of oil exports from Kuwait, and even from Iraq, adding to the oil supply on world markets.
Daniel C. Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said that if the war continued to look "fairly quick and pretty clear in its outcome," it would reinforce the underlying direction of the market, which is down.
Mr. Yergin, the author of a recent history of the oil industry, "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power," said this oil crisis appeared likely to end like the five others since World War II. "Each one began with a shortage or specter of shortage and ended with a surplus," he said.
 
Short-Term Surplus
 Many experts say the market seems to expect a surplus that will depress prices for the short term. In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price for delivery of oil in the soonest-available month is low relative to prices for delivery in later months.
But the short-term price could rise, Mr. Yergin said, if the war dragged on, if chemical weapons were used or if questions arose about the determination of the United States and its allies. As Mr. Yergin made his assessment, however, on the day after the ground war had begun, that scenario seemed unlikely.
Oil for April delivery had closed down 59 cents, at $17.91 a barrel, on the Merc on Friday, its lowest price since July. In the after-hours cash market, it was trading 25 to 30 cents below that. And it was trading even lower in the limited cash market over the weekend, said Edward A. Silliere Jr., the managing news editor of Telerate, an electronic financial reporting service.
He said that when the Merc re-opens today, "I wouldn't be at all surprised to see oil $1 down." One reason, he said, was that Iran and Saudi Arabia had substantial "floating inventories" of oil on tankers, amassed partly in anticipation of a price increase, and that they would now want to sell these stocks.
OPEC ministers from three countries outside the Persian Gulf are scheduled to consult in Geneva today, and Nauman Barakat, an oil market specialist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said they might ask the other ministers to join them. If the other ministers did attend, it would, in effect, move up the organization's next ministerial meeting, which is now scheduled for March 11, and cuts in production to stem the decline in prices could be discussed.
Mr. Barakut said oil prices were likely to fall initially if the ground war was swift and successful because traders would expect a quicker return of Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude to the market, and that they would expect a worsening glut unless Saudi Arabia cut its production. But he added that continued high Saudi production probably would not mean a worsening glut because the Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil operations may not be repaired for many months.
 
Damage Assessment Ahead
 With allied forces moving into Kuwait, a clearer assessment of the damage to the country's oil industry is likely in the next few days. Before the war, Kuwait's exports were about 1.6 million barrels a day, about 7 percent of OPEC's total.
Experts think that the Iraqi oil industry, which was about double Kuwait's production before the war, will take longer than Kuwait's to repair. When it will resume exporting oil is also complicated by the political issue of when international trade embargoes will be lifted.
A more lingering effect, probably, will be the loss of Kuwait's refineries, which will take years to rebuild.
But oil traders point out that the world learned months ago to live without Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude, and that the next few months are a relatively slack period for oil demand, as warmer weather approaches in most industrial countries.
 
Some Not Convinced
 But not everyone is convinced that prices will stay low. "All of the numbers, as best we can look at them, tend to show there is no particular oversupply anywhere," said Aivars Krasts, an economist for Conoco Inc. in Houston.
If prices stay low, he said, it is probably because the market has begun to see the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as readily available. The reserve, which has been tapped twice by the Bush Administration, contains nearly 600 million barrels.
At the Amoco Corporation, Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist, added that a quick war could raise demand for oil by "getting the issue behind us" for Europe, Japan and especially the United States, thus encouraging an upturn in economic activity and a rise in demand for oil products.
The end of the war should mean less volatility in oil markets, he said, because OPEC would be better able to predict demand and supply.
 
Demand for Revenue
 Mr. Eck said that the war would create a vast demand for more revenue in the Middle East, and that this was likely to push up prices. In the past, he said, OPEC "has not been a short-term profit-maximizing operation."
Some members, he said, had been willing to settle for lower prices in the short term so that oil would maintain its share of the world energy market and industrial countries would not find substitutes or learn to do without, a step that would mean hard times for exporters in decades to come.
Now, he said, rebuilding could cost $150 billion or more, and "everyone in the Middle East is going to have desperate requirements for more revenue, and nobody will take the long-term view."

HEADLINE: 2 West Virginia Towns Battle for F.B.I. Center

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CLARKSBURG, W.Va., Feb. 24

 BODY:
Two towns that share their water, their dogcatcher and even a page in the telephone directory are battling for the F.B.I.'s Fingerprint Identification Center.
At stake in the fight between Clarksburg and Bridgeport is $3 million in taxes from builders of the center. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation's center, now in downtown Washington, will be a major employer in the county, about 100 miles south of Pittsburgh. The county is still trying to recover from a decision by the Anchor Hocking Corporation to close a glass manufacturing plant in 1987; 900 workers lost their jobs. Unemployment in the county peaked at more than 18 percent in 1988 and stood at 9.7 percent last December.
About 2,000 of the F.B.I. center's 2,800 workers are to be hired locally, with the rest transferring from Washington.
Last month, the bureau paid about $3.5 million for pasture and woodland and part of a reclaimed strip mine. The land is not part of either city, but adjoins Bridgeport's city limits. Clarksburg's nearest border is about eight miles soth of the property. But the city moved to annex the land in July.
The issue goes to Harrison CountyCircuit Court on Tuesday, when Bridgeport will try to block the county commission's expected vote in favor of Clarksburg.
In the 1970's, Clarksburg, population 18,000, wanted to annex the shopping malls in Eastpointe by drawing a corridor from its city limits. Bridgeport, population 7,000, also wanted the malls, but the owners favored Clarksburg.
William Sessions, the Director of the F.B.I., has called the battle a local affair that will not affect construction. He spoke after an assistant sent a letter to the Clarksburg City Manager saying the bureau wanted to be in Clarksburg because the town was better preparedto provide police and fire protection and other services.
Efforts by the county commission to find a middle ground have failed.
"The feeling in Bridgeport is that Clarksburg is infringing on our territorial integrity," said Mayor Carl Furbee Jr. of Bridgeport.
Jack Allston, director of Harrison 2000, the county's economic development group, said the rivalry was not unusual.
"There are going to be naysayers no matter what comes in to an area," Mr. Allston said. "But 99 percent of the people are for this project because of the huge economic impact it will have."
Mabel Kovar of Clarksburg agreed.
"This is all foolishness," she said. "We need it here, no matter what, no matter where. If they keep it up, we might lose it."

HEADLINE: 9-Way Race for a Seat Soon to Vanish

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
On Tuesday, voters in the 29th City Council District in Brooklyn will choose from among nine candidates who have spent a total of $500,000 in a race for an office that will cease to exist before the end of the year.
Most of the candidates are liberal Democrats with barely distinguishable positions, but no trace of traditional party affiliations can be found on the ballot. Instead, the candidates are identified under peculiarly catchall and upbeat labels like "People's Choice" and "Better Government." 
 This special election, the second under the new City Charter, is to fill the north Brooklyn seat of Abraham G. Gerges, who resigned to become a State Supreme Court judge. The district includes all or parts of Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Boerum Hill, Bushwick and Park Slope.
Council elections have generally been among the uncontested or half-noticed sideshows of New York politics. But in the future, thanks to the new City Charter, they are expected to be more fiercely fought.
 
Grass-Roots Campaigning
 Because the Charter has mandated expanding the Council from 35 to 51 members, the city's 35 current districts are to be replaced this summer by 51 smaller ones in time for September primaries and the November general election. That will leave 16 additional seats up for grabs, and is designed to foster more grass-roots campaigning.
The Charter will also make special elections more common. In the past, Council vacancies had been left to each borough's Council delegation to fill by appointment.
The Charter stipulates that candidates in many of these special elections run without party identifications. Some Democratic and Republican Party officials say this provision violates state election law, and the provision may be challenged before the next special election. That election will be in April, to fill the Queens seat of Arthur J. Katzman, who has announced his retirement.
The changes were in keeping with the Charter's goal of increasing the Council's power, attracting members of greater political experience and making the board more representative of the city's minorities.
 
Biggest Issue: Incinerator
 But none of the candidates in the 29th District have previously held elective office, and all are white in one of the city's more heterogeneous districts, which is made up of Hispanic residents, Hasidic Jews, Polish emigres and blacks, as well as whites.
The debate over the contest's biggest issue -- the city's proposal to put an incinerator in Williamsburg -- has been dominated by personal attacks. Those clashes culminated last week when campaign workers for one of the two self-described front-runners, Joan Millman, placed an advertisement in a shopper that was directed to Williamsburg's Hasidim and that linked her chief opponent, Kenneth Fisher, with the incinerator. In the advertisement, which Mr. Fisher said was printed to look like a flaming tombstone, the incinerator was referred to in Yiddish as a "crematorium."
Mr. Fisher, a 38-year-old lawyer once affiliated with a law firm that represented the developer for the proposed incinerator, now opposes the project, as do all the other candidates. He denounced Ms. Millman, a 50-year-old educator and Brooklyn Heights district leader, for trying to associate him with the Holocaust in what he called a desperate effort to diminish his strong support among Hasidic voters.
Mr. Fisher, who is the son of a former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman, Harold L. Fisher, and who has been endorsed by the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden; the Bronx Borough President, Fernado Ferrer, and the Citizens Union, said that the incinerator diverted attention from "major issues of crime, housing and the deterioration of quality of life."
 
'Last-Ditch Effort'
 Ms. Millman, who has been endorsed by the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, and The New York Times, said that the advertisement used the word "incinerator," but was mistranslated by the shopper, The Advertiser, from English into Yiddish. She said that she would not pay for the advertisement, and that Mr. Fisher was using it as "a last-ditch effort to smear me."
While their clashes have dominated the seemingly minimal attention paid to the race by the district's 200,000 residents, the seven other candidates have feverishly tried to distinguish themselves from each other and to distance themselves from what they call the politics-as-usual approaches of Mr. Fisher and Ms. Millman.
Because the turnout is expected to be just 10 to 15 percent, a tight race could be swung by a few thousand votes. Consequently, the other candidates say their intensive grass-roots campaigning will help them emerge as dark-horse victors. Most of their fire has been directed at Mr. Fisher's and Ms. Millman's refusals to accept public campaign money and the resulting limits on spending. Candidates who accept the public matching grants are limited to spending $105,000 on the race. Mr. Fisher has acknowledged that he has spent more than $100,000, and Democrat officials say Ms. Millman has spent about $90,000.
"It's horrendous that Fisher and Millman, who are slashing each other's throats in public, haven't gone for public funding," said Angela Battaglia, a 38-year-old director of a housing center for the elderly in Bushwick. She has cited her long experience as an advocate on housing issues and for the elderly, and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's endorsement of her candidacy for organizing block associations to fight crime.
 
Most to Run Again
 Lonni Leavitt-Cacchione, a longtime Brooklyn Heights community advocate, called Ms. Millman a machine politician interested in patronage, and said members of Mr. Fisher's family who have been involved in government have "shot down any reforms over the years."
Irene Van Slyke, a 50-year-old nurse and aide to State Senator Velmanette Montgomery, has been endorsed by New York Newsday and called herself "the only candidate with government experience." She has advocated putting more police officers on the streets and creating park land along the Brooklyn Heights waterfront.
Linda T. Minucci, a seven-year district leader in Greenpoint, said that she was the first to oppose the incinerator and that she has long focused on ecological damage to Williamsburg and Greenpoint caused by a huge underground oil spill and a toxic-waste storage center.
John T. Glick, a 41-year-old tenant organizer in Boerum Hill who was endorsed by The Village Voice, called for increasing income taxes for the rich, reducing tax abatements for developers and expanding economic planning to reduce competition among New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The Socialist Workers candidate, Angela L. Lariscy, has principally campaigned against the Persian Gulf war. And Gary S. Popkin, running on the anti-crime line, wants "to increase prison capacity cheaply, so that everyone who is convicted would be imprisoned."

HEADLINE: The Ground War and the American Economy;
Boost but No Cure For the Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
If the ground war ends in an allied victory in the Persian Gulf by late March, with relatively few casualties, the American economy will almost certainly receive a boost. But many economists doubt that peace by springtime would be sufficient in itself to end the recession.
The two great benefits that are likely to follow an early victory are a rise in consumer confidence and a drop in oil prices to the prewar level of $18 a barrel or less. More confident consumers, in turn, would spend more. And lower oil prices would give them more to spend, by reducing outlays for energy. 
 "These positive elements will offset some of the negatives, said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. "But I don't see a very rapid recovery because there are so many other negatives unrelated to the war."
 
Economic Problems
 For Mr. Gordon and other economists, the negatives include months of rising unemployment and stagnant personal income, a sharp drop in industrial production since November, a dormant construction industry, a banking sector in crisis and hundreds of state and city governments forced into cutbacks and layoffs because of budget deficits. Until last year, spending by these governments had been a source of economic growth for the nation.
The Bush Administration and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, have primarily blamed the recession on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the damage it did to consumer confidence, as oil prices rose and the likelihood of war made Americans nervous. While Government officials count on a quick victory to reverse the recession, those who measure consumer confidence have their doubts.
 
Limited Euphoria
 "If the war ends soon, there may conceivably be some sort of euphoria that will give the economy a lift, but the ending of the war is not going to jump us out of the recession," said Fabian Linden, director of a monthly survey of consumer confidence sponsored by the Conference Board, a business organization. "The realities of the job market are the consumer's main focus now."
Among those who responded to the Conference Board's January survey of nearly 5,000 households, 36 percent said they expected job opportunities to worsen over the coming months, while only 9 percent expected job prospects to improve. Those recession-level percentages are not expected to change in the board's February survey, which is scheduled to be released late this week. In normal economic times, job optimists outnumber pessimists four to one, Mr. Linden said.
But if an early victory is no cure-all for the economy, a prolonged ground war, lasting through the end of the year, may not have much impact either. As Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, puts it: "Objectively, this war is not an important factor in the economy, and it is hard for me to explain how it is linked to consumer confidence. Unless the war took a turn for the worse, which no one foresees except Saddam Hussein, I don't see the war becoming a major quantitative influence on the economy."
 
Not a Stimulant
 One reason is that the Persian Gulf war, unlike the Korean and Vietnam wars, is not costing enough to be either a stimulant or a drain on the economy. Outlays for those wars, mostly for weapons production and supplies, represented 8 to 15 percent of the gross national product, the total value of newly produced goods and services. The outlays for the gulf war are far less.
Peter Garber, a Brown University economist who teaches a course on war and the economy, estimated the potential cost of the Persian Gulf war at a maximum of roughly $35 billion a month for the United States. That would mean an outlay of about $100 billion through March, or 1.8 percent of G.N.P. Only if the war dragged on through December would spending approach 7 percent of G.N.P. and perhaps begin to act as an economic stimulant, mostly through increased weapons production.
So far, most of the gulf war spending is for food, fuel and other supplies purchased abroad, often with money supplied by Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany and other allies -- an outlay that bypasses the United States economy. Weapons production in the United States has not been affected; the gulf war is being fought from the inventory of weaponry built up during the Carter and Reagan Administrations.
Military contractors confirm this assessment. A spokesman for the Raytheon Company, maker of the Patriot missile, said, for example, that the Pentagon had asked the company to speed up production of Patriots ordered before the gulf crisis began in August but had not placed new orders. Similar reports come from the General Dynamics Corporation, manufacturer of the Abrams tank and various warplanes, and the Grumman Corporation, also a warplane maker.
Still, weapons production might make a contribution to economic growth in the months and years after the gulf war ends, Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant, said.
"We seem to be using up a huge amount of stuff," Mr. Bernstein said, "and I would think we would not only want to replace what we have used, but add more, because it would appear that we have demonstrated in the gulf a great military capability, and we want to prepare to use it again."
 
Military Spending
 Military spending acts as a stimulant mostly through the creation of jobs at weapons companies and their suppliers. The jobholders, in turn, spend their new incomes on a great variety of services and products, adding to the prosperity of other sectors. The problem is that military contractors, seeking to cut costs, have laid off tens of thousands of workers over the last two years, and many would not be rehired, even if the Pentagon placed new purchase orders.
Peter Connolly, a spokesman for General Dynamics, said, for example, that if the Defense Department increased its cruise missile orders by 20 percent, "that would not have a significant impact on employment."
The American economy might also benefit in the postwar months if the United States emerged in control of a plentiful supply of inexpensive Middle East oil. Confidence in such a supply might stimulate not only consumer spending but also industrial production. For the consumer, lower energy costs free some income for spending on cars, appliances and other products. For the manufacturer, lower energy costs restore profit margins, giving a company leeway to draw customers by discounting.
"We get a boost from both the demand and the supply side," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist.

HEADLINE: Tokyo's Importing More, but Who's Benefiting?

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After a five-year battle by the United States and European nations to open Japan's markets and correct its big trade imbalances, imports have risen swiftly and Japan's huge financial surpluses have plummeted. On the surface, the changes seem substantial.
But as is often the case with such broad economic shifts, the side effects, like the expected boon to foreign companies and improved living standards for Japanese consumers, have not materialized the way some economists on both sides of the Pacific had forecast. While some progress has occurred, companies like Toys "R" Us are still struggling to build a network of stores here.
 
Too Expensive
 Other companies still find it just too expensive, like Citibank, when it sought to buy a bank or bank branches to develop a retail system. So the flow of foreign capital into Japan remains a trickle, while corporate Japan has continued to build up its share of foreign markets with big overseas investments. 
 A look at the broadest measure of Japan's trade in goods and services and financial transactions, called the current account, finds big changes. The surplus in the account tumbled to $35.8 billion last year, according to preliminary Government figures. The decline was the third in a row, bringing the surplus to less than half its peak of $87 billion in 1987.
The current account includes manufactured goods, like cars, VCR's and stereos, that make up "visible" trade, as well "invisible" items, like services, tourism and financial transactions across borders.
 
Major Political Issue
 Since it gives the fullest measure of the cross-border flows, the perennial surplus was regarded by some Western economists as the most menacing of Japan's imbalances. It is a big political issue between Tokyo and Washington, with American officials contending that Japan unfairly restricts imports and hinders competition from outside firms in areas like banking.
Another pronounced change is that the flood of Japanese investment in corporate stocks, bonds and other securities overseas, largely to the United States, has dropped sharply and has shifted in character. The outflow had provided an important source of financing in the United States for everything from the oversized Federal budget deficits to leveraged buyouts. Japan's long-term capital outflow peaked at $136.5 billion in 1987, then fell to $43.5 billion last year.
In fact, the Finance Ministry's Vice Minister for International Affairs, Makoto Utsumi, said recently that the swift narrowing of the current account did not worry him, but that the decline in the amount of capital Japan was exporting to a world where capital was scarce at the moment did. A great deal of that money had been used to acquire securities, mostly Treasury bonds.
Takatoshi Okuyama, the general manager of the investment advisory department at Daiwa Securities, said it was too early to say how fundamental the change was, but added, "it is clear now that interest among Japanese institutions in investing in U.S. securities has declined." Much higher domestic interest rates and reduced lending by banks are keeping more Japanese money at home.
 
More Investments in U.S.
 Still, while the big Japanese purchases of Treasury securities and other stocks and bonds has declined, Japanese electronics and automobile companies are making larger, more direct investments in new manufacturing plants overseas and are buying more foreign companies.
Recent examples include the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's acquisition of the California-based movie maker, MCA Inc.; the Toyota Motor Corporation's decision to build a new plant in the United States, and the Sharp Corporation's plans to assemble thin computer-video display screens at its plant in Camas, Wash., that makes computer chips.
Such moves increase the market penetration of the Japanese companies. Direct investment soared to more than $50 billion last year, from about $20 billion in 1987.
 
No Benefit to Consumers
 The Japanese consumer was supposed to have been a prime beneficiary of these shifts, reaping the rewards of cheaper and more imported goods. But retail prices have not declined with the stronger yen and growing imports. And the surge in domestic investment has largely been for industrial development, not for better roads, schools and housing that consumers might enjoy.
"The adjustment to the new environment has come on the corporate side, not for Japanese consumers," said Kenneth S. Courtis, an economist here for Deutsche Bank. "These changes have not given anyone a leg up on corporate Japan."
To be sure, Japan is importing far more manufactured goods, as the United States and European nations have demanded. But most of the decline in the trade surplus in the last year comes from the jump in the price of crude oil that Japan must import. That was a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, not a greater penetration of foreign goods into the Japanese market. The higher cost of oil forces up the value of Japanese imports and slows the economic growth of Japan's trading partners, which in turn buy fewer Japanese goods.
 
Slowing Export Growth
 Export growth, meanwhile, has slowed in part because Japanese companies produce more of their goods in the countries where they are sold. For instance, Japanese auto companies now make in the United States slightly more than half of the cars they sell to Americans -- 2.6 million last year. These goods made in Japanese-owned factories abroad are substitutes for exports.
These trends began as a giant macroeconomic experiment, when the leading industrialized nations engineered a doubling of the yen's value against the dollar starting in September 1985. Their accord to do so is known as the Plaza Agreement, after the New York hotel where they met.
The aim was to limit Japan's soaring trade surpluses by making Japanese exports more expensive, and American goods cheaper for Japanese consumers.
 
Surplus at $63.9 Billion
 According to Japanese Government figures, Japan's visible trade surplus has declined by a third from its peak in 1987, to $63.9 billion last year. The current account surplus has fallen nearly twice as fast as the visible trade surplus. The main reason: a boom in Japanese travel abroad, which does not affect the visible trade balance but shows up in the current account.
The current account surplus should shrink more this year. One big temporary, but sizable, bite is the $9 billion in aid the Japanese Government has promised to the American-led forces in the Persian Gulf. The aid is treated as a financial transfer that directly cuts into the current account balance.
As a result, many economists are putting less emphasis on the current account as a measure of Japan's economic prowess. They are not ignoring what had been a standard measure in the past, but they are focusing more on factors like foreign direct investment, capital flows and the structure of the country's imports and exports.
 
Waiting and Hoping
 Japanese consumers are still waiting for the deeper benefits they were promised. Five years ago, a blue-ribbon Japanese commission, under the direction of Haruo Maekawa, a former governor of the Bank of Japan, drafted a blueprint for economic reform that called for measures to improve the living standards of Japanese consumers to levels enjoyed in the West.
Yutaka Kosai, a member of the commission and president of the Japan Center for Economic Research, said he was disappointed that Japanese consumers had gotten so little out of the economic adjustments.
The report proposed that Japan not just invest more abroad, but absorb more foreign investment. The flow has largely been one-way, into foreign markets. Also, Japanese workers have not enjoyed the large reduction in working hours the commission proposed, Mr. Kosai said.
"I can't say we achieved what we wanted," he acknowledged.
 
Public Investment in Question
 In an important trade accord with the United States last year, Japan agreed to raise its public investment in the next 10 years to improve living standards. But talk has already arisen that Japan's billions of dollars in aid for the gulf war may force a reduction in the program.
Some of these changes have caused a debate in Japan over whether the decline in the country's surpluses, which most agreed was needed, has been too swift.
Tomomitsu Oba, the head of a Government-affiliated research group and a former Vice Minister of International Affairs at the Finance Ministry, has contended that Japan must not let its current account surplus shrink to less than 1 percent of its gross national product, where it now stands.
Otherwise, he contends, Japan will be unable to provide the capital that other nations need for financing everything from budget deficits to the reconstruction of Eastern Europe.
"This is a bad sign," Mr. Oba said of the decline in an interview. "This reduction comes at a time when the world needs Japan's excess savings."
 
Others Dispute Stance
 Mr. Oba's position is countered by people who say that Japan's ability to provide aid to the world is little affected by the size of its financial surpluses. The United States, for instance, has been a leading aid donor to the rest of the world, even as it shoulders huge trade deficits.
"This idea that we need a certain size surplus is still popular among old-style people, and I don't mean chronological age," said Michiya Matsukawa, also a former Vice Minister of Finance and now an adviser to the Nikko Securities Company. "There's no clear-cut relationship between our ability to make overseas investments and the size of the current account surplus."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Have Investors Already Made Their Bets on Victory?

BYLINE: BY FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
More than a month ago, Wall Street analysts were nearly unanimous in their fears that the beginning of the allies' war against Iraq could send stock prices plunging. They were wrong.
Last week, a similar but less-cohesive consensus developed, that a ground war was bad news for financial markets. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose swiftly amid talk of a peaceful withdrawal, only to plunge back on investors' expectations that Iraq was not going to accept the terms laid down by President Bush. 
 In early trading today, Japan provided the first indication of how investors viewed the ground war. Share prices opened higher in Tokyo, slipped back, then rose to post modest gains in morning trading. The activity seemed to indicate that the start of the land war had provided little new information to sway sentiment. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 193.70 points. [Page D3.]
In New York during the last month, there has been a sharp increase in both stock prices and bullishness. "We're talking about an early end to the war and an early end to the recession," Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist of Bear Stearns & Company, predicted yesterday.
But Mr. Kudlow, one of the few people on Wall Street to forecast correctly that prices would rise after the start of the air war, said he expected a much more muted response this time. On Jan. 17, the Dow Jones industrial average leaped 114.60 points, or 4.6 percent, to 2,623.51.
"The principal issue, financially and economically, was the price of energy and the security of the Saudi oilfields," Mr. Kudlow said of the atmosphere before war broke out. "Those issues have been determined, and the ground war does not affect that."
The burning oilfields in Kuwait make it unlikely that country will soon resume production of anything close to its prewar output, but oil markets have shrugged that off. In New York on Friday, after the reports of oilfield fires had circulated, crude oil for April delivery fell 59 cents a barrel, to $17.59.
The war has not been the only influence on financial markets, and some American investors say it has been overemphasized. "The war is not going to affect how many diapers Procter & Gamble sells," said Peter Thayer, the president of the Gateway Index Plus Fund, a mutual fund based in Cincinnati.
Mr. Thayer said last week that he thought stock prices had gone too high, pointing to valuation measures and the sharp escalation in stock prices since the war began.
"It's beyond ahead of itself," he said of the stock market. "It is absurd."
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 came at a time when oil prices were already rising and drove them sharply higher. That helped send share prices down rapidly, and from then through Jan. 16, the Dow fell 13.5 percent, or 390.35 points.
But since then, the Dow has made up nearly all of that loss, with the 15.2 percent recovery leaving the index at 2,889.36 on Friday -- only 9.90 points below its level on Aug. 1. The Standard & Poor's 500 is well above its level on Aug. 2 and set record highs earlier this month.
But last week, the rally began to show signs of fading. Volume dropped, and most stock indexes showed their first weekly decline since early January.
Trading activity was much lower in the weeks leading up to the start of the air war in January; many institutional investors husbanded cash and waited for what they thought would be a buying opportunity after the war began. When prices rallied, those investors jumped in, sending prices even higher.
Now, with all that money invested, there may be less liquidity available to drive the market higher should the allies triumph. "I feel the market is in a no-win situation," Michael Metz, the chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, told Reuters. "The investment community has already bought and paid for a brief and highly successful ground campaign."
In the end, the stock market's course must reflect the successes, or lack of them, of the companies whose stocks are being traded. Some companies seem likely to benefit from the end of the war, notably those likely to get large Kuwaiti contracts to help rebuild the country and put its oil industry back into operation. Kuwait is reported to be planning to give a large share of those contracts to American and British companies, including those in the construction and oil-service businesses.
For other companies, the health of the economy will be a major factor. The stock market's sharp ascent since mid-January appears to be anticipating a quick end to the recession in this country.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has voiced fears that a prolonged war would depress consumer confidence and thus extend the recession. There are hopes that a successful completion of the fighting will help to restore that confidence, perhaps leading to rebounds in sectors like housing and auto sales.
Both those areas are supposed to benefit from lower interest rates, but so far they have not, despite aggressive easing from the Fed. The rate on three-month Treasury bills, at 7.43 percent when Iraq invaded, is now at 5.96 percent.
The bond market's rally, like the stock market's, showed signs of failing health last week. Mr. Kudlow said one cause was concern over possible heavy Government borrowing to finance the war.
Internationally, the American stock market fell less late last year than did others, and while all markets have moved up since the air war began, those in Germany and Japan, for example, remain well below the levels they held before the Iraqi invasion. The relative performance of the American market, however, is not as good as it appears at first, simply because the dollar has also been falling for much of the period, although it showed some strength last week.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: WASHINGTON;
Aides Discuss Pressing For Hussein's Removal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Although Administration officials are not prepared to say so publicly, they are making it increasingly clear that the United States now considers the downfall of President Saddam Hussein and the elimination of his Baath Party structure not only the most desirable ending to the war but also an attainable outcome.
President Bush's official position is that the United States is not actively seeking to remove Mr. Hussein from power, although the President has indicated he would welcome the Iraqi leader's ouster. Administration officials say they will be satisfied if the land war only evicts Iraq from Kuwait and seriously damages the Iraqi armed forces. 
 But Administration officials are speaking with increasing candor about the desire to see Mr. Hussein deposed and about ways of applying pressure to accomplish that.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, and Robert M. Gates, Mr. Scowcroft's deputy, all suggested in television appearances today that if Mr. Hussein remained in power, Washington and its allies would keep United Nations sanctions in place longer than they might otherwise. They also indicated that the American naval and air presence in the gulf would probably grow after the war.
"We're not making it an objective of the war that he goes," a senior State Department official said. "But we're trying to create an environment that either insures that the people of Iraq understand it's not in their interest to keep him around or that insures that he cannot be a threat to any other country."
As the onset of ground combat brought the United States closer to being able to dictate the terms of the end of the war, senior officials acknowledged publicly today that American political goals exceed the simple military objective of liberating Kuwait.
When asked if the United States intended to carry out the equivalent of the de-Nazification of Germany after World War II, Mr. Baker said that was a "political aim" of Washington.
 
'A Heck of a Lot Easier'
 If Mr. Hussein remains in power, Administration officials said, Mr. Bush is calculating that his military will be so badly damaged that it will not be a threat and that he himself will no longer be a political force.
But Mr. Baker said today on the ABC News program "This Week" that the United Nations resolutions on Kuwait "imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."
But if the United States succeeds in achieving the downfall of Mr. Hussein, it could reignite the longstanding civil strife in Iraq.
The United States could then be forced to decide how deeply involved it wants to be in a politically divided country without roads and airports and with even its ability to feed itself severely damaged by the war.
As the ground war loomed last week, the question of Mr. Hussein's future caused the first significant rift between the United States and the Soviet Union over the gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2.
Administration officials said today that they believed the aim of the Soviet Union's attempts at peace brokering was to prevent the United States from achieving its political aims in the gulf.
"I think they would like to keep Saddam in power and I think they would like to retain an influence in an Iraq that's a player in the region," a senior Administration official said.
 
Overstepping Resolutions Feared
 This was one reason, officials said, that Mr. Bush did not inform Mr. Gorbachev of the exact starting time for the ground offensive, even though the two spoke on Saturday just before Mr. Bush's ultimatum expired at noon.
Still, both in public and in private, officials tried to play down the idea that the differences over the gulf would sour Soviet-American relations. They noted that the Soviet Union backed down after its peace efforts fell through, and did not try to block further military action through the United Nations Security Council.
Officials said the Soviet Union had agreed to refrain from such action and to avoid strongly anti-American responses to the ground war. In return, the United States had promised that this episode would not disrupt superpower relations after the war, the officials said.
One reason that officials have taken care not to make Mr. Hussein's downfall, even at the hands of his own people, an explicit goal, is that it would exceed the mandate of the United Nations and could draw opposition within the coalition. It also could draw fire on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have been divided about whether the United States should actively seek Mr. Hussein's removal.
 
Explicit Criticism Avoided
 Today, lawmakers generally avoided criticism of Mr. Bush's decision to launch the ground war. But Democrats also pointedly avoided expressing specific approval for it either.
"I hope that the U.S. and allied forces' efforts will be successful with the minimum loss of life," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Majority Leader.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has generally urged Mr. Bush to move slowly in the gulf, said, "The ground war, like the air war, has been well planned and I am confident that our military will carry it out with skill and professionalism. I am also confident that we will succeed."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said, "The American people pray for the men and women who are risking their lives for a free and independent Kuwait, and I join in their prayers."

The Ground War Begins
If the Persian Gulf war ends in an allied victory by late March, with relatively few casualties, the American economy will almost certainly receive a lift. But many economists doubt that peace by springtime is sufficient in itself to end the recession. An early victory's biggest likely benefits are a rise in consumer confidence and a drop in oil prices. [Page D1.] 
 The ground war against Iraq is likely to result in lower oil prices, at least in the short term, experts said yesterday. Most of these experts said a short ground war was likely to bring lower prices than a longer conflict. [D1.]
A relatively short campaign will have little effect on military contractors' prospects, analysts and executives say, even though it is the first combat test of several weapons systems. [D3.]
The beginning of the ground attack had a modest but positive effect on financial markets in Tokyo. [D3.]
More than a month ago, Wall Street was nearly unanimous in fearing that the beginning of the war against Iraq could send stock prices plunging. It was wrong. Last week, a similar but less cohesive consensus developed, holding that a ground war was bad news for financial markets. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D1.]
 
The Economy
Orders for American-made machine tools plunged 32.4 percent in January from an unusually high level in December. Analysts said that in addition to being skewed by a year-end surge in orders, the sharp decline reflected typical weak winter demand. [D2.]
First Chicago Corporation says it revoked thousands of credit cards held by residents of Northeastern states as part of a credit review of the economically weak region. [D2.]
The sporting goods industry is doing its best to ignore the forebodings of recession, hoping a menu of new technology, sauteed in marketing hype, will bring in sales. [C10.]
The F.D.A. has approved the first human tests of a purified blood product from cattle. If successful, the experiments could lead to safer and cheaper blood transfusions. [B8.]
 
International
The stage is set for a fierce scrap in Washington between protectionists and free traders. Forces led by organized labor and the textile industry are hoping to torpedo a prospective world trade agreement, as well as one between the U.S. and Mexico. [D1.]
After a five-year battle to open Japan's markets, imports have risen swiftly and huge financial surpluses have plummeted. [D6.]
Poland reached a tentative agreement with the I.M.F. on a $2 billion aid package. [A2.]
 
The Media Business
Samir Husni's Guide to New Magazines shows a thriving industry, with hundreds of new magazines each year. [D1.]
Leonard H. Goldenson thinks he knows what is wrong with the network television business: The ideas are not fresh enough, the programming is not risky enough, and the executives are not young enough. Bill Carter: Television. [D10.]
Publishers are turning to consultants for advice on everything from motivating the sales force to selling books to libraries to making warehouses cost-effective. [D10.]
The Los Angeles Times plans to stop selling papers in part of central California and in neighboring states, but it is expected to remain the nation's largest circulation metropolitan daily. [D10.]
K Mart will begin one of its biggest TV campaigns early next month with a series of 200 separate commercials. The ads are intended to demonstrate that the chain has some things in common with fancier department stores. Kim Foltz: Advertising. [D8.]
 
Today's Column

HEADLINE: Blaze Strikes Office Tower in Philadelphia, Killing 3

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Three firefighters were killed today in a fire that raged for 18 1/2 hours through eight floors of a downtown office tower.
Even after the blaze was brought under control at 3 P.M., there were fears that the 38-story building had been so weakened that its top half might collapse or shed its granite skin. 
 Fire officials said the blaze, the nation's worst high-rise fire in a decade, could have been under control in an hour if the building had had sprinklers on every floor. It was only after sprinklers on the top 10 floors began working that the fire was contained.
 
Warning to Firefighters
 Most firefighters left the building, One Meridian Plaza, about 7:30 A.M. today, when engineers warned of a collapse. The police cordoned off a five-block area and the City Hall plaza, across the street and said some streets might have to be closed indefinitely.
Fire Marshal Robert C. Wauhop said a collapse could not be ruled out until structural engineers completed their inspection of the building, perhaps as early as Monday. "We don't know if the building is sound," he said.
The three firefighters who died in the building had radioed for help about midnight Saturday, saying they were trapped on the 30th floor and that their portable tanks were running out of air.
A rescue team landed a helicopter on the building's roof in a futile effort to bring them out. "By the time we found them it was too late," said Roger M. Ulshafer, the Philadelphia Fire Commissioner. Their bodies were found on the 28th floor, but it was not clear if they had given the wrong floor in their call for help or if they had moved.
 
Cause Is Unknown
 The cause of the fire is unknown. Fire officials said it probably started in an insurance office on the 22d floor of the million building, which is named after the building's prime tenant, Meridian Bancorp.
As the fire raged out of control, about 200 firefighters from 35 companies could do little more than stand by, their equipment on the street, and watch the smoke and flames consume the building. Some firefighters, standing on the roof of a adjacent high-rise building, fired plumes of water into the burning structure.
The fire blackened the top 16 stories of the building, and smoke poured out of hundreds of missing windows. Elevators could not be used, so firefighters had to stretch six 5-inch hoses by hand to the 22nd floor, he said.
"By the time we got them up there and got enough water, the fire was three floors above our heads," Mr. Ulshafer said.
At times, smoke enveloped the statue of William Penn on top of City Hall and could be seen for miles on this clear, mild day. Hundreds of people came to watch; many brought video cameras.
 
Limited Sprinkler System
 The 19-year-old building, like most of the nation's high-rises, has a very limited sprinkler system. A city law, passed in 1984, requires sprinkler systems on every floor of new buildings over seven stories tall; One Meridian Plaza had them only on the top 10 floors, primarily to fight possible fires in a heliport on its roof.
Making matters worse last night, Mr. Ulshafer said, all of the building's fire-protection systems failed: emergency electric generators, water pumps and pressure valves that would normally have provided firefighters with water on the upper floors.
The failures delayed firefighting efforts for several hours, and the blaze engulfed four floors before firefighting efforts began in earnest.
The fire gutted the 22d story through the 29th, and Mr. Ulshafer said its intense heat had badly warped and weakened the building's steel skeleton from the 18th story to the 28th.
"We're very concerned that the building may collapse, pancaking down to the 18th floor," he said.
The three men who died last night were Capt. David Holcomb, who was 52 years old and had been with the department for 28 years; Phyllis McAllister, 44, a 10-year veteran, and James A. Chappell, 29, a four-year veteran.
Seventeen firefighters were injured.
 
'State of Shock'
 "We're all basically in a state of shock," said Fire Chief Bernard D. Dyer. "The whole department is very saddened by it. These were co-workers and our friends."
The building's owner, Richard I. Rubin & Company, a local real estate developer, said in a statement: "Words are simply inadequate to express our deepest sympathy to the families of those firemen who have been injured and those who have lost their lives in this most terrible disaster."
The burning building has 756,000 square feet. One onlooker, Andrew Mainardi 3d, general partner of the Mainardi Management Company, a commercial real estate firm, estimated that it was worth over $150 million.
Neither Mayor W. Wilson Goode nor his press secretary returned calls seeking comment.
The Philadelphia fire is the nation's worst high-rise fire since Nov. 21, 1980, when 84 people died inside the MGM Grand's 28-story hotel and casino in Las Vegas. That fire was blamed on the building's antiquated safety design, built before the adoption of a 1970 Uniform Building Code, which has been adopted by many cities and counties.
William T. Jones, deputy assistant chief of the New York Fire Department, said of the Philadelphia fire: "We've never had a fire that serious in New York. Could it happen in New York? Possibly, but not probably." New York City regulations adopted in 1973 require every 7,500 square feet of high-rise space to be isolated with fire-resistant walls.
 
Off-Duty Forces Called
 Edward Marra, chief of operations for Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections, said that when the city passed the 1984 law for new buildings officials wanted all buildings to be fitted with sprinklers.
"But for economic reasons or because they didn't think it was necessary, they didn't require it," he said. "This fire will help our cause. Unfortunately, to change a code you have to produce a body count."
The fire absorbed much of the department's manpower, forcing the department to call up all of its off-duty firefighters last night, said Fire Chief Dyer.
The police said several downtown streets would be closed for several days and urged commuters to take public transportation.
Mr. Ulshafer said firefighters would let the building cool naturally before trying to enter, probably Monday.
"We're concerned that the cold water on the hot steel up there will cause further contraction and expansion and then give us a collapse," he said.

HEADLINE: Effect of Persian Gulf News On Tokyo Markets Is Slight

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The beginning of the ground attack in the Persian Gulf war had a modest but positive effect on financial markets here early today. Traders said a quick victory by the United States and its allies over Iraq had been anticipated by investors last week.
Market experts were quick to add, however, that should the news from the Persian Gulf turn negative after the inital signs of success, the markets could be vulnerable to deep disappointment and a severe drop. 
 In the meantime, the dollar rose, oil prices were unchanged, and the Tokyo stock market edged upward.
 
Nikkei Finishes Higher
 In the morning trading session, the closely watched Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 559.95 points, or 2.1 percent, to 26,462.76. At midday, the Nikkei rose 193.70 points, also less than 1 percent, to 26,096.51, and buying by Japanese investment trusts gave the market an added lift in the last hour of trading. On Friday, the index fell 121.56 points.
"The feeling here has been that one way or another, we were getting close to an end of the war," Lawrence Praeger, an analyst at Nikko Securities, said after morning trading. "The market is starting to look beyond the war now, really. What is driving it is the fundamentals, things like the economy and the dollar."
Much as expected, the dollar popped upwards when trading began here early today. This was also based on the prospect that an end to the war would boost consumer sentiment in the United States and invigorage the stalled American economy.
The dollar rose as high as 132.80 yen here, then slipped slightly to 132.35 at midday, up from 132.15 in New York late on Friday.
 
News Was Discounted
 "There is still a limit to how high the dollar can go, because the news was basically discounted," Takashi Okura, head foreign exchange trader here for the Bank of America, said after the early session.
The oil markets were even quieter. In Singapore, the center for crude oil trading in Asia, traders said prices barely budged. The benchmark price for light crude oil was quoted at $17.75 a barrel, compared with $17.91 in New York late on Friday.
"Nothing happened because there is still no shortage of oil," said a trader in Singapore. "Even with the Kuwaiti facilities ruined by the Iraqis, that does not change the supply situation since we hadn't been getting any oil from Iraq. There's no reason to take prices up or down yet."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE TROOPS;
'We Own This Piece,' G.I. Proclaims

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN IRAQ, Feb. 24

 BODY:
More than 2,000 American air assault troops plunged at least 50 miles into Iraq at first light today in what officials described as the largest helicopter-borne operation in military history.
The attack north of Iraq's troop concentrations by the 101st Airborne Division established what is essentially a giant, fortified gas station. The installation, known as Cobra base, will fuel helicopters for assaults in the strategic Euphrates River valley to sever the main highway between Baghdad and Basra. 
 "We own this piece of desert," 1st Lieut. Phil Johnson, a Ranger, said with a grin as his Huey helicopter settled into the landing zone in a cloud of sand dust.
 
20 Miles in Diameter
 The operation was so huge and so far-flung that its dimensions were hard to grasp. The new Cobra Zone embraces a circle 20 miles in diameter, with defending infantry battalions ranged around the edge. As the ground campaign accelerates, the entire base is to be moved again.
By nightfall, a supporting ground column of more than 700 trucks had reached the base, bringing the number of troops there to 4,000. As American planners moved operations ahead of schedule because of what they said was crumbling Iraqi resistance, another brigade from the 101st planned to fly into the base tonight.
French light armor attacking from the ground on the 101st's left flank was moving faster than anticipated, ranking officers said. On the right flank were the American 24th Mechanized Infantry Division and the VII Armored Corps, equipped with heavy M-1A1 tanks that raced north from the border this afternoon, nearly a day ahead of schedule.
 
Column of Black Helicopters
 As the sun broke over the sands early this morning, long columns of giant black Chinook helicopters, many of them carrying field artillery, trucks, boxes of ammunition and aviation fuel, swept over the horizon barely 40 feet above the ground. Cobra and Apache attack helicopters had been blasting the area, an ancient lake bed, for days to clear out any possible resistance.
By late morning, a small hill had sprouted radio antennas at the makeshift command post. Soldiers had begun digging into the sandy, rock-strewn soil with entrenching tools and filling sandbags.
"There's not another division in the army that could have done this," exulted the commander of the First Brigade, Col. Tom Hill, standing atop the hill at midday. Radio men crouched around him, calling out map coordinates.
 
G.I.'s Shout 'Hoo-ah!"
 "Hoo-ah! Hoo-ah!" soldiers and officers shouted in this war's expression of approval, as they tumbled off the helicopters and scrambled into position.
The first combat test of the Army's new air-land battle doctrine went almost like clockwork, officers said, and virtually without opposition. The doctrine calls for large-scale use of air power and leap-frogging mobile troops over concentrations of enemy forces to attack from a position of advantage.
The helicopters that flew on operations from the Cobra base met only light, scattered resistance. By midday, roughly 15 prisoners had been taken, American officers said, including an Iraqi battalion commander who was persuaded to urge some remaining troops to surrender.
"The prisoners we've gotten say, 'This is Saddam's war, we don't want any part of it,' " said Lieut. Col. Gary Bridges, whose Third Battalion flushed a small group of Iraqis out of a bunker.
 
100,000 Gallons of Fuel
 By midday, Cobra and Apache attack helicopters were refueling for attacks further north, drawing up to giant containers with black nozzles and rubber bladders. The containers were ferried here along with 100,000 gallons of aviation fuel by the Chinook helicopters.
"This is a way station for future operations," said Colonel Hill."That's why we're here. We've put in here in the last three-plus hours 2,000 soldiers and 50 TOW antitank systems. We're starting to pump gas. It's going according to schedule. We got here. That's the first step on the road."
Briefing five journalists who accompanied the division during the final days of planning, the 101st Division commander, Maj. Gen. J. H. Binford Peay 3d, had said: "What we hope is we've got him by surprise. He doesn't know we're coming in."
That indeed appeared to be the case.
As one of the troop-ferrying helicopters rumbled north, its passengers could see a single Iraqi soldier emerging from a hut and staring, slack-jawed at the sight.
 
Wondering What Iraqis Think
 "We were talking about what those guys would think on the way in," said Command Sgt. Major Jim Arrabondo as the Third Battalion's mortar platoon dug in to protect their position. "One moment it's peaceful, the next moment they've got a whole brigade on them."
Cobra Zone is not only a refueling stop, but a staging area for the division's other two brigades as they leap northeast.
"This is air assault history in the making," Colonel Hill told the reporters attached to the division in an earlier briefing before the ground war began. "There has never been anything like this done before. When the war starts, we're going to be a long way in with nobody else around."
In addition to more than 2,000 soldiers, the 118 helicopters were shuttling in supplies, including about 50 truck-mounted TOW anti-tank weapons, two full artillery battalions of 105-millimeter howitzers, tons of miscellaneous supplies including eight dirt motorcycles for the division's scouts, and the key payload of aviation fuel and pumps. Some of the supply helicopters were flown by women.
 
Convoy Across the Desert
 Traveling across the desert along an old track used for the annual Muslim pilgrimage, a convoy brought another 100,000 gallons of aviation fuel, some 30 tons of ammunition and other equipment, 30 more TOW antitank weapons, field hospitals and the 2,000 additional troops. Among the forces arriving were two more artillery batteries and members of the military police, many of whom are expected to be diverted to deal with Iraqi prisoners.
The operation owes much to two military colleges that keep alive a Southern military tradition, the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel in South Carolina. The convoy is code-named Citadel, after the college attended by its commander, Lieut. Col. Jim McGarity. The roadbed has been renamed Newmarket, after the Civil War battle fought by cadets from V.M.I., the alma mater of General Peay and Colonel Hill.
The area had been softened up for days by allied air strikes. Several of the division's helicopter pilots, including the aviation brigade commander, Col. Dick Cody, had landed in the dried lake bed to test the surface.
"I don't think a lot of people have bad words for the Air Force or aviation," said Sergeant Major Arrabondo, dismissing the traditional rivalry between the services.
 
Challenge of Elite Iraqi Units
 The major challenge facing the allied thrust is believed to be at least two divisions of elite Republican Guards stationed as a strategic reserve east and somewhat south of Basra. The divisions have been heavily pounded by allied bombers but are staying in well-fortified bunkers, United States officers say.
American commanders say they also have considerable respect for Iraqi artillery, particularly the South African-made 155-millimeter guns, which are said to be accurate beyond 18 miles.
Colonel Hill said that any Iraqi counterattack would involve bringing the troops and vehicles out of their hardened shelters into the open, where they could be attacked by overwhelming allied air power.
"That's the whole ground plan, get him out of those revetments," he said. "Every time we get him out of the revetments, we kill him."
 
Brigade Assembled Saturday
 The troops of the First Brigade began assembling for the attack at noon on Saturday. By dusk, some 118 helicopters were spread across 19 boarding zones in the Saudi desert north of the Tapline Road. Circling in long arcs among the helicopters were nearly 700 vehicles of the ground convoy, with bright orange recognition cloths on their roofs.
"It's an awesome sight," said Colonel Hill, surveying the helicopters under a darkening sky. "When I looked at it I thought, 'Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.' "

Chart: 'Kuwait Before the Invasion'
 
GOVERNMENT
Since the sheikdom of Kuwait was founded in 1756, it has been ruled, sometimes under British guardianship, by the Sabah family, who were chosen by its first Arab settlers.
 At the time of the invasion by Iraq on Aug. 2, the Emir of Kuwait was Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was both head of state and Prime Minister, leading a Cabinet with 10 appointed ministers and 4 elected ones.
 
HISTORY
Kuwait became part of Turkey's Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, later becoming a semi-autonomous monarchy. In 1899, fearing further Turkish control, Kuwait became a British protectorate.
 After World War I, the Ottoman Empire was broken up and Kuwait remained a self-governing British protectorate until 1961. On June 19 of that year, Britain granted Kuwait full independence and six days later Baghdad claimed Kuwait as an integral part of Iraq. British troops landed in Kuwait to forestall any Iraqi invasion and on July 20, the Arab League admitted the sheikdom to membership, recognizing its independence.
When the Iraq-Iran war ended, Iraq renewed its claims to Kuwait.
 
GEOGRAPHY
Bounded on the west and north by Iraq, on the east by the Persian Gulf, and to the south by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, with an area of 6,880 square miles (or about 1,000 square miles smaller than Massachusetts), is largely a desert except for some fertile patches in the southeastern and coastal areas.
 Among the most important of several offshore islands, many of which are uninhabited, are Bubiyan and Warba Islands, barren mudflats that control the entrance to Iraq's chief ports, Umm Qasr and Basra, and Failaka Island.
 
THE PEOPLE
The 862,200 Kuwaitis, according to a 1974 tabulation, are predominately Arab. Before the Iraqi invasion, more than a million foreign residents were the mainstay of government, technical and other services.
 Islam is the religion of 95 percent of the people. The majority are Sunnis and there is a significant Shiite minority.
 
ECONOMY
 Before the invasion, more than 90 percent of the Government's income came from oil. The country produced about 2.4 million barrels a day despite a production quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting States at 1.5 million barrels a day. This over-production was considered a significant factor in depressing world oil prices and infuriated Iraq.

Destitution in the 1930's (No, It's Not "The Grapes")

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
It is probably not necessary for the country to be in a recession for network television to program a movie like "Long Road Home," a sort of bowdlerized spinoff of "The Grapes of Wrath," but it can't hurt. Viewers always like to be reminded that things could be worse, although today's alien migrant workers might not entirely agree.
"Long Road Home," to be shown tonight on NBC at 9, follows the travails of the Robertson family through the San Joaquin Valley in 1937 as they look for work picking fruit, vegetables or cotton. The teleplay by Jane-Howard Hammerstein almost begs comparisons with the Joads of Steinbeck's classic. 
 The Robertsons are Texans, not Okies. Ertie Robertson (Mark Harmon) is an ex-rodeo rider, not a sharecropper, and there's not an ex-con among his five children. His wife, Bessie (Lee Purcell), wants a house so the family "can get back on its feet again." But as was true for the Joads, just about anything bad that can happen to the Robertsons does. Their car breaks down; the baby gets sick; there's union agitation in the fields; they are paid company scrip instead of real money, and everybody's hungry. Just when it looks as if things can't get any worse, it starts to rain. Before it's over, each of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse takes the family for a ride.
The Robertsons' poverty is established before the credits are finished rolling. When they stop to buy gas, they are down to their last $1.33. And when a farm foreman shortchanges them their day's wages, one son threatens to smack him with a two-by-four. "We don't have a two-by-four," his sister reminds him.
Yet as so often happens in prime time, nothing is quite as bad as it seems, even destitution. Soon afterward, the son turns up with a rifle, hunting rabbits, and Pa even has a pistol hidden away along with several boxes of cartridges. (The pistol becomes important to the plot later on.) A short time later, Ma is shopping in a grocery store with real money and picking up a real-estate tip on a little house for sale on a sort of layaway plan for $10 a month.
There is, of course, a lot of hardship and soul-searching and evil to overcome before the chicken coop of a house can be called home. There are bad forces at work against the Robertsons, and "Long Road Home" makes it easy to identify them. Basically, the poor people are good and the farm owners are bad. Most everybody else, from the local sheriff to the local congressman, is in the pocket of the local land baron. The union organizers sort of lurk in the background, waiting to help and tempting Jake, the eldest son (Morgan Weisser), but Pa is the sort who likes to take care of his own. There are the requisite subplots, including a budding love story, and some color on how the poor amuse themselves, including a hoedown by a bonfire.
A lot of effort has gone into what is clearly a well-intentioned and heartfelt project, and Mr. Harmon and Ms. Purcell do what they can. But there is just so much credibility one can give to lines like "There ain't no God in this valley, Ma," or "We're gonna get out of this vale of tears." And it's hard to believe in a poverty that manages to keep a perfect three days' growth of beard on a migrant laborer for several months and provides clean dresses, shampoo and bobby pins to women who spend their days in the field. In the end, "Long Road Home" is a fairy-tale view not only of the Great Depression, but of the labor movement it spawned and the way its victims survived. For those who prefer a more authentic vintage trampled out of the 1930's, PBS will telecast the Broadway production of Steppenwolf Theater's adaptation of "The Grapes of Wrath" on American Playhouse next month.

Sporting-Goods Makers Hawk Wares at Show

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE sporting-goods industry did its best last week to ignore the recession. The 85,000 sports aficionados who gathered here for the industry's largest annual trade exhibit -- the Super Show -- whet their appetites on a menu of new technology sauteed in marketing hype.
With more than 1.6 million square feet of floor space and 6,000 booths at four sites in the downtown area, mostly at the Georgia World Congress Center, manufacturers unveiled exercise machines that talk back, tennis racquets that sound heavy but feel light, shoes that spring off their heels, bicycles that jump curbs and clothes that breathe. 
 Swarms of buyers for stores perused the show in search of items that would sell in a flat retail market. Although the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, which stages the show, projected a 6 percent growth in the industry's wholesale volume, from $30.8 billion in 1990 to $32.7 billion in 1991, the number fell short of the double-digit expansion the industry had come to expect.
But insiders were buoyed by the recession-resistant nature of the industry. "Sports have become a solid part of the modern-life style, and, therefore, sporting-goods sales are less negatively affected in recessionary times," said John D. Riddle, association president.
 
An Overview
 Lured by dazzling product displays, visitors to the show faced a marketing barrage. From Joe Montana to Greg Norman, sports celebritries appeared as if they were hors d'oeuvres in a dinner of corporate steaks.
Nike, the athletic-footwear manufacturer, spent $4 million on its booth. The 61,000-square-foot area featured Nike's newest shoes under robotic lights on center stage. Reebok, dominated a $1 million space not far down the concourse where aerobic dance skits, loud rock music and intermittent celebrity autograph signings set a frenetic pace.
Lower-profile exhibitors staffed booths strung out with wares like an exotic marketplace. Despite the enticements, most dealers seemed cautious.
"We're going to watch our spending," said Brad Henry, a buyer for Valley Sports of Fresno, Calif. "We're not going to tie up our dollars far in advance."
The mood translated into a search for trends: something, anything to make the public buy, buy, buy. Here are a few trends to watch for in your sport and equipment of choice.
 
Tennis
Widebody racquets are still the industry favorites. But the new watchwords of the 46 racquet manufacturers at the show are "lighter" and "more flexible." First introduced by Wilson Sporting Goods in 1987, the widebody racquet was made to be stiff and powerful. Today's versions are designed to put feel back in the racquet and dampen shock. Racquets are lighter than ever: the 10-ounce barrier has been broken.
"They are taking the fat out," said Tracy Leonard, equipment adviser for Tennis magazine.
And finding ingenious ways to do it, too. Head's Genesis racquet, for instance, is thinner in the cross sections. The Hammer, Wilson's newest high-end widebody, has taken about two ounces out of the handle, but kept the same weight in the head.
Prince introduced the Vortex widebody racquet at the show, its light weight achieved with materials adopted from the aerospace industry: viscoelastic polymer, a thermoplastic material, and continuous strands of carbon fiber. The strings are staggered along the frame, an innovation designed to absorb more impact from the ball.
Dunlop attacked the widebody's shock-absorption problem in a different way. With its new Revelation racquet, introduced last month and on display at the show, the company added vibration-dampening rods to the handle.
High-end racquets are closing in on $300. But the new technology is filtering down to mid-priced racquets, too.
 
Footwear
 The leading footwear manufacturers set the tone of the show with fancy video displays and Hollywood floor shows. But even more impressive was their sheer numbers: more than 160 exhibitors of everything from basketball shoes to sandals were on hand.
Other than L.A. Gear, which has produced the Catapult, a basketball shoe with a heel spring, most innovations are directed at weight savings.
"The challenge is in finding a balance between light, and making a shoe with cushioning, stability and support," said Bill Dragon, president of Avia.
New materials, like thermoplastics, carbon fiber and foams, are replacing standard materials. Nike has taken the heel counter out of its new Haurache running shoe and replaced it with a molded rubber heel strap.
And making it clear that they intend to follow their customers from the basketball and tennis courts to the trails of the backwoods, the leading manufacturers showed new lines of shoes and clothing for hiking, camping and mountain biking.
"People who were exposed to running in the 1980's while they were single are looking for activities they can do with their families in the 1990's," said Tom Clarke, director of marketing for Nike.
 
Fitness
Weight machines, popular in the 1970's, are making a comeback for the home, said Richard Miller, a buyer for The Gym Source, a New York City equipment distributor. "Home use is the future," Miller said.
Companies like Pacific Fitness are making compact home-gym units that allow for 100 different exercises at a price of $1,600 to $2,400.
CSA Inc., a fitness-products manufacturer from South Easton, Mass., introduced 23 new exercise machines at the show, including several versions of computerized talking machines that it began marketing last year. The units are designed to verbally coach users, and to store previous workouts so they can be recalled for comparison to a new routine.
Bike machines still appear to be more popular than treadmills and stairsteppers.
Traditional companies are diversifying. Life Fitness, the company that spearheaded the stationary-bike movement, has designed a new stair machine this year, Lifestep 5500, available this summer for $1,295.
 
Bicycling
Although bicycling is a fast-growing sport with a propensity for dramatic innovation, only 19 bicycle manufacturers showed up in Atlanta. A recent study by Bicycling magazine counted 32 million cyclists in the United States. In recognition of this popularity, the Super Show opened its doors for a cycle show for the first time. Although few of the leading manufacturers attended, signs of trends surfaced, most noticeably in the cross bike.
As a hybrid of road and mountain bikes, the cross bike has thinner tires than a mountain bike. It has a more central shifting system, and a sloping top tube. "People are finding that the mountain bike is too much bike," said Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling. "The cross bike is a bike that people can ride for commuting or in-town use."
 
Apparel
Neon is out and deeper, richer tones and earth colors are in, reflecting a pervasive embrace of the outdoors. Moreover, companies like Du Pont, Hind and Nike, who make their own fabrics, are finding that function is blurring with fashion.
"This crossover isn't necessarily a permanent thing because of the fickleness of ready-to-wear," said Jennifer Lisle, fabrics editor at Sport Style, a biweekly sports publication.
Function, however, still dominates. Lynn Hill, the top United States women's rock climber, and Katarina Witt, the German Olympic skater, attended the Super Show on behalf of Du Pont and Hind. Hill scaled artificial walls to demonstrate how athletic tights "allow you to move with your sport."

HEADLINE: Let's Do Something About Deposit Insurance;
End Glass-Steagall

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leonard Silk's Feb. 8 Economic Scene column ("The Argument Over the Banks") cites Albert G. Hart as an expert on why the Administration's proposals to restructure the banking system will not work. One expert's opinion deserves another.
Professor Hart cites every questionable banking practice employed during the 1980's as evidence that the restructuring of the system will fail. This may be an important, but nevertheless not relevant part of the picture. Indeed, many of the questionable practices, as for instance the cited Continental Illinois case of dealing in oil paper, were direct results of the restrictiveness of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that keeps commercial banks from investment banking and selling insurance. 
 Deregulated banks wanted to escape the limitations of the one-branch or at best statewide system by accepting paper from other, often smaller, banks that were not properly evaluated. One can now debate whether industry ownership of banks is desirable, but it should be clear that our banking system suffers from its inability to branch across state lines. The Glass-Steagall Act denies banks the chance to tap national markets, increase their deposit base and enhance their capital, as recently pointed out by Walter Wriston.
A national branch banking system with about eight national banks, and about a dozen regional banks would tap a vastly larger deposit base, diversify product markets, be much easier to regulate by a single authority, preferably the Federal Reserve Board, and would make a multitude of clearing houses and other financial and regulatory crutches unnecessary, with a resultant increase of overall efficiency and security.
The cited disadvantages pertain to effective regulation -- why should it be possible for other nations to have well-capitalized branch banks that serve their economies? Our banking system also reflects this country's longstanding unfavorable international payments position, but that is another argument for speedy bank restructuring and abolition of the Glass-Steagall Act.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Dona Nobis Pacem

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
If the official accounts are believ able and they are -- the ground war has begun easily and well for the allies. We can hope for a quick military victory.
Even Americans with doubts about this war may take satisfaction in the defeat of Saddam Hussein. The cause of undoing his aggression was always just. The war has only confirmed his brutality and megalomanic misjudgment. 
 But the doubts remain, unstilled by feats of arms. Will the Middle East be a more secure, politically enlightened region after this war? Will the world be more orderly? Will the war have a healthy influence on the United States? I can have no confidence in affirmative answers to those questions.
In the Middle East one need look at only the immediate foreground to see daunting problems. In Iraq, which had a modern economy, the basics of water and power and communications have been shattered. It is fantasy to think that a nice reasonable government will quickly take over, put things back together and make Iraq a good neighbor.
Then there is Kuwait. The devastation done by Iraqi occupiers has been multiplied by allied bombing. And the political prospect is embarrassing. Our pledge is to restore the legitimate Government. But will Americans or others be satisfied for long to have the al-Sabah family govern without the consent of the governed?
In the Persian Gulf as a whole there is the prickly question of American troops. For the Saudis and others it will be politically desirable, indeed urgent, to have them leave. But what security arrangement is going to take their place? Getting them out may prove trickier than bringing them in.
Or think about the problem that is such a major factor in the whole region's instability, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For a time I thought the responsibilities shouldered by the United States in the war would help it to be a peacemaker afterward. But there are reasons now to fear that the war will have made it even harder to solve the conflict.
The P.L.O. attached itself to Saddam Hussein, who cynically professed the Palestinian cause (and as cynically dropped it in the final diplomatic maneuvers). That attachment will make it even more difficult for Israel or the United States to work with the mainstream pro-P.L.O. leadership in the occupied territories.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, for his part, moved his Government even farther to the right under cover of the war. He took in a party favoring expulsion of all Palestinians from the occupied territories.
Whatever one thinks of President Bush's policy toward Iraq, he has been consistent and decisive in carrying it out. He began the air war the day after the United Nations deadline for Iraqi withdrawal. He began the ground war the evening after Iraq failed to meet his ultimatum.
But will he be as consistent in peace? Will he rouse the world as vigorously against every aggression and inhumanity? Will he forswear future lawless invasions himself?
Of course there can be no perfect consistency in the world we have. But some principle must animate Mr. Bush's vision of "a new world order."
Wars usually create more problems than they solve. I suspect that we shall look back at this one with more regrets than we can imagine today, in the flush of enthusiasm for victory.
One result, if it comes, would be a special disaster. That is the encouragement, in Americans, of the delusory belief that military power can solve the world's problems -- and that the United States can impose unilateral solutions.
Such an attitude would nourish the American military-industrial complex. It would lead us deeper into the mistake of neglecting civilian for military research and development. We are proud of our high-tech weapons. But while they were being developed, Robert Kuttner, the economic writer, points out, the American share of consumer-electronics production in the world fell from 70 percent to 5 percent.
It is at home that American ideas and energy need to be committed. We need to think more about education and economics and health, and military euphoria may make us short-change those real needs again.
The evening before the ground war began I was at a wonderful performance by Banchetto Musicale, the Boston early-music group, of Haydn's "Mass in Time of War." Haydn wrote it during Napoleon's wars, fearful of his aggression. Extraordinarily, the final "Dona nobis pacem" ("Grant us peace") is set with military drum and trumpets. But the hope is for peace.

HEADLINE: Burmese Oil Has Attracted Exploration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Sudden Revival for East Asian Oil" (Business Day, Feb. 4) is generally thorough, but has inaccurate information on Myanmar, formerly Burma, which ignores a potentially important development in the oil industry in that country, which was an oil exporter in colonial times.
In the fall of 1988, after the Sept. 18 military coup, the Government for the first time since Burmese independence in 1948 allowed foreign companies to bid on contracts for onshore oil exploration. Prospects had seemed bright, but the Burmese did not have internal capacity and had excluded foreign participation. Earlier offshore exploration produced disappointing results.
This onshore investment opportunity was a major change in Burmese economic policy, signaling a shift toward some economic liberalization and indicating indirectly the financial straits of the military regime, which insisted on substantial down payments.
The first contract was given to a Korean company (Yukong), and it was followed by nine more contracts to companies from the United States, Britain, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia.
Economic liberalization and foreign investment in Myanmar is tempered by political concerns, including an unresolved political crisis and continuing ethnic rebellions. But even the relatively modest openings have attracted much shorter-term trading and dubious natural resource exploitation. Oil exploration, however, is the essential longer-term foreign commitment.

HEADLINE: Mexican Debt Deal May Save Jungle

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 25

 BODY:
In one of the largest private "debt for nature" exchanges yet negotiated, Mexico has accepted an agreement that would reduce its foreign debt by $4 million in return for specific Government commitments to help preserve the country's tropical rain forests and other fast-disappearing natural resources.
The agreement, negotiated by a private American ecological group, Conservation International, is the first such agreement reached by Mexico, which has some of the rarest plant and animal life, and one of the largest debt burdens, in the world. It represents a major step forward in efforts to use foreign debt reduction as a tool for persuading third world governments to preserve wilderness areas. 
 Alhough the amount of money involved is not large by the standards of third world debt, the accord is seen by ecologists as an important endorsement of a financial mechanism that they hope will eventually be adopted for similar, much larger deals on a government-to-government level.
"Mexico is an absolutely critical country in which to have achieved this, because it occupies such an important place globally in terms of its biological richness," said Martin Goebel, director of Conservation International's programs in Mexico. "Many people know Mexico as a 'mega-debtor,' but too few realize that it is a 'megadiversity' country as well, with more plant and animal species than all but three other nations."
 
Rain Forest Is Focus
 Under the terms of the arrangement, completed last week, Conservation International is authorized to buy from Mexico's international creditors a total of $4 million in Mexican I.O.U's at discounted prices. The debt, which has been discounted on secondary markets and in restructuring agreements because of the difficulty in collecting it, is expected to cost the private group about 45 cents on the dollar, or $1.8 million, Mr. Goebel said.
Conservation International will then forgive the full amount of the debt in return for Mexican Government commitments to spend $2.6 million worth of Mexican pesos on a broad set of environmental projects set out as part of the agreement. Under the agreement, that money must be spent before the end of 1994, when the single, six-year term of Mexico's President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, expires.
The primary focus of the conservation efforts contemplated in the agreement will be preservation of the Lacandona rain forest, the largest remaining tropical rain forest in North America. Fifty years ago, the lush, mist-shrouded Lacandona jungle covered more than 5,000 square miles, roughly the size of Connecticut, in southern Mexico on the Guatemalan border. But illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture has cut it to less than half that size.
Money provided under the new agreement will finance conservation data centers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in the capital and in the state of Chiapas, where the rain forest stands. It will also support a science field station in the 1,278-square-mile Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, a protected area in the Lacandona rain forest established by the Mexican Government more than a decade ago in an effort to save the most precious part of the jungle.
 
Of Keen Ecological Concern
 Although the agreement is the first of its kind for Mexico, Government officials and private conservationists pointed out that there are few countries where the potential of such a debt-for-nature exchange is as great.
With an outstanding foreign obligations of roughly $80 billion, Mexico is the second-largest debtor in the third world, after Brazil, and is a prime target for any program that can help ease its debt burden. As important, scientists estimate that as many as 16 percent of the plant and animal species in Mexico are found nowhere else in the world. In some areas of the country like Baja California as many as 80 percent of local species fall into that category.
The sheer number of species found within Mexico's borders also makes it a subject of keen ecological concern. Government officials say the Lacandona jungle alone is home to some 3,000 species of plants and flowers, 306 species of birds, 84 species of reptiles and 700 species of butterflies.
The Mexican debt-for-nature swap, which has been under negotiation since October 1989, is the fourth such agreement concluded by the Conservation International, a nonprofit group that is based in Washington and has offices in 16 countries. Other exchanges arranged by the organization, which is supported by funds from private philanthropies such as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Sequoia Foundation, have included a 1987 debt swap in Bolivia and a 1990 agreement with Madagascar.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Fell by 10.5% in Mid-February

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks made in the United States continued to fall in mid-February, although the declines were not as steep as those of the last two months.
The 10 leading manufacturers reported combined light-vehicle sales of 260,944 between Feb. 11 and Feb. 20, compared with a weak period last year, when 259,027 vehicles were sold. On the basis of sales per day, sales fell 10.5 percent in mid-February from a year earlier. There were nine selling days in the period this year, and eight days last year.
 
Sharp Production Cuts
 Some car dealers said buyers had begun to return to showrooms in the last two weeks, and suggested that the industry had already begun to rebound from its deep slump. 
 But the auto makers see the sales drought lasting well into the spring, judging by their sharply curtailed production schedules for the next three months.
The companies said they sold 169,707 cars in mid-February, down 8.7 percent from the period a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at a 6 million annual rate, slightly ahead of the 5.9 million pace for the last 30 days. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for mid-February a year ago was 6.3 million cars.
Sales of light trucks, which include pickups, mini-vans, and four-wheel-drive vehicles, and which account for about a third of all vehicles sold, dropped 13.2 percent, to 91,670.
 
Big 3 Lose the Most
 The Big Three domestic auto makers posted the largest sales declines, as their combined car and light-truck sales fell 11.6 percent. Japanese companies with car plants in the United States reported flat sales of American-made cars, despite expanded production at several plants in the last year.
The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company also reported their sales of imported vehicles, which fell 7.7 percent for the two auto makers in mid-February.
While most leading manufacturers posted declines, auto dealers and industry analysts said they sensed that demand was strengthening.
"The economic signposts that have led car sales in the past are strongly positive," said David Healy, an automotive analyst in New York with Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "Interest rates have dropped sharply, gasoline prices are plummeting, and it looks like good news coming from the Persian Gulf. The ingredients are there for a turnaround."
"We're on the rebound now," said Frank Debartolo, general sales manager at Celozzi-Ettelson Chevrolet in Elmhurst, Ill. Although Mr. Debartolo said that he was "full to the gills" with unsold vehicles, he predicted that dealers could run short by summer because of the plant shutdowns.
Other dealers are braced for more difficult times.
"Things are not all that rosy," said Jim Hoffer, sales manager at Jordan Ford in South Bend, Ind. Mr. Hoffer said sales were down 15 to 20 percent from a year ago. "I still think we have a tough 12 months ahead of us. The only thing that has remained steady are sales of used cars."
After a disastrous drop in January, the Ford Motor Company posted car sales of 50,799, off 3.8 percent from the period last year. Ford's light-truck sales declined 13.9 percent, to 31,458 vehicles.
 
Role of Rebates
 Analysts speculated that Ford dealers had begun to pass along larger rebates to customers after the poor January showing. In a big shift in December, Ford stopped offering cash rebates directly to customers, offering discounts instead to dealers, who can choose whether to give cash to buyers or to use the price break in other ways to stimulate sales.
Honda also reported a smaller decline than most auto makers, with sales of its domestically produced cars down 1.4 percent, to 9,838. In an unusual move, Honda is offering $300 dealer incentives on its Accord and Acura Integra models.
"It's taken a while for the typical Honda dealer to learn how to deal, because they have never had to sell aggressively," said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York.
The General Motors Corporation sold 72,889 domestically produced cars, down 13.9 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 19.4 percent, to 34,738 vehicles.
The Chrysler Corporation no longer reports its sales every 10 days, but Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, estimated that the No. 3 auto maker sold 20,500 cars, a decline of 10.8 percent, and 21,250 light trucks, a drop of 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL VIOLENCE KILLS 5 IN ALBANIA

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Another Albanian was killed Sunday night, bringing to five the number of deaths in political strife this weekend, as orthodox Communist forces, aided in some cases by the military, sought to reassert authority in various parts of the country.
The victim in the latest shooting was a 20-year-old man killed in Tirana by an army rifleman, said Dr. Sali Berisha, a leader of the two-month-old Democratic Party. As recently as last summer, such incidents went unreported in Albania, where Communist censorship was strict. 
 In a telephone interview, Dr. Berisha said a patrol stopped the young man, Artan Lenja, on the street near his home about 7:30 p.m. and demanded his identity papers. When Mr. Lenja failed to produce them, an officer ordered that he be shot. A second young man was shot and wounded in the same street, Dr. Berisha said. About 1,000 Tirana residents reportedly attended a memorial service for Mr. Lenja today.
On Friday, three civilians and a policemen were killed during exchanges of gunfire at a large military school northeast of the capital. Later, generals and other officers issued a statement demanding restoration of monuments to the late Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, that had been toppled by demonstrators calling for democratic change.
 
Straining Against Tradition
 Political life in the small Balkan country has become increasingly polarized between advocates of democracy and Communists professing loyalty to the legacy of Mr. Hoxha, who ruled Albania in the Stalinist fashion for 41 years until his death in 1985. The split has deepened since the shootings, and it also appears that public order has broken down in many places. "The situation is very dangerous, in my opinion," said Dr. Berisha.
President Ramiz Alia himself appears to be torn between defending Mr. Hoxha, who chose him as his successor, and placating the growing number of Albanians who seek a radical break with the despotic past Mr. Hoxha embodied. In a television address, President Alia appealed for peace between the factions, but said Hoxha "remains in our hearts" and that his role in history would be reassessed later.
Gramoz Pashko, another opposition leader in the Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview that the ruling Communist Party of about 120,000 members is now split into orthodox and reformist factions, with the latter supporting President Alia. "His party is divided now," he said. "Alia is playing a very dangerous game."
 
Ex-Officials Defy President
 Last week, in response to widespread rioting, Mr. Alia capped a series of changes he had begun 10 months ago by dismissing the Government of Prime Minister Adil Carcani.
But over the weekend, Mr. Carcani and other former senior Communist officials joined the anti-Alia camp, Mr. Pashko said. Mr. Carcani sent a telegram encouraging Communists in Gjirokaster, the birthplace of Hoxha, to restore a bust of the dictator that had been dismantled.
Dr. Berisha said "Enverists," as he described the orthodox Communists, had formed posses that had menaced members of his Democratic Party in a number of Albanian towns and cities, including Saranda, Gjirokaster, Fier and Korca.
"They beat up the vice chairman of our party in Saranda," a coastal city, on Sunday, he said. "They threaten to hang us, to hang me, and to outlaw our party." Dozens of opposition leaders have been arrested in outlying towns and in Tirana, he said.
Dr. Berisha, a cardiologist, and Mr. Pashko, a university economist, both said orthodox Communists were calling for the removal of the Albanian capital from Tirana to Vlora, the port city on the Adriatic that served as the country's first capital in 1912.

Slight Rise in Price of Oil Surprises Many Analysts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices showed surprising strength yesterday, bouncing back from their low point of the Persian Gulf crisis to finish up slightly for the day as traders digested news from the ground war.
Crude oil for delivery in April settled at $17.94 a barrel, up 3 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Oil opened lower amid perceptions that the ground war was going well for the forces allied against Iraq. In early trading here, the price of oil hit $17.45, its cheapest yet during the gulf crisis. But crude began moving higher around midday.
"Early on, you made lows because people were looking at the fact the ground war was doing well," said Randall Rothenberg, an oil broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Then they bought it back up a bit on the feeling there might be some Iraqi resistance."
The lack of direction reflected a "total mixed bag of opinions" among traders, Mr. Rothenberg said
The rally was modest, but it caught many traders off guard, because world oil supplies are plentiful and the allies' battlefield success has largely erased fears about any threats to oilfields and refineries in Saudi Arabia.
"Everything I'm looking at points lower," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "I'm surprised at this reaction, I must confess. It seems to be doing it on its own. There's no reason for it."
Others said that the declines last week had taken oil prices about as far down as they were going to go and that many futures traders have already factored a successful ground war into their trading strategies.
Philip L. Dodge, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company, said reports that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells were burning might have strengthened the market slightly yesterday, although the world oil market has long since shown it can do without Kuwaiti oil.
Refined petroleum products showed some strength for the day on the futures market.
Heating oil for delivery in March settled at 61.95 cents a gallon, up 1.81 cents, at the Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline for delivery in March settled at 60.65 cents a gallon, up 1.32 cents.
Natural gas for delivery in April closed at $1.351, up six-tenths of 1 cent for 1,000 cubic feet.
In London, North Sea Brent blend crude settled at $16.95 a barrel, up 33 cents, at the International Petroleum Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on War News; Gold Prices Up in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained on world markets yesterday as the United States-led forces drove deeper into enemy territory, renewing hopes for a swift end to the war in the Persian Gulf.
Gold rose in New York, with the contract for February delivery settling at $359.50 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up $2.50 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $359 a troy ounce, up $2.25 from late Friday. 
 Amid reports of light Iraqi resistance to the allied attack, traders expressed relief about the potential drain of the war on the United States budget and American consumer spending.
"The market apparently is now of the belief that a quick resolution to the gulf situation will be beneficial to the U.S. economy." said Robert Hatcher, corporate dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C.
Military officials said American units were smashing scores of tanks, taking thousands more prisoners and having "tremendous success" in their first battle with Iraq's elite Republican Guard.
The dollar's upward move marked a change from the previous session's reaction to war news. Late last week, the dollar firmed on peace hopes, helped by the belief that the start of a ground war would delay the final outcome of the conflict.
This week, however, the apparent early success of the allied force's drive into Kuwait and Iraq fed hopes for a quicker-than-expected end to the conflict.
Appearing on CBS, Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the conflict could be over in three or four days. President Bush cautioned, however, that "there are battles yet to come and casualties to be borne."
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.28 yen, to a closing 132.13 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 132.80 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 133.55 yen, up from late Friday's 132.15 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9235, from $1.9440 late Friday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.9265, less than late Friday's $1.9445.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York to 1.5200 marks, from 1.5055 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.3020 Swiss francs, up from 1.2925; 5.1665 French francs, up from 5.1225; 1,136 Italian lire, up from 1,127.50, and 1.1526 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1524.

HEADLINE: Fed Official's Bank View

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, said today that he expected the economy to swing out of recession, helping the troubled banking industry, by this summer if the Persian Gulf war ends soon.
"We do expect the economy to return to positive real growth by the third quarter, assuming a prompt end of the gulf war and no serious impairment of oil supplies," Mr. LaWare said in a speech to the Institute of International Bankers. 
 He cautioned that it would take time to absorb the excess capacity in commercial real estate markets and to rebuild demand for residential real estate. But, he said, the worst may be over for banks that have suffered huge losses because of troubled real estate loans.
Profits of the nation's banks have been hard hit by the real estate slump, which has left them with a growing number of bad loans on their books.
Mr. LaWare's remarks on the economy were in line with projections made in the Fed's semiannual report to Congress released last week.
The report said the Fed board members and presidents of the reserve banks expect the recession to end later this year and growth in the gross national product to average three-quarters of 1 percent to 1.5 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Fur Industry Shrinking With No End in Sight

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 25

 BODY:
These are bitter times for those involved in trapping, dressing, making and selling furs. In a harshly symbolic blow to the industry, the Hudson's Bay Company of Canada announced recently that it was closing the last fur salons in its Bay department stores.
The company, which was synonymous with fur for centuries after it was founded in 1670 to pursue the trade under a royal charter, had been confronted by the relentless campaigning of animal rights advocates and plunging demand that began with the 1987 stock market crash. 
 The decision was a clear signal that even this country has been unable to fend off the sharp pressures that have cut deeply into the fur business elsewhere, including the United States and Western Europe.
The announcement followed the bankruptcy in early January of Northbay Fur Sales, the auction house of the Ontario Trappers' Association, which for 40 years had kicked off an annual round of fur auctions that stretched from New York to Copenhagen to Leningrad, with half a dozen stops in between.
In Montreal, center of a Canadian fur industry that surpassed Manhattan in the early 1980's as the leading fur center in North America, hundreds of jobs have been lost. By some estimates, as many as 20,000 Canadian trappers have quit the business, and many of the 85,000 who remain are barely covering costs.
"It's certainly not the business it used to be a decade ago," said Barry Agnew, a Hudson's Bay vice president. He and other company executives were unsentimental about cutting their link to the past. They said salons that offered finished mink and fox garments, along with beaver, raccoon and other furs, had become only marginally important to profitability, and the decision was made to clear the space for other wares. The company, which operates four department store chains across Canada with more than 480 stores, sold its fur auction houses in 1987.
Now, with a Canadian recession biting more deeply than the economic downturn in the United States, the industry is confronting a gloomier future. David Sebben, a spokesman for the Fur Trade Association of Canada, predicts that 1.5 million wild animals will be trapped or shot this year, representing a 50 percent decrease from 1987. The number of pelts to be sold from the ranches that account for 90 percent of mink and fox furs, the top end of the market, will decline similarly, he said.
Over all, by Mr. Sebben's estimate, the Canadian industry shrank between 1987 and 1990 to $800 million (Canadian), or about $695 million (United States), down 30 percent. And pelt prices set at auctions so far this year suggest that the downward trend may steepen.
At an auction earlier this month in New York, mink pelts averaged $23, down from $35 in 1987. Declines for some other furs have been sharper still. To sell coats from overburdened racks, some furriers have cut retail prices by as much as 60 percent from 1987 highs.
 
Optimism, for the Record
 For the record, industry spokesmen remain optimistic, saying fur has gone through boom-and-bust cycles before. But some executives acknowledge privately that once-profitable markets in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands may not recover from the onslaught of the animal rights advocates. In December, for instance, Harrods, the landmark London department store, closed its fur salon and shipped many unsold furs to Canada for auction.
Japan is one of the few bright spots, with sales that reached $1.7 billion last year, only slightly behind the United States, the world's largest market, with sales of $1.8 billion.
But Canadian animal rights advocates say they are not about to let up the pressure, and predict harder times still for the industry.
"I think the downslide is just going to continue and continue," said Christina Fox, spokesman for the Canadian Anti-Fur Alliance. "It's not going to happen in a couple of years, but people are just becoming more and more aware that you don't have to wear a dead animal for decoration."
The anti-fur alliance is part of a worldwide network of groups that has brought pressure on the fur industry. In Canada, these efforts halted the killing of whitecoat seal pups off the Labrador coast nearly a decade ago, and they have become increasingly sharp-edged. "Get the feel of fur -- slam your hand in a car door," one poster declared.
The Canadian industry is fighting the animal rights advocates and contends that it can prevail. It has begun an advertising campaign of its own, built around images of fur and fur-trapping as part of the natural cycle. A Canadian Government grant of $4.3 million is being spent, in part, to develop what Mr. Sebben called "humane traps," some with rubber guards. The aim is to insure that animals held alive in traps suffer as little as possible, and that traps designed to kill do so instantly.
Fur companies long for a return to the mid-1980's, a time when the fur industry in Canada boomed. There were soaring exports of raw and semi-finished pelts and still faster growth in the sales of finished furs, as a generation of Canadian designers shed the stodgy image of the past.
On the strength of a tripling of business in the previous decade, companies that had been the mainstays of the industry expanded, and new ones sprang up in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Toronto, and Montreal. The stock market collapse of 1987 caught trappers, ranchers and manufacturers on an expanding curve. And as fur sales dropped precipitously, anti-fur advocates stepped up their campaign.
By Mr. Sebben's account, the industry took heart last year from "focus groups" of potential buyers who were gathered in cities across Canada and the United States. Among the conclusions taken from these gatherings, the Canadian fur industry spokesman said, was that fur coats continue to convey "an image of warmth and accomplishment" among consumers and that the activities of some animal rights campaigners have prompted a backlash.
 
Replacing the Mirrors
 Still, radical moves have been necessary to stave off further bankruptcies. Four times since November, Canadian manufacturers have offered coats at knock-down prices at retail "auctions" in Toronto. In place of the mirrored salons that bolstered the industry's luxury image in the past, the auctions have been staged in a drafty exhibition hall on the Toronto waterfront, with women in jeans and sneakers taking their pick of coats fashioned from pelts of mink, fox, beaver, marten, raccoon, lynx and muskrat.
The auctions have sold more than 6,000 coats, albeit at prices that have made many manufacturers wince. But for sellers seeking hope amid the gloom, the enthusiasm of many buyers was encouraging.
"It's my very first coat; I can't wait to get it on," said Beryl Browne, a 38-year-old nurse, as she waited for the paperwork to be completed on a $2,070 raccoon and fox coat. The Canadian, born in Antigua, paused, and acknowledged that the threats of animal rights extremists had worried her.
"People say, 'You wear something like that, somebody will throw paint on you,' " she said. "That does trouble me. Oh, well, I'll just wear it for special occasions, not for everyday."

HEADLINE: California Painfully Faces Grim Truths of Drought

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANDON, Calif., Feb. 20

 BODY:
After five years of drought, the hills here are bleached tawny, the stream beds are dry and ground squirrels forage where cattle can no longer graze.
This apocalyptic landscape, in the Coastal Range between San Luis Obispo and Kettleman City, is a stark reminder that California, so vast and magnificent, is a civilization built on precarious assumptions, a semiarid land where water is destiny. 
 There has been precious little precipitation here since 1986, but until this winter most Californians acted as if it would rain or snow any minute, next month, maybe; next year, for sure.
 
'We're Living in a Desert'
 But in recent weeks, after January brought flawlessly clear skies, a desperation has taken hold. Citizens and government officials alike are suddenly grappling with what it means to live in such an inhospitable place, and each day brings news of sharp limits on water use in another city or town.
"People forget we're living in a desert and every once in a while nature is going to reclaim its own," said Paul Graham, an accountant in Firebaugh, in the San Joaquin Valley. His clients include farmers forced to let 75 percent of their land lie fallow for lack of water.
This is the driest time the state has known since the drought of the early 1930's, and the situation is considered much graver now because the population, then about 6 million, is now 30 million, with 65,000 new Californians each month.
The state has not imposed uniform restrictions, leaving it to the thousands of water districts to allocate supplies locally. That many people in that many locales fighting for a dwindling supply means civil war here: north against south, cities versus farm towns, industry against the environment.
 
Scorn for Pools and Rice
 On an 800-mile zigzag journey this week from Riverside County in the south to the Sacramento River Delta in the north, there was some talk of conservation, of bricks in the toilet tank, shorter showers, drought-tolerant landscaping and less thirsty crops. But for the most part, people seemed more interested in defending their own water needs and chastizing others for profligacy, with particular scorn for suburbanites with turquoise pools and rice farmers who grow their monsoon crop with subsidized water.
In Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, one of the fastest growing cities in California, developers complained about a moratorium on water connections to new houses that had halted construction. In Santa Barbara, gardeners said they had painted parched lawns green and defied "drought police" to water flowers.
In San Luis Obispo, farther up the coast, the leading innkeeper switched from city water to his own well to save a quarter of a million dollars a year and ranchers pay rising prices for alfalfa to feed the hungry cattle that can no longer graze.
In Firebaugh, where farmland is watered by a labyrinth of aqueducts and canals, water curbs have forced land out of cultivation and rippled through the economy. In Rio Vista, a Sacramento River Delta hamlet of boat yards and bait shops, fishermen lamented the risk to fish and wildlife when rivers run low and more fresh water is diverted for irrigation.
And all along the way there was talk of hardship and change, of a struggle that could alter the face of the nation's most-populous state. "I always said water would be more important than oil eventually," said Alex Madonna, a rancher and innkeeper in San Luis Obispo. "Well, now it is."
 
New Homes Without Water
 On Interstate 15, heading south to Lake Elsinore, billboard after billboard trumpets new developments with idyllic names: Wildrose Ranch, "a planned community at home with nature," Vintage Hills, a "fresh new neighborhood," Jasmine Ridge, Tuscany Hills.
But for 60 days, at least, that hectic sort of building must stop because of a moratorium on new water connections, including those already paid for. At the Tuscany Hills development, for example, where six developers have plans for 2,000 Spanish-style houses, 500 are ready for occupancy, but must sit empty unless the moratorium is lifted.
"This is doom," said Tony C., a superintendent at the site who refused to allow his full name to be used for fear of offending the local water district, jinxing an appeal for a reprieve and losing his position with the developer.
The burly superintendent, his face ruddy from the year-round sunshine, called the moratorium "an attention grabber." Sure, the drought is real, he said, "but it didn't just happen last month and it seems like everything is slamming us in the face at once."
Like many people across the state, he has plenty of ideas for other solutions, like desalting sea water and seeding the clouds. "What about water from the flood plains in Texas?" he asked. "Why can't they pipe that in? They pipe oil from Alaska."
 
Surreptitious Flower Watering
 Patricia Chidlaw wrinkled her brow and studied the instructions on a box of Miracle-Gro plant food. Using the fertilizer, she calculated, would mean an extra gallon of water every two weeks on each of her 35 rose bushes.
"I don't know what to do," Ms. Chidlaw said while shopping late one afternoon at the La Sumida Nursery in Santa Barbara. "I don't know what's responsible behavior."
Ms. Chidlaw's roses won out over her conscience.
She has let nature take its course with the backyard avocado, citrus and apple trees, and her lawn has become threadbare since watering was outlawed in the seaside city last summer. A drip system, which is legal, waters the roses, her pride and joy, but Ms. Chidlaw, a landscape painter, admitted that "sometimes I sneak the hose out" because "seeing things grow enhances the quality of life."
Some cheating is also going on at the home of Joyce Ashley, a psychiatrist, and her husband, Dennis, an internist. The Ashleys waited three months to water after the ban, she said, but lost one hedge and found it too messy to drag buckets of used household water to the garden. "I haven't turned the sprinklers on," Joyce Ashley said, "but I have used a hose."
The lawn, meanwhile, looked so "brown and ugly" by Thanksgiving that the Ashleys hired a painter, one of the many who have been doing a land-office business here. It took some persuading to get him to add more yellow to his standard blue-green pigment so it better matched California Bermuda grass, but the Ashleys were finally satisfied with the $200 job.
"It keeps you from being so depressed when you look out the window," she said.
 
Innkeeper Taps His Own Well
 The Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo is hard to miss, a castle of kitsch on the Central Coast, where each room has a theme, honeymooners are identified by pink balloons at their dining room table and the men's room has a urinal built in the form of a waterfall.
It is a sprawling, gabled place, with 109 rooms and huge water bills -- $27,000 a month, said Alex Madonna, the owner.
That will change soon, since the inn just switched from city water to its own well, which had previously been used to supply water to Mr. Madonna's adjoining ranch. Water will now cost $2,000 a month to run the electric pumps, Mr. Madonna said.
Mr. Madonna's other big expense lately is alfalfa, which he is feeding his cattle in San Luis Obispo and on land he owns in the San Joaquin Valley. "There's no grazing," he said. "I've bought a million dollars worth of hay already this year."
Alfalfa, sold as hay for cattle, is one of California's thirstiest crops. It requires more water each year than the combined household needs of the state's 30 million residents.
 
Swapping Farm Hardship Tales
 In the San Joaquin farm country, at a cotton gin in Firebaugh, Rosie Burns, the manager, totes up drought-related losses, which are modest now but promise to be catastrophic in 1992. Mr. Burns has only lost one major customer so far, a farmer who will not plant 1,000 acres of cotton this year because his water supplies have been cut.
"He already had his vegetables in," when cuts were announced earlier this month, Mr. Burns said, and had no choice but to stick with the crops already planted and fallow the rest of his land. "I'd do the same thing," Mr. Burns added.
The area is a patchwork of water districts, each providing different allocations, and everybody is making adjustments and comparing hardships at lunch at the Agri-Center coffee shop.
One farmer laid off five workers, cut his planted acres to 180 from 760 and will work the farm alone, hoping meanwhile that the state will approve subsidies to help him pay his rent. A crop duster is short of business because only 400 acres of rice are to be planted in this area, as against a normal 5,000. A parts salesman at a tractor dealership has been put on three-day work weeks.
 
Watching a River Slowly Die
 In the Sacramento River Delta northeast of San Francisco, the sloughs are impassable these days. The catch of striped bass at Rio Vista is as meager as anyone can remember because the fish are not swimming that far upstream to spawn. And there are hardly any salmon, which used to pass by on their migration upstream.
The fishermen and environmentalists blame the changes in the delta and in San Francisco Bay on the drought. When there is not enough mountain runoff, the system of dams and aqueducts that provide water to the Central Valley and the Los Angeles Basin must pump extra water from the delta, reducing the fresh water in its estuaries, which are ordinarily rich with fish, birds, sea animals and plants.
The threat here will be even worse, residents say, if a proposed canal, the long-delayed peripheral canal, is built to channel more delta water south. "We need that like we need a hole in our heads," said Jim Zane, a retired roofing contractor who works part-time at a bait and tackle shop.
Mr. Zane, like others in Rio Vista, reserves most of his anger for the stereotypic Los Angeles resident with clean cars and a bubbling Jacuzzi.
"Sure there's a drought, but it's a secondary issue," Mr. Zane said. "Forty-five percent of the water from the delta goes south and they waste 35 percent of that."
 
A Reservoir Tells All
 Newspapers in recent weeks have been full of pictures of nearly empty reservoirs and articles about kindergartners who have never seen a winter rainstorm. Each day, or so it seems, another town imposes water rationing, another water district cuts its allotment to farmers or raises its rates.
Pete Wilson, the new Governor, jokes that he could guarantee himself a place in the state history books by turning wine to water. But at a briefing for reporters about the drought, Mr. Wilson is sober, clearly alarmed.
At the San Luis Reservoir, southeast of San Jose in the eastern foothills of the Diablo Range, visitors mutter and fret after looking at the 624,000 acre-feet of water where there normally is 1.6 million.
"The message is right there," said Howard Berman, on duty in the visitors center. "Sometimes the news you hear sounds worse than it really is. This time what the papers are saying is absolutely true and it's terribly scary."

"Sometimes I sneak the hose out," said Patricia Chidlaw, a landscape painter in Santa Barbara, Calif., who is growing 35 rose bushes. "Seeing things grow enhances the quality of life."; Drought-related losses are modest now but promise to be catastrophic by next year. Rosie Burns, manager of a cotton gin in Firebaugh, says his customers cannot plant cotton because of the water shortage. (Photographs by Terrence McCarthy for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: New Uncertainties Said to Invigorate NATO

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Just as the demise of the Warsaw Pact appeared ready to deal a symbolic blow to NATO's role as defender of Europe, the Persian Gulf war and the erosion of Soviet reforms have joined to pump new vigor into the aging Western military alliance, Bush Administration officials say.
The Soviet crisis, capped by an army crackdown in the Baltic republics, dashed hopes that Europe could finally safely dismiss Moscow's military threat, the officials said. Meanwhile, Iraq's seizure of Kuwait's oil industryawakened Europeans to the fact that the Soviets were not the sole danger to their collective security. 
 As a result, those and other officials say, NATO's dominant role in European military issues is unlikely to ebb soon, even though the alliance faces wrenching political strains. NATO may even grow a bit, some of the officials add, as nations of the old Communist bloc seek to tie themselves to NATO security policies as a counterweight to the Soviets' unpredictability.
"Nobody in Washington thinks you're not going to scale back the NATO command structure, given what's happened in the Soviet Unionand with the Warsaw Pact in the last year," an Administration expert on European defense policy said in an interview today. "But you don't want that structure to go away totally. You want to keep it vital, to deal with the kinds of contingencies we could confront years from now."
Those contingencies, which the United States is vigorously promoting to its overseas allies, range from a resurgent Soviet Army to a ballistic missile attack by a hostile third-world government.
NATO's 15 military participants are studying those and other scenarios at their Brussels headquarters, where officials are rewriting the organization's military strategy to take account of the reduction, if not elimination, of the Soviet military threat. The new strategy is expected to be completed by year's end.
At the same time, those allies and France, which quit NATO's military arm in 1964, are informally discussing the group's political role in a region in which systems of government and even some boundaries have been changing rapidly.
NATO has traditionally spoken for Europe on common defense matters. But as Communist governments in Eastern Europe withered last year, several regional groups rose as potential pretenders to NATO's policy role.
They included the 12-nation European Community, which is eliminating many economic and political barriersamong its members; the 9-nation Western European Union, and the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose members span all Europe, from the Urals to the Atlantic.
American officials said today that several NATO members -- France and Italy in particular -- still chafe openly at a European defense policy contrived with American advice and headed by an American general: NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. But most Europeans, they say, are now convinced that a common defense mounted without American help is a distant goal.
A prime reason is the gulf crisis, in which the Western European Union tried gamely to orchestrate the region's involvement but failed, said one Senate expert on NATO policies.The reversals in Soviet policy have also strengthened the argument, on both sides of the old Iron Curtain, for an American combat presence in Europe. Last year, NATO leaders invited the Soviet and Eastern European governments to establish closer unofficial relations with the organization; Eastern Europeans are now looking at the offer more seriously in the wake of the Soviet crackdown in Lithuania and Moscow's threats to other secession-minded republics.
Some Administration officials said today that the most pressing question about NATO's future is being posed not in Europe, but in Washington, where the Congress this summer will consider how sharply to reduce the number of American troops stationed on European soil.

Trying to Fill The Shortage Of Engineers

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
American contractors are expected to have a big role in rebuilding the hundreds of bridges, roads and buildings destroyed in the Persian Gulf war, further straining an industry suffering from a chronic shortage of engineers.
According to an estimate by the National Science Foundation, the shortage of engineers in the United States will reach 70,000 by the year 2010, even though engineers have been trying for decades to persuade more students to join their ranks. 
 One leader of the campaign is James E. Sawyer, the new president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Last week, as part of National Engineers Week, he took part in an effort by 32 large engineering societies to reach teachers at 127,000 schools nationwide with brochures, personal visits and talks to classes from kindergarten to 12th grade.
"We are trying to let young people know about the fun of solving engineering problems," he said. "We visit preschools and high schools. We have open houses for youngsters."
The aim of the campaign is to inform teachers about job opportunities in engineering so they can encourage students to take more interest in mathematics and science. These courses are basic to the engineering profession, Mr. Sawyer said, and students must make a commitment to them by age 14 to meet entrance requirements for engineering schools.
Mr. Sawyer himself became interested in engineering at an early age, when he worked at his father's building company in Albany, Ga. He later received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Mr. Sawyer said he hoped the campaign in public schools would combat "technical illiteracy" in the United States.
Prof. John L. Niklaus, head of the civil engineering department at Tulane University in New Orleans, said the shortage of civil engineers was a problem because it was taking place at a time of increasing need.
"There is a lot of civil engineering activity now in two areas," he said, "transportation, which includes roads, bridges and transit systems, and the environment, which includes waste management and hazardous-waste disposal."
He said engineering students seemed to be taking particular interest in the environmental area.
"At Tulane," he said, "we have quite a few petroleum and chemical engineers taking graduate work in environmental courses in our civil engineering department, for which they can receive master's degrees."
He said students interested in becoming chemical or petroleum engineers should be aware that extra chemistry courses were required in those specialties.
Mr. Sawyer, the president of the engineers society, is chief operating officer of Greiner Engineering Inc. in Dallas. He pointed out that many companies, including his, offer scholarships and summer jobs to prospective engineers. He also said tuition-refund plans were available to encourage young engineers to obtain master's degrees in specialty fields.
Like Professor Niklaus, Mr. Sawyer recommended that five-year college programs be established for engineers. In such programs, students concentrate on basic skills, like computer and communications courses, in the first four years. In the fifth year, they specialize, graduating with a bachelor of arts degree plus the professional degree of bachelor of engineering.
He mentioned the program at Dartmouth College as an example of a five-year plan. But few other colleges have such programs, he said, partly because young engineers want to graduate as quickly as possible, find well-paid jobs and pay back loans as fast as possible. Their companies often send them to get their master's degrees.
Typically, civil engineers receive a starting salary of $29,500, on average, he said, while chemical engineers get $38,000 to start.
"Many engineers go into civil service or government-type jobs where they trade lower salary levels for more stability," Professor Niklaus said.
Once the gulf crisis is over, he added, there might be a renewed emphasis on repairing the decaying bridges, highways and transit systems of the United States. President Bush indicated as much in his recent national transportation proposals, Professor Niklaus said. And last week, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed spending more on infrastructure repair, also noting that such projects could provide jobs for the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Rent Law Fight Pitting U.S. Against New York

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The Federal agency charged with bailing out the nation's failed savings and loan associations said yesterday that it would evict nine tenants of rent-regulated apartments from a building on East 57th Street, a move that is likely to prompt a legal fight over New York State's laws protecting renters.
The agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, said it also might move to evict tenants from some of the more than 900 rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments it has acquired in 10 other New York buildings. The apartments are among assets the agency has taken over from failed thrift institutions in the New York area.
 
A Bid to End Subsidies
 The Federal agency wants to evict tenants in buildings that have been converted to cooperatives or condominiums whose rent does not cover the cost of maintaining the apartments. The agency argues that taxpayers, who are paying for the thrift-industry bailout, should not be forced, in effect, to subsidize the rent of those tenants. 
 State officials said immediately after the Federal announcement yesterday that they would try to block the evictions in court.
"Trampling on innocent tenants' rights and on state and local housing laws is not the way to deal with the impact of the nation's banking crisis," said Attorney General Robert Abrams.
The Federal decision, described in a letter to Mr. Abrams and a policy statement from Washington, caps a simmering dispute that began in September. Resolution Trust said then that it might evict the East 57th Street tenants, but it agreed to postpone any move while studying the implications for New York State's housing laws.
 
U.S. Suing the State
 The agency also said yesterday that it had filed suit in Federal court against Mr. Abrams and Angelo J. Aponte, the New York State Commissioner of Housing, to try to nullify state rent regulations if they are used to prevent evictions or rent increases in buildings that have fallen under Federal control.
At issue are sharply conflicting state laws and Federal Government mandates. Since September, officials of Resolution Trust have contended repeatedly that their job, ordered by Congress, is to obtain the best financial return from real estate obtained from failed thrift institutions.
The building on East 57th Street, which was converted from rentals to condominiums in the mid-1980's, was taken over as part of the assets of the Nassau Savings and Loan Company of Brooklyn.
It, and the 10 other New York City buildings with apartments under the control of Resolution Trust, have a mix of occupants. They include tenants who have bought their apartments and renters who have elected not to buy, both protected by rent-stabilization and rent-control laws.
 
'Significant Loss' Cited
 In its policy statement, which it said would apply in other cities and states with tenant-protection laws, Resolution Trust said it did not intend to evict any low- or moderate-income tenants. It characterized those as tenants earning up to 115 percent of the median income for the area involved.
But it said it would nullify the leases of those with middle or high incomes who were paying less in rent than was needed to cover the costs of maintaining their apartments.
"The R.T.C., and ultimately the taxpayers, cannot be put in the position of continuing to underwrite rental of such units at significant loss to the R.T.C.," the policy statement said.
The Federal agency said it would offer tenants affected by its policy the option of buying their apartments or negotiating higher rents to cover the Government's costs.
 
'A Luxury Building'
 A spokeswoman for Resolution Trust in Washington, Felicia Neuringer, said the tenants on East 57th Street, in what the agency called "a luxury building off Sutton Place," were paying rents of $475 to $1,700 a month for large apartments, all with two bedrooms or more.
Resolution Trust said it was still studying the rent-controlled leases on apartments it controls in other New York City buildings to determine whether they would be honored.
Those buildings, according to Mr. Abram's staff, include 157 East 72d Street, 235 East 22d Street, 240 West 75th Street and 55-77 Park Terrace, all in Manhattan. In Queens, the buildings include Glen Oaks Village in Belrose, Le Havre in Whitestone and 241-20 Northern Boulevard in Douglaston.
Also included are a building on 64th Avenue in Rego Park and another in the Forest Hills section for which the Attorney General's staff said it did not have precise addresses.

HEADLINE: Holtzman Wants More Cuts to Balance Books

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said yesterday that New York City should consider a range of measures from unpaid job furloughs for most city workers to wage freezes and increased productivity to help close its multibillion-dollar budget gap over the next 16 months.
Commenting on the Dinkins administration's plan for closing a budget gap that it estimates at more than $2 billion for the fiscal year that starts July 1 -- but which she says is more than $3 billion -- Ms. Holtzman said the city needed to explore more cost-saving ideas than it has so far. 
 "The city hasn't done all that it can to find savings," she said in a statement. "Raising taxes on New Yorkers, who already pay more state and local taxes than anyone anywhere else in the country, is not the answer."
 
A Complex Mix
 Although $580 million in new taxes are highlighted in the administration's financial plan, Ms. Holtzman asserted that the city was actually seeking an overall tax increase of $1.2 billion next year. This, she said, is because of a complex mix of proposed tax increases, including a real-estate tax rise that is not directly spelled out in the city's preliminary budget.
She said her staff was examining what effects such increases might have on the local economy and was concerned that they might hurt it. But she would neither endorse the administration's tax proposals nor unequivocally dismiss them as too large.
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the city was reviewing the possibility of furloughs and other actions and was prepared to take whatever steps needed to keep the budget balanced. It has already reached an agreement with the teachers' union to defer part of its recent wage increase.
Ms. Holtzman said that if the city gave an unpaid 10-day furlough to all workers except police officers and employees under the Board of Education, it could save about $135 million and that a 5-day furlough would save about half that.
But Mr. Dinkins took pains to point out that furloughs could not be easily imposed unilaterally, an idea resisted by municipal unions.
For example, Edward Ostrowski, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, said: "I suggest that Ms. Holtzman should furlough her staff for a year. That would save the city millions of dollars, too, and nobody would even miss them."

HEADLINE: California Hispanic Population Up 70%

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
California's Hispanic population grew nearly 70 percent in the last decade, the Census Bureau said today, confirming statistically what has been apparent throughout the state's economy, social structure and politics.
The bureau said the Hispanic population in California was 7.7 million last year, up from 4.5 million in 1980. Hispanic residents now account for 25.8 percent of California's total population of 29.8 million, as against 19.2 percent a decade earlier. The bureau reported earlier that California's total population grew 25.7 percent in the 1980's. 
 The Hispanic population of California now exceeds the total population of all but eight states.
The growth rate of the Hispanic population here was exceeded only by the rate of increase among Asians. The Asian and Pacific Islander population more than doubled, to 2.8 million from 1.3 million in 1980, the bureau reported.
 
Trend in Growth Continues
 The numbers released today were in line with what demographers had expected, and suggested no deviation in a trend that is likely to leave California's non-Hispanic white population in the minority by the end of the decade.
"It represents a continuation of the trend that was very evident from 1970 to 1980, and it indicates that the proportion of non-Hispanic whites is getting smaller and smaller," said David M. Heer, the associate director of the Population Research Laboratory at the University of Southern California.
The figures released today do not show the number of non-Hispanic whites since they include people of Hispanic origin who classified themselves racially as white. The Census Bureau counts in the Hispanic category both blacks and whites who are Hispanic.
The figures also show an increase of 66.7 percent in the "other" races category, to 3.9 million. And the vast majority of that increase is believed to be accounted for by Hispanic residents, demographers said.
They said the figures suggested that California's non-Hispanic white population grew very modestly if at all during the 1980's. The total white population, which presumably includes a large number of Hispanics who identify themselves as white, grew 13.8 percent, to 20.5 million.
 
Effects of the Increase
 The growth of the Hispanic population, partly accounted for by migration from Mexico and other countries and partly by rapid growth of the population already in California, has had enormous implications for the nation's most-populous state.
It has provided a source of relatively low-wage labor for manufacturers and for farmers, helping California compete economically with other states and nations. At the same time, it has strained social services and the state's school system. And although the effects on politics have been relatively modest given the size of Hispanic population, there have been indications recently that Hispanic voters will play an increasingly powerful role.
Just last week, Los Angeles County elected its first Hispanic supervisor, Gloria Molina. Her election came after a Federal court ordered a redistricting that essentially guaranteed the election of a Hispanic candidate.
It is unclear how many Hispanic residents of California are United States citizens. Representative Esteban E. Torres, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of Pico Rivera, said the figures released today should lead to at least three new Congressional districts in the state with Hispanic majorities when voting districts are redrawn starting later this year. Mr. Torres is one of three Hispanic members of Congress from California.
"It will bring to at least six the number of California Hispanics in Congress," Mr. Torres said of the redistricting process. "I look forward to that day."
The figures released today show striking evidence of the state's population trends on a local and regional basis. The total white population in Los Angeles County, for example, declined slightly over the last decade, to 5.035 million from 5.135 million.

HEADLINE: 5% Zenith Electronics Stake Is Sold to Goldstar of Korea

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Zenith Electronics Corporation said yesterday that it had sold nearly a 5 percent stake in the company to the Goldstar Company, the giant South Korean consumer electronics concern.
A Goldstar executive and analysts said the move was one of the first big investments by a Korean company in a publicly traded United States company. 
 "It is a coming of age for Korea," said James I. Magid, an analyst with Needham & Company. "You have not seen Hyundai making an investment in General Motors or Ford."
Also yesterday, Zenith reported a $52.3 million loss for 1990, so the entry of a well-capitalized partner was welcome news. Zenith said the sale of stock to Goldstar would provide the company with additional cash.
The sale may also help Zenith fight a takeover threat from Nycor Inc., a New Jersey investment company. Goldstar's $15 million investment in 1.45 million shares of newly issued Zenith common stock dilluted Nycor's stake in Zenith to about 7.6 percent from 8.2 percent.
Nycor, which owns the Fedders Corporation, the air-conditioner maker, has said it will try to unseat three Zenith directors at the company's annual meeting on April 24.
Goldstar paid $10.34 a share for the new Zenith stock, which rose 75 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $7.75. Zenith now has 29.1 million shares outstanding. The company issued more than 960,000 new shares last month for a profit-sharing plan.
The Goldstar move caught Nycor by surprise, and it said it would have no response to Zenith's announcement until today.
Zenith and Goldstar officials said talks leading to Goldstar's investment began last year and predated Nycor's investment in Zenith, which was disclosed in October.
John I. Taylor, a Zenith spokesman, said: "The Goldstar agreements are business moves that are good for our company. They would have been put in place regardless of Nycor." Zenith and Goldstar have had a business relationship since 1976.
Still, the arrangement strikes some analysts as ironic because Zenith, the only remaining United States maker of television sets, has been highly protectionist over the years. It was instrumental in the 1980's in getting penalites placed on imported color television sets from Japan and Korea that were being sold below cost.
Zenith also announced that it had signed technology agreements with Goldstar. Under a licensing agreement, Goldstar will pay Zenith a fee to make televisions that use Zenith's flat tension mask, which enchances picture quality.
Goldstar also agreed to support Zenith's proposed system for high-definition television in Korea.
 "It is a shot in the arm for Zenith that some international conglomerate with a lot of technology has decided that Zenith's technology has some merit and shouldn't be scuttled," said David Lachenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, a newsletter.
 
Approvals Required
 The deal requires the approval of the South Korean Government, which Goldstar said was expected in the spring. Zenith must repurchase the stock if approval is not granted.
The Goldstar announcement offset Zenith's dismal 1990 financial results, which were released yesterday. The company lost $52.3 million on sales of $1.4 billion. It blamed the weak economy and falling prices for color television sets. In the fourth quarter, Zenith lost $25.5 million on sales of $377.8 million.
Goldstar is one of the largest consumer electronic companies in Korea, with 1990 sales of $5 billion. It is part of the Lucky-Goldstar Group, a $30 billion conglomerate.
Mr. Magid and other analysts said that with wages in Korea increasing considerably, the country was no longer the world's lowest-cost producer and that companies there would probably pursue new arrangements like the Zenith-Goldstar deal to be competitive.
It was not clear whether Goldstar planned to increase its stake in Zenith. Mr. Taylor, the Zenith spokesman, said that Goldstar agreed not to accumulate more than 15 percent of Zenith's stock in the next two years. Zenith has a shareholders' rights plan, or poison pill, that goes into effect when a shareholder acquires 15 percent of Zenith's stock.
When asked if Goldstar planned to eventually increase its stake in Zenith, Duke M. Koo, regional director of North American operations for Goldstar, said, "It is inappropriate to speculate on the future."

HEADLINE: Boeing Sees Rising Sales To Airlines

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Even as some carriers are parking airplanes because of weak business, the Boeing Company forecast yesterday that airlines will sharply increase their purchases in the next 15 years.
The Seattle-based company, which has orders for 1,838 planes, predicted that airlines would buy 9,000 new airplanes worth $617 billion from the world's leading airplane builders between now and 2005. 
 Boeing said this would mean that based on inflation the world's airlines would take delivery of an average of $41 billion worth of airplanes in each of the next 15 years, compared with an average of $16 billion each year during the last two decades. The company said that because of past trends, it expected traffic to double worldwide over 15 years.
 
Figures Under Scrutiny
 Some analysts questioned Boeing's optimism, noting that even short-term predictions have been difficult because of unstable fuel prices and huge drops in traffic because of fears of terrorism. They noted that strong carriers like American, United and Delta had shown unexpectedly heavy losses in the fourth quarter because of the big increase in the cost of fuel and a downturn in traffic.
"They're a little too optimistic with respect to the number of aircraft to be delivered and the financing that would be available," said Peter L. Aseritis, an aerospace analyst for the First Boston Corporation.
He said that some airlines had taken planes out of service to cope with the lower traffic and that British Airways planned to park the new planes that Boeing would deliver.
But John Hayhurst, Boeing's vice president of marketing, said traffic had dropped severely in 1973 and in the early 1980's but had come back strong, averaging growth of 7.2 percent a year since 1982.
"Whenever the market has experienced a short-term disruption, it has always bounced back," he said.
While traffic growth will be slower this year and part of next year, he predicted, it will rise to a rate of about 4 percent toward the end of 1992 and then average about 5.2 percent a year thereafter.
Boeing said 70 percent of the new aircraft to be delivered would be for expansion, while only 30 percent would go to replacing aging jets.
To dramatize the hazards of long-term forecasting, Mr. Aseritis of First Boston recalled that Boeing had predicted that about 307 airplanes would be retired in 1990 but that only about 70 were.
 
Delays Being Allowed
 Boeing has agreed to allow a few airlines to delay delivery of their new aircraft. Mr. Hayhurst said that if the Persian Gulf war continued, more airlines might ask Boeing to put off delivery.
He said congestion at airports would be solved partly by using larger airplanes. He added that the average number of seats on airplanes would go from 188 to 233 in 15 years.
Boeing has had the highest market share for commercial airplanes since World War II, capturing 56 percent of the market on average over that time, with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation accounting for 21 percent and Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European aerospace consortium, for 15 percent.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Dollar's Decline As Export Engine

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
NOT in a decade has the dollar been so weak. That means American exports should be rising, and they are. But why aren't they rising fast enough to make the nation's trade deficit disappear, as it almost did in 1980, the last time the dollar was this weak? The answer seems to be that the dollar has lost some -- maybe even a lot -- of its old magic as an engine for exports.
Some economists say, "Be patient, the old magic will return." After all, with the dollar hovering near 1.50 marks today, a safety razor made in the United States at a cost of, say, $1 can be exported to Germany and sold there, at a profit, for 1.55 marks. Last year, when the dollar was a much stronger 1.72 marks, the same razor had to sell for 1.75 marks, or 13 percent more, to make a profit. 
 Made-in-America razors, in sum, are falling in price abroad. The lure of being able to buy the same quality razor -- or computer or machine -- for less in other currencies will eventually win over European or Asian buyers, said Robert Z. Lawrence, a trade expert at the Brookings Institution. "The adjustment takes a long time," he continued. "The dollar started moving sharply lower only last June, and it takes two to three years to have the full effect on exports, and sometimes longer."
But consider these cases, in which the huge swings in the dollar in the 1980's -- from weak to very strong in 1985 to weak again today -- helped give rise to new strategies for selling abroad, strategies that have partly canceled out the dollar's once powerful role in trade:
*Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of Allentown, Pa., manufactures air-purifying equipment in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and in Acrefair, England. TheBritish factory, new in the mid-1980's, was the low-cost manufacturer then because the dollar was so strong. Now Wilkes-Barre plays this role, and slowly it is getting orders to export purifying equipment to Japan. Production in Acrefair, meanwhile, has declined, but only marginally, says Dexter F. Baker, the company's chairman. The British plant must remain to supply the soon-to-be unified European market, with its various rules favoring "local" operations, he said.
*Valmont Industries of Valley, Neb., manufacturer of irrigation systems that resemble giant lawn sprinklers, went through a similar experience. As the dollar fell, the Nebraska factory became the low-cost producer, displacing its plants in Spain and Austria. But Valmont has powerful reasons to keep the two European plants. One is a Spanish program to provide aid to Central America for agricultural projects, but only if that region uses the aid money to buy Spanish-made equipment, including Valmont's. Austria also supports Valmont's exports, with liberal financing. "We often get paid in full by the Austrian Government, and then it takes on the risk of collecting from our customers," said William F. Welsh, Valmont's chief executive. "For such reasons, we'll never retreat from having plants overseas."
*Barnes Group Inc. of Bristol, Conn., maker of precision parts for motors, aircraft and the like, is largely indifferent to the dollar's fluctuations, says Wally Barnes, the chief executive. Brazil illustrates why. Barnes makes valves there that go into motors made by Japanese companies also in Brazil. To obtain permission to sell other products in Brazil, the Japanese companies export the motors to Japan, thus bolstering Brazil's foreign trade. And the Japanese buy the Barnes Brazilian-made valves to satisfy Brazil's local-content requirements. "We are followers of our customers' strategies," Mr. Barnes said.
These cases help to explain why the overseas subsidiaries of American companies manufacture and sell abroad more than $700 billion a year in products. If one-seventh of this production were shifted home and exported from the United States, the nation's $100 billion trade deficit would disappear. Already, the falling dollar has increased the value of American exports by 10 percent in the last year, as the deficit fell from $152 billion in 1987.
Mr. Lawrence says the deficit will eventually disappear as companies like Valmont and Air Products are drawn home by the lower costs that a weak dollar helps to make possible. But manufacturers are not so sure. Their trade group, the National Association of Manufacturers, wants the Administration to play a more activist role in expanding exports, as Spain or Austria do.
Would the activism increase exports by enough to wipe out the trade deficit? Probably not, with so many companies entrenched abroad. "If we could get a complete wish list on trade policy, we might be able to reduce the deficit by $20 billion a year, which isn't insignificant," said Paul Krugman, a trade expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But we won't get all that we want."
